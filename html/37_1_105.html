	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to be joined
					 by my colleague, the member for Labrador, and to note as well the presence in
					 the gallery of the House of Commons of the minister of intergovernmental
					 affairs of Newfoundland and Labrador, the Hon. Tom Lush, for what I believe is
					 an important and historic resolution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I have the pleasure of introducing a resolution
					 to authorize a bilateral amendment to term 1 of the terms of union of
					 Newfoundland with Canada. The amendment would change the name of the province
					 to Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newfoundland became part of Canada on March 31, 1949,
					 with the Newfoundland Act which ratified the terms of union between
					 Newfoundland and Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government of Newfoundland and Labrador has taken
					 many steps over time, beginning with the passage of the Labrador Act in 1964,
					 to recognize the reality that Labrador is a vital part of the province. The
					 Labrador Act provided for the official recognition of Labrador in the
					 provincial coat of arms, on government stationery and in government
					 publications.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this was an important measure, the name of the
					 province provided for in the terms of union with Canada remains the province of
					 Newfoundland. That name does not reflect by itself the fundamental reality of
					 my home province, which includes both Newfoundland and Labrador. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, it is a unique province in the sense that so
					 much a part of the history, the reality, the culture, the songs and the
					 tradition of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador is separated by the
					 Atlantic Ocean and the Strait of Belle Isle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our citizens, small in number but so dynamic,
					 have never fully felt their contribution and their presence reflected fully in
					 the governance of my home province or in its official name.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1992 the Newfoundland house of assembly
					 unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the provincial government to take
					 the necessary steps to change the name of the province to Newfoundland and
					 Labrador. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Newfoundland and Labrador throne speech of March
					 20, 1996, called upon the provincial government to take the necessary action to
					 change the name of the province. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very honoured as the premier of Newfoundland and
					 Labrador on April 29, 1999, to rise in the Newfoundland house of assembly and
					 to seek and receive the unanimous adoption of a resolution authorizing the
					 Governor General to issue a proclamation to amend term 1 of the terms of union
					 to reflect the new name of the province to that of Newfoundland and
					 Labrador.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government then asked the Government of Canada to
					 take appropriate measures at the federal level to effect a constitutional
					 amendment. Our role and our responsibility now, as parliamentarians, is to
					 consider the proposed amendment at the national level and to decide whether to
					 approve it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the longstanding practice of the Government of
					 Canada to take positive action in response to provincial requests for bilateral
					 amendments to the constitution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once proclaimed, this will be the seventh bilateral
					 amendment to the constitution to have successfully completed the amending
					 formula. This shows that progress on modernizing and improving the Canadian
					 federation can be made, and that our constitution continues to evolve in a
					 range of areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have indicated on several occasions, the
					 Government of Canada supports the amendment which provides a tangible way for
					 us to formally recognize the contribution of Labrador and of Labradorians.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the name of the province is an importance
					 symbolic recognition of Labrador's status as a full and vital part of Canada's
					 easternmost province, with its own unique geography, history and culture. It is
					 about respect for Labrador and its inhabitants as essential contributors to my
					 home province and to its rich and diverse cultural heritage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed constitutional amendment will also reflect
					 Labradorians' understandable desire that this reality be reflected officially
					 in the province's name.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is at issue here is not a border, but a symbolic
					 gesture for Newfoundland and Labrador citizens.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982 provides for
					 an amendment to Canada's constitution in relation to any provision that applies
					 to one or more but not all provinces. Such an amendment can be made by
					 proclamation issued by the Governor General under the great seal of Canada
					 where authorized by resolutions of the Senate, the House of Commons and the
					 legislative assembly of each province to which the amendment applies.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am joined today by the member for Labrador, and I
					 believe by all members on both sides from the province of Newfoundland and
					 Labrador, in asking the House to give consideration to this request.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deferring to the member for Labrador, with whom I
					 want to split my time, I would ask the House to give the member time to finish
					 his remarks. I also want to note that we have consulted with members of the
					 opposition. I specifically want to note that we have consulted with members of
					 the Bloc Quebecois. Indeed, I have consulted with the government of Quebec on
					 behalf of the Government of Canada, as has the government of Newfoundland and
					 Labrador. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation, I would like to thank all members from
					 all parties but notably colleagues from Quebec on both sides of the House for
					 the spirit in which this resolution request is being received and I anticipate
					 and hope the manner in which it shall be voted. This is an important day for
					 all citizens of Newfoundland and Labrador but no more important for any than
					 those of Labrador. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now cede my place to the member for Labrador who
					 has worked very hard on the resolution.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my thanks go to my colleague, the Minister

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as long as I have been involved in political life,

					 an enormous role to play in this country. Labrador also has a very strong

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years ago Mrs. Elizabeth Goudie wrote in her
					 autobiography, <i>Woman of Labrador</i>, that the name Labrador went deep
					 within her being. All of us who read that phrase knew exactly what she meant.
					 We knew it when we adopted the blue, white and green Labrador flag. Even though
					 the constitution until now did not recognize our name, we knew who we were.
					 There has never been any doubt in our minds that we are Labradorians.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things that other Canadians and even
					 Newfoundlanders do not know about Labrador. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labrador is two and a half times the size of
					 Newfoundland. Labrador is larger than the other 31 ridings of Atlantic Canada
					 put together. It is one of the largest ridings in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since I was elected I have been trying hard to
					 educate my colleagues in parliament. I even have the Prime Minister saying
					 Labrador these days, which I am very proud of.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at a member here who had a great time in
					 Labrador. This past summer I had the honour of hosting my Atlantic Liberal
					 colleagues along the south coast of Labrador and a very noteworthy time was
					 had. We had a great time, absolutely phenomenal, down in Battle Harbour and
					 along the straits of Labrador. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labrador has some of the richest history in Canada: the
					 9,000 year aboriginal pre-history in evidence at Point Amour, Ramah and
					 Rattler's Bight; the remains of the Basque whaling premises at Red Bay and
					 throughout southern Labrador; the historic sites of Hopedale, Hebron and Battle
					 Harbour; the stories of the trappers of North West River, the Hudson's Bay
					 Company; and the Moravian church at Makkovik and the Grand Falls “Bottle”. We
					 are only now beginning to tell our story to the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our people came from all over: the Innu and Inuit
					 inhabitants whose ancestors were there when European cities were still swamps;
					 the settlers who came from England, Ireland, Scotland, the Channel Islands,
					 Canada and Newfoundland to build new lives in the freedom of Labrador; the
					 Metis, whose heritage goes back to the blending of these traditions centuries
					 ago; and the skilled and energetic people who helped build the modern
					 industrial Labrador in our interior resource towns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our unique settlement patterns and our distinct history
					 have given us our identity. We have maintained a deep and even spiritual
					 attachment to our land. Centuries of isolation and crossing of cultures have
					 led to a distinct Labrador spirit. We treasure that spirit, that attachment and
					 that identity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest chapter of our history is the great military
					 and industrial development in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Wabush, Labrador City and
					 Churchill Falls, which contributes greatly to the provincial and national
					 economies.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With developments such as Voisey's Bay and the
					 Trans-Labrador highway, we will continue to make our place in Canada.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately over the years these developments have
					 not always been in the best interests of Labradorians. We have been too often
					 overlooked and forgotten. Our people and our land have not been respected. Our
					 needs were often ignored. Our identity was denied.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should never again have to feel that someone else is
					 taking our mineral and energy wealth, our fisheries and forest resources and
					 even our name away from us. In its own way, this symbolic change in our
					 constitution will recognize Labrador and help ensure that we will never again
					 be forgotten.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still some who believe and will say that
					 Labrador is just a part of Newfoundland. They fail or refuse to recognize our
					 special character and our unique place. However, when we see the broad expanse
					 of Lake Melville, nearly as large as Prince Edward Island, stretching through
					 the horizon, when we stand at the bottom of the Saglek Fjord with 3,000 foot
					 cliffs towering overhead, when 25,000 caribou come streaming over a barren hill
					 in back of Double Mer, when we drive across the seemingly endless iron hills of
					 the interior, a landscape that inspired the Group of Seven, or when we find an
					 arrowhead or chip that was left by our aboriginal forefathers 5,000 years ago,
					 it is hard to accept that this is just another part of Newfoundland.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our land and our people make us unique, not better,
					 just unique. Our identity, just like that of Newfoundland, Quebec, Nunavut or
					 Alberta, is worthy of celebrating and recognizing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are recognizing that Labrador is not a mere
					 appendage of Newfoundland but that we have our own traditions and our own
					 identity. We are recognizing that the Strait of Belle Isle, where I was born in
					 a small community called L'Anse-au-Loup, sets us apart even as the
					 constitutional evolution of Canada has brought Labrador and Newfoundland
					 together.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We as a parliament recognized Quebec's distinct
					 character in 1995 through a resolution and we recognized New Brunswick's
					 bilingual character in 1993 through a constitutional amendment, and so today we
					 are recognizing the dual geography and dual nature of Canada's newest province.
					 There is nothing divisive about this. It is common practice throughout the
					 world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is divisive is to gloss over and deny the
					 differences and distinctions between us instead of celebrating and recognizing
					 them. In fact the use of the name Newfoundland and Labrador goes back many
					 centuries, to 1763 when Labrador and Newfoundland were first placed under the
					 same government. It was in official use through the 19th and 20th centuries.
					 Everyone, at least in Labrador, knew that the name Newfoundland, proud as it
					 is, applied only to the large island off our southern shore.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even during the debate that led to Confederation in
					 1949 there was some discussion of making Labrador part of the name of the new
					 province. It was not done at the time. However, over the years the words
					 Newfoundland and Labrador became more common and more widely used, if only
					 unofficially. That usage was not uniform, however. Labrador was too often
					 included where expedient and excluded the rest of the time. That will change
					 starting today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our founding document as a society and as a government
					 will no longer try to tell us that we do not exist. The oversight from 1949
					 will be corrected and the constitution will at last recognize the identity,
					 history and culture of Labrador. I would like to thank the industry minister
					 who as premier put the resolution through the House of Assembly and who as
					 minister today introduced it in the House. Hopefully we will be beyond this in
					 very short order.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty years ago an elder in Cartwright, on the
					 southeast coast of Labrador, told Lawrence and Laura Jackson “I guess you'd
					 have to live here a lifetime--always with that left-out feeling--to know what
					 it feels like to be included in something”. </p>


	<A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have known that left out feeling. I think almost
					 every true blooded son and daughter of Labrador has known that feeling. Our
					 land was too often the subject of colonial and economic power plays. Our people
					 were too often ignored. The attitudes and mindsets have prevailed too long that
					 Labrador is only recognized for what there is to be gained from megaprojects,
					 from resource extraction, from development by and for the benefit of other
					 people. In other circumstances, when it is time to put back into Labrador or to
					 realize our unique challenges and needs, it seems to be “how quickly they
					 forget”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a small thing, a simple thing, but from today on
					 there will never again be any reason for forgetting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the name Labrador into the
					 constitution is not compensation for the wrongs of the past and it is not a
					 magic pill that will prevent them in the future. It is not an end in itself.
					 What it is, though, is one step on the road that sees Labrador gaining pride of
					 place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will soon have aboriginal self-government in
					 Labrador and with it greater self-reliance. Our community and economic leaders
					 are taking a more active role in development and policy and in making sure our
					 best interests are represented.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new generation of entrepreneurs and promoters are
					 doing things in Labrador that I could never have imagined 30 years ago. People
					 are more active than they have ever been and have common visions that they are
					 working toward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing Labrador in the constitution says that our
					 time has arrived, that we are here and we exist as a community and a region and
					 that we are willing to contribute to our province and our country, just as we
					 have always done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are often quiet in Labrador. That does not mean we
					 are complacent. We have certain needs and certain demands. We want equality and
					 dignity in public life. We want fairness and justice in our economic and social
					 development. We want recognition and respect from our fellow citizens.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our own way we have achieved a milestone today.
					 There are many more to come.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that I can count on the support not only of
					 Labradorians but of Newfoundlanders and all members of parliament in making
					 sure that Labrador, even if we do have second billing in the provincial name,
					 should never have to make do with second best. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken one small step today. We have many more
					 to go. The road ahead will be difficult, it will be exciting and it will be
					 challenging. We do not always know where it may lead us. I lay down a challenge
					 to my colleagues and my friends, both in the House and beyond, a challenge to
					 support us, to work with us and to join us on that road.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank both my colleagues for their
					 eloquent speeches on the subject. I will begin my remarks by saying how
					 strongly I agree with the notion of providing for the symbolic recognition of
					 Labrador's role in Newfoundland and its place within Newfoundland.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This encapsulates a spirit that is important in the
					 country, a spirit of recognizing that just as Canada is a country of regions
					 our provinces are provinces of regions and have a great deal of diversity and
					 heterogeneity. In this respect they need to reflect the fact that they are not
					 homogeneous wholes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that in the past this country and other
					 countries have sometimes failed to achieve that recognition is demonstrated by
					 the fact that in some provinces of Canada and some subnational jurisdictions of
					 other countries we have seen the rise of separatist movements. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada northern New Brunswick at one time had a
					 separatist movement. There was a partitionist movement in Quebec at one point.
					 There was a movement for an independent northern Ontario and at one point there
					 was a movement for Labrador to become a separate province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of recognition, while only symbolic, is
					 nonetheless important. Symbols are important as are the practical policies a
					 government must undertake to promote the inclusion of parts of a province that
					 are not part of a regional metropolis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inclusion of Labrador in the name of Newfoundland
					 and Labrador strikes me as a wise move. It has already happened in many
					 respects in Newfoundland's policy on an unofficial basis. For example, licence
					 plates from Newfoundland say Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labrador is a unique part of Canada in a number of
					 important respects. It is not only an area of enormous size and extraordinary
					 beauty. In some respects it is both the oldest and the newest part of Canada.
					 According to archeological evidence it was settled by the Innu at least 7,000
					 years and possibly 9,000 years ago. In the north it was settled by the Inuit
					 about 4,000 years ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labrador is the first part of the North American
					 mainland that was visited by Europeans. I would seek the indulgence of the
					 House to read into the record the first description of Labrador ever recorded
					 in print.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is from the <i>Graenlendinga Saga</i>, the saga
					 written to record the discovery of Greenland by Erik the Red and then of
					 Labrador and Newfoundland by his son, Leif Eriksson. It describes their
					 departure from what they called Helluland, which we now believe to be Baffin
					 Island:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>They returned to their ship and put
						  to sea, and sighted a second land. Once again they sailed right up to it and
						  cast anchor, lowered a boat and went ashore. This country was flat and wooded,
						  with white sandy beaches wherever they went; and the land sloped gently down to
						  the sea.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this description and on the subsequent
					 description of Vinland, scholars believe this is a description of southern
					 Labrador. This is the area which has subsequently been settled and has become a
					 fishing area. Northern Labrador is a great deal more rugged. It is possible
					 that the description of Helluland is a description of northern Labrador.
					 Helluland means the land of large rocks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labrador is in some respects also the newest part of
					 Canada. Landsat Island in particular, an island off the coast of northern
					 Labrador, is the most recently discovered part of Canada. It was discovered in
					 1976 by Dr. Frank Hall Sr. of the hydrographic service. At that time it was
					 under the ministry of energy, mines and resources. He discovered the island
					 while surveying in a helicopter off the coast of Labrador.</p>


	<A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken to Frank Hall Sr. and he told me a
					 fascinating story about the moment of discovery. He was strapped into a harness
					 and lowered from a helicopter down to the island. This was quite a frozen
					 island and it was completely covered with ice. As he was lowered out of the
					 helicopter a polar bear took a swat at him. The bear was on the highest point
					 on the island and it was hard for him to see because it was white. Hall yanked
					 at the cable and got himself hauled up. He said he very nearly became the first
					 person to end his life on Landsat Island.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the experience he suggested the island be
					 named polar island. However the name Landsat Island was given to it because the
					 island had first been spotted by the Landsat satellite, something which was
					 regarded as quite an accomplishment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can still remember listening to the radio as a small
					 boy and hearing with some excitement, because I had dreams of being an explorer
					 when I grew up, of the discovery of the new island off Canada's east coast. It
					 was a discovery of practical importance to Canada because it allowed Canada to
					 expand its territorial waters quite substantially. It was quite a remarkable
					 accomplishment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an other connection with Frank Hall if I might
					 indulge the House in pointing it out. I am good friends with his son, and his
					 daughter-in-law works as my office manager.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will turn from this to another question the hon.
					 minister raised in his comments, a question which has been raised in recent
					 newspaper reports regarding the reaction of the Parti Quebecois and Bloc
					 Quebecois to the proposed constitutional amendment. This relates to the
					 Quebec-Newfoundland boundary dispute over the sovereignty of
					 Labrador.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote from the commentary that was given by
					 those two parties. Marie Barrette, spokesperson for Quebec intergovernmental
					 affairs minister Joseph Facal, said the amendment was purely cosmetic because
					 there would be no change to the borders. She therefore indicated the Quebec
					 government would have no opposition to it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois intergovernmental affairs critic
					 stated in an interview that since the amendment had no legal consequence it did
					 not keep them from sleeping at night.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to believe there is an underlying
					 statement being made to the effect that because the amendment does not affect
					 some sort of legitimate claim of the province of Quebec to the territory there
					 is no objection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will review the history of the boundary dispute to
					 make the point that the underlying thesis is incorrect. There is no question
					 that all the territory currently designated as Labrador is entirely and
					 unquestionably constitutionally protected as part of the province of
					 Newfoundland and Labrador and that no one else has any claim to it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the territorial dispute stems back to
					 unclear draftsmanship in the original definition of the boundaries of Labrador.
					 There was no question that the original European settlers of Labrador were to
					 be under the jurisdiction of Newfoundland. They settled along the coast. The
					 description of the area they would inhabit and which would be under the
					 jurisdiction of Newfoundland was that it was an area of coastline extending
					 from Cape Chidley in the north to Blanc-Sablon in the south. Those two points
					 were not in question. What was in question was what was meant by coast.
					 </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dispute developed between the governments of Canada
					 and Newfoundland, which at the time was not part of Canada. The Government of
					 Canada claimed that the term coast meant a one mile wide strip of land along
					 salt water. The government of Newfoundland argued it should be the entire
					 watershed draining into the Atlantic. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute was eventually sent to the privy council in
					 London. The privy council made a decision in 1927 delineating the boundary
					 substantially in Newfoundland's favour. The entire watershed flowing into the
					 Atlantic Ocean would be considered part of the territory of
					 Newfoundland.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This continued to a certain point in the south from
					 which a line was drawn due east to a point directly north of Blanc-Sablon. This
					 was then joined by a direct north-south boundary line drawn north from
					 Blanc-Sablon. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some question at the time as to why the
					 straight line was drawn. It took some of the upper watershed of several rivers
					 that flowed into the Gulf of St. Lawrence and placed it within Newfoundland
					 territory, in particular the Little Mecatina River which would not have fitted
					 with the earlier description.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could dispute whether that was a wise addition or
					 change to the original formula. Whatever the case, the boundary was agreed to
					 by both parties. It was written into the Constitution of Canada when
					 Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada and it is not subject to any form of
					 dispute. There is no legal argument that any of the territory is not clearly
					 and distinctly a constitutionally protected territory of the province of
					 Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this not merely based on my own reading of the
					 facts. I say it based on the authority of the government of Quebec which
					 produced in 1970 and 1971 a detailed study on all the boundaries of
					 Quebec.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am talking here about the commission studying the
					 territorial integrity of Quebec.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Document 3.2 of the study dealing with “La Frontière du
					 Labrador” states that while Quebec might have had a claim at some point in the
					 past the privy council decision put it absolutely and unquestionably to rest.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report acknowledges that there is no constitutional
					 way that Quebec could have any claim to any part of the territory of Labrador.
					 I think that also reflects the will of the people of Labrador.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1927 there were very few settlers in the interior.
					 That has changed. The interior is no longer an uninhabited area, uninhabited
					 from a European point of view, because it always had aboriginal elements of
					 living and hunting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who live in Labrador express no interest in
					 becoming a part of Quebec. When there is such a clear indication of popular
					 sentiment reflected so clearly by constitutionally entrenched legal rules, no
					 question can be disputed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn finally to some closing comments, with regard to
					 Labrador and the character of the place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labrador is an extraordinarily large area
					 geographically. My colleague, the hon. member for Labrador, made this point in
					 his comments. If we think of this from a European perspective, Labrador is
					 larger than any of the countries in Europe, with the exception of Ukraine and
					 Russia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is full of not only extraordinary scenic beauty, but
					 also mineral wealth and rivers, some which have been tapped for hydro and some
					 have not. They all are appreciated by the people who draw resources from them.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some respects, Labrador is to the east coast of
					 North America what Alaska is to the west coast of North America: a vast
					 northern land of almost unimaginable wealth, extraordinary beauty and an
					 extraordinary challenge for all of us. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get a sense of what would characterize Labrador the
					 best, I contacted my friend, John McGrath, who was the Reform Party candidate
					 in a byelection in Labrador in 1996. He now resides in my constituency and will
					 be well known to the current member for Labrador. I asked him what best
					 expresses, in a nutshell, the character of Labrador. He suggested to me that I
					 ought to consult the <i>Ode to Labrador</i>, by Dr. Harry Padden of Northwest
					 River.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Ode to Labrador</i> reads in part as
					 follows:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<blockquote>
		
<p>Dear land of mountains, woods and snow...<br>
		

	God's noble gift to us below...<br>
		

	Thy proud resources waiting still,<br>
		

	Their splendid task will soon fulfill,<br>
		

	Obedient to thy Maker's will...<br>
		

	<br>
		

	We love to climb thy mountains steep...<br>
		

	 And paddle on the waters deep...<br>
		

	Our snowshoes scar thy trackless plains,<br>
		

	We seek no cities streets nor lanes,<br>
		

	We are thy sons while life remains,<br>
		

	Labrador, our Labrador.<br>
		

	</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment introduced by the federal government and
					 sponsored by the Minister of Industry reflects a diluted version of the
					 previous position of the government of Newfoundland, and that is good. If it
					 had been any different, the Bloc Quebecois would not have been able to support
					 the motion, but more on that later. It should be noted that the very essence of
					 this constitutional amendment has long been a touchy issue in the relations
					 between the governments of Quebec and Newfoundland.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute that still keeps these two governments on
					 opposite sides concerning the recognition of the territory belonging to
					 Labrador did not start just the other day. In fact, Canada and Newfoundland
					 filed an appeal in 1927 with the judiciary committee of the Privy Council in
					 London for a ruling on the delineation of the border between the two on the
					 Labrador Peninsula. It should be pointed out that at the time Newfoundland was
					 only a colony of the British crown, as was Canada moreover, and the Privy
					 Council in London was the highest level of the judiciary for all
					 colonies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal was therefore asked to interpret the
					 meaning of the expression “coast of Labrador”, a territory assigned to the
					 colony of Newfoundland by certain of the colonial laws. The Government of
					 Canada of the day, defending the territorial interests of Quebec, claimed that
					 this meant only a narrow strip of land along the water's edge. Newfoundland, on
					 the other hand, argued that the Newfoundland portion of Labrador extended to
					 the entire watershed draining into the Atlantic, an area very likely far larger
					 than any agreement could have been reached on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judges found in favour of Newfoundland. In addition
					 to the entire watershed draining into the Atlantic Ocean, Newfoundland was
					 awarded a portion of the territory to the north of the 52nd parallel, including
					 the watershed area of the rivers draining into the St. Lawrence, thus going
					 beyond the watershed line. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of commentators contested the reasons for the
					 decision. First, it seemed that the broad definition given the expression
					 “coast of Labrador” gave Newfoundland too much of territory Quebec considered
					 its own. It was later alleged that the delineation of the southern border along
					 the 52nd parallel gave Newfoundland more than it had asked for. It was noted
					 too that the government of Quebec was not present at the hearings of the
					 tribunal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is again important to point out that serious doubts
					 were expressed about the federal government's real interest in defending the
					 integrity of Quebec territory, since Newfoundland was already considered to be
					 a future province in the Canadian federation. Finally, doubt was often cast on
					 the impartiality of the judges on the judiciary committee, because the judges
					 belonged to a government whose members had economic interests in
					 Labrador.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand better today, with this historical
					 background, the scope of the sometimes troubled relationship between Quebec and
					 Newfoundland. However, the problem remains undiminished, and, had it not been
					 for some softening in the traditional stand taken by Newfoundland, it would be
					 a good bet that even the federal government would not have wanted to get
					 involved in any debate on the matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, the governments of Newfoundland and Canada
					 accepted the 1927 opinion of the judicial committee of the Privy Council
					 setting the border between these two states, or at least between these two
					 territorial entities of the empire. In 1949, when Newfoundland joined the
					 Canadian federation, the border defined by the 1927 decision was confirmed
					 under the heading “Terms of Union”, enacted under the Newfoundland Act. In the
					 schedule, the second term reads as follows: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

						  Privy Council on the first day of March, 1927...and the islands adjacent to the
						  said Coast of Labrador. </small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never, and I insist on that word, did a Quebec
					 government officially recognize the jurisdiction of the Newfoundland government
					 over Labrador, as delineated by the 1927 decision. For over 70 years now,
					 Liberal, PQ and Union nationale MNAs have always shared the same view on this
					 issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of this imbroglio, over the years there have
					 been many bilateral development and co-operation agreements between Quebec and
					 Newfoundland. Moreover, relations between the two governments greatly improved
					 under the leadership of Premier Bouchard and of the current Minister of
					 Industry when he was premier of Newfoundland. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, given the relative fragility of these
					 relations and the scope of future projects to be negotiated, Premier Bouchard
					 warned his Newfoundland counterpart against the negative interpretation that
					 could have been generated in Quebec by presenting a motion to officialize the
					 name of Newfoundland and Labrador, thus legalizing and officializing the 1927
					 judicial decision. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Montreal's <i>Gazette</i> reported in
					 February 1997 Premier Bouchard's comments that presenting a resolution as
					 proposed by the Newfoundland government would revive a deep emotional debate in
					 Quebec and could be perceived as a form of provocation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, intense negotiations were taking place to
					 conclude an agreement of $10 billion or so to jointly develop Churchill Falls'
					 hydro electric potential.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, some semantic changes occurred in
					 Newfoundland's position, reaching a peak on December 6, 1999, when the premier
					 of that province, now the Minister of Industry said, and I quote:</p>

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went on to say that the region of the province
					 should be acknowledged in the official name.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I insist on the word legalize, used by the then premier
					 of Newfoundland. This gives us a better understanding of the reaction of
					 Premier Bouchard, who considered this as an insult to the constant position of
					 Quebec on the border issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I remind the House that no government in Quebec,
					 whatever its political stripe, has ever recognized the legal status of the
					 border drawn pursuant under the judiciary decision of 1927. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, Newfoundland's position as presented and
					 defended by the Minister of Industry, is not the same today, if we compare it
					 to the position he had when he was a member of parliament in St.
					 John's.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have evolved considerably, since the Minister of
					 Industry has softened his position by making clear in a letter to Premier
					 Bernard Landry, and I quote: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Industry reaffirmed this commitment
					 today when he brought forward his motion, just half an hour ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a letter to Premier Landry dated October 23rd, Mr.
					 Grimes, the successor of the Minister of Industry and current premier of
					 Newfoundland, took a similar position. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I wish to reiterate that this is only
						  a change of name, which in no way changes our position regarding our common
						  border or our position on the issue.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, it is to be understood from those words
					 that the government of Newfoundland explicitly acknowledges that nothing in the
					 terms of the motion of the government will have any impact on the delimitation
					 of the border between Quebec and Newfoundland.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, this guarantee was required as a sine qua
					 non condition for the approval by Quebec of the constitutional initiative of
					 Newfoundland, as stated in the letter of October 18 signed by Mr. Facal and Mr.
					 Brassard, both ministers in the government of Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that some wish to amend the constitution to
					 facilitate the recognition of Quebec as a nation appears to me to be correct,
					 desirable, but also very unlikely, if not impossible. Unfortunately Quebecers
					 have too often been disappointed by the endless constitutional rounds to
					 rejoice about it, as the populations of Newfoundland and Labrador can today.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is particularly true, given the disconcerting ease
					 with which this historic amendment to the constitution that we are debating
					 today will be enacted. It would appear, once again, as though the federal
					 government is biased toward Newfoundland and the other provinces of Canada, to
					 the exclusion, of course, of Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days before the 1998 Quebec elections, the Prime
					 Minister of Canada stated, in response to comments made by Jean Charest, that
					 the Canadian constitution was not a general store, and the Government of Canada
					 had no intention of reopening the issue; that there should be no expectations
					 of the federal government changing the constitution; and that everything was
					 coming up roses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last spring, the Canadian Minister of Intergovernmental
					 Affairs even took pains to explain why Quebec's nationhood would not be
					 recognized in the constitution, ridiculing Quebecers' constitutional demands by
					 stating in an open letter to <i>La Presse</i>, on May 1, and I
					 quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We simply refuse to make the mistake
						  of believing that we have to put everything that is important in the
						  constitution.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister continued with a highly questionable
					 example, which now contradicts the government, by writing, and I quote
					 again:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> A great many things that are
						  important are not found in the constitution. The most important of values,
						  love, is not recognized...The fact that our constitution makes no mention of it
						  does not mean that love does not exist...but I believe this to be fundamental:
						  a constitution is not meant to contain everything that is important, but rather
						  everything for which there are legal consequences.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, according to the federal government and the
					 government of Newfoundland, the constitutional amendment designating the
					 “Province of Newfoundland” as the “Province of Newfoundland and Labrador” will
					 have no impact on the borders of Labrador. Why, then, should such a request
					 even be considered? The question remains to be answered, but the debate is
					 pointless, according to the federal government's interpretation.</p>


	<A NAME="T1100"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1100)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I already anticipate the triumphalist and trite remarks
					 of the Prime Minister and his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who will
					 brag, even before the ink from the Governor General's pen has dried, that the
					 Canadian federation is flexible and that everyone stands to gain. At the point
					 where we are now, I hope at least that the Labrador people will be able to find
					 love for their province. In any case, this is practically the only thing that
					 they will be able to hope to get from the Minister of Industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Quebec government has noted the change in direction
					 or goal of the Newfoundland government on this sensitive issue and agrees with
					 it, in light of the details of the text of the motion. However, it is important
					 to specify that Quebec's current position remains unchanged: it does not
					 recognize the definitive nature of the 1927 border between Quebec and
					 Newfoundland in the Labrador peninsula. Indeed, Quebec's official maps reflect
					 this position very accurately, while indicating the watershed divide north of
					 the 52th parallel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois will not oppose the motion and
					 wishes that the openness of the federal government may be able to affect the
					 whole of its rather deficient interpretation, must we remind the House, of its
					 own constitution. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember, of course, that this is a minor change
					 to the constitution. In fact, it is a cosmetic change to Canada's primary
					 statute, which would have no impact, except perhaps for a stronger feeling of
					 belonging for the 30,000 inhabitants of Labrador in the province of
					 Newfoundland. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, before concluding my remarks, I would like to
					 draw the House's attention to something which was pointed out to me and which
					 is of paramount importance. According to the <i>Dictionnaire illustré des noms
					 et lieux du Québec</i> of the Commission de toponymie du Québec, the geographic
					 name “Labrador” can designate the “entire peninsula between Hudson Bay and the
					 axis of the St. Lawrence River”. In other words, regardless of where the
					 interprovincial boundary lies, there is a Quebec Labrador bounded on the west
					 by Hudson Bay and on the east by the Quebec-Newfoundland border, wherever that
					 border lies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1927 arbitration seems to reflect this geographic
					 reality, because its purpose was to decide on the border separating the
					 province of Quebec and the colony of Newfoundland “in the Labrador peninsula”,
					 according to the wording of the compromise submitted to the judges. In
					 addition, the Privy Council was asked to rule on the legal and geographic
					 meaning of “coast of Labrador” in certain crown documents giving the government
					 of Newfoundland rights over this “coast”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newfoundland's use of the geographic name “Labrador”
					 could be viewed as incorrect from a constitutional point of view. In fact,
					 article 2 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada uses the expression
					 <i>coast of Labrador</i> to designate the continental portion of the territory
					 of the new province. Newfoundland therefore cannot claim to take in all of
					 Labrador in the geographic sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, and very briefly, for all the reasons given
					 earlier by the Bloc Quebecois, we will not be opposing this motion.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure to participate in
					 this historic exchange of views and to debate a motion that will realize a
					 longstanding aspiration of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For over 30 years the government of Newfoundland and
					 Labrador referred to itself by that very name: Newfoundland and Labrador. Today
					 we are amending the Constitution of Canada so that the name change would be
					 enshrined in all legislation enacted by the Government of Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government of Newfoundland and Labrador only passed
					 the motion requesting the Government of Canada to amend the constitution on
					 April 29, 1999. I understand that it has been a recurring topic of discussion
					 in that province for over 30 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1960s the then government of Newfoundland
					 decided to officially include Labrador in its name to reflect the wishes and
					 concerns of the citizens of Labrador who joined Confederation at the same time
					 as their offshore brethren. In fact they had been part of the same dominion
					 territory since the beginning of the 19th century. It was also done to assure
					 them of their status within the province. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then all official government documentation,
					 legislation and essentially anything put out by the provincial government has
					 been published, released and referred to under the name of the government of
					 Newfoundland and Labrador. The dual name has been widely accepted in
					 Newfoundland and Labrador and is considered to be the official name by which
					 the province is known though often in conversation the province is simply
					 spoken of as Newfoundland.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In supporting the motion we are simply giving effect to
					 the longstanding wishes of the citizens of the province of Newfoundland and
					 Labrador. It may take time to get used to saying Newfoundland and Labrador,
					 although some of us are in the habit of it already. The member for Labrador
					 said that he managed to teach the Prime Minister to do this, and we are glad to
					 hear the Prime Minister is teachable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the citizens of Newfoundland and
					 Labrador favour this change. The motion passed the legislative assembly
					 unanimously in 1999, the year before the federal government commissioned a
					 parliamentary committee to travel around the province finding out what
					 Newfoundlanders wanted. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, who is
					 in the House today, may recall that the provincial NDP opposed the travelling
					 committee at that time. In its view the change had been so commonly accepted
					 that there was no need to spend money on a government junket asking people a
					 question that it already knew the answer to. Newfoundlanders responded with
					 rousing support for the changes without the need for an official government
					 commission.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are asked to approve an amendment to the
					 constitution. This will be a bilateral amendment requiring only the consent of
					 the Government of Canada at the request of the province of Newfoundland and
					 Labrador. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labrador is rightly seen as an integral part of the
					 province even though it only has 30,000 inhabitants compared to approximately
					 570,000 for the province. This amendment would recognize that Labrador is an
					 unquestionably important component rather than an adjunct to the province. The
					 member for Labrador made that argument quite eloquently.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dynamics of Canadian federalism would not be
					 affected by this motion. I would like to say, in passing, that the government
					 of Quebec did accept that the name of the province be changed to Newfoundland
					 and Labrador. The Minister of Industry said that the resolution would have no
					 impact on the boundary line between Newfoundland and Quebec. I think that he is
					 right in this regard, and I support that position. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister is not always right. We have to take these
					 opportunities when we can get them.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time the federal government presented that
					 motion, the Quebec government expressed its opposition to the change. I am
					 pleased to see that Minister Facal and the member for
					 Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier have finally recognized how important it is to
					 respect the will of Newfoundland citizens who want the name of their province
					 changed. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I would like to reaffirm that this change to
					 the Canadian constitution, though minor but obviously significant to the people
					 of Newfoundland and Labrador, is an example of how easy it can be to amend the
					 Canadian constitution to reflect the wishes of its citizens. I wish that in the
					 past when we had sought constitutional amendments that went further than
					 bilateral constitutional amendments that we had had as much success as we have
					 had in the House recently with bilateral constitutional amendments. This is the
					 second one having to do with Newfoundland and Labrador. There was one earlier
					 with respect to Quebec having to do with school boards in that
					 province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the sentiments expressed by the member for
					 Charlesbourg--Jacques-Cartier regarding the number of attempts to amend the
					 Canadian constitution to reflect the special place of Quebec within the
					 Canadian confederation that have not succeeded. I was here through those days
					 and supported those amendments, both Meech and Charlottetown, as was the
					 Minister of Industry. I hope that someday we might be standing here debating or
					 reflecting unanimously upon a change to the Canadian constitution that would
					 accomplish that, but that day has not yet arrived.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason for us not to do what is possible.
					 What is before us here today is possible and has the support of the
					 NDP.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to say a few words on the
					 constitutional amendment which officially changes the name of the province of
					 Newfoundland to the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. This might be a
					 symbolic change but it is a very important and substantive one in my view.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the Minister of Industry, Newfoundland's
					 regional minister, for having taken the initiative to implement the change. He
					 started the process back when he was premier of Newfoundland and today we see
					 the culmination of that initiative. I support him and congratulate him on
					 having taken that initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me congratulate also my colleague the member for
					 Labrador. He spoke very eloquently today about Labrador and its beauty, culture
					 and people, and well he should speak well of the people of Labrador. He is the
					 first native born member from Newfoundland to come to the House of Commons. I
					 congratulate him on that. He is a good member for Labrador and one whom I am
					 very pleased to work with on this matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who has lived in Labrador knows its beauty and
					 culture. And the people of Labrador, what fine people they are. The regional
					 minister from Newfoundland lived in Labrador for a number of years as did I.
					 The member for Labrador belongs to one of the most beautiful parts of our
					 province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The territory we know as Labrador was awarded to
					 Newfoundland in 1927 by the British privy council. Both the island of
					 Newfoundland and Labrador changed hands between the British and the French on
					 many different occasions during the history of the European settlement in North
					 America. Labrador eventually ended up as part of Newfoundland.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early part of the 20th century it was generally
					 understood that Newfoundland owned the coast of Labrador. However the
					 governments of Newfoundland and Canada, which at that time represented the
					 province of Quebec, could not agree on just how far inland the coast extended.
					 At the time both Canada and Newfoundland were dominions within the British
					 empire. That meant they both ran their own domestic affairs but the British
					 privy council in London had the final say over foreign affairs and disputes
					 between the two dominions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newfoundland had previous experience going up against
					 Canada in London at the beginning of the 1890s. It was not a positive
					 experience. The Newfoundland colonial secretary Sir Robert Bond negotiated a
					 free trade fisheries deal with the American secretary of state Mr. Blaine. The
					 Bond-Blaine treaty as it came to be known raised the ire of Canada's maritime
					 provinces. The maritime provinces were upset that Newfoundland had done an end
					 run around them and had gained duty free access to American markets for its
					 fish products. Ottawa took the matter up with the British privy council in
					 London and in 1891 London quashed the treaty. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada even at that time was not familiar with free
					 trade but Newfoundland back in the 1890s had negotiated a free trade agreement
					 with the Americans called the Bond-Blaine treaty. It was in that context that
					 Canada and Newfoundland, unable to settle on the Canada-Newfoundland boundary
					 in Labrador, put that dispute to the judicial committee of the British privy
					 council. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the privy council came down in Newfoundland's
					 favour. It ruled that the word “coast” meant territory from the beach to the
					 height of the land in the interior. That accounts for the highly erratic nature
					 of the Quebec-Labrador boundary. It skips across the tops of the hills and the
					 mountains in the interior of Labrador. That is how Labrador became a part of
					 the Dominion of Newfoundland back in 1927. Labrador was part of Newfoundland
					 when it became Canada's 10th province in 1949. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no hesitation in supporting an official name
					 change that reflects a reality that has existed since 1927. When this
					 resolution passes, and I believe it will probably get the unanimous support of
					 the House, the province of Newfoundland becomes the province of Newfoundland
					 and Labrador. This will officially recognize Labrador's status in the province
					 with its own unique geography, culture and history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that our federal minister has made that change and
					 its name is secure, I sincerely hope he will make a few more changes for the
					 province of Newfoundland and Labrador. I have spoken to him on a number of
					 occasions here in the House on the equalization and health care issues for
					 Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the St. John's harbour cleanup which is
					 very important to the people of St. John's. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has been able to make a change to the
					 Constitution of Canada to reflect the name of the province of Newfoundland and
					 Labrador. Hopefully he will be able to make a few more changes which will be
					 just as substantive as this one today. We support including Labrador in the
					 official name of the province. We remind the minister that there are many
					 pressing problems facing Newfoundland and Labrador which he has to deal with as
					 well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three cheers for the minister for having made this
					 change, but let us not confuse anyone who may not be aware of our history. We
					 have owned Labrador since 1927; there is no question about that. In 1927 the
					 privy council awarded Labrador to Newfoundland. The Government of Canada
					 confirmed it and supported it as well. The resolution simply and officially
					 makes the long overdue name change to reflect what happened back in 1927. Any
					 individual or province who was not aware of that before is certainly aware of
					 it now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the minister for his initiative.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can look at hydro power in Labrador. The mighty

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I wish to do something that I do not do
					 very often. I should like to pay tribute to the Minister of Industry for his
					 initiatives not only in relation to bringing forth the government motion but
					 also the name change that took place unanimously in the house of assembly in
					 Newfoundland while the hon. gentleman was the premier of the
					 province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has certainly been the leader in bringing these two
					 great names together, recognizing that there is one province and that Labrador
					 is an equal part of that province. This is perhaps a fact that has been
					 overlooked by a lot of people for many years. I thank the hon. minister for
					 this initiative. This has to be a proud day for the people of the Labrador
					 section of the great province of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was this not done long ago? In the historic days of
					 colonization Canada was just a dominion and Newfoundland a little colony under
					 the direct rule of Britain for many years. Newfoundland eventually joined this
					 great Dominion of Canada and became part of this great country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labrador always seemed to be looked upon as an entity
					 unto itself and not part of the great province of Newfoundland and now
					 Newfoundland and Labrador. There seemed to be a geographic separation over the
					 years as well as a psychological separation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Newfoundland looked upon Labrador as a
					 place to go to rape the resources and take advantage of it. The area would then
					 be left for the people of Labrador to try to survive and eke out a living from
					 the resources without any assistance from either the province of Newfoundland
					 or from Canada. However these hardy people survived. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years the recognition began to hit home. The
					 resources that were geographically in Labrador were not for the sake of
					 Newfoundland or for outsiders but primarily for the benefit of the people of
					 Labrador. The sharing concept between both parts, the island and the mainland,
					 has grown to the point whereby officially recognizing that we are one province,
					 Newfoundland and Labrador, we will not hear any more about the issue of divide
					 and conquer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labrador has brought so much into Confederation. We
					 hear what the province of Newfoundland brought in. However much of that is
					 actually part of the Labrador section. Now we can truthfully say the great
					 province of Newfoundland and Labrador brought so much into
					 Confederation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite different from the way we are viewed by
					 many people who do not know the great strengths and resources of our province.
					 At the most northerly tip of Labrador the scenery and fishing resources are
					 incredible. I am sure that anyone who has flown, I will not say walked, over
					 Torngat Mountains has had the pleasure of seeing how immense and beautiful they
					 are. The wilderness in Labrador is the last great wilderness in Canada where
					 hunting, fishing and hiking are indescribable. One has to be there to be able
					 to appreciate it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been great mineral wealth discovered at
					 Labrador west in the mines that have kept the towns of Labrador City and Wabush
					 going for many years. The ore from that area has benefited Quebec and Ontario
					 perhaps to a much larger extent than we would like to see, with all due respect
					 to our friends in those provinces.</p>


	<A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1125)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are the great discoveries in Voisey's Bay which
					 one of these days will be primarily developed for the benefit of the people of
					 Newfoundland and Labrador. Undoubtedly there will be benefits for our sister
					 provinces as there should be. Newfoundland has never said no to that. It has
					 never said it would not share its great resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are the northern cod stocks based off the coast
					 of Labrador which swim down the northeast coast to Cape St. Mary during the
					 summer. Over the years they provided a livelihood for the people in
					 Newfoundland and Labrador. They also provided a livelihood for many other
					 Canadian provinces and foreign nations that came in, raped our stocks, took
					 quotas given to them to sell other products, and we were left the losers. It is
					 to the point where the stocks have been practically wiped out. The people of
					 Newfoundland and Labrador are the losers. They received absolutely nothing in
					 return.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best example of how we are treated is before us
					 right now. There is a 20% tariff placed on the great northern shrimp stocks
					 that we catch off the coast of Labrador and send to the European market. Our
					 fishermen face a 20% tariff on our peeled and cooked shrimp going to the
					 European market because one company in one country in the EU is trying to make
					 sure the tariff is imposed to protect its own market opportunities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not make any sense whatsoever. It is not an
					 issue between Canada and the European Union at all. It is an issue between a
					 company in Denmark and Canada. It is something that should be resolved
					 overnight, instead of having to wait for the next round of World Trade
					 Organization discussions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often said it is only Newfoundland and Labrador
					 and it is only fish. However the great fishing stocks off Newfoundland and
					 Labrador have kept many a country afloat since the discovery of Newfoundland in
					 1497. The economies of Britain, Spain and Portugal were all boosted
					 tremendously by the economic benefits from the processing of the fish stocks
					 off Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have oil and forest resources. We are an island and
					 a mainland section with a population of a little over half a million people. We
					 have more resources per capita than any province in Canada and any country in
					 the world. Yet we have the highest unemployment in Canada. We have sat back
					 over the years and watched others benefit from our resources and we have not
					 benefited at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Taiwan earlier this summer. It is a country
					 that is smaller than Newfoundland with the population of Canada. It has less
					 than 4% unemployment and practically no resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is wrong? It is the leadership in our province. It
					 must recognize the strengths we have and be willing to work with us. I am
					 delighted to support this initiative to make sure that Newfoundland and
					 Labrador are recognized equally as one province, not only in our own eyes but
					 in the eyes of this great country and the world.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for the question and I
					 am proud that he is part Newfoundlander. If we did a research study throughout
					 the House we might find that many more people are the descendants of people who
					 came from Newfoundland or at least through Newfoundland.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two things we can do. First, we have not done
					 a good job over the years of publicizing our positives. When we hear about
					 Newfoundland it is often looked upon as the poor cousin. That is changing. Our
					 job, the job of my colleagues across the House and my colleague from St. John's
					 East and others, should be to talk about what we have, the positives of
					 Newfoundland and Labrador. By doing so we would encourage more people to look
					 upon it as a place to visit rather than wondering who would want to be stuck
					 there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who were in Gander during the September 11
					 events will tell us that they have never been treated so well in their lives.
					 Somebody from St. John's referred to a person from New York who was walking up
					 the waterfront as being stuck there all week. The person from New York said he
					 was not stuck and that he had never seen such beauty and freedom in all his
					 life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to put more money into our infrastructure. One
					 of our problems is that we are an island and getting there by air is expensive.
					 We are held hostage by an Air Canada monopoly or by the ferry which should be
					 looked upon as a permanent link. It should be an essential service. It should
					 be an extension of the Trans-Canada Highway. We have to pay more to get to
					 Newfoundland than any other province in the country. If we can solve some of
					 those problems and put more money into our general infrastructure, we can be
					 and eventually will be the Mecca of Canada.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things we have tried to do with a lot of

					 to the Minister for International Trade, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity
					 to speak on third reading of this very important and timely bill, an act to
					 amend the Export Development Act. Bill C-31 is the outcome of a legislative
					 review process that was mandated in 1993. In that year a number of amendments
					 were made to the Export Development Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the amendments was to improve the EDC's
					 ability to serve Canadian exporters. Canada's trade was expanding rapidly and
					 certain aspects of EDC's operations needed streamlining. If the debates that
					 surrounded the 1993 amendments were reviewed, we would find a strong consensus
					 that EDC is a key player in Canada's international trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of the corporation's powers was supported
					 by all parties. I do not have to tell the House how important Canada's exports
					 are to our national prosperity. Forty-three per cent of our GDP and one out of
					 four Canadian jobs are directly tied to exports. At the present time, EDC
					 supports nearly 10% of this trade. This is a remarkable role for a single firm
					 and underlines the corporation's importance to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1993 amendments took effect, EDC's business
					 has grown almost fourfold, reaching $45 billion last year. It is clear that the
					 1993 changes have borne fruit, but at that time they were seen as a bold step.
					 As a result parliament also decided to monitor the corporation's future
					 performance. It imposed a requirement for a thorough review of EDC's mandate in
					 five years' time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That review began in 1998 with a report by the law firm
					 Gowling, Strathy &amp; Henderson. This was the so-called Gowlings report which
					 was the starting point for studies by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs
					 and International Trade in the fall of 1999. That committee's report was
					 presented to the House in December 1999 and was the subject of a government
					 response tabled in parliament by the Minister for International Trade in May
					 2000. On the whole, the government endorsed the findings of the standing
					 committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before moving to the substance of this bill and how it
					 responds to the many issues that were raised during the legislative review, I
					 will note a few things about the conduct of the review itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the terms of reference were extremely broad,
					 touching all aspects of EDC's operations and mandate: how were its current
					 programs operating; what were its customers views; EDC served a large number of
					 Canadian exporters, but what about those who did not use its services; and what
					 did its competitors think of it? All of these viewpoints were
					 sought.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the review surveyed the dynamics of
					 international trade itself and the challenges facing Canadian exporters. Could
					 EDC's current services to them be improved? Was there untapped capacity in the
					 Canadian financial system that EDC might help deliver to exporters?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, a lot of stress was placed on non-commercial
					 issues like the environment and human rights. Was the corporation upholding
					 Canadian values in its activities? What effect did Canadian trade have on
					 economic and social development in other countries?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the review included very extensive public
					 consultations. If we look at the list of witnesses and written submissions that
					 were received during the review, we will see that scores of individuals,
					 companies and organizations were heard. There were additional consultations on
					 individuals' issues as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review was conducted with great publicity. However,
					 this did not always make for easy decisions. There was a wide range of opinion
					 on the issues. Much of it was valid on its own terms but difficult to
					 reconcile. We did ensure that all voices were heard and that we were well
					 informed concerning where Canadians stood. There was strong consensus on some
					 points. I have already noted how Canada's economic well-being depends on
					 international trade.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review demonstrated EDC's significant contribution
					 to this trade. It is a well managed organization, highly valued by its clients
					 and respected by its competitors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would digress from my text to note that a major
					 exporting firm in my riding of London--Fanshawe, namely General Motors, diesel
					 and defense, has told me repeatedly how valuable the assistance of EDC has been
					 in helping it win very important export contracts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC is innovative in its development of programs and an
					 important contributor to multilateral dialogue on trade issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever changes we propose, we should preserve EDC's
					 flexibility to deliver its services and protect those programs that are
					 operating well. At the same time, there is also consensus that EDC could do
					 more to ensure adherence to those values that Canadians expect of an agency of
					 government. This is particularly true with regard to environmental and human
					 rights issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC is Canada's emissary in many important respects. In
					 some measure, it is Canada's reputation as well. All Canadians have a stake in
					 this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standing committee, in its report to the House,
					 summarized these views. EDC should meet reasonable environmental and social
					 standards in conducting its business. Its environmental review framework should
					 be given a firm basis in law. To promote greater transparency and rigour in the
					 framework, the auditor general should oversee its operation on a regular and
					 public basis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC's development of a disclosure policy is welcomed,
					 but it should be subject to public consultations, independent review and the
					 corporation should consider using an ombudsman to help administer the
					 policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, EDC should be required, by law, to pay due
					 regard to benefits to Canada and Canada's international commitments,
					 particularly those bearing on human rights and labour standards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge to do these things is not just for EDC or
					 other trade finance institutions. It is a challenge that confronts any firm
					 doing business on a certain scale. We are seeing very focused responses to it,
					 on the part of both individual firms and multilateral bodies, like the
					 organization for economic co-operation and development, where relevant codes of
					 business conduct are being developed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises are a
					 leading example of this. They outline principles and standards in areas as
					 diverse as employment and industrial relations, human rights and the
					 environment, disclosure and transparency and competition and tax. They are
					 voluntary but carry great political and moral weight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a signatory to the guidelines and we have
					 agreed to encourage multinational enterprises to implement them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are no easy precedents to follow in
					 taking initiatives like these. At the most practical level, we are talking
					 about revising the due diligence that is practised by corporations on a
					 regular, daily basis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New systems always have an impact on costs, on client
					 expectations and on accepted ways of doing business. Naturally, there is some
					 resistance. The work requires time, resources and real commitment. The
					 Government of Canada believes that our crown corporations have both the means
					 and the duty to take a leadership role in this work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to turn now to Bill C-31 and describe how
					 it responds to the concerns raised during the legislative review.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC served nearly 6,000 Canadian exporters last year.
					 The corporation is always working to expand this customer base. To do this,
					 Canada's small and medium-sized enterprises need easy access to EDC's services.
					 Part of this work involves service innovations like online credit insurance,
					 and EDC is taking steps to implement such systems. Part of it involves simple
					 publicity, and some members will have seen EDC's recent television
					 advertisements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both here and abroad, the corporation is known by the
					 popular acronym EDC. Bill C-31 would amend the corporation's name to Export
					 Development Canada in English and Exportation et développement Canada en
					 français.</p>


	<A NAME="T1150"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1150"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1150)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would allow use of the well known brand name EDC
					 in both of Canada's official languages. It would strengthen the corporation's
					 identity as a Canadian institution and it would facilitate EDC's outreach
					 marketing, especially to small exporters throughout Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a subtle way then, the amendment serves an important
					 objective which I am sure we can all support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-31 also contains two amendments to the powers of
					 its board of directors. The first would permit delegation of board powers to
					 subcommittees composed of directors with special abilities in some area of
					 corporate concern. This is a standard modern business practice. It permits a
					 corporate board to refer issues to those who are best qualified to deal with
					 them. It does not absolve the board of ultimate responsibility for the final
					 decisions taken in respect of such questions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A related amendment would enable EDC's board to make
					 bylaws for the administration of a recently established pension plan. The new
					 plan took effect in April 2000. It was established with appropriate
					 authorizations and is consistent with treasury board policy that crown
					 corporations should establish pension plans independent of the
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to turn now to the amendments that are
					 probably of most interest to the House. Bill C-31 would establish a legal
					 requirement for EDC to conduct environmental reviews of the projects it is
					 asked to support. EDC already does this but the amendment would make it a
					 binding legal obligation. A related amendment would require the auditor general
					 to conduct regular examinations of EDC's environmental review framework. These
					 examinations would cover both the design of the framework and EDC's performance
					 in applying it. The examinations would occur at least once every five years and
					 would be reported to parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A related amendment would prevent duplicate
					 requirements arising under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. Certain
					 ministerial or cabinet actions can trigger that act, for example when
					 ministerial authorizations are required for a transaction. Bill C-31 would
					 require environmental reviews under the Export Development Act but there would
					 still be a risk of a duplicate obligation arising under the Canadian
					 Environmental Assessment Act. The amendment simply would prevent such
					 duplication from occurring.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics of Bill C-31 have suggested that EDC should be
					 regulated under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. This view was
					 expressed repeatedly throughout the legislative review but neither Gowlings nor
					 the standing committee took up the suggestion. In fact Gowlings stated that
					 legislating specific environmental requirements for EDC might not be practical.
					 Instead they recommended an approach similar to that of the United States
					 export credit agency Eximbank.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eximbank has had an environmental requirement in its
					 governing legislation for almost 10 years. Eximbank's practices are often held
					 up as a model for other agencies. In this approach, a general mandate to
					 conduct environmental reviews is set by law but Eximbank's board of directors
					 is responsible for developing specific guidelines and procedures in
					 consultation with stakeholders. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is precisely what Bill C-31 would do, establish a
					 general environmental mandate while leaving its implementation to EDC's board
					 of directors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC recently completed public consultations on revising
					 its environmental review framework. It employed both the auditor general's
					 recommendations and specific government guidance in undertaking these
					 consultations. It has sought out and taken account of the views of industry and
					 NGOs. It has also engaged a leading environmental consultant to assist with the
					 consultations and prepare detailed recommendations for the framework's
					 revision. No other export credit agency in the world has had its environmental
					 procedures subjected to such meticulous and exhaustive review. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possibility of regulating EDC under the Canadian
					 Environmental Assessment Act was given careful consideration before the present
					 course was chosen. In taking its decision, the government applied such criteria
					 as ensuring environmentally sound projects, protecting competitiveness,
					 respecting foreign sovereignty and preserving flexibility to operate in the
					 fast paced international environment.</p>


	<A NAME="T1155"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1155)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach we have chosen is consistent with the
					 emerging practice in the international community and with our work on this
					 issue in the OECD. It would provide a uniform process for EDC's projects and
					 permit rapid adaptation to changing competitive and technical circumstances. To
					 ensure that its procedures and standards are sound, the auditor general will
					 continue to oversee both its design and operation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and
					 International Trade has also recommended that EDC's mandate should include a
					 legal requirement to pay due regard to benefits to Canada and Canada's
					 international commitments, particularly those that concern human rights and
					 core labour standards. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC's mandate is trade promotion, to the benefit of
					 Canadian exporters and our common prosperity. Furthermore, as an agent of the
					 crown, EDC is already bound to adhere to Canada's international commitments.
					 However it was recognized that a general statutory mandate of this kind could
					 raise legal risks for the corporation without clarifying the specific
					 requirements that must be met in a given case. Unlike the environmental
					 mandate, there is no pre-existing framework to help ground such an obligation
					 in concrete operational measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the government acknowledges the serious
					 concern that underlines the recommendation and is committed to ensuring that
					 economic benefits in international obligations are taken account of in EDC's
					 decision making. The government has decided to address this issue through two
					 interconnected mechanisms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, EDC will be required by its
					 corporate plan to consider economic benefits to Canada and Canada's
					 international commitments in the areas of human rights and core labour
					 standards. Preparation of a corporate plan for crown corporations is required
					 by the Financial Administrative Act. A corporate plan sets out and limits the
					 range of a crown corporation's activities. It must be approved by ministers and
					 tabled in summary form in parliament. A crown corporation cannot act outside
					 the parameters set down in its corporate plan and must undertake to fulfill its
					 requirements. EDC's corporate plan will now include these requirements and the
					 House will have the ability to review its performance and assess whether the
					 requirements have indeed been met.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However general commitments to human rights mean little
					 unless we take concrete steps to ensure their respect in specific cases. At a
					 practical level, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is
					 working with EDC to refine our information sharing on human rights concerns in
					 specific countries. This will operate at the level of general or sectoral
					 conditions as well as individual projects. The objective is to ensure that
					 EDC's decisions take full account of both the facts of the situation and how
					 that may impact on Canada's international commitments. Once again, we recognize
					 this is an issue that is important to all Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bringing Bill C-31 to parliament, my colleague, the
					 Minister for International Trade, took a very balanced approach to policy
					 reform at EDC. On the one hand, the bill would leave significant responsibility
					 in EDC's hands for the development of environmental and social policies. On the
					 other hand, both government oversight and public accountability would be
					 brought to these policies through regular consultations and the Office of the
					 Auditor General.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we last amended the Export Development Act in
					 1993, we hoped the changes would benefit Canada's trade and promote our common
					 prosperity, and the intervening years have borne this out. Today we are again
					 taking bold steps to keep the Export Development Corporation at the forefront
					 of international trade practice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to note that the legislation is very important
					 and would make EDC more transparent and accountable, but what is most important
					 is to have a proactive minister who will take it upon himself or herself,
					 whoever has the position at any given time, to ensure that the full weight of
					 the act is carried through.</p>


	<A NAME="T1200"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1200"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1200)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to acknowledge the proactive efforts of the
					 Minister for International Trade who said that he wants to see a report on the
					 activities of EDC within two years, not the five years for which the
					 legislation calls or even the three years which I believe the auditor general
					 proposed. The minister took the initiative in wanting a full audit in two years
					 time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the kind of commitment the Minister for
					 International Trade and the government has to making sure EDC performs
					 effectively but in the most transparent way that is consistent with Canadian
					 values.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask all members of the House to endorse the
					 objectives of the bill and I look forward to their support for it.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-61557"></A><a HREF="#Int-61560"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-61554"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North,
					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to Bill C-31,
					 the amendments to the Export Development Act. As the parliamentary secretary
					 laid out, I do recognize that this has been a lengthy process. The process of
					 review, consultation, surveys and other research that has gone into the
					 background leading up to these amendments has certainly been a longer process
					 than many of us have been involved in before. I have only been involved in this
					 portfolio since June of this year so there is a lot to catch up to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I can say is that very clearly a consensus was
					 developed on some of the needs that required addressing and they deal primarily
					 with the issue of transparency and environmental and social standards. It is
					 important to recognize what is the mandate of the Export Development
					 Corporation. It is a commercial financial institution, the mandate of which is
					 to support and develop directly or indirectly Canada's export trade and
					 Canadian capacity to engage in that trade and to respond to international
					 business opportunities. That public policy mandate is what makes EDC different
					 from our commercial financial institutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of all the consultations and input from
					 various parties, we now have what is called an environmental review framework,
					 which is built in as part of the mandate of the Export Development Corporation.
					 It is to review on a timely basis the best available environmental information
					 on projects for which EDC support is sought.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that is clear is that EDC borrowed
					 significantly from the World Bank group in regard to this. There is some
					 background on this from the standpoint that very clearly the World Bank screens
					 projects for their risk and impact and then categorizes them for their level of
					 potential impact. It then provides reasonable public transparency for those
					 projects that pose the greatest potential for environmental impact. The
					 environmental review framework for EDC resembles that kind of background.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of looking at it historically over a 12
					 year period, I found it very interesting that something in the order of 13% of
					 World Bank projects fall into category A, which requires a full environmental
					 assessment. Thirty-five per cent fit into category B. The bulk of the World
					 Bank's portfolio, just over 50%, was deemed to have no environmental impact and
					 therefore required no environmental analysis. This is the proper way to direct
					 ourselves because obviously every project or every finance opportunity does not
					 lead to the same degree of environmental concern. It will be interesting to
					 track the EDC experience over time and see how close it comes to reflecting
					 what has happened over the last 12 years with the World Bank group.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ongoing discussions at the Organisation for
					 Economic Co-operation and Development. It is likely to strengthen environmental
					 considerations in its risk assessment practices for export development and
					 export credit agencies and would like to pursue a multilateral approach. This
					 is all very beneficial.</p>


	<A NAME="T1205"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1205"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1205)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very high degree of desire from the people
					 who have appeared for consultations that the Export Development Corporation
					 demonstrate responsible behaviour. In a sense it is a representative of the
					 Canadian government and Canadian social and environmental practices, policies
					 and values. One of the things that became very clear is that we have had no
					 environmental mandate for EDC up to now. Although there has been some
					 recognition within EDC and it has changed its behaviour, there really were some
					 quite inappropriate measures or financing packages. Interestingly a lot of them
					 seem to revolve around our financing of dams around the world. They involve not
					 just environmental impacts but huge social impacts, having to do with
					 indigenous people or long term communities sometimes being uprooted, and a lot
					 of other untoward circumstances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has argued at times that EDC was only a
					 minor player and therefore whether it entered into those packages or not was
					 not all that significant, but it was significant. I think it is important to
					 recognize that in the same way Canada has some moral high ground in terms of
					 its participation in the United Nations peacekeeping operations, often being
					 the first to be asked because once it commits that is the catalyst for others
					 to commit, the same argument could be used for EDC on some of these
					 environmental issues. It is important that we have an environmental conscience,
					 an environmental strategy, and that it is part of the decision making
					 process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that became very clear in the
					 consultations and the responses to the proposed legislation is that people
					 retain a residual concern, which is that there is nothing to prevent the Export
					 Development Corporation under this legislation from revising its environmental
					 review framework if it deems circumstances to be such that this is the
					 appropriate thing to do. Many people wanted it to be more binding than that.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Export Development Corporation's argument is, of
					 course, that it needs flexibility and there are industry participants and
					 stakeholders as well who are obviously concerned about any insecurity of
					 arrangements that might result if something could be an impediment to making a
					 binding arrangement.</p>


	<A NAME="T1210"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1210)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of those things require a degree of balance that
					 leads me to think that although we have an environmental review framework right
					 now that is considered to be progressive, we will see further changes. There
					 will be pressure for further changes and it remains to be seen whether this
					 will be workable without having it more binding in terms of the statutory
					 requirement to have environmental assessments where appropriate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it highly ironic that these amendments were
					 tabled on September 20, during our first week back in this fall session, when
					 just three weeks earlier on August 30, just before the long weekend, a very
					 good time to announce something if we do not really want people paying
					 attention to it, the minister appointed professional Liberal Bernard Boudreau
					 to the Export Development Corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said at the time that we have a crown corporation
					 attempting to operate at arm's length from government, and that is the stated
					 objective of its mandate and the stated objective of government, yet appointed
					 to head it is a long favoured friend of the government, appointed previously by
					 the Minister of Finance to the Bank of Canada in 1998, appointed by the Prime
					 Minister to the Senate in 1999 and appointed by the Prime Minister as the
					 Minister of State for ACOA in 1999. This individual then resigned from the
					 Senate in 2000 to run for the House of Commons and was defeated in November
					 2000. My point is that the independence of our crown corporations is made a
					 mockery of by the moves of their political masters on the Liberal
					 side.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussions with officials from EDC, I know how to
					 read between the lines. This is not good for morale. It is embarrassing for
					 professional employees of our crown corporations when these things happen. The
					 only justification that has ever been offered is that because they are at arm's
					 length and the government wants to retain some influence, the only way it can
					 see to do so is through appointments of its people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find this completely unacceptable. I think the
					 professionals who operate within this environment find it unacceptable but are
					 compromised in their ability to say so. It is time for this type of behaviour
					 to stop.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a living example with Canada Post. It is
					 portrayed by the government as an independent crown corporation. It has the
					 most blatant political patronage when it comes to filling the post of head of
					 Canada Post, a very lucrative position and one which would be well sought after
					 by very qualified people from the private sector. Yet we get political
					 appointments in that very visible, high profile position as well.</p>


	<A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to change that. It does not make Canada look
					 good in the international community. Basically it is saying that the government
					 wants it both ways. It lessens our stature domestically and
					 internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect to the Export Development Corporation
					 which I would like to refer to is that there are two accounts within the Export
					 Development Corporation. There is the EDC corporate account where admittedly
					 the vast majority of EDC's business is conducted and there is this thing called
					 the Canada account. Reading EDC's own information from its corporate
					 communications department, it states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Canada account is used to support
						  export transactions that are determined to be in the national interest. They
						  are negotiated, executed and administered by EDC but the risks are assumed by
						  the federal government. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiated, executed and administered by EDC is the
					 operative statement. I wish I could witness that this were true but we have all
					 seen very clearly that the Canada account has become a slush fund for Liberal
					 ministers. It gets disbursed under the cloak of being arm's length business of
					 the EDC and it simply is not in many instances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year for example EDC provided $3.7 billion in
					 loans to two U.S. airlines to buy Bombardier jets. In the first instance the
					 Minister of Industry made the announcement, basically barging in on the
					 Minister for International Trade's territory. At the time he said it was a one
					 time deal. Then just months later the Minister for International Trade followed
					 up with a second announcement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one I believe was Northwest Air and the
					 second was Air Wisconsin. The first deal was $2.6 billion and the second was
					 $1.7 billion. These loan guarantees were to offset competition from Embraer
					 from Brazil.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We said at the time that this was inappropriate, that
					 there were other mechanisms, other avenues open to us. We had a four year fight
					 at WTO. We won the subsidy argument and we had $344 million worth of tariffs
					 that we could apply as a penalty against Brazilian imports on this corporate
					 jet subsidy argument. Rather than strengthening WTO and following its
					 judgments, we basically taunted WTO by going in direct competition with further
					 subsidies. This puts our taxpayers at risk, both on the loan and because we are
					 running the risk that WTO will find that to be unacceptable
					 behaviour.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all at a time when Canada has a strong vested

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, we are a small country population-wise
					 and a large country geographically, obviously. We are very dependent on our
					 exports. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a major dispute on lumber. We have steel
					 disputes. We have some agricultural disputes going on. We are reliant on WTO in
					 the long run supporting the fact that we are fair traders and free traders. All
					 of this, under the guise of some financing from the Export Development
					 Corporation under the Canada account which I am calling a Liberal minister
					 slush fund, is actually hurting us. It goes to the very core of what is
					 important for us as a national strategy. We simply cannot play both ends on
					 this kind of arrangement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very critical of the Canada account. We do not
					 need it. It is undermining WTO. It is also undermining EDC. EDC needs to focus
					 on depoliticized finance arrangements, not on something like this. This has
					 been foisted on it and it does not have the ability to fend it off
					 unfortunately. It is a very unfortunate trend. I hope we can sort that out
					 internally without waiting for WTO or someone else to embarrass us to the point
					 where we have no choice but to remove it. We should be much more proactive than
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two further statements from the EDC website
					 which I will make reference to. The first one states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>As a crown corporation, we operate at
						  arm's length from government and according to commercial
						  principles.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would put that in the category of a wish list. That
					 is not actually what happens, as I have just described. The second statement
					 is:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Governance policies and practices are
						  determined by our board of directors. The board has 15 directors, drawn mainly
						  from the private sector.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that is a wish list too, from the standpoint
					 that the board of directors does not entirely make all the decisions on
					 practices. Increasingly we are finding that the directors may be drawn from
					 political appointments as opposed to from the private sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the EDC needs to be independent of
					 government and it is not. I have given some rationale as to why, for example,
					 political appointments and the Canada account. The Canada account is a Liberal
					 minister slush fund. Mixed messages from the Minister of Industry and the
					 Minister for International Trade are hurting us at the WTO and in the
					 international community. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are major beneficiaries of rules based trade and we
					 cannot have it both ways. In other words, we cannot be free traders when it is
					 convenient and protectionists when it is convenient. We have to have a level of
					 consistency on the free trade ledger.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to keep this clean. It is too important for
					 Canada to do it any other way. Today for example we are expecting the
					 anti-dumping ruling from the protectionist side and instincts of the U.S.
					 lumber lobby as exhibited by the U.S. department of commerce on Canadian
					 imports of lumber. In order to keep the lumber file clean, we have to keep our
					 other files clean. Softwood lumber is a huge issue for us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of the EDC mandate is politicized. These
					 amendments do not clean that up. As a consequence, Canadian interests are not
					 fully served, nor are the interests of the Export Development Corporation fully
					 served.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Madam Speaker, we are now studying Bill C-31, an act to
					 amend the Export Development Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before anything else, I would remind the House what the
					 key elements of this legislation are. The bill would enshrines in law the fact
					 that before entering into a financing transaction the Export Development
					 Corporation, whose name it changes incidentally, must take environmental
					 considerations into consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill leaves it up to the Export Development
					 Corporation to establish its own environmental criteria and to determine the
					 exceptions to the rules. It is rare to see a corporation be made both judge and
					 defendant, when that corporation already does not comply with its own
					 directives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will see that in detail later on. In her May 2001
					 report, the auditor general stated that, out of the 25 projects audited under
					 the terms of reference determined by the corporation itself, she found 23 to be
					 in violation of those terms of reference. I am referring to the Export
					 Development Corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present bill adds nothing to the requirement for
					 accountability on the part of that corporation. There is nothing in the bill
					 about the disclosure of information or about public consultation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, the frame of reference is what the
					 corporation assigns to itself, and there is really nothing in the bill to
					 ensure that this framework is adequate to properly assess the environmental
					 effects of projects submitted to it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the bill gives the rather strange
					 discretionary power to the Minister of Finance and the Minister for
					 International Trade to exempt a project from environmental assessment. The
					 bill, in principle, gives exclusion from any of the requirements of the
					 Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit that we are totally mystified by this
					 choice. We pass environmental assessment legislation and then exempt the
					 corporation from it, at the very time that it is being asked to put more effort
					 into its environmental assessments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this bill makes absolutely no mention of human
					 rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. members can see, this bill might appear
					 ambitious, in light of the criticism there has been of the EDC in recent years.
					 Once read, however, it can be seen to be a pretty lightweight piece of
					 legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would take this opportunity to remind the House that
					 the EDC was established in 1944, as the Export Credits Insurance Corporation,
					 with a mandate to support and develop Canada's export trade. It was given the
					 responsibility of providing credit insurance and guarantees to Canadian
					 exporters. In 1969 it became a crown corporation and acquired the additional
					 powers of being able to make direct loans to foreign borrowers, and to borrow
					 against the government's credit to finance its activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last change, made in 1993, now enables it to invest
					 in capital stock, to lease assets to users outside Canada, to constitute
					 subsidiaries, and to take part in joint ventures. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy that the EDC is self-funding, in that
					 it receives no parliamentary votes for its activities. It derives its operating
					 revenue from fees, premiums and loan interest. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2000, for instance, it reported net profits
					 of $194 million, a 9.7% return on shareholder assets. Its assets would
					 therefore be some $2.8 billion. That same year, hon. members will recall, the
					 corporation estimated that it had supported exports and foreign investments to
					 the tune of some $45 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let us not forget that this crown corporation
					 enjoys special status. It is not subject to the Access to Information Act. It
					 is not subject to the Environmental Assessment Act. It is not regulated by the
					 Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, as is the case for all
					 private enterprises. It does not pay income tax. It does not have to pay
					 dividends. It can borrow money at favourable rates, thanks to the credit
					 extended to the Government of Canada.</p>

	<A NAME="Int-61566"></A><a HREF="#Int-61568"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-61565"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b>

	I think it must also be said that the Export
					 Development Corporation has a highly developed secrecy policy: it hardly gives
					 out any information about its activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evidence we heard at the Standing Committee on
					 External Affairs and International Trade, most of the groups that appeared
					 before the committee, particularly the international co-operation groups,
					 reminded us of the difficulty they had in getting information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Warren Allmand, a former Liberal member
					 and minister, who is now president of Rights and Democracy, presented a
					 document that was obtained by his organization through the Access to
					 Information Act. The document was completely blank. This shows that a secrecy
					 policy, a lack of transparency, seems to be a feature of this
					 corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back specifically to the environmental issue,
					 since it is the only new element in this bill, we see that the corporation will
					 set up an environmental framework to apply environmental criteria to its
					 financing decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I already mentioned, in response to many criticisms,
					 the auditor general was asked to assess the appropriateness of the Export
					 Development Corporation's environmental review framework. She concluded that
					 the framework contains, and I quote “most elements of a suitably designed
					 environmental review process”. However, it would appear that the framework has
					 never been properly applied. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned at the outset, and I think the Canadian
					 and Quebec public have to know it, out of the 25 projects she studied, 23 had
					 not been properly reviewed for environmental risks, or not reviewed at all, in
					 accordance with the framework the corporation had defined. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this was not the only thing she criticized.
					 I will repeat some of her criticisms, as set out in her May 2001
					 report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general pointed out that there are major
					 shortcomings in terms of public consultation and disclosure at the Export
					 Development Corporation, there are significant differences between the
					 environmental review framework's design and its operation, the framework's
					 statement of objectives is not clear, the framework's environmental standards
					 are not specified, there are flaws at each stage of the environmental review
					 process, screening tools are not applied adequately to identify potential
					 environmental risk, and there is no methodology to determine if adverse
					 environmental risks can justify a decision or not. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the only report we can refer to in order to
					 have an idea of the major shortcomings in the current management approach taken
					 by the Export Development Corporation. Members will recall that in 1999, the
					 Gowlings report pointed out much the same shortcomings with regard to
					 transparency, environmental review and human rights. In December 1999, the
					 Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade tabled its
					 report, in which we find basically the same criticisms. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are dealing with a corporation that has gotten
					 some pretty bad press from most groups, including parliamentarians. In my
					 opinion, this should have elicited a much stronger response from the federal
					 government than that which was given with Bill C-31.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1999, the Bloc Quebecois published a
					 dissenting opinion to the report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs
					 and International Trade; it was already clear to us then that there was
					 disagreement that could be boiled down to three elements: transparency, human
					 rights and the environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will recap the main elements that we highlighted in
					 December 1999. Regarding transparency, we noted that there was an obvious and
					 marked lack of transparency in the Export Development Corporation's operations;
					 that access to information was sorely lacking; and that given the context of a
					 lack of transparency, it was highly likely that the Export Development
					 Corporation's activities could be used for inappropriate purposes, which might
					 even conflict with the purposes outlined in the statute.</p>


	<A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it seemed essential to us at that time that
					 the Export Development Corporation be subject to the Access to Information
					 Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for human rights, the Bloc Quebecois expressed
					 serious concern regarding the Export Development Corporation when it comes to
					 respecting human rights. Among the risks that the corporation assumes, there
					 are political factors. It provides political risk insurance. However, the
					 Export Development Corporation does not take into consideration the human
					 rights situation when it assesses political risks. When it comes to political
					 risks, obviously there is a serious risk of political upheaval in the case of
					 regimes that abuse human rights and do not respect fundamental labour
					 law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before providing support for a business, the
					 corporation should at the very least—this is what we thought then, and still
					 think now—ensure that the company in question subscribes to the code of conduct
					 established by the OECD, when it comes to human rights. Bill C-31 makes no
					 mention of this fact, as I stated earlier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for environmental standards, they are briefly
					 mentioned in Bill C-31. The Bloc Quebecois was and is still of the opinion that
					 the committee's recommendations concerning the environmental responsibility of
					 the Export Development Corporation—we refer here to the report of the Standing
					 Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade—were nothing but a wish
					 list. It was not enough to ensure that, in fact, the environment will now be
					 included in the corporation's studies prior to any decision making
					 process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Export Development Corporation's environmental
					 responsibility must be more firmly anchored in order to better reflect the
					 corporation's duty as regards environment, respect for the environment, and
					 sustainable development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the Bloc Quebecois would have expected
					 the Export Development Corporation to draw more from the operating framework of
					 the World Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, where
					 for each reasonable project there is an environmental impact assessment, public
					 hearings, and above all full transparency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot accept that the Export Development
					 Corporation, even under its new name, should use public moneys to fund projects
					 that could end up destroying the environment or violating human rights, and do
					 so with impunity, as secrecy is one of the corporation's
					 characteristics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I indicated, there were three very harsh reports.
					 The May 2001 report of the auditor general, the report of the Standing
					 Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, complete with the Bloc
					 Quebecois dissenting report, and the Gowlings report were all extremely
					 critical. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, Bill C-31 was presented as a response to this
					 criticism, since that the Export Development Corporation had obviously not
					 succeeded in regulating itself. One would have expected Bill C-31 to address
					 this weakness, but there is nothing in this bill to do so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is too weak from an environmental point of
					 view. It provides no guarantee for an effective environmental assessment and
					 gives the EDC too much leeway in establishing the criteria. It is silent on
					 disclosure. The bill does not include any punitive provisions should the EDC
					 not respect its own environmental framework. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen in the auditor general report that in 23
					 of the 25 projects examined, the framework had not been respected. In this
					 regard, I shall point out that Quebec imposes fines and even jail terms on
					 officials who are found guilty of negligence in environmental
					 matters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the bill is watering down
					 environmental standards by not assuring Canadians that projects comply with
					 more than just the standards of host countries, and that they respect the
					 environmental review framework. This bill also excludes any possibility of
					 making the EDC subject to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. Since the
					 corporation has no credibility whatsoever, this bill does not represent a
					 response to the criticisms made repeatedly over the last three years.
					 </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Bill C-31 completely sidesteps the issue of
					 fundamental rights, human rights, labour rights, and this is totally
					 unacceptable. For example, we know of this gold mine in Tanzania that belongs
					 to a Canadian company which was granted a political risk insurance by the
					 Export Development Corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine was apparently put at the disposal of the
					 Canadian company following a massive eviction of artisanal miners. There are
					 even allegations by Tanzanian lawyers which were made public here in Canada to
					 the effect that, as part of this massive eviction operation--and we are talking
					 about hundreds of thousands of people--there were artisanal miners who were
					 buried alive in their mine. These are allegations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take this opportunity to mention that the NDP leader
					 asked a question in this House concerning this extremely disturbing case. In
					 his reply, the Minister for International Trade referred to the fact that
					 Amnesty International had investigated the matter, but had not found evidence
					 supporting the allegations made by human rights lawyers, particularly Tanzanian
					 lawyers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in its annual report for the year 2000,
					 Amnesty International says that, based on the documents provided to it by the
					 Tanzanian police, it was not able to come to a conclusion regarding this issue,
					 and it is asking for an independent, international investigation to shed light
					 on these events. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what the minister told us, probably in good
					 faith, not only did Amnesty International not come to a conclusion regarding
					 these extremely disturbing and dramatic facts, but it is also asking--as we
					 are--for an independent, international investigation to shed light on all these
					 events. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, the Export Development Corporation
					 continues to proceed as if it were business as usual.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to correct this situation, I proposed a number
					 of amendments in committee, which I will mention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments basically deal with clause 10.(1) and
					 seek to correct a number of flaws relating to this clause and to make
					 appropriate related changes. I will discuss clause 10.1</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, absolutely no reference is made to the
					 EDC's responsibility to take into account not only environmental effects, but
					 also social effects and, more globally, human and other rights provided for in
					 international agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore proposed that, to this clause, be added a
					 point that would clarify the mandate of Export Development Corporation. The
					 amendment read as follows:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Corporation is established for
						  the purposes of supporting and developing, directly or indirectly, Canada's
						  export trade and Canadian capacity to engage in that trade and to respond to
						  international business opportunities in keeping with Canada's international
						  commitments.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It strikes me as perfectly normal that a crown
					 corporation would honour commitments made by the government internationally,
					 especially in the area of human rights and basic labour rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe it or not, the Liberal members of the committee
					 rejected this amendment. It is difficult to understand how the federal
					 government makes commitments on Canada's and Canadians' behalf, and indirectly
					 still on behalf of Quebecers, and then does not want to require its own
					 corporations to honour these commitments. We are indeed talking about
					 international commitments, that is conventions, treaties and charters ratified
					 by the Canadian government. </p>


	<A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say I was quite disillusioned about the scope
					 of the work Canada can do internationally, if it is not prepared to have its
					 crown corporations honour the commitments it itself makes. How is it going to
					 get private firms and multinationals based in Canada to honour these
					 commitments?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my first disappointment was at the rejection of such
					 an obvious amendment, which was later reformulated by the member for
					 Burnaby--Douglas, in fact. Twice, we have tried to get this element, a simple
					 matter of common sense, passed, and twice the Liberal members have rejected it.
					 That was the first great disappointment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in my presentation, the environmental frame
					 of reference that the Export Development Corporation has set for itself is
					 inadequate. It fails to honour this environmental framework it set for itself.
					 It is therefore incapable of self-regulation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (2) of the famous clause 10 reads as
					 follows:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Board shall issue a directive
						  respecting the determination referred to in subsection (1)--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the assessment of environmental
					 effects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">

<td><small>--,

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(a) define the words and expressions that the Board
						  considers necessary for the application of that subsection, including the words
						  and expressions “transaction”, “project”, “adverse environmental effects” and
						  “mitigation measures”;</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(b) establish the criteria that the Corporation must
						  apply in making the determination:</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(c) establish exceptions specifically or by any class, as
						  defined by the Board, to the Corporation's obligation to make the
						  determination.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not an obligation. The Export
					 Development Corporation can define its own terms of reference. It beats me how
					 there can be environmental terms of reference without some sort of minimal
					 definition of words such as transaction, project, adverse environmental effects
					 and mitigation measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore proposed an amendment to Bill C-31 to
					 define these various terms. People must know what they are talking about when
					 they refer to impact on the environment. Without reading the amendment in its
					 entirety, I will convey the gist of it by reading what strikes me as the most
					 important term, environmental effects, because this has to do with a framework
					 for assessing environmental effects. I suggested this definition to the
					 committee:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>environmental effects means any change that the project may
						  cause in the environment, including any effect of any such change on health and
						  socio-economic conditions--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very clear to me that when one refers to
					 environmental effects, one is also referring to socio-economic
					 effects:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>on the
						  current use of lands and resources by local communities, on any structure, site
						  or thing that is of historical, archaeological...importance--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House can see, it is a very straightforward
					 definition. The definitions are borrowed from the Canadian Environmental
					 Assessment Act. We therefore did not rebuild the wheel; we used what was
					 already available. I also borrowed the definition of environment, environmental
					 assessment, mitigation and project.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, I was astonished, because it is only common
					 sense that if a crown corporation adopts environmental terms of reference,
					 there should at least be agreement on the terminology used to make an
					 assessment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, the Liberal members of the Standing
					 Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade rejected this amendment. I
					 am still wondering what logic they could have used, unless it was a form of
					 anti-opposition sectarianism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second amendment was therefore rejected. Its purpose
					 was merely to define the terms on which we must work and agree on so that when
					 the auditor general and parliamentarians are called upon to assess the work of
					 this crown corporation, they will know where we are coming from.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, I believe definitions are necessary, but we
					 ought to have at least been able to expect to find the bill stating that the
					 corporation “must” define a certain number of criteria, and make these
					 definitions public in order to open them up to public debate. It seems,
					 however, that the government side of this House prefers to lend to this bill
					 the same secrecy as reigns within this crown corporation, the EDC, at the
					 present time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, not only are definitions lacking,
					 but the frame of reference for assessments is flawed as well. </p>

.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members can see that this is far too weak a
					 directive from the legislator. I therefore took the liberty of submitting to
					 the committee a far clearer, and far more complete, environmental assessment
					 procedure. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the first element of this procedure,
					 what I proposed--not just what is stated here about looking to see whether
					 there are likely to be adverse environmental effects--what I proposed was for
					 the corporation to be required to carry out an environmental assessment before
					 exercising its power to assess a project against a series of criteria, such as
					 environmental assessment, or the development and implementation of a program
					 for follow up. Then the environmental effects must be determined, along with
					 the extent of these effects. Comments from the local population must be
					 obtained. And are the mitigation measures technically and economically
					 feasible?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the rationale behind the bill is
					 important. There are the alternative solutions and the requirement for a follow
					 up program. Those are all self-evident criteria for the evaluation of any
					 project.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corporation carries out the environmental
					 assessment, prepares a report and sends it to the Minister for International
					 Trade. On the basis of that report, the corporation takes one of the following
					 measures, depending on the environmental assessment: it decides either to go
					 ahead with the project or not to support the project because its environmental
					 impact would be negative. In that case,however, what is EDC to do? It is not
					 really clear; there is a grey area? Can the corporation be judge and defendant?
					 I do not think so. It seems to me that in such a case the Minister for
					 International Trade has a responsibility and a role to play.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was suggesting that, whenever it is unclear whether
					 the adverse environmental effects outweigh the value of a project, the
					 corporation should ask the Minister for International Trade to decide. If the
					 corporation considers that even after the implementation of appropriate
					 mitigation measures, the project might have serious adverse environmental
					 effects, it should refer the matter to the minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a project is likely to have major adverse
					 environmental effects despite the implementation of mitigation measures and if
					 the previous clause does not apply, the EDC refers to the minister, provided
					 the concerns of local populations justify such a measure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an environmental frame of reference that leaves
					 a lot of leeway to the Export Development Corporation, while defining rules
					 that everyone would know and understand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Bill C-31, the corporation will set for itself
					 the rules that it wants. It will decide whether or not it will comply with
					 these rules.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in the same amendment, I proposed including
					 two small provisions whereby the corporation would have to disclose, in the 45
					 days prior to the conclusion of an agreement, information on the projects in
					 which it is involved. This information was to include the name of the borrower,
					 the host country of the project, the environmental and social concerns of local
					 populations, the value of the project and the conditions relating to financial
					 support. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want Canadians and Quebecers, international
					 solidarity organizations and any interested party to be able to express their
					 own views on the evaluations to be made before supporting a project, the public
					 must be informed of the existence of the project. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we proposed that no provision in the Privacy
					 Act or the Access to Information Act should have the effect of preventing or
					 restricting the disclosure of the information mentioned in the previous
					 paragraphs, to which I just referred. This is a fundamental flaw in Bill C-31.
					 Nothing is done to give Canadians and Quebecers access to information on the
					 management of the Export Development Corporation.</p>


	<A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will obviously be no surprise to anyone if I say
					 that the Liberal members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and
					 International Trade voted against this amendment, which, as I mentioned, was
					 drawn from internationally known rules. More specifically, I drew on the rules
					 of the World Bank. We were not starting a revolution in committee by proposing
					 such amendments, but it was rejected. Once again, I have a hard time
					 understanding the reasons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in light of the criticism raised about the
					 governance of the Export Development Corporation, I cited three or four damning
					 reports, but the evidence of representatives of NGOs, groups and individuals
					 before the standing committee should have been heard. They raised questions of
					 considerable concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that, to wait until the auditor general looks
					 into the EDC's operations every five years, is to give the corporation far too
					 much latitude, especially with what is contained in the rest of Bill C-31.
					 There is practically nothing there to really structure the work of this crown
					 corporation. If an audit is done only every five years, the Export Development
					 Corporation will have time to do a lot of damage. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some guideline must be set in terms of time so that in
					 the next two years, the auditor general will be able to report on management
					 methods subsequent to the passage of this bill on the Export Development
					 Corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did it make the changes the Canadian and Quebec public
					 were expecting? Did it support projects consistent with our laws and concepts
					 of sustainable development in environmental terms? Did it support projects that
					 promoted fundamental rights or, conversely, did it help to further destroy our
					 planet and further erode the rights of workers and people in countries in the
					 southern hemisphere?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, five years is too long a time. I
					 therefore proposed an amendment to enable the auditor general to examine the
					 governance of the Export Development Corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, no one will be surprised to hear me say
					 that the Liberal members voted against this amendment, which makes good
					 sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation is therefore still hollow. Bill C-31
					 does not address any of the concerns repeatedly mentioned by committees,
					 groups, individuals, and Canadians and Quebecers. The bill is nothing more than
					 a surface attempt to give the impression that the federal government has
					 listened to the criticisms and made the necessary changes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has not. Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to
					 go through the whole bill but as soon as the surface is scratched, the bill's
					 hollowness becomes apparent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the criticisms of the Export Development
					 Corporation in recent years will not end, even with a name change. On the
					 contrary, they will increase. Why? Because for a few months, or weeks, now, the
					 public, not just in Canada and Quebec, but in the entire western world, has
					 understood that trade is not the only thing that matters when it comes to
					 assessing support for corporations such as the Export Development Corporation,
					 or for agreements and international treaties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human and environmental considerations, as well as
					 considerations of democratic rights, are now vital. And this is not the first
					 time. It was the same with the debate on the Canada--Costa Rica free trade
					 agreement. The Canadian government had no suggestions to make regarding human
					 rights, environmental rights or democratic rights. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, Bill C-31 is just like Bill C-32. The
					 government is plowing ahead as though there had been no change in public
					 opinion in Canada and Quebec, as though the economy is more important than the
					 values of Canadians and Quebecers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also surprised that the bill contained no
					 proposal to create a position of ombudsman, although this was repeatedly
					 recommended, both by government committees and by parliamentary
					 committees.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore nothing in this bill that meets the
					 expectations of the Bloc Quebecois or of Canadians or Quebecers. We will
					 therefore have no choice but to vote against Bill C-31.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, first off I would like to thank the hon.
					 member for Joliette and Bloc Quebecois critic for international trade for his
					 comments. I would like to say, on behalf of my New Democratic colleagues, that
					 we will also oppose Bill C-31. We will do so for the reasons expressed very
					 eloquently by the member for Joliette, which I will try to explain in the few
					 minutes of comment allowed me in connection with third reading of this
					 bill.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, we are opposing the bill at third reading. I
					 want to make it clear how profoundly disturbing and disheartening the process
					 was in committee with respect to the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee took the time to hear many witnesses from
					 civil society, the labour movement and the NGO working group on the Export
					 Development Corporation. We heard witnesses from a Latin American human rights
					 group, a researcher for KAIROS, witnesses from Développement et Paix and many
					 others from the business community. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following extensive hearings on the bill, when it came
					 time to reflecting the concerns and the hopes of those witnesses in the
					 legislation with respect to amendments, not a single amendment was accepted by
					 the government members on the committee. Not a comma changed in the bill from
					 its original presentation. Frankly this was contemptuous of the very thoughtful
					 concerns that were expressed by the members of the committee and by the
					 witnesses who appeared before the committee on its hearings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned the NGO working group on the Export
					 Development Corporation, the so-called Halifax initiative. I want to read out
					 the names of the members of that initiative to give some sense to the House and
					 to those Canadians who are watching this debate of the broad diversity of
					 groups that made up this initiative and who were calling for significant
					 changes to the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Halifax initiative working group was made up of:
					 the United Auto Workers Union, the Canadian Council for International
					 Cooperation, the Canadian Friends of Burma, the Canadian Labour Congress, the
					 Canadian Lawyers Association for International Human Rights, Democracy Watch,
					 Development and Peace, East Timor Alert Network, the Falls Brook Centre, Rights
					 and Democracy, Mining Watch Canada, Project Ploughshares, Results Canada,
					 Sierra Club Nuclear Campaign, the Social Justice Commission of Montreal, the
					 Steel Workers' Humanity Fund and the West Coast Environmental Law Association.
					 This is a very impressive group of organizations from across the land that
					 appeared before the committee and put together a comprehensive brief asking for
					 some significant changes in the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to those suggestions, on behalf of my
					 colleagues in the New Democratic Party, I proposed a number of amendments and
					 each and every one was rejected.</p>


	<A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from the Bloc Quebecois also tried to
					 respond to the concerns and priorities of these witnesses. His amendments were
					 also totally rejected by the committee.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now summarize the key areas of concern that were
					 raised in the committee with respect to Bill C-31. First is the issue of
					 disclosure and transparency. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations made to the committee were that the
					 act be amended to require the disclosure of project related information in a
					 timely and regular manner and that pre-approval disclosure of environmental and
					 social information for projects with known or potential significant adverse
					 impacts should have been included in Bill C-31.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review made by Gowlings in June 1999 of the Export
					 Development Act, by the foreign affairs committee in December 1999 and by the
					 minister, all recommended that the EDC be required to disclose information
					 related to transactions. When we look at Bill C-31 there is not a word about
					 disclosure. There is not a single word about greater transparency. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tabling the legislation and in refusing to implement
					 the amendments and recommendations of witnesses, the government is ignoring not
					 only the Gowlings report and the foreign affairs committee but the commitments
					 that were made previously by the minister himself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDC says that it has a disclosure policy that was
					 implemented on October 1 of this year. It says that it has an internal
					 compliance officer. The fact of the matter is there is nothing at all in the
					 bill that requires the EDC to disclose any information whatsoever.
					 Historically, back in the mid-1980s, the EDC actually decided that it would
					 stop releasing any project related information to the public. It could do that
					 tomorrow under the provisions of the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is particularly important as well that the EDC be
					 required to adopt pre-approval disclosure of environmental and social
					 information for projects that may have a significant adverse environmental or
					 social impact. If there is going to be any efficient environmental impact
					 assessment process there has to be pre-approval disclosure. This is already
					 part of the process under other international financial institutions such as
					 the IFC and the European bank for reconstruction and development. In fact, the
					 export credit agencies in the United States and Australia release such
					 information 45 to 60 days prior to approval.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just good practice and it is a principle of the
					 Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. If we look at Bill C-31 there is
					 absolutely no requirement whatsoever for any kind of prior disclosure or
					 pre-approval disclosure of environmental and social information for projects
					 that could have very serious impacts on the environment. Although it was not
					 possible to introduce an amendment to this effect because it was ruled to be
					 beyond the scope of the bill, I would urge the government to bring in
					 legislation to ensure the Export Development Corporation is fully subject to
					 the Access to Information Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Business Development Bank, which is another crown
					 corporation in Canada, is already subject to the Access to Information Act.
					 Both of the American export credit agencies are subject to similar United
					 States legislation. It is totally unacceptable that a crucial question such as
					 transparency should simply be left up to the entire discretion of the
					 corporation. It should come under the umbrella of the access to information
					 legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the issue of environmental protection,
					 clause 10.1 in Bill C-31 is a new clause that deals with environmental effects
					 but it is full of loopholes. It gives the Export Development Corporation board
					 total arbitrary discretion. I will read now from the section itself. It
					 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(c) establish exceptions specifically or by any class, as
						  defined by the Board, to the Corporation's obligation to make the
						  determination.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That determination is with respect to adverse
					 environmental impacts. It could exempt an entire category without any oversight
					 whatsoever. This makes a mockery of any meaningful environmental assessment
					 under the legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we proposed, along with the many NGOs that
					 appeared before the committee, that environmental criteria, including standards
					 and processes, should have been included in the legislation and that a
					 regulation on the environmental assessment process for the EDC should have been
					 developed under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.</p>


	<A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, in December 1999, the foreign affairs
					 committee made a similar recommendation that made it very clear that there
					 should be far more openness to environmental criteria being included in the
					 legislation. No such thing was done. There is not a single word about it in
					 Bill C-31.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Export Development Corporation finds that a
					 project does have, in the words of the section, adverse environmental effects
					 despite the implementation of mitigation measures, the board can approve
					 funding for the project in any event. Even if it accepts that there will be a
					 significant adverse impact on the environment, it can fund a project despite
					 that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at some of the projects that have been
					 funded, such as some of the Candu reactor projects, including the Cernavoda
					 project in Romania and in China, we have very serious concerns about those,
					 just as we have concerns about the Three Gorges dam project in China and a
					 number of other projects that the EDC has seen fit to fund despite very
					 destructive environmental and social impacts. That is why we proposed those
					 amendments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would note as well that the auditor general's report
					 released in May was a damning indictment of the EDC's failure to implement its
					 own environmental framework. It had an existing environmental framework in
					 place but according to the auditor general's report it correctly implemented
					 its own internal environmental framework in only 2 out of the 26 projects that
					 were reviewed. That is why we as New Democrats have called for the Export
					 Development Corporation to be placed under the framework of the Canadian
					 Environmental Assessment Act. There is litigation currently underway
					 challenging the decisions with respect to the Three Gorges dam. I for one hope
					 that the litigation ultimately will be successful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final area of concern is with respect to human
					 rights and core labour standards. We recommended in the committee, supported by
					 the Bloc Quebecois which made a similar recommendation, that the purpose of the
					 EDC be changed to include a requirement that it respond to international
					 business opportunities in a manner consistent with Canada's international
					 obligations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it really such a revolutionary thing to ask that the
					 Export Development Corporation, which is accountable to Canadian taxpayers and
					 owned by the people of Canada, respect and honour the international commitments
					 that Canada has undertaken, whether it be the international covenant on civil
					 and political rights; the international covenant on economic, social and
					 cultural rights; our international environmental commitments; or our ILO
					 commitments on core labour standards?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Warren Allmand, the director of rights and
					 democracy, appeared before the committee, he pointed out the same thing and
					 made the same recommendation, that we should be honouring and EDC should be
					 required to honour in its operations those international
					 obligations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again was a recommendation of the foreign affairs
					 committee, the same committee that studied the bill and recommended in its
					 December 1999 report, of which I have a copy here, that we explicitly make
					 reference in the legislation to our international commitments to human rights,
					 core labour standards and other key areas, including the environment.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a copy of the press release that was issued by
					 the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade on December
					 16, 1999. The committee stated the following:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Committee recommends, as an
						  overarching provision, adding to the Export Development Act clear Parliamentary

						  these both deliver benefits to Canadians and meet Canada’s international
						  commitments and obligations, including those related to environmentally
						  sustainable development and human rights.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened between December 1999 and October 2001?
					 The same committee rejected an amendment proposé par le Bloc québécois, proposé
					 par moi pour le NPD.</p>


	<A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	They rejected an amendment in the identical wording
					 that we had accepted and unanimously recommended in December 1999. I say shame
					 on the Liberal members of that committee for not being prepared to stand up for
					 the original recommendation that was made by their own committee. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again the bill is profoundly flawed in that
					 respect as well. There is no commitment whatsoever to honour those
					 international obligations and no commitment whatsoever with respect to the
					 important issue of establishing an ombudsperson within the EDC. For those
					 reasons my colleagues and I oppose the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to raise a broader question today. What the EDC
					 has said is that it is prepared to protect commercial interests. We have heard
					 this same argument with respect to trade deals. We know that under NAFTA
					 corporate interests are protected by chapter 11, the investor state provision.
					 We know that under the WTO the interests of patent holders and multinational
					 pharmaceutical companies are accepted under the so-called TRIPS agreement, even
					 when that has an obvious detrimental and in some cases devastating impact on
					 the availability of affordable drugs to fight HIV-AIDS and malaria in
					 sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil, India and elsewhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that the Liberal government and its allies in
					 the Canadian Alliance on this issue are prepared to defend the rights of
					 multinational pharmaceutical drug companies but are not prepared to defend the
					 basic rights of workers around the world? They are not prepared to defend the
					 environment, to defend indigenous peoples, to defend human rights. Why the
					 double standard?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might just say parenthetically that many in
					 developing countries are asking why the double standard with respect to patent
					 rights. We have seen the spectacle of the Minister of Health recently being
					 prepared to override patent rights of the Bayer corporation in a minute because
					 of a possible threat of anthrax in Canada. Frankly we as New Democrats welcome
					 that decision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in developing countries are asking if this is
					 the same government that is prepared to defend the multinational pharmaceutical
					 companies under the TRIPS agreement when they try to say they need the right to
					 protect their patents on drugs to fight HIV and AIDS. What hypocrisy. What a
					 double standard with respect to multinational pharmaceutical companies. If it
					 is good enough for Canada, it is good enough for the poor in sub-Saharan
					 Africa, Brazil, India and around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing I want to point to one very real, powerful,
					 human example as to why there has to be fundamental changes in the workings of
					 the EDC and why Bill C-31 falls far short of what is acceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999 an indigenous Embera Katio leader from
					 Colombia, Kimy Pernia, appeared before the foreign affairs committee. I was
					 there when he gave evidence. At that time he provided testimony about the
					 impact of the EDC supported Urra hydroelectric dam in northern Colombia. Kimy
					 testified eloquently before a committee about how Embera land and crops were
					 being flooded by the dam. Fish stocks upriver from the dam were eliminated,
					 robbing the Embera of the mainstay of their diet. Vast areas of stagnant water
					 were created, bringing mosquitoes and epidemics of malaria and dengue to Embera
					 communities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kimy testified that this dam was built without ever
					 consulting any of the indigenous communities living in the area that would be
					 affected. This was a violation at the time of both the Colombian constitution
					 and international human rights agreements. The EDC financed a portion of this
					 dam. There was no consultation whatsoever with the indigenous peoples that were
					 most directly affected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kimy also told our committee that day that speaking out
					 about these things would put his life in danger in Colombia and that four other
					 Embera leaders had already been killed by paramilitary forces for challenging
					 the negative impacts of that dam. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tragically Kimy's prediction proved to be accurate. On
					 June 2 of this year Kimy Pernia was abducted by paramilitary gunman in
					 Colombia. Since then we have no way of knowing where he is. There has been
					 absolutely no news about his whereabouts. Since he has disappeared there have
					 been other killings and continued threats against Embera
					 communities.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the dam, a project the EDC chose to
					 invest in despite the opposition of the local indigenous communities, has
					 exacerbated the violence that already existed there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is another reason we wanted to see included in the
					 legislation a requirement that the EDC operate in a manner which would be
					 consistent with our international obligations in areas such as the universal
					 declaration of human rights, the UN covenants I mentioned, and the ILO
					 declarations on core labour standards. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that kind of assessment had been done in Colombia
					 perhaps that terrible project would not have been funded. We oppose Bill C-31.
					 We believe that in the key areas of transparency, environmental protection and
					 respect for human rights core labour standards the bill falls far short. For
					 that reason we will be voting against the bill at third reading.</p>

					 (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon.
					 member for Burnaby—Douglas for his speech. His concerns for human rights date
					 back many years. He addressed a number of points in his speech.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before asking my question, I would like to make some
					 comments. I represent the riding of Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, a riding
					 in which is located a company called Davie Industries. Despite a bankruptcy
					 last Wednesday, there is an economic recovery project under way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister for International Trade is questioned
					 about projects submitted to the EDC, he or his assistants always reply “We
					 cannot speak of them, because that is a crown corporation”. They are, when it
					 comes down to it, merely required to table an annual report in the House. There
					 is always the aspect of confidentiality. When the hon. member refers to the
					 access to information aspect, I find it vital to democracy for people to be
					 kept informed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, let us recall that Davie did eventually
					 obtain something from the EDC, the famous <i>Spirit of Columbus</i> platform,
					 after two years, when the work on it was completely done. Examination of the
					 project took two years. I assumed that they were probably busy looking at the
					 human rights aspect, and if it respected the environment, and the
					 like.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I realized that was not the case. It is even
					 worse with the changes. The corporation is not even subject to the
					 international treaties Canada has signed. This is inconceivable. There is
					 nothing in writing. The amendment proposed by the hon. member for Joliette was
					 refused. So there is still the matter of transparency, environmental problems
					 and the like.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the hon. member, with his lengthy
					 parliamentary experience, he who says he does not understand how the Standing
					 Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade could have changed its
					 mind in its report, what in his opinion are the possible responses he has in
					 mind that would cast some light on it for me, with my lesser experience in
					 foreign trade. In my opinion, it is inconceivable. The government will not give
					 us a reply on this. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, according to him, are the reasons the government
					 side is behaving in this way, doing such an about turn in its
					 position?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the space of only a few months, the committee
					 members changed their position, surely under someone's influence. I would like
					 to hear some hypotheses from him on this.</p>

	Madam Speaker, unfortunately I cannot answer the hon.
					 member's question. It is an excellent question but it should be put to the
					 Liberal members who sit on the committee and who completely changed their
					 position between December 1999 and today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know and I do not understand why they are not
					 prepared to accept the same recommendation. It is not revolutionary. It
					 provides that the EDC must comply with its international obligations regarding
					 the environment and human rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read the recommendations made by other
					 witnesses, I can only assume that major Canadian companies said that they did
					 not want to be forced to accept these obligations. Perhaps this is what
					 explains the Liberals change of attitude, since they are funded by these same
					 companies. As to whether the Liberals yielded to the pressure exerted by these
					 corporations, I do not know. Is there another answer? The question should be
					 put to the Liberals.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to
					 Bill C-31, an act to amend the Export Development Act. It makes a number of
					 other amendments which I will go through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for International Trade tabled amendments
					 to the Export Development Act. There are a number of them, including changing
					 the name of the corporation to Export Development Canada. There is nothing too
					 substantive in that regard, but I should like to talk about some of the more
					 substantive changes. I should also like to spend some time at the end talking
					 about the Canada account.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First I will go to some of the proposed changes. One
					 amendment would enable the board of directors to delegate its powers and duties
					 to committees that it may establish other than the executive committee. Right
					 now 13 of the 15 board members are currently appointed by the Minister for
					 International Trade. The remaining two, the chairman and the president, are
					 appointed by the Prime Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These appointments, all very partisan political
					 appointments, are the people responsible for formulating the current practices
					 of the EDC. We have political appointments. There is the patronage we have seen
					 in the past and now an unelected board wants to delegate its powers and duties
					 to one level down. I think it is incredibly questionable. Instead I would
					 suggest that the board should come before a parliamentary committee and be held
					 accountable instead of further divesting its responsibilities and powers to
					 another partisan appointed committee. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 15 member board is appointed by the Prime Minister
					 and the Minister for International Trade, which I think is wrong. They should
					 be looking at its focus. Recently Patrick Lavelle, chairman of the EDC, called
					 for more independence for crown corporations and agencies such as the EDC,
					 stating the objective of naming directors should be to “get the best people, no
					 matter where they come from”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Lavelle has suggested the EDC move toward
					 privatization, noting that there is a culture of secrecy in the government
					 bureaucracies, “an inherent believability in federal crowns that information is
					 power and increasing its release will just generate unwarranted criticism”.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing with taxpayer money. This is all about
					 accountability. Yes, one in four jobs in Canada is a direct result of our
					 exports. Some 43% of our GDP solely depends on exports. However the funding
					 that goes out from EDC has to be fully accountable. It has to be transparent.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have the chairman of the EDC saying that the
					 power of the federal crowns in releasing information will only generate
					 unwarranted criticism, we have to question where these types of things should
					 be addressed. Of course they have not been in this legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore he is recommending that the Prime Minister
					 create a cabinet post that would make one minister responsible for overseeing
					 all crown corporations, with a parliamentary committee established to provide
					 oversight. On another note he mentions that crown directors should perhaps face
					 the same liability as private sector directors. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course this is coming from somebody who has worked
					 very closely with the EDC as the chairman and has seen this firsthand, probably
					 better than most. These are the types of suggestions that he has come forward
					 with. Yet there is no mention of any of them in the legislation. It does not
					 address any of these issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of Mr. Lavelle's words, the latest addition to
					 this haven for patronage appointment is former Senator Bernie Boudreau who was
					 named by the PMO last month to a plumb post as a director of the EDC. It is
					 just another flagrant example of patronage on the part of the
					 government.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has to be more accountability with crown
					 corporations, something which is evidently lacking at present.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present government agrees that EDC should “publicly
					 demonstrate its accountability by reflecting the full range of public policy
					 concerns in its activities and should introduce appropriate transparency
					 measures concerning its activities”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Export Development Corporation is immune from
					 access to information because it is not covered under the act. We are dealing
					 with billions of dollars of taxpayer money and it is immune from any type of
					 access to information request to make sure that we have more
					 accountability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to call quorum, Madam Speaker, because I
					 did not see any government members. However I apologize because I see one now.

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, this is about accountability and
					 transparency. One suggestion proposed by the auditor general was that the
					 design and implementation of a directive be established by the board at least
					 once every five years. I know there will be measures in the legislation for
					 these type of reviews, but once every five years is not good enough. These
					 reviews should be more often than that, whether it is every year or two
					 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing with billions of dollars of taxpayer
					 money. There has to be accountability. The members board controlling the funds
					 are politically appointed. I am not suggesting that they are not doing a good
					 job in a lot of their work, but there has to be accountability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it completely unacceptable that Export
					 Development Canada, or Export Development Corporation as it is now known, is
					 immune from the Access to Information Act. Nonetheless a study prepared for the
					 federal government found that crown corporations, including the EDC, should be
					 subject to access to information since access laws encourage organizations to
					 be “demonstrably worthy of public trust”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study notes that the reasons for crown
					 corporations, such as EDC, to be excluded from the laws are unclear and
					 suggests that an agency should be subject to the law if the government appoints
					 more than half of its governing body. As I pointed out earlier, the 50 member
					 board is appointed by the Minister for International Trade and the Prime
					 Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking for is greater accountability and
					 transparency. What has the government done with its legislation? It is now
					 giving powers to a politically appointed board to appoint further committees of
					 its choice. The committees would not be appointed by parliament nor would they
					 be accountable to parliament. The board would divest its responsibilities to
					 further the committees, and I find that completely unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment would require the EDC to determine
					 whether projects would have adverse environmental affects. I acknowledge this
					 is important, although I question whether this is the place for that. It has an
					 environmental review process now, and we have to be committed to ensuring that
					 we protect the environment for future generations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mandate of the EDC is to assist Canadian
					 corporations with exports and access to other markets. In light of the recent
					 events of September 11, with an economy that is beyond fragile and that is in
					 serious decline, there has probably never been a more important time for EDC to
					 ensure it fulfills its mandate where needed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's trade with the United States is $1.4 billion
					 U.S. a day. I have been told that exports between Canada and the United States
					 are off some $200 million to $300 million a day since September 11. We are
					 talking 10% to 15% out of our economies, which is a huge amount. Again, if
					 there has ever been a time for EDC to fulfill its mandate, it is now. I see
					 nothing in the legislation that strengthens this area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May this year the report of the auditor general gave
					 failing grades to 24 of 26 projects backed by the Export Development
					 Corporation. To add insult to injury, the EDC decided it would not make public
					 details of three of the projects judged to have been improperly assessed under
					 the corporation's environmental review process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new environmental changes, and I understand they
					 are voluntary, are very questionable. </p>


	<A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is even more telling when it comes to
					 accountability and transparency. The EDC unilaterally decided not to release
					 the details of three of these projects for “good, legitimate reasons”. That was
					 what we are told without know what the reasons were. We will never know any of
					 the details of these three projects. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, EDC has argued that these are business
					 transactions and businesses have to be protected for patent reasons or whatever
					 the case may be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that these businesses are approaching a
					 crown corporation, in essence the taxpayer, for financial assistance for these
					 projects. That being the case, that changes the circumstances completely. If
					 they need taxpayer dollars and assistance, then they have to be accountable and
					 more transparent. They should be open to access to information requests. If
					 they have business practices or information that could hurt future business
					 opportunities and they does not want to divulge whatever that information may
					 be, maybe they should rethink asking for taxpayer money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crown corporation is supposedly striving to rid
					 itself of this secretive image. Yet it is well known for its lack of
					 transparency and willingness to fund projects of which other agencies stay
					 clear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to come back to the Canada account. So people
					 understand, there are two accounts with Export Development Corporation, or
					 Export Development Canada as it will now known. There is the corporate account
					 to which businesses apply under the general rules. They have to have proper
					 credit ratings to meet those practices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the Canada account, also known as the
					 political account. This is for companies that would not qualify under the
					 corporate account. If they do not have the right credit risk, the right
					 business plans or whatever it may be to access funds from the corporate
					 account, they go to the Canada account. The Canada account is basically a
					 cabinet account where the Government of Canada interferes and advises the EDC
					 that it would like something approved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been some examples. Again, the most obvious
					 one, and the public is aware of it because it has been in the press, is the
					 recent Bombardier transactions to the tune of $3.7 billion in loan guarantees.
					 In fairness to the government, they were not actual subsidies but loan
					 guarantees. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, Bombardier was facing unfair business
					 practices. It was at risk of losing to Embraer, which was engaging in unfair
					 trade practices. It was important to Canada and our economy that we maintain
					 these jobs in Canada and that Bombardier continue to be a world leader in the
					 manufacture of regional aircraft. As a result of September 11, there is even a
					 greater market for smaller regional aircraft.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am making is that there are many other
					 industries that face unfair trade practices. Probably right now no other
					 industry has more problems than the softwood lumber industry. It is facing
					 unfair trade practices, not unlike Bombardier did with Embraer. Trade tariffs
					 of 19.3% are being imposed on the industry by the U.S. administration. The case
					 has been to various international trade tribunals on three separate occasions.
					 Canada has won every single time. However, through U.S. domestic legislative,
					 these tariffs have been imposed on the softwood industry in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be remiss if I did not mention that 45% of that
					 industry is in British Columbia or over $10 billion a year. When we add that
					 kind of tariff, we are talking over $1 billion a year out of the British
					 Columbia economy alone. </p>


	<A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow we will be hit with the anti-dumping tariff.
					 Canada has one industry that is getting loan guarantees under the EDC Canada
					 account and I understand why. However tens of thousands of jobs, and the number
					 is probably in the area of 40,000 to 50,000, in the softwood lumber industry
					 right across Canada have been lost. Those people are getting absolutely no
					 assistance from the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government granted the $2.1 billion loan guarantee
					 under the Canada account for the Air Wisconsin deal. In January I asked the
					 minister if this was a new policy of the government. When an industry in Canada
					 is faced with unfair trade practices, I asked him if the government would start
					 providing subsidies or loan guarantees or match the unfair trade practices.
					 Using the words of the government, I was told that all it was going to do was
					 match the unfair trade practices of Brazil. That begs the question, does that
					 become the policy of the government? I do not think that is the best policy.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now the forest industry in Canada is facing
					 horrific job losses. We are told that tomorrow it is going to be faced with an
					 anti-dumping suit anywhere from 5% to 15% on top of the 19.3%. The forest
					 industry is facing somewhere between a 25% and 35% tariff. This issue has been
					 through international trade tribunals and Canada has won every time. We have
					 heard the minister say time and time again that officials are meeting with our
					 American friends to the south on the issue. The reality is that this process
					 could take two or three years and there will be no forest industry left in
					 British Columbia or elsewhere in Canada for that matter. The industry will be
					 struggling to stay alive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stress that the Canada account is very political. In
					 summary we will not be supporting this legislation primarily because it does
					 absolutely nothing to deal with the issue of accountability and transparency.
					 This crown corporation spends billions of taxpayers' dollars. It has a budget
					 in the billions of dollars and has control over where the money goes. It is
					 immune from access to information. That needs to change. The government thought
					 it more important to change the name rather than bring about accountability and
					 transparency. We believe that is wrong and we will be voting against
					 it.</p>

					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any time September 11 is mentioned we think of those
					 who suffered and died in New York and Washington. We should never make light of
					 what happened there. However it does have some ongoing effects on our economy
					 and these are things we have to discuss.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance is going to have to bring down
					 a budget soon. He is trying to stay away from that awful D word, the deficit.
					 Perhaps it will be looming large again in our vocabulary but we certainly hope
					 not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Export Development Corporation's role is to help
					 small, medium and large exporters obtain sales abroad for Canadian goods and
					 Canadian services. To ensure that our Canadian suppliers get paid, they can
					 obtain insurance through the Export Development Corporation to guarantee that
					 they will get payment. On a normal transaction that is not a bad thing. We
					 ensure many different things these days. We wonder why it has to be a crown
					 corporation that does that and not the private sector. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to be that mortgages had to be insured by the
					 government and then the private sector took over that. Why can we not think
					 about allowing the private sector to do it in the export market as well? That
					 of course would bring to bear what is called the Canada account. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member who spoke previously talked about the Canada
					 account which is a political account. Team Canada sometimes likes to slide all
					 those great big sales that it announces to justify its trips around the world
					 through the Export Development Corporation. In the final analysis sometimes
					 Canadian taxpayers end up picking up the tab not only for the trip around the
					 world but also for those great sales promotions that team Canada said it had
					 achieved but it did not quite work out that way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to think that we would get away from these
					 politically motivated deals. The governor in council, the cabinet, can dictate
					 to the corporation saying it has signed a deal to sell a Candu reactor to some
					 rather nefarious country it would rather not deal with but it is good for
					 Canadian jobs. It tells the corporation to sign the deal and guarantees the
					 deal. Lo and behold if sometime later something goes wrong and we do not get
					 paid, the Canadian taxpayer gets to pick up the tab. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It works in much the same way as the Canadian Wheat
					 Board which sells wheat and grain around the world all guaranteed by the
					 Government of Canada. When we look at the financial statements of the Canadian
					 Wheat Board, it has never had a bad debt since it started. The Government of
					 Canada pays every bad debt that it incurs. We never know exactly how much that
					 is costing us. The wonderful statements made by the wheat board say, “Don't
					 worry. We get paid”. It is the Canadian taxpayer who quite often pays for the
					 wheat that we presumably sell elsewhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the bill deals with trying to require the
					 Export Development Corporation to build in some environmental criteria. We
					 recognize that the environmental laws are different in different parts of the
					 world. To apply a Canadian standard and say that we are not going to finance a
					 project in country <i>x</i> unless it meets a Canadian environmental standard
					 may be totally inappropriate. The environmental standards would be different in
					 that country and there would be a total mismatch of rules and regulations and
					 the whole thing would fall apart. It is going to require the Export Development
					 Corporation to try to develop some criteria to ensure that not only the country
					 involved but all the inhabitants of the world benefit and that the environment
					 does not suffer too dramatically because of the project that is being
					 anticipated.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general's report produced in May 2001, just
					 a few months ago, reports on the Export Development Corporation and its
					 environmental review framework. That is what the bill talks about in some
					 degree. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 5 the report talks about the important gaps in
					 public consultation and disclosure. We are talking about a crown corporation. A
					 crown corporation is owned by the taxpayers and has to report to the taxpayers.
					 On the first page of part 1 the auditor general says there are important gaps
					 in public consultation and disclosure. That is right at the front. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is typical of the government. Every time we turn
					 around there is something it is trying to hide, be it the shawinigate papers we
					 could not get our hands on, or just yesterday I was reading in the newspaper
					 how the privacy commissioner is trying to get a hold of the Prime Minister's
					 agenda, not the contents of what he discussed, but whom he met with. Even that
					 is a state secret. It is little wonder that the Export Development Corporation
					 is saying that it wants to be part of the same mould.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general is right in saying that the elite
					 of the corporation will have to act quickly to address issues of transparency
					 and that there is lack of policies and procedures at the project level to
					 govern public consultation and disclosure of environmental information. These
					 are serious allegations. The auditor general, our officer of parliament, is
					 saying it is time for EDC to wake up and start being more open and transparent
					 and tell us what it is actually doing because we the taxpayers are the
					 shareholders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 10 on page 6 under the heading “Is the
					 framework operating effectively?” the auditor general says: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

						  differences between the framework design and its operation. In those cases,

						  interpreted according to the circumstances of each project, than as an
						  important risk management tool that they were expected to apply.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is minding the store? If there is no openness and
					 transparency, the institution of parliament which is supposed to be holding it
					 to account does not have the information. Therefore we cannot do our job
					 properly and it gets away with anything it wants to get away with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 22 on page 8 states: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Unlike federal departments and
						  agencies, the Export Development Corporation is not subject to the Canadian
						  Environmental Assessment Act or to the Access to Information Act. Unlike
						  private sector financial institutions, it is not subject to regulation by the
						  Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, does not pay income
						  tax, is not required to pay dividends, and can borrow at favourable rates on
						  the credit of the Government of Canada.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it can do all those things, we would think the least
					 it could do is tell us what it is up to so we could keep an eye on what the
					 organization is doing. But we all know that transparency is not the watch word
					 of the government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 27 on transparency, public disclosure and
					 accountability states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The government acknowledged that the
						  information the corporation currently discloses provides few details.

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we really trying to do here? Are we a
					 dictatorship or are we an open democracy? I thought we were an open democracy.
					 It goes on to state:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td><small>It noted, however, that the
						  corporation was making significant strides toward making more information on
						  its activities available to the public. </small></td>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we are still waiting. The litany continues on. In
					 paragraph 34 which deals with developing a framework for risk management it
					 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>To provide the public with a better
						  understanding of the corporation's environmental practices. Although the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are right back to square one. Whatever it wants to
					 do it does behind closed doors. It does it incompetently or not at all. As long
					 as the taxpayer is kept in the dark it thinks it is home free. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the way it should be. Given that it relied
					 on the environmental information provided by project proponents for its risk
					 assessments, the corporation needed to communicate to participants what
					 information it required and how it would be used. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through the report, there are many instances of
					 problems in the organization. In paragraph 56 at page 14 the auditor general
					 points out that there are important gaps in public consultation and disclosure.
					 It states: </p>

	Mr. Speaker, this past weekend the National Aboriginal
					 Youth Conference took place in Edmonton. Aboriginals are the fastest growing
					 segment of the Canadian population. That is why it is vital to hear the voices
					 of First Nations, Inuit and Metis young people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Secretary of State for Children and Youth
					 spoke at the conference which brought together youth from across the country as
					 well as members of national aboriginal organizations. The findings from the
					 conference will assist in implementing the national aboriginal youth strategy.
					 They will be presented in December to a meeting of national aboriginal leaders
					 and the ministers of aboriginal affairs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conference provided a valuable forum to hear
					 directly from aboriginal youth about the issues that concern them.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to rise
					 today to mark the 29th anniversary of the 1972 election held on October 30 of
					 that year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only five members of parliament elected or
					 re-elected in that election who still serve here today. The Right Hon. Prime
					 Minister, the hon. Deputy Prime Minister and the hon. member for Davenport were
					 re-elected that year. Today there are only two MPs who were first elected that
					 year: the right hon. member for Calgary Centre and I.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then as now I was a proud member of the official
					 opposition. In fact the right hon. member for Calgary Centre and I both served
					 in the same caucus under the leadership of Mr. Stanfield. Then as now the
					 centre right was split in the House of Commons, with the Conservatives as the
					 official opposition and the Social Credit Party here also. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an old saying that those who forget the past
					 are doomed to repeat it. The lessons of those years are not lost on me, and I
					 would venture to say they are not lost on the Prime Minister or the Deputy
					 Prime Minister. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I hope that my colleague and fellow classmate
					 from 1972, the right hon. member for Calgary Centre, remembers those lessons
					 too and will not become the Réal Caouette of 2001 or allow his party to become
					 the true inheritors of the Social Credit legacy in this place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I thank the voters of British Columbia for
					 sending me to this place that year and in three subsequent
					 elections.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of that the federal government, while pumping

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-32, the act to implement the free trade
					 agreement with Costa Rica, cannot be viewed in isolation of the North American

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reciprocal provisions in the agreement would not
					 provide Canadian sugar with any commercial export opportunity. Sugar should be

					 precedent with upcoming negotiations with Central America.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's sugar market is already the most open in the
					 world. Our sugar industry does not depend on any domestic or export subsidies
					 or other trade distorting policies. Our modest 8% tariff is important until the

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege in
					 relation to the failure of the Minister of Justice to respect the tabling
					 requirements, enacted for the benefit of this House by the Parliament of
					 Canada, in section 119 of the Firearms Act and chapter 39 of the Statutes of
					 Canada, 1995.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 117 of the Firearms Act confers on the governor
					 in council extensive regulation making powers in recognition of the significant
					 impact which the exercise of those powers can have on Canadians. Parliament
					 also adopted a provision requiring the Minister of Justice to table any
					 proposed regulation before both houses for referral to an appropriate committee
					 of each house before the regulation can be enacted by the governor in
					 council.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 118 of the act precludes the adoption of any
					 proposed regulation before the expiry of certain deadlines to ensure that
					 members of both houses have an adequate opportunity to examine and report on
					 the appropriateness of the regulation under the Firearms Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This background information makes clear that parliament
					 attaches a great deal of importance to members being fully informed and
					 involved before the governor in council is allowed to make a regulation under
					 section 117. It is against this background that the exceptions to the rule must
					 be assessed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 119 of the Firearms Act provides for two cases
					 in which the governor in council is allowed to make a regulation without the
					 Minister of Justice having first tabled the text of the proposed regulation
					 before both houses. The first exception is where the minister is of the opinion
					 that the changes made by the regulation to an existing regulation are
					 immaterial or insubstantial. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second exception applies only to regulations made
					 under certain specific paragraphs of section 117 and where the minister is of
					 the opinion that the making of the regulation is so urgent that the requirement
					 in section 118 should not apply.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both these instances subsection 119(4) of the act
					 provides that where the Minister of Justice forms the opinion that a regulation
					 should not be tabled in draft form, the minister shall have a statement of the
					 reasons he or she formed that opinion laid before each house of
					 parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has come to my attention that between September 16,
					 1998, and December 13, 2000, a number of proposed amendments to regulations
					 made under the Firearms Act have not been tabled before parliament as required
					 by section 118 of the act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant instruments are those registered under the
					 designation SOR/98-468 to SOR/98-471, SOR/99-109 to SOR/99-111, SOR/99-453,
					 SOR/2000-224, SOR/2000-225, SOR/2000-259, SOR/2000-385, and SOR/2001-9 to
					 SOR/2001-12.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In four of these sixteen instances the reason for which
					 the amendment was not tabled was that the Minister of Justice formed an opinion
					 that the regulation was so urgent that section 118 should not apply. In the
					 other twelve cases the regulations were not tabled pursuant to section 118
					 because the minister formed the opinion that the changes made were immaterial
					 or insubstantial.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I could determine from the records of the
					 House, the minister has not complied in those 16 cases with the duty imposed
					 upon her by subsection 119(4) of the act to table a statement of reasons
					 supporting her opinion that the section 118 requirement should not
					 apply.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 17, 2001, my colleague, the member for
					 Yorkton--Melville, rose on a point of order to request that the same minister
					 observe the statutory tabling requirement in the case of yet another regulation
					 which was registered as SOR/2001-336.</p>


	<A NAME="T1505"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1505"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1500"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1505)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fundamental distinction between the point of
					 order raised by my colleague and the question of privilege I raise today. It is
					 my contention that the minister's failure to table the required statements in
					 relation to the instruments I have identified is a breach of the privileges of
					 the House. This conclusion would not change even if the minister were to table
					 the required statements today, tomorrow or the day after.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In failing to table the required statements the
					 minister is not only breaching an order of the House as expressed in its
					 statute but has also deprived members of their ability to verify that her
					 reasons for exempting these regulations from the application of section 118 are
					 sound and proper.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be no excuse for the minister's cavalier
					 disregard of the statutory duty she owes to the House. Each of the regulations
					 in question states in its preamble that the minister will lay a statement of
					 reasons before each house as she is required to do by section 119 of the act.
					 This is not a case where the minister was unaware of her duty. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, your predecessor was called upon in 1993
					 to rule on a similar question of privilege raised by the hon. member for
					 Scarborough--Rouge River. The issue at that time concerned the failure of the
					 minister of finance to table an order made under the Customs Act as it was his
					 statutory duty to do. The member for Scarborough--Rouge River stated that he
					 entertained no doubt that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--the
						  minister's failure to table a document required to be tabled by this House,
						  whether intentional or accidental, tends to diminish the authority of the House
						  of Commons and is something that might reasonably be held to constitute
						  contempt by this House.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaker Fraser ruled on April 19, 1993, that a prima
					 facie case of breach of privilege had been made and allowed the member to move
					 a motion referring the matter to the Standing Committee on House Management. In
					 his ruling Speaker Fraser reiterated that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The
						  requirements contained in our rules and statutory laws have been agreed upon by
						  this House and constitute an agreement which I think all of us realize must be
						  respected. Members cannot function if they do not have access to the material
						  they need for their work and if our rules are being ignored and even statutory
						  instruments are being disregarded.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker said he found it particularly disheartening
					 that the government failed to table documents within the prescribed time and
					 did not do so until after the matter was raised in the House. The Speaker noted
					 that the tabling was a statutory requirement and quoted the member's
					 comment:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>It is difficult to conceive of any
						  command of this House that could have more legitimacy than one contained in a
						  law passed by this House.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker also agreed that disregard of a legislative
					 command, even if unintentional, was an affront to the authority and dignity of
					 parliament as a whole and the House in particular.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that the statute in this case does
					 not specify a particular time within which the minister must table a statement
					 of reasons before both houses when a regulation is made without having first
					 been laid in draft form before the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that tabling of such a statement may be
					 made at any time? Can it be years after the making of a regulation? The answer
					 to both questions is no. In the absence of a specific tabling deadline the
					 obligation of the minister must be understood to be an obligation to table her
					 statement of reasons within a reasonable time following the enactment of the
					 regulation made in reliance on subsections 119(2) or 119(3) of the Firearms
					 Act.</p>


	<A NAME="T1510"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1510"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1505"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1510)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that reasonable people might disagree on
					 whether a particular delay in tabling is reasonable or not in the
					 circumstances. However, it is equally certain that no reasonable person would
					 consider that a delay of two or three years is reasonable or was contemplated
					 by the statute. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event the questions of whether or not a
					 particular delay in fulfilling a tabling requirement was reasonable and whether
					 there has in fact been a breach of the statutory duty imposed by subsection
					 119(4) are clearly at the heart of this question of privilege.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are questions that the House itself will deal
					 with in reaching a decision on the question of privilege.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, we are not concerned with a substantive
					 determination of the question of privilege but only with a determination of
					 whether or not the facts I have laid before the Speaker appear to give rise to
					 a legitimate question of privilege. That is the only issue before the Speaker
					 and, based on the ruling by your predecessor, Mr. Speaker, I suggest that the
					 House should be allowed to deal with the substantive issue of
					 privilege.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I believe that a review of this precedent
					 will show that the repeated failure of the Minister of Justice, whom, by the
					 way, I have given a notice to today, to table a statement of reasons in 16
					 instances for a period of over two years, beginning some three years ago,
					 constitutes a prima facie breach of the privileges of the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to move an appropriate
					 motion but I will seek advice from you. Should I table the motion today or
					 later on when you so desire?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I received moments before question period
					 a copy of the letter to which the hon. member refers. He refers in that to
					 regulations made under section 117 of the Firearms Act, and the tabling
					 requirement under subsection 119(4).</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some difficulty in understanding how this issue
					 could be before the House today. If the information I have is correct, the
					 matter of the tabling of regulations pursuant to section 117 of the Firearms
					 Act was already brought to the attention of the House by the hon. member for
					 Yorkton--Melville on October 17.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was brought to the attention of the House at
					 that time, it was on a point of order and the Speaker accepted that it was a
					 point of order, not a question of privilege. I am in some difficulty to
					 understand how, mysteriously, it could be a question of privilege
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I am told that the Chair ruled at the time that
					 the matter would be taken under advisement and that the Speaker would come back
					 to the House and give his answer on the matter. I have no information to the
					 effect that the Chair has ruled on it. I assume the Chair has not. If the Chair
					 has ruled on it, it must be only very lately.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I understand that the Minister of Justice
					 intends to lay the matter in question before the House in very short order in
					 any case, which would probably make the point moot if and when it is
					 raised.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I understand that the Minister of Justice is
					 providing to the two members in question, namely the member who just raised the
					 issue along with the member for Yorkton--Melville, written information
					 regarding the material in question.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have to add another piece of information
					 to this in relation to what my colleague across the way just said. There is a
					 huge time difference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulation I was referring to, and the urgent need
					 that the minister made, was taking place on September 11. I raised that issue
					 several weeks later. The time differential there was very different from what
					 my colleague is now raising.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a question of privilege because the minister
					 has ignored this for a very long period of time. She has completely disregarded
					 it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are two separate issues completely.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not raise it as a question of privilege. I wanted
					 the minister to reply. She did not give an adequate answer, Mr. Speaker, but
					 that is really not what concerns you in this case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case we have, I believe, a prima facie case
					 before the House on privilege, and because of the time differential these two
					 are not comparable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill
				C-31, an act to amend the Export Development
				Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the
				third time and passed.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-61844"></A><a HREF="#Int-61852"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-61850"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier,
					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, this bill on the Export Development
					 Corporation—let us call it that for the last time—which was known by the French
					 acronym SEE and the English EDC, stems from a series of consultations in which
					 I participated as a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and
					 International Trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put a lot of work into the Export Development
					 Corporation, and I regret now to have to announce that we will be voting
					 against this bill at third reading. We did, as I said, try to get it
					 amended.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our audience, it is important to know that the
					 mandate of the Export Development Corporation is to support Quebec's and
					 Canada's exporters, as well as those who wish to do business in Canada. It
					 therefore also has a function to develop trade with other countries.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was established in 1944 as the Export Credits
					 Insurance Corporation. In 1969, it became a crown corporation and acquired the
					 additional powers of being able—and this was something new—to make direct loans
					 to foreign borrowers, and to borrow against the government's credit to finance
					 its activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, a final change enabled it to invest in capital
					 stock, to lease assets to users outside Canada, to constitute subsidiaries, as
					 well as to take part in joint ventures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, the EDC is self-funding, in that it receives
					 no parliamentary votes for its activities. It is a very important corporation.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members need to know that it estimates that it has
					 supported experts and foreign investments to the tune of some $45 billion last
					 year. It is a very important corporation. Despite its financial
					 self-sufficiency, it is still a crown corporation, because a private company
					 wishing to do the same could never compete with it. It is, therefore, a crown
					 corporation which, thanks to a series of privileges, benefits both potential
					 investors in Quebec and Canada and potential exporters from Quebec and
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not subject to the Access to Information Act. It
					 is not subject to the Environmental Assessment Act. It is not regulated by the
					 Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, as is the case for the
					 private sector. It does not pay income tax. It does not have to pay dividends.
					 It can borrow at favourable rates, thanks to the credit extended to the
					 Government of Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are some of what might be termed the privileges
					 enjoyed by the EDC. </p>


	<A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1525)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to see its importance but it is also easy to
					 see why parliamentarians have repeatedly studied its role in Quebec, in Canada
					 and abroad. It is not subject to the Access to Information Act, nor
					 environmental assessment, and it has developed a policy of extreme secrecy. For
					 all these reasons, there have been numerous recommendations made regarding the
					 EDC.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment to Bill C-31 is to change the name
					 of the EDC. I think that few parliamentarians noticed this. However, since I
					 have been here, I have seen many legislative texts that begin by modifying the
					 name.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDC, the Export Development Corporation, is well
					 known. This bill changes the name to Export Development Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of so many crown corporations have been
					 changed to contain the “Canada” trademark, all I can do is to comment that this
					 is also the case with the name of the EDC.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of those listening, I would like to
					 point out that the most outrageous change, in my opinion, was that made to the
					 former Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, the regional section of
					 the Department of Industry, the former Canadian regional development
					 department, which dealt solely with development investment in Quebec. That was
					 why it was called the Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after we arrived here in 1993, a bill was
					 adopted which stipulated that this office, for the region of Quebec, would be
					 called Economic Development Canada. What is peculiar is that, in the budget or
					 votes, the names of offices with a similar mandate in the other provinces—for
					 example, Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and the Western Diversification
					 Office—remained unchanged.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in Quebec, it is now called Export Development
					 Canada. Of course, this is all part of the great propaganda campaign to rename
					 things. So, in French, it is goodbye to the SEE and hello to Exportation et
					 développement Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998-99, the EDC was the object of a first review
					 that had been decided in 1993. For the purpose of that exercise, the firm of
					 Gowlings was asked to make recommendations. Gowlings conducts studies and
					 audits. It is one of these large Canadian accounting, and surely now financial
					 firms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gowlings, which is very much a private firm, made
					 recommendations that differed significantly from the practices in use at the
					 EDC as regards, among other things, transparency, the environment, sustainable
					 development and also human rights.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, this is from the firm of Gowlings, a well known
					 firm of lawyers, accountants and other experts. Its recommendations were not
					 revolutionary, but provided that: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The EDC should regularly publish

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firm added the following:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Canada must work to achieve an
						  international consensus on guidelines and environmental procedures that must be
						  complied with by organizations similar to the EDC in other
						  countries.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after, it goes on to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The EDC should submit its
						  environmental framework to a public consultation process and ensure that the
						  resulting policy is largely supported by exporters and non-governmental
						  organizations.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was in 1998-99. The firm then
					 recommended:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">

						  projects or operations for the environment. The corporation should develop and

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not read everything. Finally, on the issue of
					 human rights, the firm said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>EDC should implement a policy whereby
						  when applying for EDC financial or insurance services, Canadian exporters are

						  codes of conduct that ensure respect for human rights, ethical business conduct
						  and fair labour standards in their international activities. </small></td>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and
					 International Trade studied the Gowlings report at some length, after hearing
					 from many witnesses. The committee made several recommendations. These
					 recommendations dealt with public disclosure, with its risk assessments, which
					 could be useful to Canadian financial institutions and to the Office of the
					 Superintendent of Financial Institutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee, with the support of Liberal members—we
					 know, of course, how things work in committee—opted for the principle of
					 improving mandatory disclosure of useful information in the interest of public
					 accountability, in line with the Gowlings report's recommendation, provided
					 that confidential trade information was protected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also suggested that:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--a
						  provision be added enjoining EDC to give due regard to the commitments and
						  obligations undertaken by Canada under international agreements—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee then proposed, and this is
					 interesting:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">

<td><small>—EDC
						  could further enhance its public credibility by conducting a formal
						  consultation with stakeholders on the framework's performance after its first
						  year of operation—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, the recommendations did not find a
					 taker in the report. However, not only the Bloc Quebecois but many NGOs who
					 came to testify found that even the committee's report did not go far
					 enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one basic principle. This corporation is a
					 crown corporation. As such, can it afford to fund and support in various ways
					 companies which do not respect the environmental assessment framework? Can it
					 refuse to provide information which is provided in other countries by
					 equivalent corporations?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can it circumvent international agreements that Canada
					 signs in the area of human rights? Can the corporation, which acts on Canada's
					 behalf, do everything contrary to what Canada signs?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This basically is what the Bloc is opposed to. I will
					 not say that there should be no concern over competition and trade secrets.
					 That said, however, there remains a significant margin where, while remaining
					 competitive—the American and Australian corporations are—the corporations must
					 honour the bases of the major international conventions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without compatibility, we could be contributing to the
					 confusion and anger of many countries and people living in developing
					 countries, who see countries like Canada with international commitments
					 respecting the environment and human rights and a degree of transparency and
					 practices at home that contravene these very rules.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-31, which has created a lot of expectations
					 among many people, contains some improvements. They are so timid that they will
					 prevent us, even if we wanted to, from voting in favour of its
					 content.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt my colleague from Rosemont will use all
					 his time to speak to the environmental aspect, because what is there is totally
					 inadequate. I will read the only thing sought, and we will see it makes no
					 sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10.1 provides, and I quote:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem lies in the fact that the auditor general
					 has said that the frames of reference were inadequate even to evaluate it, and
					 that of the 25 projects she evaluated, 23 did not conform.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the environment, transparency, public
					 disclosure of information or compliance with international conventions on human
					 rights, Bill C-31 is a long way from attaining the minimum objectives we might
					 have expected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore with regret that we will vote against
					 the bill.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, as always I am pleased to rise on behalf
					 of the people of Surrey Central. Today I am taking part in the third reading
					 debate on Bill C-31, an act to amend the Export Development Act and to make
					 amendments to other acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to share my time with the
					 hon. member for Kelowna.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is of a housekeeping nature, simply to update
					 the act. The government did not accept any amendments from the opposition
					 parties during the committee stage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since legislation governing the Export Development
					 Corporation requires a ministerial review of the act, a review commenced in
					 1998 and concluded with a report. It was reviewed and reported by the Standing
					 Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade. The results of that
					 report are the amendments in Bill C-31.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If passed, the bill will enable the board to delegate
					 its powers. It will require the EDC to establish a pension plan for its
					 employees. The treasury board policy encourages crown corporations to arrange a
					 comprehensive, independent pension plan for their employees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPP managed by the federal government earns even
					 less interest than a bank savings account. That is how expert the government is
					 in mismanaging the employee and employer funds. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surplus funds from the inefficiently managed CPP
					 were grabbed by the Liberal government. The chief actuary of the CPP was fired
					 for being forthright and not yielding to the Liberals' pressure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to these amendments, there were no legislated
					 environmental review requirements of the EDC. If the bill is passed, it will
					 require the EDC to determine if a project is likely to have adverse
					 environmental effects and whether it would be justified for the EDC to enter
					 into a transaction. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act will not
					 apply to the EDC's reviews so that Canadian environment standards and laws are
					 not imposed on other sovereign nations. That is what the government says. Or
					 perhaps the government can further its own agenda under the guise of
					 environmental protection evasion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the substantive environmental
					 amendment is to strike a balance between trade competitiveness and concern for
					 the potential environmental impacts of projects supported by the
					 EDC.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My opposition to the bill also stems largely from
					 questions surrounding EDC's lack of environmental accountability under the
					 Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996 Candu reactors were sold to China at a cost of
					 $2.5 billion. To sweeten the deal, the Canadian government financed the sale
					 with EDC facilitating the deal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinarily, the deal would have required an
					 environmental assessment to deal with questions such as whether the area around
					 Qinshan was prone to earthquakes, floods and the like. Issues like these are of
					 vital importance in determining if nuclear reactors are a danger or not. Had an
					 environmental assessment been done at that time, it would have helped put these
					 concerns to rest. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now know that since the government did not like the
					 rules of the game, it changed them, even though there is a lawsuit by the
					 Sierra Club of Canada. This is another example of how the government failed to
					 do its homework and tried to circumvent due process by altering the rules of
					 the game to suit its purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all witnessed the alarming and tragic consequences
					 of the nuclear tragedy in Chernobyl. The loss of life directly attributable to
					 that disaster is truly staggering. </p>


	<A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1545)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years later, cancer rates in the area remain alarmingly
					 high. Imagine the effect of such a disaster in China where the population is
					 much greater. The death toll from radiation poisoning and cancer would be
					 enormous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental assessment in highly populated areas,
					 flood prone areas and earthquake prone areas was probably very important, but
					 the government thought it was better to stay quiet about such issues rather
					 than jeopardize the deal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, this weak government's record on
					 environment is very weak. It has let the legislation on the protection of
					 endangered species die a few times on the order paper. It has signed
					 international treaties, including those from Kyoto, Beijing and Rio, for
					 example, with no intentions whatsoever of carrying out its commitments. The
					 government made those commitments without consulting Canadians, parliament and
					 the provinces. The government has made political decisions about matters that
					 require scientific decisions, logic and reasoning. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general recommended that most international
					 financial institutions, including export credit agencies, have environmental
					 policies and procedures. A consensus emerged on the elements of good practice
					 that an international financial institution should adopt to ensure that the
					 projects it supports are environmentally and socially responsible.
					 Industrialized G-8 countries and OECD countries developed common environmental
					 guidelines for export credit agencies but the government is trying to
					 circumvent them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen the framework's implementation, the EDC
					 should concentrate on the tools that identify environmental risks in the
					 screening process and on monitoring to ensure that the framework is operating
					 efficiently and effectively. To strengthen EDC's environmental review process,
					 EDC needs to make changes in both the design and the operation of the
					 framework. To close the gaps in the framework's design, EDC should focus on
					 enhancing transparency through public consultation and disclosure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem with the bill is that EDC is being used
					 by the Liberal government, no surprise, for political favours, in addition to
					 other crown corporations and agencies being used, such as CIDA, HRDC, WD, ACOA
					 and many others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patronage appointments in crown corporations are
					 rampant. Most recently, Mr. Bernard Boudreau, a short term senator and cabinet
					 member who unsuccessfully ran for the Liberals in the last election, was
					 appointed to the board of EDC. The bill does not address the issue of patronage
					 appointments at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance recognizes the essential part
					 financial institutions play in the everyday lives of Canadians. We would
					 protect the best interests of consumers by fostering competition and ensuring
					 that the financial services sector is adequately regulated, without impairing
					 stability or opportunity for success and growth in these
					 institutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the services provided by the EDC, such as short
					 and medium term export insurance and financing, should be privatized. The rest
					 of the EDC services should become a division of DFAIT and should be directly
					 accountable to parliament. This division could provide occasional loan
					 guarantees and other services that are beyond the scope of the private sector,
					 such as long term insurance, political risk reassurance and projects that are
					 not commercially viable but are deemed to be in the national interest. In 1991
					 the United Kingdom privatized its equivalent export agency, the Export Credits
					 Guarantee Department. We can learn from that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve exporters better, there should be true
					 competition in the export business and financing business. They should have the
					 opportunity to deal directly with their own banks or insurance brokers to have
					 their exports financed and insured. If the banks got into the business,
					 exporters might receive 100% financing in addition to speedier and personalized
					 services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the bill does not address the concerns
					 that I have highlighted. I ask the government to address these issues and make
					 appropriate amendments to the bill, which they have not done so far. Otherwise
					 I will be left with no choice but to vote against the bill.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to address my remarks to
					 three particular points in the bill. I would like to attack it from the
					 principles of patronage appointments and of crown corporations and private
					 enterprise, and also on the business of transparency, in particular with regard
					 to the judge, advocacy and jury all at the same time with the bill. It would do
					 those things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is actually amazing what the bill would do and how
					 it came to be. The first thing I want to stress is the business of this crown
					 corporation actually being created to be in direct competition with private
					 enterprise. Some people would ask how I came to this kind of conclusion. The
					 conclusion comes to me on the basis of what the United Kingdom did when it
					 considered joining the EU. At that time it became very evident that it needed
					 to maintain a clear balance between crown corporations, which are really the
					 instrument of government, to develop their particular policies, purposes and
					 objectives, and to do so in a commercially viable way. At least that is the
					 purported intent. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I do not quarrel with a situation where a private
					 enterprise could not get into that enterprise, I do quarrel with it here. So
					 did the EU and so did the United Kingdom. In fact, in 1991, ten years ago, the
					 United Kingdom privatized a short term branch of its equivalent export agency.
					 It was called the Export Credits Guarantee Department. The agency was
					 privatized to ensure that there were no implied trade subsidies in the EU from
					 one country to another. The United Kingdom government now, as written in 1997,
					 provides a political risk reinsurance to the private company that took over the
					 ECGD. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is very significant that the United Kingdom
					 saw the potential conflict that was there, not only in its own government but
					 also in the governments of other countries, and the complication that it would
					 create among various countries doing business with one another. It wanted to
					 have a fair and level playing field among them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is that significant? The EDC really runs its
					 operation on two accounts. It has a commercial account and it has a Canada
					 account. The commercial account really gets most of its money from financing
					 export operations and the insurance in guaranteeing certain loans to exporters.
					 The Canada account, on the other hand, is designed to advance the particular
					 policies, objectives and purposes of the Canadian government. I am really
					 addressing my remarks here to the first part of that, because that is its major
					 operation. It is here that it finds itself in direct conflict with private
					 enterprise. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophically and on principle I am utterly and
					 completely opposed to government doing things that the private sector can do as
					 well or better. I would suggest that not only is that the case for the private
					 enterprise, but it is actually in the interests of all Canadians that it be the
					 case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move on to my second point which has to do with
					 the patronage appointments that are possible here. I will read, for the benefit
					 of those who are listening to us this afternoon, the provisions for this
					 activity as provided for in Bill C-31. It is really an amendment to section 7.
					 Section 7.1 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Board may establish any other
						  committee and that committee may exercise any powers and perform any duties of
						  the Board delegated to it by the Board.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we wanted carte blanche, there it is. We would first
					 of all have this board and this board would have a number of members on it
					 appointed by the government. They feel they would like to do something. There
					 may be some friends that they would like to have doing some work, so they form
					 a committee and appoint people who are their friends and who can do certain
					 kinds of things. The number of committees is unlimited. They may form any
					 committee to do whatever they want and then they can delegate whatever powers
					 they have to any one of those particular committees.</p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would think that reason would prevail and that in
					 fact there would not be an abuse of this power, but we have seen it, not only
					 in this government but in other governments where this kind of freedom exists
					 and politics rather than the interests of people enter into the decision making
					 process. At that point it is clearly obvious that a political advantage accrues
					 to those who supported the party in power. That is what I am concerned
					 about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only would the bill make it possible, the bill
					 almost says please do it and make sure that there are enough vacancies here so
					 that we can appoint anybody we want to have appointed to these committees. I
					 take strong exception to that. I do not believe that kind of thing should
					 happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can a private corporation do something similar to this?
					 Yes, it can, but it has the added difference that it does this on the basis of
					 being efficient and working in the interests of the shareholders and the people
					 it is trying to serve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That motivation may be the same for the government, but
					 it may not be. The political situation may be one of fostering its own bed
					 rather than developing what is there in the best interests. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Mr. Speaker, that is not you. You care about
					 people. I know that. I know you very well. Even though you are in an opposing
					 party, you are the kind of guy who I think would not do this sort of thing.
					 However, Mr. Speaker, they are not all like you.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move on to my third point which has to do with
					 the judge, advocacy and jury of this committee. I cannot believe the kind of
					 thing that has happened here. However, not only do I have to believe it, I have
					 to put it in the context of what the auditor general said about this
					 corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refer specifically to paragraph 22 in the May
					 2001 auditor general's report on the Export Development Corporation and in
					 particular the environmental review framework. In paragraph 22 he
					 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Unlike federal departments and
						  agencies--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I notice that he is separating out from federal
					 departments and agencies that crown corporation in particular, the Export
					 Development Corporation. </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--the
						  Export Development Corporation is not subject to the Canadian Environmental
						  Assessment Act or to the Access to Information Act. Unlike private sector
						  financial institutions, it is not subject to regulation by the Office of the
						  Superintendent of Financial Institutions, does not pay income tax, is not
						  required to pay dividends, and can borrow at favourable rates on the credit of
						  the Government of Canada.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is very significant. This group could determine a
					 number of things. With regard to the environment, it may determine whether a
					 particular project “is likely to have adverse environmental effects” and then
					 later on it will define what an adverse environmental effect is to be. Is that
					 not interesting? A project comes up and the board decides on what are adverse
					 environmental conditions. The other one is whether the particular project
					 actually does meet those requirements. If we wanted to create a situation where
					 we could change the rules of the game halfway through the game, we would have a
					 perfect way in which to do this. All the board would have to do is change the
					 definition and change its particular interpretation or application of that
					 definition for a particular project.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot think of a greater morass, almost a miasma, a
					 poisonous vapour arising from this kind of situation, than a group that comes
					 to this board and says it will not cause environmental damage, with the board
					 members saying they are not sure if it fits the definition or not, and then
					 they could move it around to suit the situation as they wanted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should never be allowed. There should be an
					 independent group like the environmental group that stands for all government
					 agencies and departments, financial institutions, private institutions and for
					 us as individuals. It should apply in exactly the same way to this agency even
					 though it is a crown corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to vote against this provision unless it is
					 changed.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the member raised the issue of the

					 applicability to corporations, such as the EDC, the Canada Broadcasting
					 Corporation and others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the important elements of the debate about

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member knows, EDC deals extensively with

					 their correspondence could be subject to requests. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give an example, members of Democracy Watch wanted
					 the committee to ask the industry department to provide copies of every piece
					 of correspondence that was ever sent to them concerning a particular policy
					 initiative. It had nothing to do with the decisions of Industry Canada. It had
					 to do with a fishing expedition by people, either educators, researchers or
					 people in the espionage business, looking for information that they could use
					 for their own gain and that they could acquire it at a nominal cost.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise that with the member in terms of the
					 sensitivity that he may have to putting businesses, which, in good faith, go
					 through the EDC, at risk of having their competitive position jeopardized
					 because of the applicability of the Access to Information Act.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would be very happy to respond to the
					 hon. member. That is not at all what I referred to. There is sensitive
					 information, and the hon. member knows that I know that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completely agree that if there is information that is
					 pertinent to a particular contract, it must be kept confidential. However I do
					 not believe all information is of that nature, and he knows that too.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important issue here is that there is a lot of
					 information that can and should be made public. The financial institutions,
					 such as the banking institutions that are governed by the superintendent of
					 financial institutions, must give certain information to the superintendent.
					 What we are talking about is that the corporation we are talking about today
					 does not have to do that. It should be as clear and transparent as those
					 institutions have to be to the superintendent, no more and no less.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not talking about the abuse of information. I am
					 not going on a fishing expedition and I do not think the hon. member is. That
					 is not the issue nor is it the point I was trying to make.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am trying to make is that if it is
					 legitimate information it should be made public and it should be available to
					 all those who want it.</p>

					 Rock—Langley, PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-31, the
					 amendments to the Export Development Act. I think the concern Canadians have
					 whenever we talk about agencies or organizations such as the Export Development
					 Corporation is that once again we are talking about a crown corporation that
					 operates supposedly for the people of Canada and yet lacks all
					 accountability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC has a reputation of being unaccountable, secretive
					 and without transparency in its operations. It does not fall under the Access
					 to Information Act which allows it to operate in such a way that it does not
					 respect environmental concerns and issues. It has a reputation of being a crown
					 corporation that operates out there on its own agenda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Canadians are concerned that it has become a
					 norm for agencies of the government to operate without parliamentary oversight.
					 If people watch question period they will see that even when the opposition
					 parties try to ask questions of the minister to bring some accountability to
					 the crown corporation that the questions are not answered, not that any of them
					 ever are, but questions pertaining to this particular crown corporation are
					 never responded to in a way that shares information with Canadians as to what
					 it is doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Canadians have real concerns that the
					 government is continuing to operate in this manner and that it is the
					 government's mode to develop organizations that it controls. It controls the
					 people who run these organizations. It controls the information flow that goes
					 into them and the lack of information that comes out about them. In essence,
					 the government is removing any kind of connection between the people who pay
					 for the crown corporation, which is the Canadian taxpayer, and the operation of
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Canadians have become more aware of the
					 involvement of the Export Development Corporation when issues like the Candu
					 reactor come up and the fact that the Canada account, which I believe was used
					 in that kind of venture, is often done in such a way that there seems to be a
					 disregard for those regulations that are put in place, such as the
					 environmental regulations. Canadians are somewhat concerned that Canada would
					 be exporting Candu reactors without any kind of environmental assessments being
					 done, without any real concern about the national security of our country where
					 we would give foreign nations the capacity to perhaps use nuclear by-products
					 for other means other than creating energy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Canadians to a degree are aware of the
					 existence of the Export Development Corporation but are not aware of the
					 details of it, who sits on the board or to whom it answers. Canadians are a
					 little concerned that here again is another crown corporation that is run in a
					 manner that may not be acceptable to the Canadian public who pay for
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to look at the bill and the amendments to see
					 whether they address those concerns. I would suggest that the bill does not
					 seem to address those concerns that Canadians have. I do not think that the
					 means with which the bill deals with the accountability is sufficient. I think
					 Canadians want to know that this crown corporation, which is using Canadian tax
					 dollars to give to some corporations but not all corporations, is done in a
					 fair and transparent manner. Some Canadian corporations might ask themselves
					 why their competitor is getting this kind of support when they are not.
					 Canadians need to feel comfortable that the people who are making the decision
					 as to who will get government support, taxpayer money, are treating these
					 decisions in a fair, open and above-board manner.</p>


	<A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the fact that the chairman and president of the
					 Export Development Corporation are appointed by the Prime Minister should cause
					 some concern. The fact that the other 13 board members are appointed by the
					 Minister for International Trade should cause Canadians some concern. The
					 reason for this concern is that once again we see that the appointments to this
					 board are political. They are being used to reward individuals who have been
					 faithful supporters of the party with an opportunity to sit on the
					 board.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Canadians would like to see the end of that
					 practice. I think Canadians would like to see some justification for the
					 appointments to the board of the Export Development Corporation. They would
					 like to see that the appointments of a president, CEO or chairman are done in
					 such a manner that they could not be used for political purposes. They want to
					 see people appointed who have earned the right to be there, people who have
					 expertise in the field they will be dealing with, who will be fair and balanced
					 in the decisions they make and who will not unduly risk Canadian taxpayers'
					 money for ventures that are not sound.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, perhaps reflecting on past appointments,
					 Canadians cannot be confident that this is happening. The amendments to the
					 bill do not deal with that concern. A very real concern that I hear on a very
					 regular basis through my householders is that Canadians are concerned about the
					 way the government does business and appoints individuals to positions for
					 whatever reason, most of them political. Canadians are concerned about that as
					 well as being very concerned about how the government spends their money and
					 how the decisions are made on how to spend their money. I do not see any
					 changes in the legislation that deal with those concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in many other cases, we see the government putting
					 in housekeeping legislation that deals with minor things like changing the
					 name. Canadians do not care whether it is called the export council of Canada
					 or export development council or whatever. Canadians do not care what it is
					 called. They care about what it does and how it does the business of the
					 day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues of transparency and complying with the laws
					 of Canada with regard to environmental assessments are the issues that
					 Canadians care about. Canadians care that when the government is operating in
					 the global market network we can be proud of how Canada is represented, that it
					 is being represented by a corporation and by the government in a way that makes
					 us proud.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minor changes to legislation such as changing the name
					 and moving around a few of the powers and oversights and whatnot just do not
					 cut it. I heard my colleague from the Canadian Alliance talking about the
					 decision maker, the oversight and the judge all being one. That basically is
					 still the situation. It has not changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again we see the government operating in a manner
					 that shows its arrogance and lack of contact and connection with Canadian
					 taxpayers. This shows that it really does not believe in transparency, that it
					 really does not believe in giving access to information to Canadians to let
					 them to know what is going on in their government and how their money is being
					 spent.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not buy the argument that there are business
					 decisions that cannot be shared. If the Canadian taxpayer is being asked to put
					 money into a corporation, there should not be anything that the corporation is
					 not willing to share with the people who are paying the bill. If those
					 individuals do not want the ordinary Canadian to have access to that
					 information, then perhaps they should not be asking the Canadian taxpayer to
					 pick up the cost. If they want to avoid disclosure, if they want to avoid
					 access to information, there are private funding sources they can go to that do
					 not have that kind of responsibility to disclose and to be
					 accountable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government could have done a much better job of
					 making this crown corporation more accountable, of making this crown
					 corporation more acceptable to the Canadian taxpayer who is putting the money
					 up front. I would hope that the government could, in this legislation as in
					 other legislation, make necessary amendments to make it more
					 appropriate.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am astounded. The member included a lot
					 of platitudes about secretive transparency, no access, arrogance, et cetera.
					 What she did not say, other than that the taxpayer is footing the bill, is that
					 the Export Development Corporation does not cost the Government of Canada
					 anything. In fact it is making money for the taxpayers of Canada. It is making
					 a substantial amount of money after having been set up. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member would check www.gc.ca and under
					 government departments look at Export Development Corporation, she would see
					 the financial statements. In fact she would also see EDC's annual report, which
					 I commend to the member to give her some information which she obviously does
					 not have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me list some of the services provided. Under credit
					 insurance there is global comprehensive insurance; export credit insurance;
					 documentary credit insurance; specific transaction insurance. Under financing
					 there is direct loan operations; line of credit operations; note purchase;
					 purchase receivables; leasing; equity project financing; master accounts
					 receivable guarantee; small exporter guarantee framework; North Star Trade
					 Finance Inc.; the Scotia Americas capital equipment program. Under contracting
					 bonding, which I know the member knows all about, there is bid security
					 guarantees; performance security guarantees; bid security insurance;
					 performance security insurance; surety bond reinsurance; direct surety bond
					 support; political risk insurance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went out to the lobby and in two minutes I got this
					 information off the web.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Export Development Corporation is a vibrant financial
					 institution that is helping Canadian companies and companies abroad to do
					 export business which creates jobs in Canada. This is not simply a bunch of
					 people who were arbitrarily politically appointed, which the member summarily
					 reduces the entire EDC to. These are financial professionals who are working on
					 behalf of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the member would like to retract or rethink her
					 view of EDC and the platitudes she has put out and put some specifics on the
					 table as to why she has to condemn this thing. Is it just a matter of her sheer
					 ignorance of EDC or is she simply playing politics?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member thinks the Canadian taxpayers should be
					 pleased that honourable people are being appointed. I am not doubting that
					 honourable people are being appointed; I am saying there is a direct
					 correlation with the government of the day, the Prime Minister and the Minister
					 for International Trade by appointing this board. That is not transparent. I
					 would suggest it is not what the Canadian taxpayers want to support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the banks in Canada fund these agencies and
					 companies if it is such a good investment. If they make so much money, let the
					 banks make that money. Let private investors make that money. </p>

					 (Rosemont--Petite-Patrie, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to
					 Bill C-31. As its title indicates, this is a bill to amend the Export
					 Development Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously we can assume that from the moment this bill
					 becomes law it will probably be the last time we discuss what went under the
					 name of Export Development Corporation for many years. This bill proposes a new
					 name, export development Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleagues, the members for Mercier and Joliette,
					 clearly indicated, we will oppose the bill for reasons that are becoming more
					 and more obvious as the debate progresses. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should remind members that the Bloc Quebecois
					 proposed in committee a number of amendments which, unfortunately, were
					 defeated. We would have liked to see the bill improved or at least to see a
					 number of environmental protection measures included in this bill. We would
					 also have liked the bill to provide for more transparency with regard to the
					 disclosure of information. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentarians study the way the corporation has had
					 to work and develop in recent years but we are not alone. A number of NGOs,
					 those belonging to the NGO working group on the Export Development Corporation,
					 repeatedly looked at the work the corporation had done in recent years to
					 expand exports and the extent to which funds and aid were given to projects
					 carried out in developing countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can list some of the organizations involved. They
					 include the Canadian Lawyers Association for International Human Rights, the
					 Social Justice Commission of Montreal, the Canadian Council on International
					 Co-operation, the Canadian Labour Congress, Democracy Watch, Development and
					 Peace, Falls Brook Centre, Canadian Friends of Burma, Mining Watch Canada. Many
					 others also considered the potential impact of this bill on aspects of our
					 lives today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could debate a number of aspects of the bill, the
					 whole issue of disclosure of information, the place of democracy and human
					 rights, which certain specific organizations in the working group and the
					 standing committee on foreign affairs and human rights considered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my intervention will focus primarily on the
					 environmental framework of the EDC and its involvement, on support for certain
					 projects which the EDC set up or supported in the past, but which also—no point
					 hiding it—violate to some extent a number of environmental parameters Canada
					 and Quebec have debated frequently. These debates naturally concern the funding
					 of projects in developing countries, some aspects of which should have been
					 included in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is, to say the least, vague, soft and lacking
					 in environmental terms. It is vague as concerns its environmental framework,
					 which, in many ways, is nebulous and inadequate with respect to the need for
					 disclosure of information. I think this should be pointed out.</p>


	<A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for EDC's environmental framework, the objective is
					 far from clear. It is to “implement a simple, clear, and efficient process for
					 reviewing on a timely basis the best available environmental information on
					 projects for which the Corporation's support is sought”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this objective, the EDC is not saying that the
					 purpose of an environmental assessment is to ensure that the projects approved
					 respect the environment and encourage sustainable development. The EDC prefers
					 to qualify its approach in order to give itself some leeway.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the framework is based on two guiding
					 principles. The first is that environmental reviews undertaken by financial
					 institutions to mitigate project risk can help encourage sustainable
					 development by promoting consideration of the environmental benefits and costs
					 of projects in host country jurisdictions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of my sentence, which is included in the bill,
					 is important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of this guiding principle from the
					 framework is that consideration will be given to the context in which a project
					 would be carried out and therefore also to the context in which the project is
					 funded.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain developing countries, the corporation could
					 be called upon to fund projects which did not respect all the laws, the
					 environmental consensuses, the rules, regulations and environmental values
					 which Canadians and Quebecers have decided are important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to mention one project,
					 although several come to mind. I am thinking of a project funded by the Export
					 Development Corporation. It was criticized for funding and giving $135 million
					 U.S. in support to a mine in Peru. In this particular case, the compensation to
					 the communities affected was clearly inadequate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Candu reactors are another very eloquent example.
					 Is it right that while environmentally based social consensuses must be
					 enforced within Canada's borders and prove acceptable, they would not be
					 enforced for certain other projects which, because of less stringent
					 environmental rules, could be implemented? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must be consistent in politics. A project that
					 would be unacceptable in Canada for environmental reasons should not be
					 acceptable in some developing countries because their environmental rules are
					 not as strict as ours. That is why we, as well as several environmental groups
					 in Canada, have asked that these projects be assessed under the Canadian
					 Environmental Assessment Act. If that were the case, the values and principles
					 that are agreed upon in Canada could be applied to those projects and not only
					 to Canadian projects. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must realize that the framework used is not the
					 Canadian framework but could be that of a country where environmental rules are
					 not as strict. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect, which is the second guiding
					 principle, is that the EDC should decline support for projects which, after
					 taking into account the implementation of mitigation measures, are in its
					 opinion likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects that cannot
					 be justified in the circumstances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think the first guiding principle clearly
					 illustrates a watering down of the environmental standards that the EDC intends
					 to apply. As I was saying earlier, why is it necessary to specify that it has
					 to be done in the context of the host country? Several EDC projects are in
					 developing countries where environmental standards are not as strict as they
					 are in Quebec and in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, need I remind members of this rather eloquent
					 report from the Auditor General of Canada, a special report dealing with its
					 evaluation of the Export Development Corporation, which pointed out that the
					 EDC did not respect its own environmental framework. According to an evaluation
					 by the Auditor General of Canada, and not by opposition members in this House,
					 the environmental effects had not been assessed properly or not at all in 23
					 out of 25 projects funded by the EDC. The situation is clear. In some cases,
					 the environmental framework is respected but, in other cases, it is not
					 respected at all. I think we must act quickly to correct this problem.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wrong to say that the bill we are looking at will
					 remedy the situation. It creates, in a way, a kind of loophole for the
					 government, a dispensation from even having to respect the environmental
					 consensus that has been reached in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another important aspect: the whole matter of
					 preselecting projects. How does the EDC environmental assessment
					 operate?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step is to select the projects that will
					 undergo environmental analysis. Right at the start, the corporation eliminates
					 two-thirds of these projects because it does not submit the short term
					 assurance aspect to any type of environmental review whatsoever. This includes
					 short term client account insurance. It protects exporters from any risk of
					 non-payment by purchasers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us it is clear that environmental viability is not
					 related to whether or not a project is carried out on the short or the long
					 term.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the project is linked to a risk sector. Whether
					 the mining sector, hydroelectric energy, oil or gas, forestry or pulp and
					 paper, the EDC does an influence test. With it, it determines whether it can
					 bring any influence to bear in order to reduce the risks posed by a project. It
					 carries out a detailed environmental review of a project only when it
					 determines that risk and influence constitute factors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the Export Development Corporation,
					 soon to become export development Canada, possesses by virtue of what I have
					 just stated, a certain discretionary power in determining whether risk and
					 influence constitute factors to be considered. Rather than subjecting every
					 project to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, the corporation gives
					 itself the power to conduct this screening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision ought instead to be based solely on
					 potential environmental risk. A number of other institutions classify their
					 environmental assessment requirements according to potential impact on the
					 environment. This is the case in particular with the world export and
					 corporation bank in Australia. The greater the repercussions, the more
					 stringent the examination.</p>


	<A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that this bill leaves much to be desired. It is
					 vague as regards its environmental framework and inadequate as regards its
					 screening and self-assessment processes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the EDC feels that it has some influence, it carries
					 out an environmental assessment based on the promoter's information. A guiding
					 principle of the corporation's frame of reference provides that it will not
					 support a project if it feels that the anticipated positive effects do not
					 justify the potential harmful risks to the environment, in spite of the
					 implementation of mitigation measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her May report, the Auditor General of Canada found
					 that there is no methodology to determine if adverse environmental risks can be
					 justified. This means that a project that would have a negative environmental
					 impact could be approved, based on the interpretation of the assessor and on
					 the information provided by the promoter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No scientific criteria are used. Therefore, it is no
					 surprise that the auditor general found that, for 23 out of 25 projects that
					 were funded by the EDC, the assessment of the impact on the environment had
					 either not been done properly or not been done at all. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would have liked to see amendments adopted by the
					 committee. We would have liked to see improvements to this bill, including to
					 subsection 10.1(2), which leaves the corporation totally free to determine its
					 own environmental criteria. This clause says that “The Board shall issue a
					 directive respecting the determination referred to in subsection
					 (1)”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, these projects are not governed by
					 Canadian laws. How could we accept that the arguments, proposals and
					 representations of some promoters be taken into consideration and that a kind
					 of discretionary power be granted to the board of directors of a corporation
					 such as the Export Development Corporation, when the Canadian Environmental
					 Assessment Act is, to some extent, a requirement under other bills?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we would have liked to see major changes
					 to this legislation. We would have liked to see some amendments accepted. This
					 would have prevented giving a discretionary power to the EDC's board of
					 directors and letting it determine what is good, what environmental guidelines
					 and what frame of reference are acceptable. We would have liked to see the
					 provisions of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act implemented.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We deeply regret the fact that even though amendments
					 were presented in committee, the government refused to accept them. Again, I
					 want to thank the NGOs working group on the Export Development Corporation,
					 which I thanked earlier.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said: Mr. Speaker, one of the honours of a member
					 of parliament is to be able to bring forward initiatives that were truly
					 created in the community. On behalf of the Hepatitis C Society of Canada, the
					 Canadian Hemophilia Society and numerous other organizations I am proud to
					 bring this motion forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We presented the motion on March 19. Since that time
					 the Minister of Health, in response to a question by the member for Hamilton
					 Mountain, has indicated his support. We hope today's motion will bring momentum
					 to the issue such that by May we will have this in effect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the toughest things in health care is dealing
					 with diseases that people do not know they have. It is extraordinarily
					 important that awareness campaigns be launched to seek out people who may be at
					 risk but who do not know they ought to be tested.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment between 210,000 and 275,000 people are
					 infected with hepatitis C in Canada. Only 30% of those people know they have
					 the virus. They are therefore at extraordinary risk of passing the disease on
					 to others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I graduated from medical school in 1974 we did not
					 even know of hepatitis C. We had a form of hepatitis that was neither A nor B.
					 It is only since 1989 that we have begun to name the disease and learn more
					 about its epidemiology and what needs to be done in terms of prevention.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all forms of hepatitis, hepatitis C is an
					 inflammation of the liver. Some people experience severe symptoms such as
					 fatigue and jaundice and go on to develop cirrhosis and even liver cancer.
					 However many people have no symptoms. It is those people we are hoping to help
					 by designating the month of May hepatitis C awareness month to raise awareness
					 among those at risk. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hepatitis C prevention, support and research
					 program within Health Canada. The program, like the first Canadian conference
					 on hepatitis C that Health Canada supported last May, intends to increase
					 awareness, promote positive prevention behaviours, expand research activity and
					 augment the government's capacity to respond to this health threat. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to understand that at the moment the
					 major group of people acquiring hepatitis C are the people most at risk. Some
					 of us saw the documentary on CBC about Joyceville Penitentiary where 50% of the
					 inmates may have hepatitis C. This is an extraordinary health burden in that it
					 is the greatest indication for liver transplant and therefore a huge burgeoning
					 cost to our health care system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest risk is of course among injection drug
					 users and people who engage in high risk behaviours such as tattooing, body
					 piercing, acupuncture and even inter-nasal cocaine use. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current research shows that the risks of transmitting
					 hepatitis C through sexual intercourse or childbirth are low. However it is
					 extraordinarily important to note that we are seeing up to 8,000 new hepatitis
					 C infections each year, of which approximately 2,000 or less than one-quarter
					 are clinically recognized as acute diseases.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 10% to 20% of persons with hepatitis C go on to
					 develop cirrhosis of the liver. This can prevent the liver from functioning
					 properly and eventually require a liver transplant to prevent liver failure and
					 death. Some 1% to 5% of people with hepatitis C and cirrhosis can go on to
					 develop liver cancer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is extraordinarily important that we understand that
					 although there is a help fight liver disease month and many other months, an
					 awareness campaign for this silent illness would be an extraordinarily
					 important step.</p>


	<A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1650)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hepatitis C would not get its due in the regular liver
					 month of March. Because it is unique in its scope a specific awareness campaign
					 is necessary. Otherwise it would be the equivalent of calling AIDS just another
					 immune disease and putting it in an immune disease month. It is extraordinarily
					 important that we focus specifically on hepatitis C because of its serious
					 complications and health burden.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no comparable infectious diseases in Canada.
					 Even AIDS at the moment does not have as many new infections on a yearly basis.
					 We therefore need an even stronger emphasis on prevention activities for
					 hepatitis C across Canada. A full month of awareness would be an extremely
					 strong format for that. Health Canada could then launch its awareness campaign
					 within that time and benefit from the month of focus. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already many activities happening on May 1,
					 including a candlelight ceremony. It could be difficult to co-ordinate a
					 nationwide shift to March should we decide it should be included in help fight
					 liver disease month. The next Canadian conference on hepatitis C will be in
					 May, if not next year then in 2003 or 2004. We feel strongly that by then we
					 will desperately need a month of focus on the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998 Health Canada committed $50 million over five
					 years to develop and design a prevention, support and research program for
					 Canadians living with hepatitis C. It consists of the five components of
					 prevention and targets programming to prevent transmission of hepatitis C among
					 those currently uninfected, particularly high risk youth and injection drug
					 users.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program includes community based care and treatment
					 support as well as the extraordinarily important research component. Then there
					 is the program's management and delivery. In partnership with other parts of
					 Health Canada there are other programs, including enhanced hepatitis C
					 surveillance sites, research into hepatitis C among aboriginal street youth and
					 the Canadian Viral Hepatitis Network.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of these important volunteers who feel their
					 work could be enhanced and made easier by the designation as such, I welcome

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Motion No.
					 303 and I thank my colleague for bringing it forward. I also wish to salute the
					 hard work of the Hepatitis C Society of Canada and the Canadian Hemophilia
					 Society in recommending the motion. They have done a lot of work to promote
					 awareness of this disease and to support the victims of hepatitis C.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all need to understand a little more about the
					 disease and the problems that are caused because of it. I understand there was
					 a conference in Montreal on hepatitis C this past spring with 72 speakers and
					 900 participants. That is a great example of federal-provincial co-operation
					 coming together to bring awareness to this issue. I would like to congratulate
					 the organizers of that conference and both levels of government for bringing
					 together a conference to address the plight of those who are victimized by
					 hepatitis C. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the House of the individual who was in the
					 gallery here last spring, Joey Haché. Joey, as a young boy of 12 or 14 years of
					 age, was victimized by hepatitis C between the compensation years of 1986 to
					 1990. He was asking for compensation that was due to him after a three year
					 plight of trying to get compensation. He brought awareness to his plight when
					 he was here and before he got home that day there was a phone call that his
					 settlement had come through. It is absolutely amazing that a government would
					 work so slowly in this case. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many facts that need to be known about
					 hepatitis C. We have talked about it many times in the House over the years. I
					 will dismiss with going through some of the actual problems of hepatitis C
					 because I think we all understand it needs further attention. The idea of an
					 awareness month is something that would help in that vein.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must help those who are living with this terrible
					 disease on a daily basis and we must do whatever we can to prevent any further
					 spread of it. It is worthwhile noting that hepatitis C is much easier to
					 contract than HIV and that some of the strategies used to prevent HIV are not
					 helping to reduce the rates of hepatitis C. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is something that has been brought up in the health
					 committee, which I vice chair. As deputy health critic I am concerned with
					 prevention in this area, with the idea that we should do whatever we can to
					 keep our blood in this country as safe as possible. The safety of our blood
					 system is being challenged as we speak. We learned a lesson with what happened
					 with hepatitis C and we dare not ignore it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of an awareness month is very important. The
					 way the Liberal government dealt with hepatitis C and tainted blood has left a
					 shameful legacy. The tainted blood scandal was a dark chapter in the nation's
					 recent history. Thousands of victims contracted hepatitis C out of no fault of
					 their own when they were most in need. They contracted this disease from a
					 blood system that they were depending upon when they were ill and needed blood
					 transfusions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a problem with that situation because not only
					 were they let down in their time of most desperate need, but when compensation
					 finally came it was restricted to a four year period between 1986 and 1990.
					 Many Canadians contracted hepatitis C through the blood system outside that
					 four year period. Thousands of victims were let down by the federal government.
					 Many who did qualify, like Joey Haché, had to wait years before they were
					 compensated. That is a terrible legacy for the government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully there were some bright spots. Some of the
					 provincial governments rose to the occasion, such as Quebec, Ontario and
					 Manitoba. Again, there was co-operation among levels of government. They said
					 they would compensate regardless and they had their own compensation programs.
					 They are to be commended. However, many victims still continue to wait for
					 justice. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian hepatitis C health consortium filed a
					 class action complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission against the
					 federal government and eight provinces. It claimed that victims infected with
					 hepatitis C through tainted blood were treated differently from those with
					 HIV-AIDS.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Vicky Boddy, the group's president,
					 HIV-AIDS victims were receiving close to a quarter of a million dollars in
					 compensation. Their drugs were covered and they could access disability
					 insurance under the Canada pension plan, whereas victims of hepatitis C got
					 very little compensation, if at all, and were denied drug coverage and
					 disability pensions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boddy contracted hepatitis C through tainted blood when
					 she received multiple transfusions in 1994. She says that everyone should be
					 treated the same. There should not be a distinction when it comes to hepatitis
					 C and HIV-AIDS. Both diseases are killers. She says that their stories are just
					 as horrifying as the stories we hear from people with HIV-AIDS. The disease has
					 changed many aspects of her life as she used to know it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She noted that thousands of Canadians were dying from
					 hepatitis C every year. The government still has an opportunity to partially
					 right some of the wrongs it inflicted on some of those outside that four year
					 period from 1986 to 1990. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was brought out in the health committee that there
					 is still a surplus of some $900 million in the federal-provincial compensation
					 fund that was set aside to deal with this issue. The money was to be used to
					 help those excluded from the plan. According to Mike McCarthy, a policy adviser
					 to the Ontario health ministry:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The numbers reflect that they grossly
						  overstated the numbers of victims that would qualify from 1986 to 1990 in the
						  package and grossly overpredicted the number of people who were excluded.
						  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a gesture it would be if the federal government
					 used the occasion of this motion to compensate all hepatitis C victims who were
					 infected through tainted blood outside the four year period.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reiterate my support for the motion. This gesture
					 however will be tainted if it is not accompanied by actual deeds. Unless the
					 government acts hon. members can be sure that we will use the opportunity of
					 hepatitis awareness month each and every May because we are prepared to bring
					 awareness to this issue every year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to next spring if the motion is not
					 agreed to. I will bring it forward each and every year and as long as it takes
					 until the Liberal government gets on its knees and apologizes for the way it
					 has treated hepatitis C victims who contracted the disease outside the four
					 year period between 1986 and 1990. I appreciate the idea of having an awareness
					 month. Justice needs to be served and we need to have the political will to
					 make sure it happens.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, first I want to congratulate our colleague
					 who brought forward this motion. I would remind the House that we have debated
					 this idea of an awareness month, which would be the month of May, on several
					 occasions. If memory serves me well, last May the New Democratic Party proposed
					 a motion to that effect. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish members of the government majority would have
					 been just as enthusiastic about that motion. I wish they would have been just
					 as enthusiastic when we studied the Krever report. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that, after three years of inquiry,
					 the first recommendation made by the Krever commission, which had the status of
					 a royal commission, was that all hepatitis C victims would receive compensation
					 regardless of when they contracted the disease. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the government agreed to compensate those
					 hepatitis C victims who became contaminated through blood transfusions, but
					 only between 1986 and 1990. Thousands of Canadians were ignored, particularly
					 those who contracted the disease before 1986 or after 1990. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather shameful that, despite a royal commission,
					 despite representations made by several groups, despite the support of all
					 opposition parties in this House and despite the fact that three provinces,
					 namely Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, have put in place their own
					 compensation schemes, the federal government has not yet followed up on the
					 recommendation contained in the Krever report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that not the role of the government? The government
					 said that it did not have access to the kind of testing that would have enabled
					 it to detect the presence of the virus. However when such a tragedy hits
					 someone--and we know there are different levels of hepatitis C--and it is the
					 result of a blood transfusion, which is a public responsibility, is it not the
					 role of the government to compensate these people and to help them get through
					 such ordeal?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that hepatitis C is affecting increasing
					 numbers of people. Each year, year in and year out, between 8,000 and 10,000
					 people acquire hepatitis C, but only 25% to 30% of them are aware of it. These
					 people could be made a bit more aware of precautions to be taken. They might be
					 provided with health care and be able to eventually come to grips with this new
					 reality in their lives. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we say that only 25% to 30% of people are aware
					 they are hepatitis C carriers, this means that 70% are not. With this disease,
					 there must be a clear differentiation between those who are symptomatic and
					 asymptomatic, those who are contagious and those who are not. That is why the
					 whole matter of prevention and awareness is so important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most certainly, there is not much funding available.
					 Reference has been made to $15 million for the five components of Canada's
					 hepatitis C policy. Fifteen million is most certainly very little, considering
					 the significance of the disease.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, this is a relatively recent phenomenon. Hepatitis
					 A has been known about for some years, and hepatitis B for several decades, but
					 it was only in the early 1970s that we were able to understand the entire
					 symptomology of hepatitis C, to understand its origins and to have a clearer
					 medical and clinical picture of this medical reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, we are in agreement with the principle of
					 having an awareness month.</p>


	<A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want this awareness to involve all the partners,
					 including the Government of Canada, because it has a responsibility in
					 epidemioliogy and in certain research programs, the provinces, naturally,
					 because they are the primary health care providers, and we must not forget, the
					 various community groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each of our communities, there are groups comprised
					 of volunteers, people who assume responsibilities on boards or who, by
					 providing volunteer support to others who are infected, can provide real
					 comfort.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a real battle, real hepatitis C awareness, involves
					 a partnership between the governments, federal and provincial, and the various
					 community groups and public bodies, such as CLSCs, hospitals and all care
					 providers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will therefore vigorously support this motion. I
					 hope that next May we will have a real public awareness campaign. I also hope
					 that, in the short term, the government will really follow up on the Krever
					 commission and that it will act on its first recommendation and ensure that
					 those who need financial support, or drugs, may find comfort in the federal
					 government, which has the means of its policies and that, as the first
					 recommendation of the Krever report proposes, we may have a compensation plan
					 without regard to chronology.</p>

					 (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, NDP):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for St. Paul's for
					 bringing forward this valuable motion to the House to further debate the
					 concerns of victims of hepatitis C.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to correct a misconception from the previous two
					 speakers. Canada already has a hepatitis awareness month, which is the month of
					 May. I am pleased to say that I had a private member's bill which was drawn and
					 debated in the last parliament. We tried to make it votable but unfortunately
					 the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of health said no. However the
					 minister, who has his own concern, announced at the hepatitis conference in
					 Montreal that from that day forward the month of May would be known as
					 hepatitis awareness month.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the motion deals just with hepatitis C,
					 those who follow the concerns of hepatitis know that there are seven different
					 strains which have infected close to 740,000 Canadians from coast to coast to
					 coast, with hepatitis C infecting over 300,000 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the hon. member for St. Paul's has done a lot of
					 work on behalf of people afflicted with hepatitis C. She should be
					 congratulated by all members of parliament on both sides of the House for her
					 continuous effort in this field</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reiterate, the month of May already recognizes the
					 seven strains of hepatitis. The member for Yellowhead said he would like to
					 bring forward recognition and awareness of hepatitis year in and year out. I
					 encourage him to do so in his householders, mail outs, in his town hall
					 meetings in his riding or for that matter throughout the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know three individuals who have worked closely on the
					 hepatitis file. They are Joey Haché and his family from Ottawa and two people
					 from my riding specifically, Mr. Neil Van Dusen and Mr. Bruce Devenne. All
					 three have hepatitis C. All three fought hard, not just for themselves but for
					 all Canadians afflicted with hepatitis C, for some sort of financial assistance
					 from the government. However the minister made a decision to make the window
					 between 1986 and 1990. Unfortunately, anyone who contracted hepatitis C outside
					 that window was not entitled to any kind of compensation or assistance in that
					 regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do thank the provinces involved for picking up some
					 of the slack, but unfortunately people who have a disease of that nature are
					 unable to work. While that kind of funding was welcomed, it was not enough to
					 assist them. Canadians, and especially the Minister of Health and the
					 government in charge, need to promote health wellness wherever we
					 can.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contraction of hepatitis C over the years has not
					 just been through operations in hospitals and blood transfusions. It also comes
					 from needles and other interactions that Canadians involve themselves in on a
					 daily basis. We need to bring awareness to unsuspecting Canadians who may
					 involve themselves in activities of that nature. We need to make them aware
					 that whatever decisions they make may have dire consequences on their long term
					 health or some may even die as a consequence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not just talking about HIV-AIDS, which transmitted
					 sexually or through needles. I am also talking about hepatitis which is very
					 serious and contagious disease that can be contracted through various forms.
					 One of those ways is through needles.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage all Canadians who are listening to tell
					 everyone, including their municipalities and health boards that more awareness
					 of this very serious disease would go a long way toward the education of
					 Canadians. Thus hopefully we can eradicate the disease from not only the face
					 of the country but from the planet as well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Democratic Party definitely supports the
					 motion. Again, I thank the member for St. Paul's for bringing the issue to the
					 floor of the House of Commons.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this
					 debate. I recall the debate and the problem about compensation for victims of
					 hepatitis. The tone was slightly different, and we had a much more heated
					 debate. Let us not forget what happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of my colleagues have raised the matter of
					 compensation. Unfortunately, there are still problems. People have yet to
					 receive all of the money they are entitled to under the agreement. Some have
					 found themselves outside the terms announced by the federal government so that
					 they could not benefit from the terms of the agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleagues have said, the motion before us
					 concerns hepatitis C, a new disease. It was identified in 1989, that is only 12
					 years ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the first time either that there is talk of
					 making May a month for hepatitis C awareness. As my colleague in the New
					 Democratic Party said, a bill was tabled in the House in this respect, but
					 unfortunately it was not declared votable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to a question, the Minister of Health
					 announced that May would be hepatitis awareness month in Canada but this does
					 not detract from the quality of the motion put forward today, far from
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 17, the Minister of Health said, and I
					 quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not recall that we supported him on this issue,
					 not that we would have had any problem doing so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees from my office did some research on the
					 department's website. I do not know whether they were going at it the wrong way
					 but they found no press release confirming this. They have searched Health
					 Canada's website and found absolutely nothing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore a bit strange that, twice now, members
					 of the House have taken steps to designate a hepatitis awareness month in
					 Canada, specifically for hepatitis C as this evening's motion suggests, that
					 the minister has taken a decision, and that the New Democratic Party member
					 says that this month has already been designated, when we can find nothing on
					 the Health Canada website.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that everyone agrees with the motion.
					 Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that you seek the consent of the House
					 to make this motion votable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat that the motion put forward this evening has
					 unanimous approval. With the fine speeches we have heard, with the support of
					 the government members and of opposition members, unanimous consent can be
					 sought, because everyone is in agreement. I believe that with unanimous consent
					 we could vote on the motion put forward this evening and officially give our
					 support to the Minister of Health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, we greatly appreciate the member's work and
					 I once again seek unanimous consent so that the House can officially vote on

	Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to talk
					 about an important subject that concerns all Canadians. I am talking about
					 hepatitis C. I want to congratulate the member for St. Paul's for her
					 dedication to this cause and for her efforts to have the month of May
					 recognized as hepatitis C awareness month. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the member has worked tirelessly to defend this
					 cause and I am glad she decided to raise the issue in the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year, a motion to make the month of May
					 hepatitis awareness month was debated in the House. The motion before us today
					 is very much in line with the previous motion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will use the rest of my time to talk about hepatitis
					 C and the initiatives taken by Health Canada to deal with this most important
					 public health concern. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hepatitis C is a virus that can be transmitted by
					 blood. It infects the liver and can cause serious damage. A test to detect
					 hepatitis C was developed in 1989 and was introduced in Canada when it became
					 commercially available in June 1990. Before that, in cases of hepatitis of an
					 unknown type, it was referred to as non-A, non-B hepatitis. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the groups most at risk of contracting hepatitis
					 C are those who received blood transfusions before screening for the virus
					 began in 1990, persons exposed to contaminated needles, and health care staff
					 who suffer needlestick accidents with contaminated needles.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is believed that the risk of transmission to
					 newborns or transmission via sexual contact with an infected person is
					 low.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In approximately 10% of cases, the source of infection
					 is unknown or undisclosed. According to estimates, up to 8% of
					 Canadians--somewhere between 210,000 and 275,000 people--carry the hepatitis C
					 virus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some people may experience symptoms such as
					 fatigue or jaundice, many others present no symptoms at the beginning of
					 infection. The hepatitis C virus progresses slowly within the body. Symptoms
					 may take up to 20 or even 30 years to manifest themselves after the initial
					 infection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998 the federal government, more specifically
					 Health Canada, allocated $50 million over five years to design a prevention,
					 support and research program to assist Canadians with hepatitis C.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, over the next 20 years the government will
					 transfer $300 million to provincial and territorial governments in order to
					 provide the medical care that people with hepatitis C require. This financial
					 assistance guarantees that no Canadians, regardless of where they live, will be
					 forced to pay for needed care and treatment, particularly services and
					 treatment such as new drug therapies and home care nursing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main objectives of the prevention, support
					 and research program is to educate Canadians and raise awareness about
					 hepatitis C.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultations with key stakeholders revealed that the
					 greatest challenge for an awareness campaign would be to inform and educate
					 target groups without frightening them. It is of the utmost importance that
					 messages not create false perceptions regarding the virus, and that they not
					 contribute to stigmatizing those persons who are infected with or affected by
					 the virus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the general public, increased awareness of
					 hepatitis C will help create an environment that is supportive of people
					 infected with or affected by this disease.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For persons who are unaware that they are infected,
					 early diagnosis offers the possibility of adapting their lifestyle to slow the
					 progression of the disease. As well, there are promising developments in
					 treatment options.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hepatitis C program includes care and treatment
					 support. This component is aimed at raising hepatitis C awareness by making the
					 public better informed about the disease and the risk factors associated with
					 it. During its first two years of existence, the program was aimed mainly at
					 increasing capabilities and developing tools for professionals and other care
					 givers as well as community support groups by providing medical and practical
					 information on hepatitis C.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevention and community support are also part of the
					 hepatitis C prevention, support and research program. Community support
					 includes programs aimed at supporting both a strong community response to the
					 needs of people with or living with hepatitis C, and a significant role for
					 community organizations in the program .</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past year and a half, Health Canada has
					 financed about 120 community initiatives at the local level, including peer
					 support, hepatitis C education, needs assessments, training and strengthening
					 of community capabilities.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the current hepatitis C national initiatives,
					 there is the establishment at the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse of a
					 database on hepatitis C and injectable drugs; the preparation of a series of
					 working and research papers on topics such as injectable drug use and
					 prevention of hepatitis C.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research component of the program has increased the
					 amount of available research results, bolstered the research community
					 capabilities, and added a wealth of information to the data used to make
					 decisions regarding hepatitis C policies and programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This component has financed 27 research projects and 11
					 research and salary awards through the Canadian Institutes for Health Research,
					 and has contributed to the financing of a research chair on liver disease at
					 the University of Manitoba Health Sciences Centre Foundation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several projects have been financed including HCV-HIV
					 co-infection assessments, the establishment of social networks for injectable
					 drug users as well as a review of the literature on animal models.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In co-operation with the blood borne pathogens division
					 of Health Canada, the research on hepatitis C component has financed better
					 monitoring sites, control of VHC, studies on the economic burden of VHC, and on
					 its prevalence in first nation people and Inuit in four communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In partnership with the bureau of HIV/AIDS, STD and TB,
					 the program has financed research on VHC and the young aboriginals on the
					 street.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the research component has contributed to the
					 creation of the Canadian network on viral hepatitis. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the hepatitis C prevention,
					 support and research program is a constant reminder that the Government of
					 Canada is looking after problems such as those raised in the hon. member's
					 motion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Health Canada supported the proclamation
					 by the Canadian Liver Foundation of the month of March as the Help Fight Liver
					 Disease Month. The hepatitis C virus can cause serious liver diseases.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Canada has been one of the main proponents of
					 the first Canadian conference on hepatitis C, held in Montreal in May 2001.
					 This event has been a convergence point for researchers on hepatitis C,
					 caregivers for those affected by hepatitis C and people infected by the virus
					 or affected by the disease.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This instructive conference was an opportunity to
					 present research results, to share ideas, and to update one's knowledge. The
					 Canadian Hemophilia Society, the Hepatitis C Society of Canada, the Canadian
					 Liver Foundation and other not for profit organizations have co-operated with
					 Health Canada so that this conference would be beneficial for all
					 Canadians.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to use this opportunity to raise
					 with my colleagues something that has troubled me concerning the Library of
					 Parliament, a tool that is essential to us. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had raised the question with the member for Ottawa
					 West--Nepean as the spokesperson for the Board of Internal Economy back in May
					 and requested an opportunity to respond to the question because I was not
					 satisfied. I will break this into two parts, the issue itself and then the
					 matter of accountability and the difficulty I and other colleagues will find
					 ourselves in in trying to make the library accountable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty is that the Library of Parliament issued
					 a request for proposal for a news gathering service. One company that wanted to
					 respond to the request for proposal uses a different system than the system
					 that was specified in the request for proposal. It tried to get the library to
					 correct that by calling for a generic system as opposed to a specific system on
					 which the computer system was based. The library proceeded
					 nonetheless.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company appealed to the Canadian International
					 Trade Tribunal. Through a series of protracted discussions and so forth, at the
					 end of the day, the tribunal ruled that the library was in error, that the
					 library had to correct its request for proposal or start over. This was a
					 rather lengthy effort. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The library concluded by saying it was cancelling the
					 request, that it did not need the service any more because it had fixed the
					 problem. This begs the question as to why it was not fixed in the first place.
					 The response it gave for cancelling the request for proposal and not issuing
					 another one as per the CITT ruling was that it had used up all its money in
					 defending itself at the CITT.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a problem with that. This was not a one year
					 project; it was an ongoing one. Perhaps it could have delayed it, as I hope is
					 the intent of the Library of Parliament, but not cancelled it outright, never
					 to revisit it and never call for a proposal for implementing the system that
					 might be required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some problems with the rationale the Library of
					 Parliament is using. The biggest problem I have is the total lack of
					 accountability of the Library of Parliament to the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Library of Parliament is accountable to the
					 Speakers, the Speaker of the House and the Speaker in the Senate, yet members
					 in the House cannot ask questions of the Speaker. We have to go to the Board of
					 Internal Economy, yet we are told that the Board of Internal Economy is not
					 responsible for the Library of Parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, I managed to ask a question of the representative
					 of the Board of Internal Economy in the House on the basis that the library
					 offers services to the members, I am not sure that the Speaker would again
					 allow me to do that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot ask a question of the Speaker. The library is
					 not accountable to the Board of Internal Economy. The joint Senate and House of
					 Commons committee on the library has not met. It has not even been struck.
					 Therefore, I cannot ask a question of the chair of that committee in the House.
					 There is no accountability. We are now almost into November. We have been
					 sitting for a month and a half now and that committee has yet to be
					 struck.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point the rules of the House are going to have
					 to be changed so that the Library of Parliament is accountable to the members
					 of the House. Then we can get information about the library without having to
					 go through the hoops and a system that does not seem to work.</p>

					 West—Nepean, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, as I said in my answer of May 30, the
					 Board of Internal Economy does not normally deal with issues relating to the
					 Library of Parliament. However, in the hope of clarifying this issue, I am
					 pleased to have this opportunity to respond, on behalf of the board, to the
					 member's question. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 30, 2001, the hon. member for Ottawa--Vanier
					 raised the question concerning a request for proposal, which in fact is a call
					 for tender, issued by the Library of Parliament for an electronic news
					 monitoring service and which had been referred to the Canadian International
					 Trade Tribunal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P&amp;L Communications filed a complaint with the trade
					 tribunal related to the library's procurement process, arguing that the library
					 was subject to the agreement on internal trade and was therefore subject to the
					 authority of the tribunal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the library's original deadline for the filing of
					 proposals for the tender was June 1, it appeared unlikely that the trade
					 tribunal would hear the case prior to the deadline. Therefore, at the request
					 of an hon. member, the co-chair of the Standing Committee of the Library of
					 Parliament, the parliamentary library agreed to extend the bid until June 31,
					 2001.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several exchanges of arguments by the parties, on
					 July 24, 2001, the tribunal informed the Library of Parliament that it had
					 ruled in favour of P&amp;L Communications and that it would issue its reasons
					 for the determination at a later date.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the library's legal adviser and pursuant
					 to the CITT act, the library had the obligation to inform the tribunal of its
					 response to its decision on or before the deadline of August 13,
					 2001.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of this situation and based on an article of
					 the library's request for tender, which stipulates that the Library of
					 Parliament may at its discretion cancel and/or re-issue this RFP at any time,
					 the library decided to cancel the request for proposal immediately to ensure
					 that it would respect the reasons for determination of the tribunal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision by the library was based on the following
					 reasons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as a result of the tribunal's decision the
					 library had incurred legal costs. It was required to pay both the petitioner's
					 and its own legal costs and, therefore, had insufficient budget to proceed with
					 the project.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, since the request for proposal was posted the
					 library has been able, with the technical assistance of the information
					 services directorate of the House of Commons, to make improvements to the
					 existing electronic news monitoring service, allowing the library to maintain
					 these services for the foreseeable future.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a memo dated September 25 and addressed to both
					 chairs and to the members of the Standing Joint Committee on the Library of
					 Parliament, the parliamentary librarian said that the library never intended to
					 defy the tribunal. He also said that all parliamentarians could be assured
					 that, from now on, requests for proposals from the Library of Parliament would
					 comply with procurement rules. </p>


	<A NAME="Int-61958"></A><a HREF="#Int-61960"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-61955"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I find this answer very weak since the
					 fact that the Library of Parliament is accountable to this House was not even
					 mentioned. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a situation where the Library of Parliament
					 serving members is totally unaccountable to the members of the House. We have
					 no access to the library. We cannot ask questions of anyone speaking on behalf
					 of the library in the House and the committee that is supposed to be overseeing
					 it has not even been struck.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would implore the chief government whip to make sure
					 that the committee is struck as rapidly as possible because there is throughout
					 this whole issue a sense of lack of respect for the members of the House by the
					 library.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to get to the bottom of it. Why would they not
					 have fixed the problem? Twice they requested proposals and twice they
					 cancelled. Twice they were wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this mess, if I can call it that, has to be
					 investigated by the committee which has not been struck. At the very least, the
					 government should get on with striking the committee so that it can do its
					 work.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I can only point out that the government
					 is not responsible for the operation of parliament, but I believe the member
					 has raised an important question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a question, frankly, that he raised in his
					 original question in the House. The library committee will be having its first
					 meeting later this week. It was delayed simply because the person proposed to
					 be nominated as chair of the library committee was not in the country for the
					 last couple of weeks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee will be meeting. I suggest very strongly
					 that the member take his concerns there and that he encourage the committee, as
					 I will do personally, to pursue this matter.</p>
