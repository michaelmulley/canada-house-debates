	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
learning is a life long process and in a rapidly changing world 
our vision of learning must be constantly changing and 
evolving. I am proud to say that the city of London is developing 
into a learning community.
<P>
	The London Investment and Education Council is a 
non-profit community based group committed to bringing 
together students, business, labour, government, families and 
social and cultural organizations to plan initiatives and share 
information related to education.
<P>
	The federal government recognizes that learning is a life long 
process and encourages all sectors of our community to become 
involved in the learning process. London truly is a learning 
community, thanks to the innovative work of the London 
Investment and Education Council.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last Saturday, 
the Minister of Finance said in an interview published in <I>Le 
Soleil</I> that everything to reduce the deficit was on the table. In 
other words, the minister is simply ignoring the commitment 
made by the Prime Minister in the last election campaign that he 
would not raise taxes. On the expenditure side, the minister tries 
to justify additional cuts in social programs that might total $7.5 
billion, arguing that everyone would have to do his or her share.
<P>
	Instead of targeting the needy, the unemployed and the middle 
class, I suggest the minister take a good look at the 
government's operational expenditures, subsidies to 
corporations, Defence spending and duplication, and ensure that 
taxpayers who live on high incomes are the first in line to pay 
their fair share of taxes.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, police sources state the hub of Asian organized crime 
for the world will be situated in Vancouver and Vancouver Island 
by the turn of the decade. This statement has been acknowledged 
in part by the Solicitor General who recently supported the 
deployment of extra drug enforcement officers to Nanaimo.
<P>
	The situation requires more than just extra police. The 
government must get serious about reforming and strengthening 
legislation in the areas of immigration, customs, justice, 
fisheries and human resources development.
<P>
	The Reform Party recognizes the need for these changes. In 
my riding I have already started bringing together concerned 
members of the immigrant population with municipal, 
provincial and federal authorities to look at ways to make the 
system work for all Canadians. Next week I will continue the 
process and will report the results of this truly grassroots 
consultation process back to the House.

	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, hon. members 
opposite often suggest that the views of Canadians are not taken 
seriously by the government. I want to tell my hon. friends that 
they are wrong.
<P>
	Some of the suggestions made last April by my constituents 
appear in the discussion paper the Minister of Human Resources 
Development tabled in the House on October 5.
<P>
	Oxford recommendations in this paper include: first, 
programs should be result oriented, with the emphasis on ending 
dependency.
<P>
	Second, while everyone should pay into unemployment 
insurance, it should be structured more like private insurance so 
that those in higher risk areas of employment pay higher 
premiums. Third, to help those on welfare become independent 
the govern-

ment should subsidize those who choose to take low paying 
positions rather than remain at home.

seriously by the minister and that they are now being discussed 
across Canada.

Speaker, next week on November 11 members of the House will 
join with thousands of Canadians to pay tribute to those who 
fought and died so that we might enjoy democracy and freedom: 
freedom to hold democratic elections and the freedom to voice 
concern.
<P>
	This year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of the second 
world war. It is a time to show that Canada remembers. Let us 
join with all Canadians on November 11 to renew our pledge to 
the many Canadians who fought and fell in battle.
<P>
	Let us also remember the sacrifices and efforts made by those 
at home. It is through the efforts of these people that we have 
been able to build Canada into a country deemed the best in the 
world in which to live.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to bring to the attention of all Canadians that 
November 1 to 7 is Pharmacy Awareness Week.
<P>
	The theme of the week is: ``Talk to me, your pharmacist, your 
friend''. The purpose of the week is to encourage 
communication between pharmacists and their patients. This 
week recognizes the important role that pharmacists play in 
health care, and in particular medication use.
<P>
	During Pharmacy Awareness Week pharmacists across the 
country will be demonstrating their commitment to close the 
information gap on the safe use of medications.

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, by not 
dismissing out of hand the recommendations of the SECOR 
report on the future of cultural industries, the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage knowingly supports the abolition of the NFB.
<P>
	NFB productions are well received and win many prizes 
internationally. The minister does not seem to realize that 
closing the NFB would mean shutting down the production of 
documentaries and animated films.
<P>
	How many artists and technicians have been able to benefit 
from this institution's training programs? Does the minister 
really understand the impact that NFB productions have on our 
cultural life?
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage is obviously no longer 
competent to defend the interests of cultural institutions. The 
industry can do without friends like these.

Minister of Finance realizes he is over budget and will have to 
make deep cuts. The human resources development minister 
will also be making some cuts.
<P>
	Now we find that Canadians are paying some $24,000 for the 
commissioner of official languages to drive back and forth 
between his two residences in a chauffeured limousine because 
he does not want to relocate from Montreal to Ottawa.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance likes to give us the impression that he 
is attacking the deficit but now we find this example of 
scandalous spending. Canadians are outraged when they learn of 
this type of spending. How could the government dream of 
paying $15,800 for his apartment, $5,160 for his meals, and 
$3,000 for incidental expenses?
<P>
	I call on the Minister of Finance to stamp out this spending. 
Let us hope that the commissioner is paying taxes on his benefits 
as are all other taxpayers.

being announced today in Toronto between the National 
Basketball Association and the stay in school program by my 
hon. colleagues, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
and the Secretary of State for Youth and Training.
<P>
	The stay in school initiative has become a community success 
story. The program encourages young people who are at risk of 
dropping out to stay in school longer and complete high school.
<P>
	Significant gains have been made in expanding knowledge, 
action, collaboration, and moral obligation among Canadians to 
find solutions to the disturbing high school dropout problem.

in my riding of Erie.
<P>
	Service Kanada, an initiative of the Secretary of State for 
Training and Youth, brings 19 to 24 year olds and non-profit 
organizations together to provide labour for needed projects 
while offering the participants training and the opportunity to 
live in another community while learning another language.
<P>
	Participants are paid $2 daily and will receive a $1,000 grant 
at the end of their six-month stint. Food and lodging are 
provided by Service Kanada.
<P>
	There are four objectives for the participants: performance of 
valued work for the community, acquiring personal work skills, 
achieving an awareness of our environment, and learning a 
second language.
<P>
	These energetic volunteers, these young adults of today from 
Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick will be the leaders of a

Mr. Speaker, yesterday I had the great honour of visiting Rideau 
Hall for the presentation of the first ever National Entrepreneur 
of the Year Award by His Excellency the Governor General of 
Canada.
<P>
	In particular I wish to single out one of the nine recipients, 
Mr. John Bragg, president of Oxford Frozen Foods Ltd., Oxford, 
Nova Scotia. John Bragg founded his company in rural Nova 
Scotia processing wild blueberries in a single plant. Today he 
has four processing plants and has capacity to process 1.9 
million pounds of blueberries per day as well as other frozen 
foods. In peak season John Bragg employs 3,000 people 
throughout his diversified companies.

recipients whose gross sales total more than $2 billion annually. 
The government is very proud of our entrepreneurs, the role 
models for all Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the co-chairman of the Special Joint Committee on Canada's 
Defence Policy is quoted today in <I>La Presse</I> as saying that this 
department exists solely to show our solidarity with the rest of 
the planet.
<P>
	In the report that came out Monday, he defended the idea of 
acquiring new equipment, the purpose of which would be to 
enable Canada to defend, at great expense, its territorial 
sovereignty.
<P>
	It would certainly take mental gymnastics to be able to see 
how buying tanks, not to mention submarines, is a way of 
expressing solidarity with the planet. On the contrary, it merely 
confirms the militaristic doctrine that pervades the report.
<P>
	My advice to the co-chairman is that he would do better to 
strengthen his solidarity with Quebec, which is in great need of 
support, particularly his, if it is to hang on to what little it 
receives from the Department of National Defence, the Liberal 
Party notwithstanding.

National Film Board of Canada's mandate is to produce and 
distribute films for Canadian audiences and foreign markets, to 
enhance knowledge of Canadian social and cultural realities and 
in so doing contribute to the development of a flourishing film 
industry.
<P>
	The National Film Board receives over $80 million from 
taxpayers. I would like to outline for the House where some of 
those dollars are going. A film board promotion for a video says: 
``Compelling, often hilarious and always rebellious, the 10 
women discuss lesbian sexuality and survival in Canada during 
the fifties and the sixties. This video brings lesbian history out 
of the closet and contributes to the viable history of sexuality in 
Canada''. It also states: ``Due to the explicit nature of certain 
scenes, viewer discretion is advised''.
<P>
	This is another example of hard earned tax dollars at work 
enhancing Canadian social and cultural realities.

	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, four 
times a year, the House of Commons meets the cost of 
publishing a householder prepared by each member of 
Parliament to keep their constituents informed.
<P>
	In his latest householder, a Bloc member published a letter 
under the heading ``Changes required at the CECM''. In this 
letter, the member argued the need for a school that meets 
modern-day needs and one with a resolutely forward-looking 
curriculum, adding that in the current debate, only MEMO 
offered such a perspective.
<P>
	I must admit that, on the surface, the connection between the 
member's mandate and school board elections is not obvious. 
However, we are not naive enough to believe that this statement 
has nothing to do with the fact that the member's spouse is a 
MEMO candidate in ward No. 9 in Montreal.

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, here is 
something I would like the ministers of agriculture, transport 
and finance to think about before they discontinue the so-called 
Crow benefit.
<P>
	In my region the benefit is worth between $22 and $28 per 
tonne. We grow about one tonne of crop per acre and good land 
rents between $20 and $30 per acre.
<P>
	If the benefit disappears and freight costs rise by a like 
amount, the cash rental value of those lands becomes zero. The 
financial effect on the region is to further deflate farm land 
values by several hundred dollars per acre. This equity, which 
will disappear with the decline and demise of the Crow benefit, 
is what farmers and their communities have been using as 
collateral to borrow funds for economic diversity.
<P>
	The proposal to save some $600 million per year will take 
billions of dollars worth of value and equity from existing farms 
and businesses in western Canada and will trigger further 
bankruptcies and business failures.

Mr. Speaker, when it comes to CIDA and our foreign aid

<P>
	Since 1991 the Canadian Wilderness Committee has received 
around $300,000 from CIDA. The Sierra Club of Western 
Canada and the Clayoquot Biosphere Project have also received 
CIDA funding.
<P>
	To my best recollection, British Columbia is still a part of this 
great nation. Why then is nearly half a million dollars being 
misspent to bolster the efforts of anti-logging radicals?
<P>
	This is blatant interference in British Columbia's jurisdiction 
over its natural resources. B.C. is battling to maintain the 
considerable lumber exports in the face of a concerted campaign 
of disinformation by these very groups.
<P>
	We are neck deep in debt. What little foreign aid we can afford 
should go to those most in need. The federal government, which 
has not shown any great competence in managing natural 
resources, has no business interfering in provincial concerns.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the ethics counsellor, Howard Wilson, said on 
television this morning that at no time did he receive from the 
Prime Minister or his colleagues the mandate to investigate the 
heritage minister's direct interference in the CRTC's business.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Does he confirm what 
his counsellor said?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all the facts relating to this issue were clearly put on the 
table; these are public documents available to all. The 
counsellor, Mr. Wilson, is aware of the facts, but he does not 
need to investigate. All the facts are public knowledge and have 
been discussed in this House for several days.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, are we to understand that the Prime Minister 
deliberately neglected to ask his ethics counsellor to investigate 
last week because he did not want to have to justify the decision 
to overlook this matter which he had made a month earlier when 
he was informed of his minister's mistake?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7555"> 7555 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we told the House of Commons and the public 
everything that happened in this affair and, as I said several 
times, the minister in question realized that his letter was 
interpreted as support. He immediately took action to correct the 
situation and we accepted this explanation. Then I personally 
took the initiative of asking all ministers to search their files to 
see if there was anything in them concerning the 
Radio-Television Commission, which itself asks for public 
opinion before rendering its decisions. Several members have 
written to this commission and several ministers wrote as they 
did when they were backbenchers. I asked Mr. Wilson to clarify 
the directives on this subject. I have had conversations with him 
and I hope that the new directives will be ready within a few 
weeks.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, </B><B>BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the Prime Minister if he thinks that his 
minister again showed his lack of judgement yesterday when he 
said that he felt more and more at ease, although four of the 
largest newspapers in Canada and Quebec are calling for his 
resignation.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister, who has shown the virtue of 
forgiveness, not consider the penitent to lack firm resolve and to 
be insufficiently remorseful?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Lord in Heaven decides whether someone has firm 
resolve, not I.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. We learned 
that government ethics counsellor, Howard Wilson, was 
disciplined in 1992 for awarding almost $1 million worth of 
contracts without tender. His signing authority was suspended 
by the Deputy Minister of Industry after the Auditor General 
intervened.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister think that the government's 
ethics counsellor still has the credibility needed to occupy his 
position, whose incumbent must be above suspicion?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there was an investigation on this matter and Mr. 
Wilson's signing authority was reinstated. All I know about this 
man is that he is honest, competent and very open. He readily 
makes himself available to the media and, under circumstances 
like these, he gave interviews.
<P>
	Before appointing him, I asked both the Leader of the 
Opposition and the leader of the Reform Party for their opinion 
on his ability to perform these duties; they both agreed with me 
that he was an honourable man and that he could do an excellent 
job.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, need I remind the Prime Minister that Mr. Wilson 
himself admitted that he had not informed the Prime Minister of 
his situation before being appointed ethics counsellor in June, 
thus making it  impossible for the Leader of the Opposition and 
the leader of the third party to find out about the situation which 
Mr. Wilson was involved in.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister continue to trust Mr. Wilson, who 
hid his suspension when his first duty was to inform the Prime 
Minister of his background at the time of his appointment?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the man in question was not suspended. He kept his 
position. It was an administrative matter as to whether he had 
authority or whether he should keep it. It was found appropriate 
to give him back the authority he had before.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last Thursday, October 27, the Prime Minister said 
regarding the heritage minister affair: ``I consulted the 
government's ethics counsellor and confirmed that I had made 
the right decision in this matter''. On Friday in the House he 
said: ``I did not speak to Mr. Wilson myself but I asked that he be 
consulted''. Today we find out that in fact no one, neither the 
Prime Minister nor his staff, asked the ethics counsellor to rule 
specifically on the heritage minister's letter to the CRTC.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor's revelations on national television this 
morning contradict every version of events that the Prime 
Minister has given us. I ask the Prime Minister: How does he 
explain his previous comments to the House?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I explained clearly that I had asked people to call the 
ethics counsellor and they called him. He gave me an opinion 
that did not lead me to change my mind.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party should know that whatever 
advice a minister or a Prime Minister receives, that advice is for 
him or her. As I said, he is the one who takes full responsibility 
for the decision. I cannot get up in the House and say to 
somebody here: ``I made that decision because somebody told 
me to do that''. That is not the way it works. The Prime Minister 
is the one who is fully responsible. I am fully responsible for the 
decision I have made and I will stand by it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are asking the Prime Minister to accept 
responsibility for comments that he made to the House.
<P>
	The Prime Minister clearly declared that the ethics counsellor 
had been consulted and said nothing that changed the Prime 
Minister's mind about his decision to retain the heritage 
minister. In fact, the ethics counsellor was not asked to give a 
ruling on that matter so how could he have provided advice to 
the Prime Minister on that subject?
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="7556"> 7556 </A></B>
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister explain this contradiction between 
his own comments and the comments of the ethics counsellor?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to say that we seek advice. The ruling is 
the decision of the Prime Minister and this Prime Minister 
makes decisions. He was not called upon to rule. He has no right 
to rule. I have the right to rule and I made a decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this whole affair from the letter writing to the Prime 
Minister's comments is either an example of gross stupidity or 
unethical conduct, or both.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are getting very close to language that is 
not acceptable. I wonder if I could ask the hon. leader of the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, this whole affair is either an 
example of a grave error in judgment or unethical conduct, or 
both.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for changing his 
wording on the first part. I would invite him to do the same on 
the second part.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, this whole affair is either an 
example of a gross error in judgment or in conduct unbecoming 
to a minister or a Prime Minister, or both. It has also made a 
mockery of the office of the ethics counsellor.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister allow the ethics counsellor to report 
directly to Parliament on the conduct of the Prime Minister's 
own office in this affair?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am responsible to the people of Canada.
<P>
	I appreciate the frustration of the leader of the Reform Party. 
He and his party are out fishing and catching no fish. That is 
their problem. However I do not want to get mad.
<P>
	When the member for Beaver River yesterday made an 
accusation in relation to me she forgot to tell the nation in the 
accusation she made in the House today that the judge 
apologized to me and the <I>Globe and Mail</I> apologized to me. Not

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Human Resources Development. On 
Monday, we were stunned to learn that a young man who is 
unemployed was threatened with losing his UI benefits because 
he intends to participate in the job-search program set up by 
Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi. This is an agency whose federal  
contribution was just cut and which has now been taken over by 
the Quebec government and the city of Gatineau.
<P>
	How can the minister justify such blackmail on the part of his 
civil servants when young jobless people want to use the 
services provided by Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi to improve 
their lot?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a judgment by 
employment counsellors as to the advice they give to clients of 
our employment centres as to the services that can be provided.
<P>
	In this particular case, the employment counsellor referred 
the young man in question to the project La Relance. It has an 
almost 75 per cent success rate in ensuring that employment is 
gained under these circumstances.
<P>
	We believe very strongly that we have to ensure there is 
discussion and decision making at the local level. Therefore that 
kind of authority is given to local employment counsellors. I am 
sure when they make a judgment that a reference to the group 
Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi is appropriate and helpful they will 
make references to that group as well.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	It is a little strange that a member of Parliament in this case is 
second guessing the judgment of an employment counsellor 
when he was not there. He does not know the case and he does 
not know the individual. It is up to the employment counsellor 
who is dealing with the case individually to make the best 
judgment that can be made.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the

other, at the expense of the unemployed?

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure exactly what 
question the hon. member has.
<P>
	I would like to point out to him that in the case of the 
Carrefour Jeunesse the federal government provides an annual 
contribution of $550,000 which compares with the $100,000 
from the province of Quebec. It would seem to me that we are 
doing our proper job in contributing to help the unemployed in

<P>
	I will read the Prime Minister a quote from pages 23 and 24 of 
that document:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Parliament has gone to special lengths to protect the independent mandate 
and powers of certain other agencies such as granting bodies or tribunals. You 
are advised to take very special care to avoid intervening, or appearing to 
intervene in cases under consideration by quasi-judicial bodies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In light of this, will the Prime Minister do the only honourable 
thing that is available and ask the heritage minister to resign?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have asked the minister to be careful but there is no 
accompanying prohibition for ministers. We have tabled in the 
House some letters by ministers in support of cases from their 
constituents. We have debated in the House the problem of 
members of Parliament who become ministers remaining 
members of Parliament in our system.
<P>
	I have asked the ethics counsellor to work on some guidelines 
so that members who are ministers can serve their constituents 
at the same time as serving the government. The guidelines will 
be ready in a couple of weeks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
these guidelines are absolutely clear.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister's version of responsibility that he has no 
responsibility for his own guidelines, no responsibility for his 
ministers, no responsibility for his own statements? Is it the 
Mulroney version of responsibility: ``to heck with the facts, I 
will wait until the next election''? Is that his version of 
responsibility?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are looking at the next election anxiously because a 
lot of you guys will not be there.
<P>
	We have been in government for a year and Canadians are 
quite happy with the government. Never has the confidence in 
the nation been as high as it is today. We have growth in the 
economy and the mood of the country is very good. I can see why 
the Reform Party is going fishing when it dropped in the polls

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	The federal government's decision, as a result of which 
unemployment insurance benefits may be cut off to young 
people who do not use the services of La Relance, a centre 
subsidized by the federal government, is starting to look like 
some kind of retaliation or tit for tat, just because the 
Government of Quebec and the City of Gatineau have decided to 
support Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that by supporting La Relance as 
opposed to Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi, his public servants are 
contradicting the very essence of the minister's social security 
reform, which includes substantial flexibility in the way young 
people will be helped?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have just explained, 
the federal government funds the Carrefour Jeunesse to the tune 
of $550,000.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	It shows that there is a very clear commitment to that 
organization to conduct a variety of services. At the same time 
we made it very clear that the judgment of the employment 
counsellor as to what is the best reference and the best service 
should be left to that counsellor and not be second guessed here 
in the House of Commons.
<P>
	We are not cutting the UI benefits to the young man. That is a 
false statement. The hon. member should withdraw that 
statement. It is simply not a fact. He should recognize that we 
have many good public servants working in the province of 
Quebec giving major help to a lot of young people. They should 
not be second guessed by the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we do not deny the competence of the employment 
counsellors, but we do deny that the federal government has 
jurisdiction over manpower training.
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that this is just one more pitiful 
example of the federal system's failure to function where 
manpower training is concerned, which merely strengthens the 
broad consensus that exists in Quebec in this respect?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's 
statement is really not logical, nor does it make much sense.
<P>
	The presence of the federal government is through the people 
we have as our public servants who represent the federal 
government who are doing an effective job in giving good 
advice. In this specific case, as I just stated, we provide funding 
of over half a million dollars to the Carrefour Jeunesse. We have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7558"> 7558 </A></B>
<P>
also provided funding for  projet La Relance, but we have made 
some division of responsibility so that we can get more 
efficiency and more effectiveness out of it. That was a choice 
that was made very much within the local region.
<P>
	I believe that trying to turn this into some kind of great 
abstract argument of the role of the federal government in 
Quebec simply makes no sense at all. The federal government, 
as the member well knows, is highly committed to the 
employment of people in Quebec because we are doing 
something about it. That is why we have created close to 
100,000 jobs in that province in the past 11 months.

	Can the Prime Minister explain why the ethics counsellor was 
set up to be the fall guy for providing bad advice when his advice 
was not even sought?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

ethics counsellor. I said to the House that I have consulted a lot 
of people in my life. I know one thing. At the end of the day, I am 
responsible. There is no fall guy in this. We have debated that. 
We went a long way. I have asked every cabinet minister to look 
over the files and to say whether they have written letters. It is an 
open process. These documents were public at any time.
<P>
	If the Reform Party is so smart, why did it not go to the CRTC? 
These documents were public. Those members did not do their 
job. We had to tell them what the facts were. We were not trying 
to have a set up person.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister says they talked to the ethics counsellor.
<P>
	Did the ethics counsellor talk to the government? The Prime 
Minister indicated to us that the ethics counsellor had advised 
him on the minister's letter and the ethics counsellor says that 
this is simply not the case.
<P>
	This morning he said no, and that is clear. The question of 
course is: What part of no does the Prime Minister not

this contradiction in his integrity and apologize for breaching 
the trust of the Canadian public?

older workers who are laid off. But the paper contains no 
concrete proposal, and does not even make reference to POWA.

this program in his reform? How does he explain this?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member would 
read chapter 2 of the green book, he would recognize the entire 
chapter is devoted to the question of how we can take resources 
of the federal government, provincial governments and the 
private sector and redirect them toward proper training, job core 
development, literacy programs and community based 
employment through a strategy that would help older workers, 
young people, workers who need adjustment.
<P>
	The chapter is devoted to how we basically can improve the 
entire system of employment development services.
<P>
	It would seem to me that the hon. member should be able to 
read the entire chapter and come to the conclusion that it is a 
brand new philosophy and direction by giving a lot more local 
control, a lot more responsibility to the people to make 
decisions about how they get re-employed.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

are simply not true. The fact of the matter is that in the province 
of Quebec we have approved, in conjunction with the provincial 
government, because it is a joint federal-provincial program, 65 
per cent of the applications we have received. I think the 
expenditure represents almost 45 per cent of the entire POWA 
expenditure in that province alone. It has been a very important 
program.
<P>
	I do agree with the hon. member in one area. It is an awkward 
program to run. I am quite prepared to talk with the provinces 
about how we can improve the program and how we can, as I said 
in my earlier statement, use many of the existing programs to 
consolidate into broad based employment services so we can 
then direct resources to those groups that need it most, and they 
can help make the choices to put their own signature on their

	Considering that only 13 per cent of Canadian defence 
infrastructure is located in Quebec, while Quebecers meet 
approximately 25 per cent of Canadian defence expenditures, 
can the minister undertake to take into account this imbalance 
that is unfavourable to Quebec before making any cuts

<P>
[<I>English</I>]

	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

is that the Bloc Quebecois advocates defence spending be 
reduced in Canada and Quebec of course as part of Canada by 25 
per cent.

all sorts of people. Members of Parliament, ministers, 
everybody can consult him before doing something. These are 
private conversations, for example, with any member of

there to give advice but he does not have to report on every case. 
He gives advice to people. He gave advice to me.

	He gave me advice and he gave advice to other people. It is up 
to the person who received the advice to keep it or not, but at the 
end of the day the decision is made by the minister or by the 
Prime Minister. In this case it is me and I am not afraid to take 
my responsibility.

	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	The minister is aware of the situation in the harbour adjacent 
to Massena, New York. Many seaway residents are worried 
about the environmental damage which could be caused if the 
safety measures taken do not control the PCB laden silt which 
will be stirred up as a result of the proposed dredging.
<P>
	I realize that the minister has stopped the dredging for now. 
What guarantee can the minister give that she will not allow 
resumption of any more dredging in the St. Lawrence near 
Massena until it is proven absolutely safe for the people and the 
environment in that area?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we did announce 
jointly yesterday with the Environmental Protection Agency of 
the United States that there will be no dredging at Massena this 
year. I can further assure the House that there will be no 
dredging unless and until the Department of the Environment 
and myself as minister are satisfied that there is absolutely no 
risk to the health of Canadians.
<P>
	There is no dredging this year. If there is any operation next 
spring, and I want to thank the EPA and General Motors for their 
co-operation and their assurances, no dredging will take place 
where there is any risk of any PCB contamination.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is addressed to the Minister of Transport. Early last 
October as speaker at a dinner sponsored by the western 
transportation advisory committee, the Minister of Transport 
made the following comment: ``Railway labour with grade eight 
or nine education cannot be blamed for negotiating excessive 
collective agreements''.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that his remarks were an insult to the 
62,000 rail workers in Canada and is he prepared to make a 
public apology for his unacceptable and scornful comments?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for that question because it 
provides me with an opportunity to explain to him and to the 
House exactly what was said.
<P>
	I am from northern New Brunswick. From the time I was a kid 
I have dealt with railroad workers. I know who negotiated the 
contracts. I have listened to the stories of the people who 
returned from the war and had to negotiate contracts with the 
railway barons in the country.
<P>
	What I said that night in Winnipeg was that never, no matter 
how much pressure is exerted on the Minister of Transport, will 
I ever point a finger at those men who worked very hard with 
very limited educations to find a way to negotiate collective 
agreements to protect their rights and to protect the rights of 
others who worked on railroads in the country.
<P>
	I said that government had to take its responsibilities and 
management had to take its responsibilities. I did say, Mr. 
Speaker, because it was the truth-I remember Bill Dunn telling 
me exactly this in Tracadie in 1950-that it was very difficult 
for people with grade eight and grade nine educations to sit with 
people who were educated and who were in the pay of the 
railroads of the country and try to negotiate collective 
agreements to protect their rights.
<P>
	I said then I would never attack the men who achieved that and 
I will not now because they did what they had to do to protect 
their rights.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, day after day we receive more copies of ethical 
guidelines for cabinet ministers. None of them appear to be 
unclear. None of them are contradictory. In fact, the current 
guidelines from the PCO insist there be no intervening by 
ministers with quasi-judicial bodies under their jurisdiction. 
The letter tabled said intervention on it.
<P>
	Now that the truth about guidelines has become obvious will 
the Prime Minister admit that he has offended Canadians by 
stripping his government of its integrity?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I made a speech on Monday and I explained the 
guidelines, the distinction between the two. I have asked 
everybody to table the letters and so on.
<P>
	I think the people of Canada think the members of the Reform 
Party are just trying to score some political points because they 
cannot attack the government on its economic policy. They 
cannot attack the government on the performance of the 
economy. They cannot attack the government because 
unemployment is down. They cannot attack the government 
because the mood of the country is much better than it was a year 
ago.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. On October 20, 1993, five 
days before the last federal election, the Prime Minister, then 
leader of the official opposition, wrote a letter to one of his 
caucus members.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7562"> 7562 </A></B>
<P>
	In this letter the Prime Minister stated that Canada requires a 
first rate transportation system that is able to serve every region. 
He also stated that the PC government's continued tolerance to 
rail line abandonment had done nothing to improve the 
situation. He stated that the Liberal Party, if elected, would 
clean up this mess.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Transport has stated that he cannot answer my 
call because he has 175 Liberal calls to answer first. In view of 
that fact, could the Prime Minister intercede and make sure that 
after December 15 the people in Saint John have a dayliner to 
Moncton instead of a bus as promised by the Minister of 
Transport?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can only say to the hon. member for Saint John, I have 
been into her beautiful city on at least four or five occasions to 
meet with people who have concerns about the transportation 
system there.
<P>
	I want to say to the hon. member that we are going to do 
everything we can to continue to provide services to Saint John 
and all other parts of the country. However, what we need to hear 
are some solutions and proposals that make a lot more sense than 
what was done over the last nine years by the party that she 
represents.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege.
<P>
	Yesterday in this Chamber the Deputy Prime Minister quoted 
from a letter I wrote to the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
regarding the concern of one of my constituents without my 
prior knowledge or permission or the prior knowledge or 
permission of my constituent.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in your deliberations as to whether what I raise 
today constitutes a prima facie question of privilege, I ask that 
you consider the following. Beauchesne's 6th edition, citation 
115 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A question of privilege must be brought to the attention of the House at the 
first possible opportunity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Because breaching the right of a member of Parliament is a 
serious matter, before taking it any further I undertook to obtain 
the transcript record of what transpired yesterday. I also 
undertook to consult the legal counsel of the House regarding 
what had occurred.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister and by making the aforesaid letter 
available to her the Minister of Canadian Heritage breached 
confidentiality and in so doing interfered with my ability to 
function as a member of Parliament.
<P>
	By breaching confidentiality the minister has called into 
question whether or not issues on which my constituents ask my 
assistance will be made public.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask you to find this to be a prima facie question 
of privilege. If you do so find, as is the usual practice of this 
House as described in Beauchesne's 6th edition, citation 118, I 
will move that this question of privilege be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all the letters were 
part of the public record of the CRTC.

was said yesterday and I will seek advice. I will do research on it 
and if necessary I will come back to the House with my decision 
at the earliest time.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> I have been getting the kind of exercise 
somebody else was referring to earlier only I have been getting 
more of it than I want.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will recall an argument I made to you earlier 
in this session. I argued that the NDP caucus should be entitled 
according to the mathematics of the opposition to at least a 
question and a supplementary and a statement each day. We have 
not come anywhere near that.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	This week we have only had two statements. I have to say that 
I think the treatment of the NDP caucus in this Parliament by 
you is abominable.

that according to the approximate proportion each party has that 
they get a chance to put questions. It is not always possible in

<P>
every Question Period to recognize everyone who stands in this 
House, although I must say in fairness that I have no difficulty 
seeing the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona.
<P>
	I would respectfully request that if the hon. member wishes to 
pursue this case I invite him of course to see me at any time at his 
convenience in my chambers. I would hope that the hon. 
member would be a little judicious in his comments toward the 
Chair.
<P>
	I will do the best I can to see to it that all members get fair 
treatment in this House as has been my want since I took this 
Chair. I will see if I can make improvements on my 
performance. I would surely urge all hon. members to seek to do 
the same thing in theirs.

hundreds of residents of my riding of Thunder Bay-Nipigon.
<P>
	The petitioners plead that the crimes committed on society by 
young offenders are on a serious uprise throughout all of Canada 
and that there are certain elements in the young people of our 
communities who have little or no respect for law and order and 
the protection of life of their fellow citizens. The petitioners 
abhor the lack of remorse or shame shown by many of the young 
offenders within our communities.
<P>
	The petitioners implore Parliament to review and revise our 
laws with respect to the Young Offenders Act by at least 
releasing the names and lowering the age to allow prosecution of 
the young offenders in this country to meet the severity of the 
crime.

which would tend to indicate societal approval of same sex

grounds of discrimination the undefined phrase of sexual

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present this afternoon, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36.
<P>
	The first petition is signed by a number of constituents of The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake, all members of the Ukrainian 
Catholic Women's Organization in The Battlefords.
<P>
	The petitioners draw the attention of the House to the 
following: Decriminalizing assisted suicide or legalizing 
euthanasia could lead to a reduction of patient-physician trust 
and respect, the degrading of the value of human life and the 
erosion of moral and ethical values. Palliative care is active and 
compassionate care which can relieve the pain and suffering of 
terminally ill persons and families without the dangers of 
suicide.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners pray that Parliament continue to 
reject euthanasia and physician assisted suicide in Canada and 
that the present provisions of section 241 of the Criminal Code 
of Canada which prohibits the counselling, procuring, aiding or 
abetting of a person to commit suicide be enforced rigorously, 
and that Parliament consider expanding palliative care that 
would be accessible to all dying persons in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the second petition is signed by a number of 
residents of various parts of Canada. The petition presented to 
me states that Canadians for several decades have been provided 
home delivery of their mail not by privatized post offices but by 
Canada Post post offices.
<P>
	Further, the recent introduction of supermailboxes has further 
reduced and eroded post office services that all Canadians have 
come to expect as a normal federal government service.
<P>
	Therefore the undersigned petitioners pray and call on 
Parliament to end privatized postal outlets and reinstate full 
postal services and products normally provided by Canada Post 
through sub post offices.

I hope higher priority on the political agenda.

signatures, the other has 75. They are signed largely by people 
from Peterborough riding but also from elsewhere in Ontario.
<P>
	These people petition Parliament stating that at the time of the 
Lakota-Chippewa native American Leonard Peltier's 
extradition from Canada to the U.S., the information provided 
surrounding Mr. Peltier's case was fabricated by U.S. 
authorities. Since that time new information has emerged that 
indicates that Leonard Peltier was not guilty of the crimes for 
which he has spent the last 18 years in prison.
<P>
	Therefore these petitioners request that Parliament hold an 
external review of the 1976 extradition hearing and that he be 
brought back to Canada for asylum.
<P>
	I would like to say the last time I presented one of these 
petitions I made the point that an internal review is already 
under way but I would stress that these petitioners want an 
external review.

it is a privilege for me to stand this afternoon to present two 
petitions.
<P>
	The first petition is signed by residents of my constituency of 
Regina-Lumsden, as well as the communities of Copper Sands 
and Pilot Butte in Saskatchewan. Pursuant to Standing Order 36, 
this petition is duly certified and states that whereas under  
section 745 of the Criminal Code of Canada convicted 
murderers sentenced to life imprisonment without chance of 
parole for 25 years are able to apply for review after 15 years and 
that the murder of a Canadian citizen is the most reprehensible 
crime, these petitioners request that Parliament repeal section 
745 of the Criminal Code of Canada.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the second petition I have to present today pertains to the Senate.
<P>
	The petitioners are from the constituency of 
Regina-Lumsden primarily. They believe that the Senate, 
being unelected and unaccountable, has become a home of 
recipients of Tory and Liberal patronage, and has been a 
discarded notion of a working body in the best interests of 
Canadian taxpayers over the past number of years. Because the 
Senate costs $54 million to $55 million per year to Canadian 
taxpayers, and that travel costs for senators alone are nearly $3 
million, these petitioners request, pray and beg the House of 
Commons, the Parliament of Canada and the Government of 
Canada to abolish the Senate.

the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in any way which 
would tend to indicate societal approval of same sex

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP)</B> moved:

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-50, in Clause 2, be amended by replacing lines 14 to19, on page 
4,with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``33.5 A deduction fixed by the Governor in Council shall apply at the same rate to 
all holders of certificates in the designated area.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
two amendments that we propose regarding Bill C-50, an Act to 
amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act, are cautionary measures. 
Indeed, some protection must be provided to agricultural 
producers.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to allow the Canadian Wheat Board 
to make deductions from wheat and barley producers' final 
payment cheques. The purpose of these deductions, or check 
offs, is to finance plant breeding research. Contributions will be 
made on a voluntary basis.
<P>
	Since the bill meets the expectations of western producers, we 
can only applaud this initiative which imparts a responsibility to 
agricultural producers. However, some provisions deserve a 
closer look and we should even be prepared to amend those if 
need be. This is the case with the provision concerning check 
offs for research.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	The initial provision provides that the Canadian Wheat Board 
shall, with the approval of the Governor in Council and at such 
rate as is fixed by him, make the deduction. The danger with this 
provision is that the Governor in Council may unnecessarily 
increase the deduction and reduce the federal government's own 
research budget, thus forcing producers to shoulder a heavier 
burden. In that case, agricultural producers would have to make 
a greater contribution to research funding.
<P>
	Based on the original rate, that is 40 cents on each tonne of 
barley sold and 20 cents on each ton of wheat sold, and based on 
the assumption that 90 per cent of farmers will voluntarily 
participate in this funding scheme to promote research and 
development, contributions should total $4.5 million.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7568"> 7568 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian government currently provides between $17.4 
and $17.5 million. Consequently, a total amount of about $22 
million could be allocated to research on wheat and barley in the 
four western provinces. Again, my fear is that cabinet might 
decide to increase farmers' payments and lower the federal 
government's contribution. Should that happen, farmers would 
have to fund a greater proportion of the research and 
development budget. I may recall that in a speech made here in 
the House, Eugene Whelan, a former Liberal Minister of 
Agriculture, who has made quite a name for himself throughout 
the world, said that there is a return of seven dollars on every 
dollar invested in research and development in the agricultural 
industry.
<P>
	The government should invest now in research and 
development, because no bank in Canada will give us a better 
return on our investment. The government could, of course, take 
advantage of this opportunity to cut its research budget as a 
deficit reduction measure, in the knowledge that it can tap the 
incomes of grain producers for the funding it needs.
<P>
	To preclude this possibility, we in the Bloc Quebecois suggest 
that the CWB conduct consultations with individuals and 
organizations that represent certificate holders so that the board 
itself can make recommendations on the rate of deduction to the 
Governor in Council, who would then consider such 
recommendations when the time comes to fix the rate as 
provided in subsection (1) of the Act. In addition to providing 
safeguards for producers, this would also benefit consumers 
who, in the end, have to pay, because if the producers have to 
spend more on research, consumer prices may very well be 
affected.
<P>
	This amendment will require genuine consultations with the 
principal parties, people in the industry who are in the best 
position to know what a reasonable deduction would be and what 
our research and development needs are. In any case, I may 
remind the House that farm producers in the four Western 
provinces are entirely free to say yes or no to this voluntary 
deduction, which will be used to collect $4.5 million for 
research and development. Should the Governor in Council start 
throwing his weight around, I assume farm producers will 
simply decide not to participate.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	The amendment also gives producers some say in determining 
the amount of the deduction, and since this bill is a response to 
their initiative, it is entirely fair that this should be the case.
<P>
	We are aware that the Canadian Wheat Board, an agency 
established to defend the interests of producers, consults 
producers on decisions as important as setting the deduction 
rate. But this is only to make it automatic and include it in Bill 
C-50.
<P>
	I would go as far as saying that our amendment proposal will 
give the Canadian Wheat Board enhanced legitimacy vis-a-vis 
the Governor in Council, as it should be the case on the issue 
before us today.
<P>
	My proposal is clear: to allow those who are the most 
qualified to set the rate of deduction do so. These are my 
arguments in favour of Motion No. 1 and I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank my colleague from Lotbinière, who sits 
with me on the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, for seconding Motions Nos. 1 and 2.
<P>
	Now, turning to the famous Motion No. 4 put forward by the 
hon. member for Vegreville, it is important to note that this 
motion introduces two significant changes to Bill C-50. First, 
we eliminate the red tape and make life easier for producers.
<P>
	I imagine that the situation is no different in Western Canada 
than in Quebec. In my riding, indeed everywhere in Quebec, 
producers and voters ask us ten times a week: ``Why make 
things so complicated?'' This is one such case. When it comes to 
withdrawing from the deductions plan, why make life difficult 
for our farm producers? What my colleague from the Reform 
Party, the hon. member for Vegreville, is proposing here makes a 
lot of sense. It will cut the red tape.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 deals with the procedure for opting out of the 
voluntary deductions plan to support research. The bill provides 
for filing a separate notice to withdraw from the program, 
whereas it is suggested here that this notice be given in the 
permit book that producers have to fill in when they sell their 
crop to the board. There should be space provided at the bottom; 
you check off one or two boxes and there you have it.
<P>
	This makes life easier for producers who do not wish to 
contribute to research, and spares doing unnecessary 
paperwork. But there should be a space provided specifically for 
this purpose inside the book, in order not to make life unduly 
difficult for the board.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by saying that, with this amendment, 
producers will have to decide whether or not to continue 
contributing to the research fund at the wrong time of the year. 
That is to say, when they see their income for the year. But since 
this is the risk you take with a voluntary contribution plan, I will 
vote for this amendment. 
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to the three amendments in the 
first package today, amendments 1, 4 and 5.
<P>
	I will start with amendment No.1 which puts in this bill a 
requirement for consultation with the people who would be 
affected by research done with the money collected through this 
fund established by the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7569"> 7569 </A></B>
<P>
	There is need for consultation. Certainly my concern with that 
amendment is that by putting it in the act it may lead to more 
consultation than is necessary. I say that because in this case the 
check off is refundable. Because of its refundable nature I 
suggest that when the research foundation is setting the level of 
funding it should be careful to make sure that the level is 
reasonable.
<P>
	Because of the refundable nature I think this amendment is 
not needed and may cause a lot of extra bureaucracy beyond 
what is necessary. For this reason I do not think I can support 
this amendment, although I do recognize the need for 
consultation.
<P>
	Another concern is that it still leaves the power to make the 
decision in terms of the level of the check off in the hands of the 
governor in council. The power should be left strictly in the 
hands of the Western Grains Research Foundation, the 
organization that will allocate the funding for research. For that 
reason I cannot support that amendment.
<P>
	Amendment No. 4 is the Reform amendment which, as the 
Bloc member has stated very clearly and very well, would 
simplify the process that farmers would have to go through in 
order to get a refund for their research funding.
<P>
	This amendment would put on the permit book application 
form, which every grain farmer receives every year, another box 
and require the farmer to check off the box if they want to get a 
refund on their check off for this particular year.
<P>
	Some argue that it is really not a problem for a farmer to write 
a letter for a check off. As a grain farmer I know that farmers are 
inundated with stacks of letters and requests, a tremendous 
amount of book work they do not ask for. This would just be 
another piece of paper, another duty, another responsibility, 
another process they would have to go through to do business. I 
think there is far too much government interference right now. 
Certainly farmers would appreciate this simplification of the 
process. I believe simplifying the process of refund would be 
very worthwhile in this bill.
<P>
	Amendment No. 5 put forth by the NDP is really asking for the 
wheat board to have complete control to interfere with check 
offs that are presently in place. For example, right now the 
western barley growers have a refundable check off through the 
Alberta Barley Commission. Barley farmers selling barley in 
Alberta already have a check off in place. This amendment 
would require that the people selling barley would have a check 
off by the wheat board as well as by the Alberta Barley 
Commission. For that reason it would cause a double check off 
or would cause the barley growers to give up their check off.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	It is a general Reform principle that the closer to the people 
one can put decision making, the better the decision will be. In 
this case I believe it would be better to leave it in the hands of the 
barley producers in Alberta, just as an example, instead of 
requiring that all the check offs are done through the Canadian 
Wheat Board.
<P>
	I cannot and will not support this amendment because it is just 
another move to put the power in the hands of this huge 
bureaucratic monopoly. I can in no way endorse that. Leave it in 
the hands of the Alberta Barley Commission for example.
<P>
	I will leave my comments at that. I certainly look forward to 
speaking on this bill again at third reading.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak on this grouping of amendments.
<P>
	One is from the member for Frontenac. He proposes to set up a 
group with whom the wheat board would consult before setting 
the rate of the deductions that are provided for under this act. I 
commend the hon. member for his concern about consultation. 
However I remind him and the House that there is a group that 
provides consultation and advice to the board now. It is the 
advisory committee and the board would be asking for that 
group's advice.
<P>
	The board will also be asking for advice and 
recommendations from the Western Grain Research Fund. It 
makes certain there is no duplication in the research efforts that 
go into plant breeding and the research programs that gravitate 
around plant breeding, whether it is to establish what methods 
and levels of fertilization should be utilized or what genetic 
changes should be searched for in order to avoid disease and to 
get better productivity and yields and to come to fruition in a 
shorter growing period.
<P>
	Therefore there is in place already the kind of organization the 
hon. member for Frontenac envisions. I am sure it will be put to 
that purpose.
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 4, essentially the member for 
Vegreville is proposing to make it fairly simple for people to opt 
out of paying into this program. I have no personal problems 
with that. I would remind the hon. member that if he is going to 
support the idea of raising money for research through check 
offs that asking people if they want to save some money when 
they are applying for their permit book will almost always get 
the response: ``Of course I want to save some money. I will not 
bother allowing the check off to occur''. It will depend on how 
that part of the application form is drawn to the farmers' 
attention as to whether they do or do not decide to participate in 
the check off.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7570"> 7570 </A></B>
<P>
	My motion proposes that a deduction fixed by the governor in 
council shall apply at the same rate to all holders of certificates 
in the designated area. First there should be a little bit of 
translation as to what that means.
<P>
	Holders of certificates are people who are eligible for a final 
payment under the wheat board for the four pools that exist for 
various types of barley and wheat. These are people who will 
have a final payment accrue to them at the end of the crop year 
when there is a surplus that has accrued from the sales and 
marketing activities of the wheat board. That surplus is 
distributed on the basis of how many tonnes of each grade and 
variety the farmer delivered.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	This act is proposing to take a certain amount from each of 
those pools which would go into specific research which would 
be designated and allocated by the Western Grain Research 
Fund. This works in conjunction with the other granting 
agencies which set out the programs that will receive public 
funding for research, whether it is for plant research as in this 
case, or for engineering or other disciplines throughout the 
country.
<P>
	I am proposing this motion because the act as written now 
permits some parts of the wheat board designated area, which 
for those who do not know what that is, it is essentially the 
prairie region plus the mountain valleys and the valleys running 
into Thunder Bay in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta 
and British Columbia. It is essentially the northern end of the 
great plains region. The climate and the soil and the farming 
technique there is such that most of the varietal research that 
will be done will be only applicable to that region. Therefore the 
plant varieties we develop for that region are usually of no 
application to regions in the rest of Canada. It is a nice, clear cut 
area whose economic interest in the area of plant breeding is 
basically the same.
<P>
	The province of Alberta has decided to take a check off for 
barley and some types of wheat. That exists and is possible 
under provincial legislation. It is Alberta's constitutional right 
to do so. If we are going to take an action as a federal Parliament 
with a federal program, it should apply to all of the area the 
program is designed to cover. There should not be written into 
the law the ability for some regions to opt out. If some regions 
want to use their powers under the Constitution to do a similar 
thing, so be it.
<P>
	We have plenty of examples of how that has been applied. For 
instance, when the GST was applied it was applied at the same 
rate right across the country, even though it was a tax on 
consumer goods and some of the provinces already had 
consumer taxes on consumer goods. However there was no 
recognition that because for example Newfoundland had a 9 per 
cent provincial sales tax that we would not bother to collect it in 
Newfoundland because those taxpayers were already 
contributing to the tax system in Newfoundland.
<P>
	I think it is inappropriate for us to put forward federal 
legislation that will apply to all of the wheat board designated 
region that covers as I said basically the northern plains of North 
America. That is a very concise and well-defined region that has 
very clearly defined needs because of climate, geography and 
agrology for basically the same services. It makes no sense to 
have a separate rule for growers of some crops in some of the 
provinces.
<P>
	Therefore, I would expect that there would be considerable 
interest in the House to try to apply the rules equitably and fairly 
across all the regions. I presume I would get support for this very 
logical motion.
<P>
	Alberta growers may wish to continue with the activities they 
have been carrying out under their check off system which is 
different in many respects from the check off for research that 
this program is collecting for. As an example, the Alberta 
program only contributes less than half of their collected 
moneys to actual research and the the rest is either held in trust 
or used for administrative costs. With this program however we 
have been assured by the promoters at the department of 
agriculture that virtually all of the funds will be allocated for 
research through the Western Grain Research Fund.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	If my amendment does not pass, I do not think it is fair for the 
contributors in Alberta under the proposal to contribute a lesser 
amount to the research needs of the area and still benefit from 
the activities of the surrounding areas. Barley growers in 
Alberta will benefit just as much as barley growers in British 
Columbia or Saskatchewan from the research that is done on 
barley varieties. Yet if we go along with the way the bill is 
currently drafted without my amendment they will be paying 
less toward research for the same benefit as everyone else gets.
<P>
	I have no objection to Alberta growers taxing themselves by 
means of a check off to perform their political, administrative, 
and other activities the fund is now engaged in. However they 
should not expect the rest of us in the other provinces to finance 
the research and to give them the benefits from barley research 
they will get by opting out.
<P>
	I urge members of the House to support this motion because it 
makes sense, because it is fair, because it is the cheapest way to 
get the most bucks for research. This will work if Alberta 
farmers pay the same rate as Saskatchewan farmers, as 
Manitoba farmers, as farmers in the rest of the wheat board 
designated area. I urge support for this because I think the only 
way the federal government and the federal jurisdiction can 
continue to receive the kind of respect this country ought to 
receive is if we treat them all in an equitable manner.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, it is now the turn of the

government side. I take it there is nobody wishing to speak. Is 
the minister of agriculture intending to speak? It would be his 
turn to speak now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do intend to speak with respect 
to both groupings of amendments. However, with the 
permission of the House I would prefer to wait until all relevant 
comments have been made so that I could respond to them all 
together, once I have heard all members of the opposition on the 
points they wish to raise.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois wishes to express its concerns about Bill C-50, an 
Act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act, which provides 
for deductions from the board's wheat sales in the four Western 
provinces and from barley sales in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and 
British Columbia.
<P>
	We certainly agree with the principle that this sector should 
contribute to research and development and with an initiative 
that could generate close to $5 million for plant breeding 
research on wheat and barley. Especially since this initiative 
was put in place by the producers themselves, who will thus 
remain competitive with their counterparts in countries where 
plant breeding research is strongly encouraged. I am thinking in 
particular of American, European and Australian producers, 
who played a leading role in reviving government plant breeding 
programs. That is why a deduction program is vital to Western 
producers.
<P>
	However, we are entitled to ask a few questions. While the 
government really meets this sector's needs by promising to 
contribute to the research fund, it should not withdraw later 
because it is a producers' initiative. We must see to it that our 
interests are truly protected.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois proposed amendments to this 
bill which, as you will see, my colleagues from other parties will 
readily approve. Again, they are aimed at protecting producers' 
interests.
<P>
	The first amendment provides that it should be clearly stated 
in the act that the board must consult with producers before 
changing rates, for example. If it seems obvious to you, then the 
government should have no objection to putting this in writing 
in the act. This would provide extra protection for producers. We 
must ensure that the Canadian Wheat Board always consults 
producers' associations before recommending changes in 
deduction rates. The democratic right of any association of 
producers to be consulted should be respected.
<P>
	The second amendment is necessary to prevent the 
department's research projects from duplicating or overlapping 
the industry's. We are told that those concerned in the farming 
community will discuss the research plans in order to avoid 
duplication and overlap and ensure that the funded projects are 
complementary. The bill says nothing about this and that is why 
this amendment is essential. We in Quebec have seen too much 
wishful thinking to believe that the government will always act 
logically. The Minister of Finance has told us often enough that 
the government's financial resources are limited. A good way to 
avoid wasting public funds is to make duplicate research 
impossible.
<P>
	We all want to reduce the deficit. When an opportunity to 
avoid waste presents itself, we should seize it! If you refuse to 
adopt this amendment, the people will judge you and you will be 
accused of lax handling of the funds provided by the producers. 
What we are asking for is a simple effort so that the government 
does not subsidize the same research activity twice. Show some 
resolve to end waste-that is what the people expect of us in 
general and the government in particular.
<P>
	The Reform Party presented two motions with which we 
agree. Having the minister table a report will show that the 
producers and the government actually co-operate. However, 
we consider the fifth amendment unacceptable. Alberta set up 
its own program and, considering that we keep asking the 
government to put an end to duplication and overlapping, we 
would be ill-advised to let that government impose its program 
on a province which already funds research through 
contributions from its producers.
<P>
	It would be useless to compete with the provincial initiative in 
Alberta. Quebec's example should be eloquent enough to 
understand the absurdity of such overlapping. In our province, 
the federal government never stopped trying to control 
agriculture. It has been told time and again that the Quebec 
government already supports farmers. Yet, the federal 
government is involved in market development as well as in 
research activities, even though the Quebec government is 
already looking after these aspects. The same is true for 
activities related to the inspection of agricultural products. Let 
us reject this amendment so that Alberta can avoid such 
problems with overlapping.
<P>
	As for the other amendments, the bill would become a lot 
more acceptable if they were supported. As we say back home, 
you cannot be against virtue.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words on 
these amendments as they have been grouped today.
<P>
	I am particularly pleased that the minister of agriculture has 
indicated that he wishes to listen to all the presentations before 
responding. I certainly respect that  position. I am quite 
appreciative of the fact that the minister is present today and that 
he is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7572"> 7572 </A></B>
<P>
taking note of what is being said in response to these 
amendments.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to take advantage of that circumstance to indicate 
that the majority of farmers I have talked to throughout my 
constituency have asked me on as many occasions as I can to 
speak strongly in favour of a strengthened Canadian Wheat 
Board and to convey to the minister their concerns that the 
current debate about the future of the Canadian Wheat Board is 
one that they have expressed opinions upon for numerous years 
by their continual support for the board and its activities.
<P>
	In fact they would prefer a bill in front of the House today that 
did not deal with check off but dealt with expanded powers for 
the Canadian Wheat Board, powers that included marketing 
jurisdiction for oats as in the past and perhaps for canola and 
other products as well.
<P>
	On behalf of many hundreds of producers in my constituency 
who have discussed this matter with me, I would certainly urge 
the minister to consider bringing forward another bill in the near 
future to take into account those very issues of expanding and 
enhancing the jurisdiction and role of the Canadian Wheat 
Board.
<P>
	In particular, I want to add a few words to what my colleague 
from Mackenzie said in direct response to the amendment, 
Motion No. 5, that he has put in front of the House for 
consideration and debate today. That concerns the application of 
the check off to all holders of certificates within the designated 
area.
<P>
	The member for Mackenzie spoke very well. I support his 
arguments about the need for the act to have a blanket 
application to producers supplying the Canadian Wheat Board 
with product for sale and therefore not dealing with the 
exemption for certain Alberta producers who as the member for 
Vegreville indicated already have a check off in place.
<P>
	Perhaps when the minister makes his remarks he could 
address this issue and give the House some information about 
why the check off for Alberta producers exists in the first place.
<P>
	I wonder if we know specifically what the Alberta check off is 
for. We know that the federal check off proposed in the 
legislation is for breeding research, that the funds that are 
collected will go specifically for research into plant breeding. Is 
the Alberta check off for the same specific purpose? If not, why 
are the Alberta producers not participating in this breeding 
research program?
<P>
	Will Alberta producers not benefit from the research that will 
be commissioned by the WGRF? We do not know if Alberta has 
plans to continue in perpetuity the check off within that province 
for its producers.
<P>
	Under this legislation, if for any reason the Alberta check off 
were discontinued, would Alberta producers continue to enjoy 
the exemption allowed by the current legislation or do they 
automatically get picked up by this legislation?
<P>
	I believe that we need the blanket provisions. Alberta 
producers should recognize that the benefits that they would 
receive under this program are the same as if they were living 
anywhere else in Canada.
<P>
	I want to reiterate the point that my colleague from 
Mackenzie made because it is a most appropriate one. When we 
look at the way other federal legislation has applied, the Goods 
and Services Tax Implementation Act is a very good example.
<P>
	If we applied the same principle to agricultural check off 
programs as we applied in the introduction of the GST, we would 
find that the GST would apply only in the province of Alberta, 
the only province that did not have a pre-existing tax in place as 
a result of other legislation.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	All the provinces, with the exception of Alberta, have a sales 
tax. If the federal government was applying tax appropriately 
across the country then obviously the GST could not have 
applied in other provinces, only in Alberta. It is an interesting 
point and I think the minister of agriculture might want to give 
some indication whether or not he would agree with or support 
that premise.
<P>
	It is obvious that I am anxious to support the amendment put 
forward by my colleague from Mackenzie. I look forward to 
additional legislation that may come forward from the minister 
of agriculture concerning a stronger and enhanced Canadian 
Wheat Board.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak on Bill C-50 and the 
amendments. In particular, I would like to address my comments 
to amendments Nos. 4 and 5. First I would like to go back a little 
bit and share with the House my history of involvement with a 
check off program in the riding I am pleased to represent.
<P>
	One position I held prior to being elected to this exalted place 
was with an organization called the B.C. Grain Producers 
Association. I was a founding member of the organization. I was 
the first vice-president when it was first formed and 
subsequently became president of that organization. Over the 
years, as any struggling organization does, we had to try and sell 
memberships and raise money to keep the organization running. 
We had a number of ongoing projects.
<P>
	One we always wanted to get involved in was in the area of 
varietal trials and research at local levels. There were always 
problems with the government operated research farms in areas 
that did not necessarily conduct research applicable to the Peace 
River region of British  Columbia. We wanted to carry that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7573"> 7573 </A></B>
<P>
research one step further by conducting trials in our area on a 
field scale.
<P>
	Over a number of years we came up with a plan to lobby the 
provincial government to allow the B.C. Grain Producers 
Association to enact a check off that would automatically come 
off producers' cheques at the time their product was delivered to 
the elevators. This check off is now in place and has been for a 
number of years. It is working quite well, I might add.
<P>
	I would like to address some concerns that have been raised by 
my colleague from Vegreville and other members. One real 
strength of the operation of the check off in the B.C. Peace has 
been that it is local and is administered at a local level. In other 
words, the farmers have the option of electing councillors to a 
regional council that oversees how the money is spent. The 
problem my colleague from Vegreville mentioned was that once 
you go beyond that and have a bureaucracy in some distant place 
administering the money, there is concern with the local 
producers that they lose control of how that money is spent and 
whether they get the best bang for the buck, so to speak.
<P>
	Local producers supported the check off because they could 
visibly see how their money was being spent. As we moved 
forward and were able to purchase specialized equipment for 
plots to expand different varieties of wheat, barley, canola and 
other grains, we could readily drive by the fields in our area and 
see how different varieties were producing in comparison to one 
another. That was a real benefit to the producers.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	Subsequently we found that there were very few people who 
opted out at the end of the year because the check off was and is 
fully refundable. However, what we found, because it was a 
local organization, was that at our annual meetings we could 
certainly do a good selling job to the local producers of what 
they were getting for their investment. Subsequently we found 
that very few wanted their money back out of the check off 
pooling fund.
<P>
	I am certainly in support of the fact that this check off is 
totally refundable, as is the one in B.C. However, I am very 
concerned about the process. I think that is addressed in 
amendment No. 4 put forward by my colleague and the amount 
of the extra paperwork. In other words, make it as easy as 
possible for farmers to opt out of it because after all if it is not 
easy for them to get their money out they will view this as just 
another form of taxation, just another expense for them. They 
have to be convinced to see it as an investment in their future.
<P>
	All of us in the agricultural industry certainly understand that 
we have to have and have to find the funds in these days of 
increasing problems with the government funds being available 
for research and development. We have to find them elsewhere. 
Producers are willing to do that as long as they can see the 
results. To do that we certainly want to pass amendment No. 4  
which would allow that there would be as little paperwork as 
possible to allow the producers to opt out should they decide 
they are not getting the best investment for their dollar.
<P>
	The other thing I would like to briefly touch on is the 
amendment as put forward by the hon. member for Mackenzie in 
allowing certain groups that already have a check off in place an 
exemption from it. We had concerns when we were holding 
meetings in our area of the B.C. Peace region trying to convince 
producers to come on board and support this thing. We actually 
had to pass a referendum of the producers before the B.C. 
government would pass the legislation to allow that check off. 
They insisted, and rightly so, that the producers supported the 
concept. To do that the B.C. Grain Producers Association had to 
go out and hold meetings and actually convince the farmers of 
the necessity of this and that it would certainly be worthwhile 
over the long haul.
<P>
	We did that but one of the real concerns that was expressed to 
us time and time again was if we vote in favour of this what is to 
prevent next time another check off by the Canadian Wheat 
Board or the prairie wheat growers and the list could go on and 
on. That was the major concern that they voted for with the 
understanding that there would be no further check offs.
<P>
	I am quite insistent that we should oppose amendment No. 5 
put forward by the member for Mackenzie because it does allow 
those areas that already have an existing check off the option of 
trying to get the exemption and not having a double check off put 
in place.
<P>
	With that bit of history with my involvement with the check 
off I thank you very much for the time, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have enjoyed and appreciated 
the opportunity to listen to the remarks that have been delivered 
by all members with respect to three of the motions that are 
before us, Motion No. 1, Motion No. 4 and Motion No. 5.
<P>
	I will confine my remarks at this point in the debate to those 
three specific motions. I understand we will have a chance later 
this afternoon to talk about motions 2 and 3.
<P>
	First, with respect to motion No. 1 proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois, this motion would in effect impose a duty for the 
Canadian Wheat Board, not the Western Grains Research 
Foundation, to consult with respect to the amount of levies and 
to make certain recommendations.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	The motion would effectively make the Canadian Wheat 
Board more than simply an administrator of the check off 
program. In the development of this program proposal and in the 
lengthy consultations with farm organizations, it was 
recognized that the Canadian Wheat Board is a marketing 
institution and not a research  agency. Therefore the role of the 
board in this particular research initiative should be purely 
administrative. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7574"> 7574 </A></B>
<P>
This has been explicitly discussed and agreed to by all of the 
farm organizations involved in this initiative.
<P>
	The Western Grains Research Foundation as a matter of 
practice consults with its membership on all significant business 
matters. In turn, the member organizations that are a part of the 
WGRF consult with their producer membership to gauge 
support for all of the foundation's activities.
<P>
	It was that kind of consultation that resulted in the 
accumulation of a very broad base of farmer support for the 
check off proposal presently contained in Bill C-50. Should 
there be any discussion in the future about altering the levy rates 
from where they will originally be established, there is an 
obvious and ready mechanism to consult with producers and 
with producer organizations. That mechanism is the Western 
Grains Research Foundation, its board, its member 
organizations and their broad based farm membership at the 
grassroots level.
<P>
	This amendment in effect would contradict the agreement and 
the consensus that exist for implementation of this particular 
research initiative. Therefore it is not possible for the 
government to support the amendment because it would 
contradict that consensus and that agreement.
<P>
	In addition, we view the amendment as unnecessary in any 
event because that ready consultative process is already in place 
through the apparatus and the means of the WGRF.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 proposed by the Reform Party has to do with the 
method by which a producer could effectively opt out of the 
check off procedure.
<P>
	The resolution that is proposed in motion No. 4 really deals 
with an operational matter, the method of operation for the 
check off program. It seems to me that is something which 
producer groups should decide upon for themselves.
<P>
	It is my understanding that the Western Grains Research 
Foundation board of directors has reviewed the motion that is 
before us at this moment in Motion No. 4. It has considered very 
seriously the arguments and the rationale put forward by the 
Reform Party and by others who support the motion. The board 
of directors of the Western Grains Research Foundation has 
decided that it would by far prefer to retain the opt out 
mechanism which is envisaged in the bill and envisaged in its 
business plan.
<P>
	The rationale for taking this position on the part of the WGRF 
is really three fold. First of all, when a person merely has to put a 
check mark in a box, opting out may be done without a lot of 
serious consideration going into that decision. Support for 
agricultural research is in the view of the government and in the 
view of the WGRF a serious matter and it is important that a 
conscious decision be made by producers whether to participate 
in  the program. Merely ticking off a box in the wheat board 
permit book application form may not provide the opportunity 
for that serious consideration.
<P>
	Second, writing a letter by a prescribed date is not a very 
onerous obligation. It does show that the individual has given 
some thought to the matter and has made a conscious decision to 
opt out and that evidence of that conscious decision is in the 
form of the letter.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	Third, the opting out mechanism that is envisaged in the bill 
and in the business plan for the WGRF is consistent with 
virtually all other existing check off mechanisms and 
procedures. It is obviously consistent with the wishes of the 
WGRF and the 12 farm organizations that make up the WGRF.
<P>
	This is my final point with respect to motion No. 4. It is also 
important to recognize this amendment would effectively 
restrict the producer's ability to opt out, to make that judgement 
call to one specific moment in time. That moment in time would 
be when the permit book application form is actually being 
filled out.
<P>
	The other procedure as we have envisioned it under the terms 
of the bill and under the business plan of the WGRF would allow 
the producer more time and more flexibility with respect to 
making this decision. If the producer had to just tick off the box 
on the permit book application form, that decision would have to 
be taken effectively 18 months before the check off would 
become effective.
<P>
	The check off becomes effective when the final payment is 
made, which is basically in January after the end of the crop 
year. The permit book application form must be filled in before 
the crop year begins, about 18 months prior to the date upon 
which the check off would occur. It seems to me that is a time 
gap that is unreasonable and limits the producer's flexibility and 
the timeliness of the producer's decision.
<P>
	Accordingly, for those reasons we are not in a position to 
support Motion No. 4.
<P>
	Finally, with respect to Motion No. 5, I certainly would agree 
with the general comment that the check off systems presently 
available in the province of Alberta are somewhat less focused 
in their objectives and more costly in terms of their 
administration than the check off system being proposed in Bill 
C-50.
<P>
	However, the scope of Bill C-50 effectively embodies an 
agreement that has been reached among 12 producer 
organizations in western Canada. Part of this agreement, this 
consensus among producers, is that the activities of the WGRF 
check off system will not impinge on other established check off 
schemes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7575"> 7575 </A></B>
<P>
	In developing the consensus necessary to implement this 
program, the WGRF directors were in unanimous agreement 
that the program should not overlap upon the activities of other 
existing check off programs. This means that where existing 
check offs are in place with respect to Alberta barley and Alberta 
soft wheat, the WGRF will not make a check off.
<P>
	The WGRF and existing agencies that are funded by other 
check offs have agreed among themselves that they will 
co-operate with each other. They will co-ordinate their research 
activities to make sure that research dollars from producers, 
whether collected under one check off or the other check off, are 
used in the most cost effective and efficient manner to the 
advantage of grain producers.
<P>
	This is essentially a producer decision about a producer 
program. It is not appropriate in my opinion to alter the program 
in a manner that explicitly contradicts the consensus upon which 
the program was developed. Part of that consensus at the outset 
was that there should be no overlap.
<P>
	I appreciate the comments that have been made by hon. 
members on Motions Nos. 1, 4 and 5. I regret for the reasons I 
have already stated the government is not in a position to 
support these motions. I acknowledge that in putting forward 
these motions to amend Bill C-50, hon. members have done so 
in a conscientious and sincere manner. Their close attention to 
the subject matter is much appreciated.
<P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-50, in Clause 2, be amended by adding after line 47, on page 2, 
the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(5.1) The research funding agency shall not distribute moneys received by 
it pursuant to subsection (3) to persons or plant breeding centres for a 
research purpose unless the research funding agency, after reasonable 
inquiries, has determined that the information to be sought by the research is 
not and is not likely, as a result of other research, to become available to 
holders of certificates.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the second amendment we wish to 
present in the House this afternoon, seconded by the hon. 
member for Lotbinière, is aimed mainly at preventing 
duplication by the various organizations that are awarded 
research contracts and also any duplication of research carried 
out by the Research Branch of the Department of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Under Bill C-50, the Canadian Wheat Board will be 
responsible for distributing monies received as a result of 
deductions from producer income. The Board will distribute 
such monies among the various centres engaged in developing 
new and improved wheat varieties.
<P>
	The purpose of our amendment is to make it clear that the 
agency must, after reasonable inquiries, have determined that 
the information to be sought by the research is not, and is not 
likely, as a result of other research, to become available to the 
producers. In other words, we must make sure we are not paying 
twice for the same research. To do so, we need consultation 
between the research funding agencies.
<P>
	Take the example of Agriculture Canada conducting research 
on possible alternate processing of red wheat. If the Canadian 
Wheat Board does not make the necessary inquiries, it might 
provide funds to an agency in order for it to carry out similar 
research, and producers would end up paying twice for research 
seeking the same information.
<P>
	This measure would also oblige Agriculture Canada to carry 
out its research mandate on behalf of producers. If private 
agencies wish to receive research funds from the CWB, they will 
clearly have to align their research activities with the interests 
of producers, who ultimately are the ones making the 
recommendations. Thus, if Agriculture Canada does not carry 
out its mandate well, independent research agencies will step in 
to meet producers' needs.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board will be obliged to increase the 
amounts given to independent agencies and to increase the 
contribution from producers, who will again pay for a 
duplication of services. If producers see their contributions 
increasing unduly, that would be a good sign that Agriculture 
Canada was not meeting the needs of the clients it serves, 
because private agencies would have to take over the 
department's work.
<P>
	As set out initially in the bill, however, the measure allows 
Agriculture Canada to diversify its areas of research. If, for 
example, grain production picked up substantially and for this 
reason more research than earmarked for the sector was 
necessary, another sector might suffer. This could happen to 
dairy producers, for instance.
<P>
	This bill give producers a chance to have research conducted 
on demand. With the element of information we are adding, it 
would be very interesting to see that organizations eligible for 
CWB grants do not need such grants because the Minister of 
Agriculture satisfies any requirement this farm production 
sector may have. It could mean that other sectors are probably 
being neglected.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Our proposal is designed to prevent Agriculture Canada from 
focusing on one single aspect of grain production in terms of 
research. One potential risk that should be kept in mind and 
could be countered with our amendment proposal is that larger 
producers end up running the show at the expense of smaller 
ones. Insofar as the voluntary contribution is based on the 
number of tonnes of wheat sold, larger producers will inevitably 
make larger contributions to this fund because they produce 
more than the others.
<P>
	If research is not adequately suited to the needs of smaller 
producers, the Canadian Wheat Board will be able to react to 
this threat. Since it will be monitoring the research activities, it 
will know exactly what is the fruit of the research it is 
supporting.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to point out that initiatives such as 
those put forth with respect to Bill C-50, which show a 
commitment on the part of producers to assume responsibility 
for themselves, are encouraging. To sit idly by and wait for the 
department to resolve our problems is not a very effective 
approach, in my view.
<P>
	The cautionary measure we want to include in this bill is 
simply aimed at greater protection. The Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food must not see this measure as an excuse to neglect 
his duty to Western grain producers to promote research.
<P>
	In closing, may I remind you that producers will contribute to 
this research fund on a strictly voluntary basis. If the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food ever abuses the good faith of grain 
producers, he will live to regret it. There will be a protest 
movement, producers will withdraw, and he will end up 
financing research and development by himself.
<P>
	Partnership is another key to success in research and 
development. When producers are directly involved in research, 
development, or co-operation, they co-operate wholeheartedly. 
Farmers, as is well known, are the workers who show the most 
solidarity in Canada, or at least in Quebec. I personally can tell 
you that if the Minister of Agriculture still thinks that he has a 
monopoly on truth, he is sorely mistaken.

	The amendments proposed in this House by the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Reform Party and my colleague from 
Mackenzie-some of which I think are relevant-are not meant 
to thwart the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. On the 
contrary! It is to help him and at the same time to help farmers in 
the four western provinces. Of course, the Bloc Quebecois has 
nothing to gain politically in this matter, but we are doing it as 
members of the Official Opposition and we are also acting in 
accordance with the old principle that if your neighbours are 
prosperous, you will also benefit and live well.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	With that, I call on my colleagues in the Reform Party and the 
NDP and the Minister of Agriculture to read this amendment 
carefully. I ask the minister for once not to say no just because it 
comes from the opposition. I ask him for once to try to assess it 
for what it is worth and to support this motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
amendment proposed by the hon. member for Frontenac would, 
I believe, require that the funding which is gained from the 
check off on wheat and barley which passes through the 
Canadian Wheat Board is spent on research.
<P>
	If this motion did put in the hands of the Western Grain 
Research Foundation the responsibility to ensure that there is no 
duplication in research, then I would support the motion. 
However, this motion puts this responsibility in the hands of the 
Canadian Wheat Board through the Canadian Wheat Board Act. 
A responsibility that should be in the hands of the foundation 
will now be in the hands of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	A brand new level of bureaucracy will be added to the process. 
The Canadian Wheat Board certainly is not the one you would 
want to add to as far as bureaucracy is concerned because it is a 
very large bureaucracy. It would be counter productive to have 
the Canadian Wheat Board as it is set up now deciding whether 
there was duplication in funding.
<P>
	I believe it would be a big mistake to give the Canadian Wheat 
Board control and get it involved in the process of allocating 
funds. For that reason I cannot support this motion.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is a monopoly that is not 
accountable to anyone it seems. I said the other day that it is not 
even accountable to God because it thinks it is God. Certainly it 
is an organization that has power beyond what the farmers who 
pay for the operation want.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board ought to be run by an elected 
board of directors and farmers across western Canada, as 
proposed by the Reform Party. That type of organization could 
be involved in making a decision such as this but certainly not 
the board as it is.
<P>
	I strongly oppose this motion because it adds another level to 
the decision making. That level is the Canadian Wheat Board 
which is a large bureaucracy and one which would make this 
bill, which I support, not as good.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not 
going to intervene on this motion until I heard the member for 
Vegreville. I wonder if he was speaking to motion No. 2 because 
he does not seem to have read it the way the hon. member for 
Frontenac wrote it.
<P>
	We should remind ourselves that the research funding agency 
that is mentioned in the motion by the hon. member for 
Frontenac is to be the Western Grains Research Foundation. If 
members look at the section of the act where this all starts, the 
deductions for research portion on page 2 explains that the board 
collects the funds and then turns it over to this research funding 
agency.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	The motion we have before us from the member for Frontenac 
directs that the research funding agency, which will be the 
western grains research fund, shall distribute funds to persons 
who will make the results of their research available to the 
people who contributed to it, namely the producers. I do not see 
anything wrong with that. This is something that should pass as 
a matter of course. However I realize the way some 
bureaucracies work and some funding works it does not always 
happen.
<P>
	I do not know if the people who contribute to the check off for 
research in Alberta necessarily know what varieties of plants 
their deduction money has gone into. Neither do I know if the 
designation of research is the same in each case. In the bill it is 
quite clear that the funding will be for plant breeding research. It 
is not clear what the deductions are in some of the other 
provinces.
<P>
	I hope the research granting agency, which is the western 
grain research fund, will make certain that it collects the same 
amount per tonne from producers in Alberta as is collected from 
producers in Saskatchewan, British Columbia or Manitoba. 
Whether it comes from a different collecting group should be 
irrelevant, but I hope that the same amount of moneys for a 
tonne of grain goes into the research granting agency from 
Alberta producers as is coming from Saskatchewan or Manitoba 
producers.
<P>
	If that does not happen a lot of screaming and yelling will be 
going on by producers in Saskatchewan if this duality that the 
minister appears to be willing to support and which apparently 
the Reform Party is willing to support results.
<P>
	If we cannot have fairness in the funding of research and 
openness to the point of allowing the people who pay for it know 
what the results are, then we are on a long, slippery slope into 
another form of taxation and another way for government to opt 
out of providing the kind of research dollars that it ought to have 
supplied in the first place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7578"> 7578 </A></B>
<P>
	I have one other thought as I look at motion No. 2. Since this 
money is being collected directly from farmers to finance this 
plant research I would hope that when a variety is developed that 
those same farmers will not be asked to pay fees under plant 
breeders' rights for the privilege of growing the variety they 
paid to produce.
<P>
	I believe that is what the member for Frontenac is trying to 
avoid. If we know what varieties our money has produced as a 
result of the deductions from our grain sales then we should not 
have to pay plant breeders' rights on those varieties because we 
have already paid for them once, thank you very much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will take just a few moments to comment on the 
amendments in front of us this afternoon, motions No. 2 and 3, 
before we conclude the debate.
<P>
	I could not help but notice a few moments ago, when the 
minister of agriculture rose to speak on motions No. 1, 4 and 5 
and the following interventions by a number of members on this 
side of the House, including myself, that many of the issues we 
raised were not addressed in his responses in reply.
<P>
	In particular, I was expressing the support of my constituents 
in northwest Saskatchewan for the strengthened and enhanced 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	I hope the minister takes an opportunity before the end of the 
day to express to the House, to producers in Saskatchewan and 
the prairies his support and his party's support for a 
strengthened Canadian Wheat Board, a marketer of Canadian 
grain.
<P>
	Certainly, Mr. Speaker, coming from the west you realize that 
the Canadian Wheat Board has long benefited the producers in 
western Canada. It has always found premium markets for 
Canadian grain. Those premium markets occasionally come 
close to the Canadian border as they do today.
<P>
	Those people, including the Reform Party, who support dual 
marketing of grains forget that the premium market is not 
always across the Canada-U.S. border. The premium market is 
sometimes in Japan or Saudi Arabia. With the agricultural 
situation in China today it is quite possible that the premium 
market may exist there in the near future. Under no 
circumstance could any of the dual marketers survive without 
the Canadian Wheat Board in a marketplace that is dominated by 
a nation outside of North America. In any case I hope the 
minister of agriculture would take a moment to discuss that.
<P>
	More to the point of the amendments, I could not help but add 
my voice to that of the member for Mackenzie who just talked 
about plant breeders' rights. Members of my constituency a few 
years ago were opposed to the introduction and passage of the 
plant breeders' rights legislation. They said at that time the 
legislation would lead to a greater concentration of agricultural 
breeding in the hands of multinational corporations and other 
corporations that would push up the cost of producing 
agricultural products, grains in particular. When the costs of 
producing the product increase and the results of plant breeding 
are tied in with fertilizer and chemical production of any kind, 
then the input costs rise as well.
<P>
	My constituents are now seeing a possible tie between 
legislation that perhaps turns some of their contributions to 
plant breeding over to those individuals or corporations which 
may financially benefit from their breeding programs at the 
expense of the producer. This is a situation to which the 
government should pay very close attention because we cannot 
jeopardize public supported research in grain varieties to benefit 
the corporations to the detriment of the producers and the 
industry.
<P>
	I have spent a great deal of time as the New Democratic 
Party's environmental critic working on issues of population 
and the environment. These issues have helped me to understand 
that the need for agricultural product must be increasing with 
the increasing populations. Whether we are feeding grains to 
people or whether we are feeding grains to cattle, fish or other 
sources of protein or food for human consumption, the growing 
of grain will become very important to the future of the world as 
populations increase.
<P>
	Yields must increase. Therefore the transfer of support and 
resources to the producers of the grains must also exist to ensure 
that we have a steady supply from this part of the world where 
grains grow so well and to ensure the transfer of the benefits of 
that growing to the areas of the world where populations are also 
growing.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	For that reason alone, even though it is not fully intended in 
Motion No. 2, I would look favourably upon Motion No. 2 as it 
appears before us. Obviously, from my remarks I hope the 
minister of agriculture will have some additional matters to 
think about as he looks to additional legislation and perhaps 
even additional amendments to this legislation in the future.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> During the course of the debate this 
afternoon on the various motions that we have had before us 
members opposite have invited me in my responses to go quite a 
distance beyond the precise subject matter that is the focus of 
the debate today.
<P>
	While I am indeed tempted to respond at length and in a wide 
ranging way to some of the remarks that have been made by all 
of the speakers this afternoon on Motions Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5, I 
will continue my practice of  restricting myself to the precise 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7579"> 7579 </A></B>
<P>
subject matter that forms the point of the debate and save the 
wider ranging commentary for another time.
<P>
	The fact that I do not happen to mention some of those other 
things should not be taken as any kind of disinterest in the 
subject matter. I am simply holding my fire.
<P>
	Motion No. 2, the further proposed amendment by the 
member for Frontenac, is directed to the point that research 
efforts funded by the proposal in Bill C-50 should not be 
duplicative or overlapping. I take that as a valid point. 
Unfortunately, the proposed amendment would really not offer 
any assurance of no duplication and no overlap other than just 
comfort language. Quite frankly, I do not think that is realistic. 
The avoidance of research duplication in reality is a primary 
objective of the Western Grains Research Foundation. To this 
end, the foundation has already established a very close working 
relationship with both public and private research 
establishments, including a very close working relationship 
with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada researchers.
<P>
	Further to this the foundation has consulted with and it 
intends to work with existing producer-funded research 
programs-for example, Alberta barley-to ensure that there 
are not turf wars started and that research efforts are 
co-ordinated.
<P>
	Since this type of co-operation and co-ordination of research 
is already an established practice, it would not be useful in my 
view to proceed with the motion contained in Motion No. 2. 
Incidentally, I would add that in its present form I believe the 
amendment is unenforceable in any event.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that I fully understand the spirit of what 
the hon. member is trying to achieve. I think it is achieved 
otherwise through the WGRF and I cannot recommend this 
particular amendment to the House.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-50 in clause 2 be amended by replacing line 39 on page 3 with 
the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>period ending on December 31, and the Minister shall lay the report before 
the House of Commons on any of the first fifteen days on which the House 
sits following the day the Minister receives the report.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, amendment No. 3 is about 
accountability. The Western Grains Research Foundation is 
required under this legislation to report to the minister once a 
year. All we are asking for in this amendment is to require that 
any report to the minister is made public through the House of 
Commons. That is the intent of the motion.
<P>
	I cannot possibly see how this government would be against 
this accountability. I do not know why a report from a body such 
as the Western Grains Research Foundation should be kept 
under cover. I do not know why it should not be a public 
document.
<P>
	The Western Grains Research Foundation, I just want to 
acknowledge, has an annual report that is made public every 
year but that does not necessarily mean that the report that it 
sends to the minister is the same report.
<P>
	That is why I want this report which is sent to the minister 
every year made public through this House. That is what the 
intention of this motion is and I believe that is what it would do 
if it was passed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to comment on Motion No. 3, moved by the hon. member 
for Vegreville. First, I would like to say that we support that 
proposal to the effect that a report must quickly be tabled in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	For reasons of transparency, annual reports submitted to 
every minister must be tabled in the House, so that all 
parliamentarians can quickly have access to them. If our good 
friend the Minister of Agriculture receives a report, he should 
not keep it to himself for months. We, members of the 
opposition, have a right to see that report as quickly as possible. 
As you all know, if a report is made public after a six-month 
delay, it has lost a great deal of its timeliness. It no longer 
generates the same interest.
<P>
	The proposal made by the hon. member for Vegreville makes 
a lot of sense. As regards agriculture we, members of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7580"> 7580 </A></B>
<P>
opposition, work primarily for the agricultural community and, 
in doing so, we also work for the 28 million Canadian and 
Quebec consumers. Indeed, we do not work exclusively for the 
agricultural community. We  work for everyone, and that 
includes producers and consumers.
<P>
	If the minister believes in transparency for his party, he 
should support the motion tabled by the member for Vegreville. 
In its original bill, the government merely proposes that a report 
be tabled to the minister as soon as possible. If there is still some 
fortitude left in this House, if transparency is really a concern, 
as the Prime Minister mentioned again today, why not accept 
that it be done within two weeks of the minister receiving the 
said report?
<P>
	Right now, the government's transparency somewhat 
resembles the St. Lawrence River, you cannot see anything a few 
centimetres below the surface. The proposed amendment is very 
interesting because it does not put pressure on the agency, but on 
the minister. Indeed, it suggests that the minister shall lay the 
report before the House within fifteen sitting days of the day the 
minister receives the report.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	All of us elected representatives from Quebec and Canada 
have the right to have access to the report within fifteen days.
<P>
	Since such a wish can be easily granted, I wonder how anyone 
could oppose an amendment making a minister accountable to 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	Therefore, it will be for the sake of transparency and 
efficiency that we, in the Bloc Quebecois, will support the 
motion presented by my colleague for Vegreville.
<P>
	To conclude, I will use the few minutes I have left to comment 
on Motion No. 5. I must say that I am rather puzzled by the 
amendment proposed by the member for Mackenzie. 
Considering that section 33.1 recognizes the principle of 
distinct wheat classes, the amendment he proposes would only 
allow the Governor in Council to exclude the province or the 
area where a given class of wheat is produced.
<P>
	In Alberta, since farmers can already contribute to a similar 
program for barley, offered by the Alberta Barley Commission, 
the proposed amendment would eliminate the monopoly and 
encourage competition between that organisation and the board.
<P>
	The argument is justifiable, since the results of the subsidized 
research funded by the board would also benefit Alberta and also 
because farmers who support the board might prefer that it 
manage their deductions.
<P>
	However, if the Governor in Council no longer has the 
authority to exclude a province, provincial initiatives will 
immediately be cast aside.
<P>
	This is why, as you can imagine, I have a great deal of 
difficulty supporting motion No. 5. When a province, like 
Alberta, is ahead of the federal government, it is essential that 
its initiatives be respected.
<P>
	This is why members of the Bloc Quebecois cannot support 
the motion of our colleague from the New Democratic Party, the 
hon. member for Mackenzie.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a few words on this motion. I will take up 
where the minister of agriculture left off in his remarks. The 
minister of agriculture indicated this was not the time to talk 
about the future of the Canadian Wheat Board. In fact he said, 
and I think I quote him correctly: ``Now is the time to hold my 
fire''.
<P>
	I could not help but think that on this side when one holds 
one's fire and when one is fed up, it leads only to indigestion. We 
do not want this issue to be lapped without the proper debate in 
this place that it deserves.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	I remind the minister of agriculture that members of his party 
campaigned in my province and others one year ago, some of 
whom were elected on a campaign of supporting the Canadian 
Wheat Board and enhancing its powers.
<P>
	The red book has a commitment toward marketing boards and 
the support of the Canadian Wheat Board. There were numerous 
news releases issued a year ago from Liberal candidates and now 
sitting members indicating support for the Canadian Wheat 
Board. I do not believe that at this time when the future of the 
Canadian Wheat Board is under so much pressure that the 
government, especially members who campaigned the way they 
did, and particularly the minister can hold their fire on this very 
important issue.
<P>
	As it stands, my constituents are firmly behind the Canadian 
Wheat Board and I will speak for them as often as I can to ensure 
that the Canadian Wheat Board supports the farmers, the 
producers of western Canada and all the communities those 
farmers and producers support throughout my constituency in 
western Canada.
<P>
	I want to indicate that on this motion the member for 
Vegreville has made an interesting intervention and with a 
couple of clarifications I believe I will now be able to support 
the amendment he has brought forward and I urge the 
government to do the same.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a few remarks to address 
precisely to the subject matter of Motion No. 3.
<P>
	Once again the member who has just spoken and others have 
tempted me to broaden the discussion this afternoon. I will not 
do that. There will be ample opportunities for that. I will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7581"> 7581 </A></B>
<P>
welcome those opportunities and if hon. members want a sneak 
preview of some of my views and opinions on the subject they 
seem to be amply reported almost on a continuous basis in the  
media so they can whet their appetites on those observations and 
we will get to the main subject matter in due course.
<P>
	There do seem to be some animal noises coming across the 
way from the opposition members. Sometimes it is difficult to 
determine the distinction between their heckling and their 
speeches. I trust the speeches will have more substance than the 
animal imitations that seem to be emerging from the opposition 
members at the present time.
<P>
	That type of conduct does tend to trivialize the subject matter 
that is under consideration. I prefer to remain serious about it.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 3 the proposal is essentially for a 
tabling of the annual report of an arms length, not for profit 
private organization. That is a rather unusual proposition 
because the Western Grains Research Foundation is an arms 
length, not for profit private organization. It represents 12 farm 
organizations in western Canada. It may represent in due course 
more organizations than that because as I understand it other 
organizations are expressing very sincere interest in joining the 
WGRF because of the good work that it does. It does represent 
those private sector producer based organizations.
<P>
	It will operate with producer and not taxpayer funds. That is 
essentially what the check off procedure is all about.
<P>
	Bearing in mind that the agency we are talking about in terms 
of the WGRF is a private, not for profit, arm's length 
organization. Bearing in mind that organization will operate 
with producer funds, not taxpayer dollars, it seems to me that a 
different type of accountability is appropriate.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	Accountability obviously is important but it must be of a 
different kind than one would think of if we were speaking of a 
purely government institution. The foundation is operated by 
producers and is accountable to producers. The program that is 
proposed in Bill C-50, it seems to me, does not require 
excessive control by the House of Commons or by any 
government agency. It should have that kind of accountability 
which the WGRF in the proper exercise of its responsibilities 
considers to be appropriate.
<P>
	In these circumstances the avenue that should be pursued is 
simply this. Every year when the report from the WGRF 
becomes available there should be a notice published in the 
Canada <I>Gazette</I> indicating that annual report has now been 
produced and it obviously is available for inspection. That is a 
more economical and appropriate way to deal with this 
requirement of accountability in the case of the WGRF.
<P>
	At the same time I would again point out the nature of the 
WGRF. It is an organization involving 12 western farm 
organizations. They have a board of directors and  they are 
accountable to their membership. They have developed this 
whole program in very close consultation with farmers. There is 
a very real discipline and a very real form of accountability built 
right into that structure because it is producer based and 
producer driven through those farm organizations that make up 
the WGRF. The board of directors of the WGRF is 
representative of those farm organizations.
<P>
	In addition to that kind of accountability which will certainly 
ensure the publication of the kind of annual report that is 
appropriate and necessary in the circumstances, I think it would 
be sufficient for us to simply publish a notice in the Canada 
<I>Gazette</I> every year noting that the annual report is available for 
inspection if needed. In addition, it would seem to be logical that 
a summary of that annual report could be provided in the 
ordinary course through the publication known as ``Grain 
Matters'' which is broadly distributed to all Canadian Wheat 
Board permit book holders across western Canada.
<P>
	The annual report will include statements concerning 
revenues and expenses as audited and other statements as may 
be necessary to provide and to ensure full transparency.
<P>
	I would also note in conclusion that when Bill C-50 was in 
committee it was strengthened by allowing for agreements 
between the minister and the research funding agency. That 
agreement is now provided for in a prior amendment to Bill 
C-50, section 33(1)(6). That particular agreement will provide 
for another form of accountability. All of those factors taken 
together sufficiently address the point and make the amendment 
proposed in Motion No. 3 unnecessary.

divisions at the report stage of the bill now before the House.
<P>
	Call in the members.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 45(5)(a), I 
have been requested by the chief government whip to defer the 
division until a later time.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 45(5)(a), 
the division on the motion before the House is deferred to 
tomorrow at 10 a.m. at which time the bells will ring for 15 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you would probably find 
unanimous consent to proceed immediately to private member's 
hour or we could suspend for four minutes. My colleague seems 
to be ready to proceed now so the House would probably consent 
to proceed immediately.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think it is 
important while we are on this subject of deferring the votes 
until tomorrow morning that the House realize that the minister 
of agriculture is before the standing committee on agriculture at 
nine o'clock tomorrow morning. The deferral of the vote until 
ten o'clock tomorrow morning simply cuts short the amount of 
time that the minister would have in front of the committee. I 
wanted to bring that to the attention of the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to call it 
5.30 p.m.?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now 
proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business as 
listed on today's Order Paper.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCEACT">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed, from September 20, 1994, consideration 
of the motion that Bill C-218, an act to amend the 
Unemployment Insurance Act (excepted employment), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on Bill C-218, an Act to amend the Unemployment 
Insurance Act. I wish to indicate my approval of the bill 
introduced by the hon. member for Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	The bill seeks to correct an injustice made against almost a 
million Canadians and Quebecers, of whom two-thirds are 
women.
<P>
	Yes, one million Canadians, most of them women, that the 
government does not trust and considers as UI abusers because 
they are not dealing at arm's length with their employer, who is 
either a brother, a son, a daughter or a spouse. This is 
unacceptable in a country where citizens are presumed to be 
honest.
<P>
	I remind the House that until 1989, any woman employed by 
her spouse could not draw unemployment insurance benefits. 
That in itself is shocking and appalling. Indeed, who would 
accept such a discriminatory clause nowadays? Yet, women had 
to unite in a long and vigilant fight to bring that discrimination 
to an end.
<P>
	After a challenge under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
the section of the act excluding from entitlement to benefits any 
woman working for her spouse was ruled invalid and 
discriminatory by the Supreme Court of Canada in March 1989. 
This ruling finally gave fair treatment to these women who work 
in family businesses and granted them the well-deserved right 
to unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
	However, this victory was short-lived. In October 1990, the 
then government found a way to get around the 1989 ruling, by 
including, in the definition of excepted employment, 
employment where the employer and employee are not dealing 
with each other at arm's length. By excluding from benefits not 
only women, but everyone not dealing at arm's length with their 
employer, legally, the law no longer seemed discriminatory.
<P>
	It is possible that some employees working for their spouses 
defraud unemployment insurance just as it is possible for an 
employer and an employee who are perfect strangers to cheat the 
system. The penalties in the law are explicit and severe enough 
to cover all fraudulent claims.
<P>
	Losing a job is in itself a stressful event that can weaken one's 
self-esteem. We, on this side of the House, do not think that 
most people choose unemployment as a way of life. Nor do we 
believe that the unemployed in Canada are lazy people drinking 
beer in front of the television, as the prime minister 
unfortunately said. But that such a suspicion be covered in the 
act is unacceptable to the 1 million Canadians who are 
unemployed, including 650,000 women.
<P>
	What is shocking here, and that I want to denounce, is the 
burden of proof which lies with the unemployed individuals 
from the very first stage of their benefits claim. These 
individuals must prove to Revenue Canada, Taxation that their 
work contract was meeting all the requirements of a position 
that anyone else could have held. No other category of claimants 
is required to produce such proof.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7583"> 7583 </A></B>
<P>
	But what is more shocking and adds to my determination to 
support the deletion of section 3(2)(c) is the fact that the 
amendment adopted October 22, 1990, only slightly softened 
the blatant discrimination present in the former Unemployment 
Insurance Act. The existing legislation is targeting an easily 
identifiable group and results mainly in the systematic 
exclusion of women employed by their spouse.
<P>
	Are these women entitled to UI? Yes, said the Tax Court of 
Canada in 1989. Since then, these women have been 
contributing to the system. But by a clever trick, the 1990 UI 
reform managed to include anyone not at arm's length with the 
employer.
<P>
	When these women lose their job, it is often because their 
spouse's business is going down the drain. It is then that these 
women need UI benefits. Instead they have to prove to officials 
of Revenue Canada, Taxation that their job is justified, therefore 
insurable.
<P>
	Then begins a long inquiry process that can last several 
months, even a year, during which the slightest doubt leads to an 
exclusion because the process does not tend to confirm 
eligibility but rather to prove abuse.
<P>
	Once more, the Canadian government shows that it does not 
focus on the real problems and that the services most needed by 
people are still subject to a cumbersome bureaucracy.
<P>
	I believe it would be improper to assume that a woman taking 
an active part in the operations of her husband's business would 
try to abuse the unemployment insurance system. Yet, if she 
worked for a competitor, she would not be subject to such 
misconceptions. Bill C-218 precisely aims to put an end to such 
an unfair situation.
<P>
	This discriminatory clause of the act is detrimental to all 
women from a human and social point of view because it denies 
them the right to their fair share and a fair treatment.
<P>
	Therefore I ask the government to repeal paragraph 3(2)(c) of 
the Unemployment Insurance Act. I urge the government to get 
rid of the vicious and discriminatory measure by which the 
previous government deprived one million Canadians and 
Quebecers, mostly women, of their right to unemployment 
insurance at a time when they need it most.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the 
concerns expressed in Bill C-218 by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	The hon. member's bill purports to correct an injustice she 
perceives in section 3(2)(c) of the Unemployment Insurance 
Act. I know the hon. member has brought this matter forward 
with the very best of intentions.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	The government appreciates the hon. member's concern. 
After all, we are striving to make sure its rules and regulations 
are fair and equitable for everyone. It pleases me to say that this 
particular provision is an example of the equality we are trying 
to achieve.
<P>
	The section of the act that the hon. member is concerned about 
addresses the situation whereby relatives work for one another. 
Some hon. members have argued that this section of the act 
discriminates against relatives of employers. This is simply not 
so. The provisions simply act to make sure that those individuals 
who work for a spouse or for a mom or dad have the same access 
to this important government program as any other worker. 
Perhaps I can alleviate the hon. member's concern by pointing 
out the intent of this arm's length employer-employee 
relationship.
<P>
	The government recognizes that more so today than ever 
before individuals are starting their own businesses working out 
of their homes and providing services that may involve family 
members. What we can call non-standard employment is on the 
increase. Last year more than 60 per cent of all new jobs were 
part time. Therefore I think the hon. member will agree with the 
necessity of having UI regulations that allow a relative or 
common law spouse to be an employee.
<P>
	This section of the act entitles these individuals to pay 
premiums and collect benefits if their contracts are similar to 
those of workers not related to their employer. As well the 
employee of a corporation in which he or she has shares may 
also be eligible to pay UI premiums and collect benefits.
<P>
	All the unemployment insurance program is asking in this 
regard is that relatives employed by relatives ensure that this is a 
legitimate employer-employee relationship. This is not 
discriminatory because all employees related or not must also 
do the required paperwork to satisfy the commission that they 
are legitimate employees. I say to the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert that the only real distinction is a few additional 
forms to fill out. This is but a minor inconvenience. It is a 
reasonable measure because it protects the integrity of the UI 
program for everyone.
<P>
	The hon. member has quite rightly pointed out that the 
majority of individuals affected by this section of the act are 
women but that is why the section was amended in the first 
place. It used to be that spouses, the great majority of whom are 
women, were not eligible for UI benefits. This is no longer the 
case. Women are not discriminated against in this regard. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7584"> 7584 </A></B>
<P>
are however required as any other employee to show there is a 
legal employer-employee relationship if they wish to pay UI 
premiums and to be eligible to collect benefits.
<P>
	In a related matter this government recognized that many 
women are entering the workforce. We know that many women 
are the main providers for their families. To address this 
evolving situation, the government introduced the dependency 
benefit rate of 60 per cent. This rate is for claimants with low 
incomes supporting a dependant or who have a spouse 
supporting a dependant. Without this, people in this situation 
would receive a 55 per cent benefit rate.
<P>
	I believe that if the hon. member for Saint-Hubert considers 
the matter, she will see that this government is totally 
committed to fairness and compassion in applying its programs.
<P>
	The thinking behind any adjustment to unemployment 
insurance is to guarantee that all potential UI recipients are 
treated fairly. That is one of the reasons we are looking at UI as 
part of the social security reform. Our surveys have shown that 
the great majority of Canadians support the concept of 
unemployment insurance, but the key word is insurance.
<P>
	Canadians want this program to be used for the purpose for 
which it was originally intended, the purpose being temporary 
financial support between jobs and not as a supplement to a 
regular income. People understand that UI is a major component 
of social security and they want to see that it works fairly and 
equitably.
<P>
	During previous debate on this bill one hon. member referred 
to the government's initiative to use UI development funds for 
training and upgrading skills. He suggested that by supporting 
the hon. member's bill we will enable workers employed by 
relatives to take advantage of training programs.
<P>
	Individuals who qualify under this section of the act are as 
eligible for training programs as any other recipient. They are 
not being denied training because they have to fulfil an 
obligation, an obligation that guarantees that the business 
arrangement with their spouse is a true employer-employee 
relationship.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	I say to all hon. members that a review of our social security 
system will give them ample opportunity to present their ideas 
on reforming our unemployment insurance program. The 
government's proposals are detailed in the discussion paper and 
we more than welcome constructive input. Social security 
reform is a partnership. It is a partnership that needs helpful 
suggestions if we are to develop new social security programs 
that will be fair and beneficial to all Canadians.
<P>
	In summing up I thank the hon. member for Saint-Hubert for 
raising concerns over what she perceives to be discrimination. 
The government appreciates her attention in this regard. 
However in studying the matter I see no grounds to assume there 
is discrimination under this section of the UI Act. Therefore, 
regretfully I cannot support the hon. member's bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity today to speak on Bill C-218 
which seeks to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act. The 
member for Saint-Hubert proposes to eliminate the exemption 
that prevents family members from collecting UI if they work in 
the family business.
<P>
	I suppose the intent of unemployment insurance at the time it 
became law in 1940 was to provide financial assistance to 
industrial and commercial workers during periods of 
unemployment. Since that time the program has expanded to 
encompass everything from grants to organizations under 
section 25 to maternity leave and sickness benefits. Today 97 
per cent of paid workers are covered by the unemployment 
insurance program. The originators of the program would not 
recognize it in its present form today.
<P>
	For some time now Canadians have been expressing concern 
over the abuse of the unemployment insurance program. Even 
the Minister of Human Resources Development realizes there is 
a need to tighten up the system and close the loopholes.
<P>
	When the hon. member for Saint-Hubert outlined her reasons 
for introducing this bill, she said that the primary effect of 
section 3(2)(c) is the systematic exclusion of women who work 
for their spouse. She finds it objectionable that such employees 
must prove to Revenue Canada adjudicators that the labour 
contract has all the features of a job that the employer would 
have given to someone else who was completely unrelated to 
him or her.
<P>
	We believe that if a wife works for a husband or vice versa, 
they should be prepared to prove that a bona fide 
employer-employee relationship exists. At this point many 
people on farms would qualify under those regulations.
<P>
	It should be incumbent upon them to show they are not taking 
advantage of the system and trying to add to the family income. I 
do not believe this is an unreasonable safeguard in a system that 
is all too often abused. Members from the official opposition 
often talk about abuse in the system.
<P>
	Revenue Canada adjudicators would adjudicate arm's length 
relationships. Statistics show that each year some 3,750 UI 
claimants are denied benefits because they do not work in true 
employer-employee relationships. This actually amounts to 
one-quarter of the claims that are reviewed each year. This 
means there are some 11,000 arm's length relationship 
claimants who do receive UI benefits. If this amendment were 
passed those 3,750 claims that are rejected each year possibly 
would be approved. Taking the average benefit from 1992 which 
is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7585"> 7585 </A></B>
<P>
$6,600, the minimum annual increase in UI payments would be 
$25 million.
<P>
	I am sure my colleague for Saint-Hubert believes that her 
amendment would be a great benefit to women and to the small 
business community. The truth is that she is ultimately bringing 
more harm to those people she is trying to protect.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	The changes and add ons brought in since the inception of the 
program have been costly to the workers and their employers. 
Together the contributions by employees and their employers 
average 7.3 per cent of contributors' income.
<P>
	As it stands now the UI program will take $19.8 billion from 
the people who are trying to keep their businesses solvent and 
from workers who are trying to make ends meet and pay their 
taxes. That $19.8 billion amounts to approximately $1,500 from 
every Canadian worker covered by the unemployment insurance 
program. It is the second highest source of revenue for the 
federal government, second only to personal income tax.
<P>
	If the hon. member really wanted to help women and small 
businesses she would support the proposal of the Reform Party 
for a private insurance plan, one which is operated on basic, 
actuarially sound insurance principles. She would be proposing 
an amendment to make UI contributions voluntary so that those 
who are not eligible to collect benefits would not have to 
contribute to the plan. She would be calling on the government 
to lower the tax rate so that money could be left in the hands of 
the entrepreneur, the farmer, the small business person who 
relies on family members to help out on the farm or in the store.
<P>
	We feel most Canadians would agree with our party's belief 
that a dollar left in the hands of an entrepreneur, a small business 
person is far more likely to stimulate economic growth than a 
dollar left in the hands of mother government or bureaucrats.
<P>
	Reform Party members oppose this bill for many reasons. It 
opens up the Unemployment Insurance Act to yet another 
avenue of abuse and waste of taxpayers' dollars at a time when 
we should be tightening the loopholes and saving employer and 
employee UI premiums to cover UI claims by workers and their 
families hardest hit by today's high unemployment. This bill 
would increase payouts of the UI benefits by millions of dollars 
per year. It directly contravenes Reform Party principles which 
support elimination of fraud and abuse and returning UI to true 
insurance principles.
<P>
	Most important, spouses employed by their partners already 
have an advantage over other Canadians because they can split 
their income and reduce their taxation in that way. While 
Reformers support income splitting for married couples, we 
would like all Canadians to have equal opportunity to do so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> As you know, Mr. 
Speaker, the purpose of this bill is to repeal section 3(2)(<I>c</I>) of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, which stipulates that 
employment where the employer and employee are not dealing 
with each other at arm's length is not insurable. The law is clear: 
Where the employer is related to the employee, he or she must 
prove that the job would have been given to an unrelated person 
in similar circumstances.
<P>
	The vast majority of workers affected by this section of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act are women who work in a family 
business. For these women, the law is also unequivocal. Women 
who work for their spouses must pay unemployment insurance 
premiums. This is also true for employees who are not dealing at 
arm's length with their employer and who hold 40 per cent or 
less of the family business shares.
<P>
	Since the act was brought into force in October 1990, the 
Department of Human Resources Development, which is 
responsible for the administration and the application of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, increasingly refuses to pay 
unemployment insurance benefits to these people.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois denounces such an attitude stemming 
from the retrograde section 3(2)(<I>c</I>) of the Unemployment 
Insurance Act. Yes, Mr. Speaker, this section is retrograde and 
even discriminatory, since its main effect is to systematically 
exclude from the unemployment insurance program women who 
work for their spouses.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	The argument most often put forward to prove that the 
employment is not insurable in the case of women working for 
their spouses is this: The employer and employee are not dealing 
with each other at arm's length, hence there is no 
employer-employee relation. When examining the claims of 
these women, Revenue Canada may carry out all inquiries it 
deems appropriate at the workplace, including financial 
statements audit, analysis of bank statements, and study of the 
work organization in the plant or the office.
<P>
	In fact, the department is not seeking to establish eligibility 
but to prove fraud. I support Bill C-218 put forward by my 
colleague from Saint-Hubert to repeal this antiquated provision 
of the Unemployment Insurance Act that is so unfair to a certain 
category of women. There are 650,000 women in this situation. 
If they lost their job, these employees who work in a business 
controlled by their spouse, these workers described as wife 
associates, would not be eligible for unemployment insurance 
benefits because of their status.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7586"> 7586 </A></B>
<P>
	Again, wife associates represent the vast majority of 
exclusions under section 3(2)(<I>c</I>) of the existing legislation, 
which deprives women of their right to equality in matters 
related to unemployment insurance. In general, these women 
perform administrative duties in a family business, whether it is 
a farm or any other type of small business.
<P>
	They perform duties such as billing and accounting and 
respond to requests from suppliers and clients. A family 
business, like any other type of business, can experience serious 
financial difficulties. The wife associate can be laid off and stop 
receiving a salary. We think that, since she contributed to the 
unemployment insurance program, it would be quite normal that 
she be eligible for benefits.
<P>
	This injustice toward women is particularly obvious in 
agriculture. In 1988, 6,066 Quebec women had titles of 
ownership in a farming enterprise. In 1993 their number had 
almost doubled. For their work on the farm, 43 per cent of 
respondents to a survey say that they are paid, either through a 
salary or through profit sharing or through investments made in 
their name.
<P>
	The survey also shows that 33 per cent of those women earn 
off-farm revenues. Obviously, women with such earnings make 
a large contribution to the operation of the family farm. What, 
then is the difference between women who earn their living in 
the family business and those who do so elsewhere?
<P>
	Both groups of women are equally dependent on the farm and 
pay UI premiums, but their status is different when they become 
unemployed. Again, that is blatantly unfair to a group of 
working women.
<P>
	It is not a matter of whether a wife is dependent on her 
husband. In any normal couple, the wife is no more dependent 
on her husband than he is on her. It is a matter of being fair to a 
group of working women. That is why we support Bill C-218, 
which proposes that section 3(2)(c) of the Unemployment 
Insurance Act be repealed. The Bloc Quebecois refuses to wait, 
as was suggested at first reading, for the Liberal comprehensive 
reform of social programs, a reform that will never achieve 
national consensus in any case. I urge all the women in the 
House, including those in the Liberal government, to support 
this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Saint-Hubert has presented the House with 
a matter which I am sure concerns us all and that is the fairness 
of our rules and regulations. This government most certainly 
does not wish to discriminate against anyone.
<P>
	The question in the circumstances raised by the hon. member 
is whether or not discrimination is occurring. Her bill argues 
that because the majority of people affected by section 3(2)(c) of 
the Unemployment Insurance Act are women the section 
discriminates against women.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	I admire the hon. member's concern but this section does not 
discriminate against women nor does it discriminate against any 
relative involved in an employer-employee relationship. The 
intent of the section is to ensure that genuine legal 
employer-employee relationships exist in businesses that 
involve relatives. That is hardly an unreasonable requirement.
<P>
	The House has heard some interesting arguments on this 
matter but if my hon. colleagues consider what could happen if 
the act did not have safeguards I think they would agree we 
would be in a real quandary.
<P>
	Section 3(2)(c) of the act requires only that those affected by 
it satisfy the Unemployment Insurance Commission that they 
qualify for UI coverage just as any other employee. It is merely 
one of the regulations set out to protect the program's integrity. I 
do not hear hon. members arguing that employees not related to 
their boss should be exempt from proving a legal 
employer-employee relationship, so why should employees 
who are related be exempt? That would be the effect of passing 
Bill C-218.
<P>
	Family employees should certainly have the same rights as 
any other employee. However I trust the hon. member will agree 
that family employees should also have to meet the same 
requirements to be eligible for UI benefits. That is all section 
3(2)(c) requires. To have it otherwise would then discriminate 
against employees not related to their employer. The regulation 
treats everyone in the same manner, which is the way it should 
be.
<P>
	One word we have heard frequently in the remarks of my 
colleagues is fairness. I would like to expound briefly on how 
the government has used fairness, not as a political slogan but as 
a philosophy. Fairness or equality or whatever synonym you 
wish to use is a cornerstone on which this country's social 
security system was built. Indeed it may be argued that it is the 
cornerstone on which the entire country was founded.
<P>
	I do not for a moment claim that every program is perfect or 
that these programs do not have loopholes that unjustly deny 
people their due. I will state however that fairness has been and 
will continue to be the watchword  for this government. We will 
strive to close loopholes wherever and whenever we find them.
<P>
	A case in point is a recent series of changes to the UI program 
which took effect in July. We realize that reducing the benefit 
rate to 55 per cent would represent an undue hardship to people 
with lower incomes who have dependants. That is why we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7587"> 7587 </A></B>
<P>
introduced the dependency benefit rate which gives a 60 per cent 
benefit rate to people in these circumstances.
<P>
	A decision to reduce the benefit rate was indeed a tough one. 
However we tried to be as fair as we could by minimizing the 
impact of this change on those who could least afford it. It is this 
spirit of fairness that embodies the provision which so concerns 
the hon. member.
<P>
	As my colleague has pointed out this provision allows family 
members to collect UI. In the past they simply were not eligible. 
Yes it is true there is a little bit more paperwork involved in 
these cases. I hasten to point out that among the tens of 
thousands of UI claims filed by family businesses in the 
1992-93 fiscal year only 15,000 were reviewed by Revenue 
Canada. The great majority of individuals employed by a 
relative simply filled out the forms necessary to qualify for UI 
and they received their benefits.
<P>
	Therefore I can say with great sincerity and with all due 
respect to the hon. member that her concerns are exaggerated. 
No one is questioning the intentions of the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert regarding this matter. She is undoubtedly 
addressing what she perceives to be an injustice but I would say 
to her and to all hon. members that during the review of our 
social security system there will be plenty of opportunity to 
present constructive recommendations for reform of the UI 
program.
<P>
	In our discussion paper the government has proposed a 
number of possible approaches to adjust and strengthen 
unemployment insurance so that it serves all Canadians. That is 
the context in which we should be looking at the UI Act. 
Everyone most certainly recognizes that UI is very much a key 
element of social security.
<P>
	I am sure that when hon. members hear from their 
constituents they are finding more and more people are working 
in what we refer to as non-standard employment. There is a 
considerable increase in the number of part time, self-employed 
and multiple job holders. And yes, there is also a significant 
increase in family run businesses.
<P>
	We need to look at the whole picture. We need to consider 
whether we should develop an entirely new unemployment 
insurance program that will address the needs of workers in the 
changing economic structure, or whether we can adequately 
adjust our present UI program to serve the needs of a rapidly 
diversifying workforce. Whichever approach, the government 
has stressed that social security reform is a partnership. We want 
input from anyone who has constructive ideas.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Saint-Hubert will have an opportunity 
to present her ideas and the government will be pleased to give 
her submissions every consideration.
<P>
	At this time, while I appreciate the intent of her bill, I regret 
that I cannot support it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to debate the bill 
presented by the hon. member for Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	Like my colleagues, I recognize the hon. member's intent in 
presenting this bill which is to correct a perceived injustice. I 
would ask her and all hon. colleagues to remember that the bill 
received first reading prior to the government's discussion 
paper on social security reform. Perhaps if the hon. member had 
known the extent of the proposed revisions to the unemployment 
insurance program she would have seen fit to wait and put 
forward her ideas in that context.
<P>
	As the old saying goes, I do not want to keep flogging a dead 
horse, but I honestly believe that Canadians want their elected 
representatives to consider revisions to the UI program in the 
context of social security reform. I am sure the hon. member 
sees the logic of evaluating her suggestion in that context.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saint-Hubert talks about injustice but 
there is no injustice in doing everything possible to maintain the 
integrity of our unemployment insurance program. I can state 
unequivocally that the majority of UI claimants are honest, 
law-abiding citizens and we need not fear that they will try to 
take advantage of the unemployment insurance system.
<P>
	However that does not preclude us from being diligent in 
ensuring that UI benefits go only to those who meet the 
necessary conditions. We must be accountable. Canadians 
expect their elected representatives to do everything in their 
power to ensure the viability of our social security system.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to look at it another way for a 
moment. Just last week the Minister of Finance made it 
abundantly clear that the government will fulfil its commitment 
and meet its deficit reduction target, that is 3 per cent of the 
gross domestic product at the end of the third term in office. It 
has been made very clear that this goal will be met. There is no 
doubt about that. We can help by keeping costs as low as 
possible in our social security programs.
<P>
	We have already tried to do what we can to save UI funds 
through other measures. I am thinking of such things as 
lowering the premium rate which we estimate will create or 
preserve about 40,000 additional jobs. These jobs mean that 
people will pay into the fund rather than take money out of it. 
Besides that, we have to do everything possible to ensure that 
the system is used for the purpose for which it was intended.
<P>
	Now that we have heard hon. members argue that arm's length 
provisions discriminate against women since  they are often the 
ones employed by their husbands in a family business, as the 
kids say today: ``Let's get real''. When it comes to making 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7588"> 7588 </A></B>
<P>
revisions to UI, we have been mindful of the particular needs of 
Canadian working women.
<P>
	One measure we have taken, as hon. members have 
mentioned, is to bring the dependency benefit rate of 60 per cent 
for low income earners who are supporting a dependant or 
whose spouse is supporting a dependant. We estimate that 
approximately 240,000 claimants are helped by the dependency 
benefit rate. I can assure my hon. colleague that the majority are 
working women. If hon. members want to do more for women 
then I encourage them to study the proposals for social security 
reform and to come up with positive, constructive ideas on how 
we an make improvements.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	It is easy to criticize but it gets us nowhere. It is just the easy 
thing to do. The hon. member whose bill we are debating today 
is down on the government because the government is being 
responsible and protecting the integrity of the unemployment 
insurance system, a system that has served Canadians well for 
more than half a century.
<P>
	Just what are we asking under this provision of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act? Are we asking workers to do 
anything more than ensure the UI branch that they are genuinely 
in an employer-employee relationship? No, we are not. We are 
simply requesting that workers fill out the required forms and let 
us know the precise nature of their working relationship with a 
family member. This is not too much to ask if it helps reduce the 
UI deficit and maintain the fund's integrity.
<P>
	It would not surprise me at all if the majority of individuals in 
this situation would support this requirement because it will 
guarantee that working for their relative fulfils their obligations 
under the act of employer-employee relationship.
<P>
	I implore the hon. member not to use the scattered shotgun 
approach to fixing problems to UI and other social problems. 
Let us look carefully at the whole package, as we are presently 
doing. During our review of the system the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert and all hon. colleagues will have every 
opportunity to present constructive ideas on changes to UI. I 
encourage them to do so in that context.
<P>

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Standing Order 44(2) in part states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2)a reply shall be allowed to a member who has moved a substantive 
motion-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3)In all cases the Speaker shall inform the House that the reply of the mover 
of the original motion closes the debate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Since no other members are rising, I will recognize the hon. 
member for Saint-Hubert, who will close the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to start by thanking hon. members for their interest 
throughout this debate on Bill C-218. I particularly want to 
express my thanks to members who have solidly supported a 
cause that is just and democratic, a cause that is reflected in Bill 
C-218.
<P>
	However, we cannot close this debate without responding to 
certain claims that repealing paragraph 3(2)<I>(c)</I> of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act would inevitably increase the 
likelihood of abuse and fraud and lead to a sharp increase in UI 
claims.
<P>
	I refer more specifically to what was said by the hon. member 
for Yorkton-Melville who, on April 21, expressed his 
apprehensions about Bill C-218. The hon. member's fears are 
clearly ill-founded. The hon. member seems to think that 
paragraph 3(2)<I>(c)</I> of the Unemployment Insurance Act is a 
punitive provision. The sole purpose of this section is to 
discriminate against a substantial part of the population that 
contributes to the fund and pays premiums but is treated unfairly 
and inequitably when the time comes to claim benefits. These 
individuals, who may have paid unemployment insurance 
premiums throughout their working lives, are denied the 
benefits to which they are entitled because a public servant at 
the Department of National Revenue has decided that their 
employment is not insurable and that as a result, they cannot 
receive these benefits.
<P>
	I referred earlier to concerns that were expressed by the hon. 
member for Yorkton-Melville. I think he can take some 
comfort from sections 73 and 74 of the act and from the powers 
of investigation conferred under sections 92 to 106 of the same 
act. The purpose of such provisions is to deter potential 
offenders. The Unemployment Insurance Act already 
incorporates procedures to curb abuse and prevent fraud. Stiff 
penalties are already provided for with respect to anyone who 
would dare to contravene the act. This means that, as it stands 
and regardless of paragraph 3(2)(<I>c</I>), the act already has teeth and 
can bite.
<P>
	Opponents of this bill also quoted some interesting statistics, 
showing that, on average, 85 per cent of benefit claims are found 
to be admissible after review. Opponents of Bill C-218, and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development in particular, 
maintain these are very satisfactory results. The parliamentary 
secretary is glad that the vast majority of benefit claims are not 
fraudulent.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	How can he allege that the very existence of paragraph 3(2)(<I>c</I>) 
is justified? How can we claim that the act as it now stands is fair 
and equitable to 85 per cent of those who must wait months and 
even years before a decision is made as to whether or not their 
jobs are covered by UI?
<P>
	These people, the majority of which are women who help run 
the family business, are honest people with no intention of 
committing fraud. Yet, they are treated like cheats until they can 
prove otherwise.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	The member for Calgary North added insult to injury when 
she said in the House on September 20:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If a woman works for her husband in a small business, then she must be 
prepared to convince Revenue Canada that she is in fact in a true 
employee-employer relationship [-]</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is very wrong that in 1994 women in family businesses must 
still have to prove that they are really working, as though their 
work were not real and these women were only foils for their 
husbands. It is this kind of archaic thinking that underlies the 
philosophy of the present law and denies working wives and 
dependants the same protection and benefits as the rest of the 
population.
<P>
	This is an opportunity to say loudly and clearly in this House 
that we cannot close our eyes and give our tacit consent to such 
an unfair and unjust law. I therefore ask hon. members to vote 
for Bill C-218 and above all to think of all those who are still 
waiting for a decision from a revenue department official.

	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALPROGRAMREFORM">SOCIAL PROGRAM REFORM</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, 
NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the week before last I raised a question in 
the House with the Deputy Prime Minister about the proposals in 
the green paper for post-secondary education funding.
<P>
	We all know that there is much in the green paper which talks 
about the importance of education, skills upgrading and training 
to Canadians and to Canada in terms of our ability to compete in 
the new world economy.
<P>
	I am glad to see those comments in the green paper but the 
proposals which the Minister of Human Resources Development 
goes on to suggest for post-secondary education belie this 
rhetoric.
<P>
	The minister is proposing that the $2.6 billion which each 
year goes to the provinces for post-secondary education instead 
go to students in the form of loans. We remember that federal 
government transfers to the provinces were first cut by the 
Liberal government prior to 1984. Those cuts were continued by 
the Mulroney government through the 1980s and into the 1990s 
and of course, as we all remember, were vigorously criticized by 
the Liberal Party while in opposition. Now the Liberals are back 
in government and those cuts continue.
<P>
	The government rationale here appears to be that the cash 
portion of post-secondary education funding coming from the 
federal government to the provinces is going to disappear 
anyway because of this trend begun first by the Liberals and 
continued by the Conservatives. As it is going to disappear why 
worry about tuition fees going up, they are going up already. Let 
us just let them go up even further.
<P>
	What the government is planning to do in spite of arguing, 
quite rightly, for the importance of post-secondary education, is 
planning to slash $2.6 billion from post-secondary education 
and make that available as loans to students and have an income 
contingency loan repayment system.
<P>
	The contradiction is quite clear. It is time the government 
recognized that it cannot say good things about post-secondary 
education and then cut funding to post-secondary education and 
expect Canada to compete in the world economy.
<P>
	The imposing of a heavy burden of loans on students will of 
course lead to less accessibility of education as more and more 
potential students decide that they simply cannot afford to incur 
such heavy loans.
<P>
	A study in Australia which has a similar program to that being 
proposed by the government has found that the average man 
repays 50 per cent of his loan by the age of 28 years but it takes 
an average woman until she is 38 years old in order to pay 50 per 
cent of that loan because of the difference in earning capacity for 
women. We know that Canadian women earn significantly less 
than Canadian men and thus they will be the most heavily 
burdened by this process.
<P>
	Perhaps the most cynical and disturbing part of this proposal 
is what this government is doing is saying to Canadians and to 
Canada that the agreement that we have always regarded as 
important, that post-secondary education is an important 
contribution both to the student and to Canada as a society, is no 
longer the case.
<P>
	What this government is saying is that the burden of paying 
for post-secondary education and thereby the benefits will all 
fall to the student and Canada will not benefit in the slightest. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7591"> 7591 </A></B>
<P>
This completely contradicts every study done in Canada since 
the Massey commission in  1951. It is stupid and the government 
should change its strategy and position on this.
<P>
	It has done a good job of politicizing students in 1994. I am 
glad to see the students have seen through this government's 
action on this. I urge the government to change its policy and 
make post-secondary education an investment in Canada and 
Canadians and stop imposing the burden on Canadian students.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond.
<P>
	Under the present system Canada spends a lot, about $16 
billion, on post-secondary education. The federal government 
alone spends $8 billion annually. The cash portion of the EPF 
transfers to the provinces is slowly ratcheting down. As the cash 
portion decreases the invisible portion which is given to the 
provinces through tax points is increasing. This is an invisible 
endowment to the provinces which will grow from about $4 
billion in 1996-97 to $6 billion within 10 years.
<P>
	The provinces will make the decision whether or not to pass 
on some or all of this cash reduction to students. Nobody yet 
knows how much will actually be passed on. That remains to be 
seen. Many factors will influence their decisions.
<P>
	At the same time we face different pressing realities. 
Government resources are shrinking but more people need more 
education to get and to keep a job. Full time college and 
university enrolments are up 36 per cent since 1981 and 3 
million workers, 25 per cent of the workforce, want to upgrade 
their skills and cannot afford it.
<P>
	The discussion paper asks whether the federal government's 
role should remain as is or whether we should develop a more 
strategic approach. One option proposed in the green paper is to 
use the cash to invest in a new permanent program to provide 
more loans and grants to individual students.
<P>
	Each $1 we spend could mean $4 in loans, $500 million could 
mean $2 billion in loans. Instead of declining cash loans would 
remain constant. Along with tax transfers this would mean the 
total resources available to the post-secondary education 
system would continue to grow in order to meet increasing 
demands for more learning opportunities for more Canadians.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ETHICS">ETHICS</A></H4>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in this adjournment debate to ask more questions and try to get 
some clarification about this ongoing saga that has continued in 
the front benches.
<P>
	I would like to make the Chair aware again of the remarks I 
made on Friday where I asked the Prime Minister about his 
particular quote in which he said and I quote from <I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I consulted the government's ethics counsellor and the one I appointed for 
myself-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We asked questions about that and did not seem to get 
wonderful answers. The Prime Minister replied to me on Friday 
morning, October 28 and I quote from <I>Hansard</I> at page 7367:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The ethics counsellor was consulted yesterday and gave his advice. The 
advice he gave was given to me and it did not force me to change my mind 
about the decision I took a few days ago.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is pretty straightforward. It would seem to me that would 
make perfect sense if we took the Prime Minister at his word.
<P>
	However this morning the ethics counsellor appeared on 
national television, CBC Newsworld. I quote from the transcript 
that we were provided where the interviewer said: ``You're 
saying then that the Prime Minister at no point asked you to rule 
on the ethics of this letter''. Mr. Howard Wilson replied: ``No. 
That is quite clear. The Prime Minister indicated that he had 
handled it and came to the conclusion and he stated it''.
<P>
	This seems perfectly clear to me that the ethics counsellor in 
fact was not consulted, was not asked for his advice. There is a 
huge discrepancy here and we want to get to the bottom of it.
<P>
	There are any number of guidelines for cabinet ministers, the 
most recent of which I quote from, when we look at 
quasi-judicial bodies versus the judiciary. It would seem to me 
pretty straightforward again where these guidelines from the 
Privy Council Office in a confidential document say to 
ministers: ``You are advised to take very special care to avoid 
intervening, or appearing to intervene in cases under 
consideration by quasi-judicial bodies''. It is again fairly 
straightforward to me. It would seem like the minister certainly 
knew what his bounds were and he stepped outside of them.
<P>
	I would just like to finish before asking the parliamentary 
secretary to respond to this by pointing out that the Prime 
Minister has made it clear over and over again that you should 
not phone a judge no matter what. I refer to a situation that went 
on in the House yesterday and of course in the newspapers 
recently where the Prime Minister said that I was being dreadful 
for bringing up an incident in which he phoned a judge in 1971. 
Of course he said that he was just asking when the particular 
court case on this bankruptcy would be. That is fine. The <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> accused him further of saying that he had tried to 
intervene in that case.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	Regardless the instance, regardless the circumstance, this 
Prime Minister stood in his place a number of times in the last 
week and said that no cabinet minister should phone a judge 
ever, for any reason, period. That seems fairly straightforward 
to me.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7592"> 7592 </A></B>
<P>
	We are trying to get to the bottom of this. I hope that we get 
further answers and further clarification from the parliamentary 
secretary right now.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the 
question of October 28.
<P>
	In our parliamentary system it is the Prime Minister who is 
ultimately accountable for the actions of his government and 
who must answer to Parliament and to the public. There can be 
no substitute for responsibility at the top. It is the Prime 
Minister who sets the moral tone for the government and who 
makes the ultimate decisions when issues of trust and integrity 
are raised. That is what leadership is all about. As the Prime 
Minister said yesterday during question period, the buck stops 
here.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor plays a very important role in advising 
the Prime Minister in conflict of interest issues, but at the end of 
the day it is the Prime Minister who must make the decisions. He 
must make the decision about membership in the cabinet. 
Creating an ethics counsellor with a reporting relationship to 
Parliament will not change this fact.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor envisioned in the red book had a focus 
on lobbying. This government extended that to a much broader 
range of ethical issues, including administering and enforcing 
the revised conflict of interest code which replaced the old 
conflict of interest guidelines.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor's responsibilities in the two domains of 
conflict of interest and lobbying put him in a unique position to

	The ethics counsellor is available to the Prime Minister to 
investigate allegations of impropriety by public officeholders 
and to advise the Prime Minister accordingly, but he is only an 
adviser. At the end of the day the Prime Minister is ultimately 
responsible for ministers and senior officials.
<P>
	Under Bill C-43, the lobbyists registration bill, the ethics 
counsellor has independent powers with respect to the lobbying 
industry. If there are grounds to believe there has been a

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Friday I raised a question with the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to whom I had given notice. Eleven ministers of 
agriculture for Canada had agreed to an initiative to help with 
community development, particularly concerning child care. 
The Department of Human Resources Development had 
allocated some $720 million for 150,000 child care spaces in 
this budget year. I was asking how much of that would be 
dedicated to rural child care.
<P>
	I raised this question because we have just come through a 
harvest season which is a very busy time on farms. As always 
there have been reports of some injuries to children because of 
the exigencies of harvest.
<P>
	The modern farm is not the idyllic place that we read or think 
of in mythology. There are huge machines around. There is 
noise. There are chemicals. There are factory type buildings. 
There are sinkholes that children can get caught in. There are 
grain augers. There are all sorts of hazards for children. It is not 
a place particularly for very small children to be involved. 
However, both parents of necessity are required to contribute to 
the work, especially in busy times and it is unsafe and quite 
impractical for those children to be among the machinery and 
animals on the farms.
<P>
	There has always been difficulty in setting up child care 
facilities for rural areas because of the low population and great 
distances and the need for very flexible hours. Families will 
sometimes need child care for short periods of time during 
harvest and seeding that would run from eight o'clock in the 
morning until 10 or 11 at night. The rules that have been set out 
for urban child care just are not adequate and do not fit.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	For the decade and a half that I have been in this Chamber, I 
know of groups that have been trying to find a model for rural 
child care that is flexible, that will work, and that provides all of 
the requirements for children and still provides the basic 
necessities available for urban child care but can be adapted to 
rural communities.
<P>
	We have watched a model of child care develop at Langruth, 
Manitoba. That very small community of some 500 souls has 
developed a child care facility that meets all of those 
requirements. It has been in operation for about two and a half 
years and provides child care for some 40 children. It is 
considered to have overcome most of the organizational 
problems, the service delivery models and particularly provides 
the required flexibility.
<P>
	There is an old saying that it takes an entire village to raise a 
child. All communities whether they are strung out rural 
communities or local neighbourhoods in cities understand that. 
Particularly in an era of the global village we understand that the 
whole of society must contribute to the raising of a child. 
Therefore it is only fair that the money which has been allocated 
for child care should also be equally available to rural families.
<P>
	I would hope that the government would state how much, 
what proportion and what its plans-

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order please. The hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the 
member for Mackenzie.
<P>
	This government is committed to improving child care in 
Canada. In its red book the government committed itself to 
investing $720 million toward that end. The intent is to expand 
existing child care in Canada by 150,000 new quality child care 
spaces, 50,000 to be phased in over the next three year period.
<P>
	The implementation of the federal initiative will be done in 
co-operation with the provinces since child care is a provincial 
responsibility. Initial discussions with provincial authorities 
have shown that rural child care is a priority for any new 
spending. However no decisions have been taken yet on the 
allocation of spaces. The provinces will decide on the 
distribution of funds and services to their rural communities. 
During these discussions most provinces indicated a preference 
for rural population in new cost sharing arrangements with the 
federal government.
<P>
	In his question, the member referred to Langruth, Manitoba as 
a model for delivering rural child care. This centre is an 
excellent example of federal-provincial co-operation. The 
centre became operational through provincial support and 
federal funding under the child care initiatives fund program. 
The centre's program is designed to meet the specific child care 
needs identified by families living in that rural community.
<P>
	I would remind the member for Mackenzie that the federal 
government currently contributes significantly to the cost of 
child care services in Canada. The federal government is 
contributing in excess of $400 million annually to support child 
care services mainly through the Canada assistance plan. 
Clearly that is not enough and more needs to be done. The 
human resources minister tabled a discussion paper on social 
security reform which addressed the whole issue of child care. 
Page 53 is the reference.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to invite the member for Mackenzie to 
submit any proposals on how we could develop child care in 
rural parts of Canada to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. I am sure he would be very interested.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am here today to pursue a question that I asked of the Deputy 
Prime Minister. The Minister of Transport was not in the House 
at the time but I asked the Deputy Prime Minister whether or not 
letters that were being sent to the Prime Minister with respect to 
something the Minister of Transport had said would be 
answered.
<P>
	These letters are from the Brotherhood of Locomotive 
Engineers and the United Transportation Union and others. They 
were calling on the Prime Minister to ask the Minister of 
Transport to apologize for remarks that he had made and to 
which railroaders had taken offence.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	Subsequent to my question and to putting in for this 
adjournment debate the Minister of Transport had an 
opportunity to explain what he had to say in the House during 
question period earlier today.
<P>
	I listened carefully to what he said. I think he could probably 
bring the matter to a close if he had added, and perhaps that is 
what he wants to do now, that if people took offence at what he 
said that he would apologize. He explained himself earlier today 
but did not actually apologize. Clearly some very sincere 
offence was taken at what the minister said. I look forward to 
what he has to say.
<P>
	While I have him here and because I have so much difficulty 
in communicating with the minister on the floor of the House, 
perhaps he might also want to comment on a couple of other 
matters.
<P>
	Recently a colleague of his, the member for Thunder 
Bay-Nipigon said that we would be better off without 
Churchill in the Canadian port system. This runs directly 
contrary to promises made by the Liberals in Manitoba during 
the last election.
<P>
	Another matter has to do with Manitoba and Liberal promises 
during the last election has to do with the Liberals making a lot 
of promises in Winnipeg with respect to stopping the flow of 
jobs from Winnipeg to Edmonton on the part of CN. Subsequent 
to the election of the new government, CN has announced that it 
will be moving its rail traffic control centre and its crew calling 
offices from Winnipeg to Edmonton in 1995.
<P>
	Here we have two Liberal promises to Manitoba, that 
Churchill would be revived and that the bleeding of jobs from 
Winnipeg to Edmonton on the part of CN would be stopped. 
What do we have? We have the rail traffic control and the crew 
calling jobs being transferred from Winnipeg to Edmonton, and 
we have a Liberal chair of a committee looking into ports and the 
seaway, et cetera, saying that we would be better off without 
Churchill.
<P>
	I hope the minister can deal with these matters, repudiate the 
member for Thunder Bay-Nipigon and say that Churchill is 
still part of the plan for the Liberal government. Could he also 
say that pursuant to the promises made by his colleague, the 
member for Winnipeg South and the minister of human 
resources, that the Ministry of Transport and the government 
will be instructing CN to stop this constant diminution of 
Winnipeg as a rail centre by transferring jobs to Edmonton.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for recognizing that I had 
tried to explain the context in which the remarks were made in 
Winnipeg.
<P>
	I do not know the rules on this, but let me explain with respect 
to Churchill. There is a marine review going on and Churchill 
will be addressed as well as the comments made by my hon. 
friend whom he mentioned in his speech.
<P>
	With respect to jobs in Winnipeg, CN has just announced 
hundreds of jobs in Winnipeg. I was there a couple of weeks ago 
and that was confirmed, so there has been an effort to retain 
some jobs there.
<P>
	I want to address specifically the question that was raised a 
couple of weeks ago. In the 1950s and 1960s, thousands of CN 
employees worked in my province and many times I heard about 
the challenges that employees faced when representing their 
union brothers in trying to improve salaries, working conditions 
and safety conditions.
<P>
	Many of these men to whom I spoke and listened to were 
veterans of World War I and II, like Luc Roussel and Bill Dunn 
who I mentioned this afternoon. They were very proud of what 
they had achieved in their military service but they understood 
they had very limited educations which was through no fault of 
their own. They had fought for their country and then they 
fought for their rights as workers, faced by highly skilled 
lawyers, negotiators for powerful railroad interests.
<P>
	I said in Winnipeg that all parties today have to recognize 
their responsibilities with respect to where railroads are and 
what is happening, whether it is government or management. I 
also said that under no circumstances would I point a finger at 
those achievements arrived at by men who in many instances 
had only grades 7, 8 or 9 education who worked very hard at 
protecting their rights and the interests of those who have 
succeeded them.
<P>
	Everybody in that room in Winnipeg, with the exception of 
the three people who walked out, knew exactly what I meant. It 
was a compliment to people who had made an enormous effort in 
the face of very difficult odds to achieve rights that were theirs.
<P>
	I want to take up my friend's suggestion and apologize to 
anyone who has been mislead by the way those remarks were 
interpreted. I apologize if anyone felt slighted by them because 
those achievements were remarkable in those days. Now I think 
it is time for us to move on and make sure that the railroaders of 
today have a future by making sure the conditions they work in 
and the railroads they work for can be viable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.11 p.m.)
