</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-449, an act to amend the Employment Insurance 
Act (parental benefits). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the 1996 national longitudinal survey on 
children and youth found that 25% of Canadian children entered 
adult life with significant emotional, behavioural, academic or 
social problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore investing in early childhood development is an 
imperative, not an option.  This bill responds in part to this 
need by providing more flexibility, options and choices to 
parents, by amending the Employment Insurance Act to provide one 
full year of maternity or parental leave benefits under that act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to introduce this bill and I look forward to 
earning the support of my colleagues in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B> Mr.Speaker, 
I move that the first report of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans presented on Monday, March 23, be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit I have been waiting an entire 
year and a half in this House in order to debate the east coast 
report and to move concurrence on what I consider to be an 
outstanding and fabulous report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing that has to be remembered is that this report 
does not come from the Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans.  We tabled it in the House but the report is actually a 
reflection of all the witnesses and all the people by the 
thousands who came to all the meetings in November 1997 in 
Newfoundland, Quebec, the New Brunswick region, Nova Scotia and 
P.E.I. This is an outstanding report that five political parties 
in this House can agree to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the election and the campaign in June 1997 the 
reporters, the pundits and even ourselves were calling it 
possibly a pizza parliament.  If a pizza parliament can put 
together what I consider an excellent report, then so be it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the government's response in September 1998 to this 
east coast report?   Absolutely scandalous.  The government 
completely whitewashed the report and ignored the recommendations 
of nine of its own members.  Absolutely scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go on to specific details within the report. When the 
east coast report came through, committee members got together 
and said they cannot be in Ottawa making recommendations or 
conclusions on what to do with the thousands of lives of the 
people on the east coast. They decided to go to these communities 
and talk to the people and write down what they were told, put it 
in a report and table it.  For the first time in a long time the 
standing committee actually agreed unanimously to put this report 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report is a triumph of east coast fishermen, plant workers 
and their families over the adversities and policies of the 
current DFO and the past DFO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had 16 ministers in the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans in the last 11 years.  Everybody knows they use this 
department as a revolving door to move forward on to other 
grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> A spawning ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  It is a spawning ground for future 
references or future movements by ministers.  That is one of the 
key problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem with DFO is it is very stagnant.  It has well 
over 800 people at 200 Kent Street and not one of them is 
catching any fish or setting any fish in the Hull River or the 
Rideau Canal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the serious recommendations we made in this report is 
that DFO seriously downsize and move to the coastlines to where 
the resource is so it can have a better handle on what goes on on 
all three coasts of Canada and our inland waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The east coast report seriously condemns the government and the 
bureaucracy within DFO.  It is one of the changes that has to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody on the east coast except for those who are involved in 
the ITQ and the big corporates which were funded by this and 
previous governments agree with the government.  Ninety-five per 
cent of all people in the fishing industry on the east coast 
vehemently disagree with the current policies and practices of 
DFO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are they continuously ignored?  They are continuously 
ignored because they do not have a voice in Ottawa.  They did not 
have a voice until this report came out.  What is the 
government's response?  A complete whitewash of this report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely scandalous that parties as diverse as the 
Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois, the Progressive Conservatives, 
the New Democratic Party and the Liberal Party can agree to this 
report only to have it turned around and voted against by their 
own members because of the pressure tactics of the Prime Minister 
and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an absolute whitewash.  It is an absolute scandal that we 
can spend all this money touring those provinces on the east 
coast only to have the report completely ignored by the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans and by the bureaucrats in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, this government has spent over $4 billion since 1988 
readjusting the people on the east coast out of the fishery.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has there been any great improvement over the years?  Absolutely 
not.  The lives of thousands and thousands of people have been 
totally disrupted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the attitude of the centrally based Canadian government? 
Move.  Just get up and move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons I decided to run as a member of parliament 
followed what the Prime Minister of the day said in a late 
November or early December town hall meeting on the CBC.  A woman 
very passionately and eloquently told him that she had her 
education, that she was trying to look after her children and 
that she was finding it difficult to get a job.  She asked the 
Prime Minister what he and his government could do to help her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's answer at that time was “In life some 
people are lucky, some are not.  You may have to move.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite obvious that that attitude permeates the entire 
Liberal government.  All that is heard by the people who have 
worked for centuries in the resource is “you have to move”. 
That is an attitude that is absolutely despised on the east coast 
of Canada and in northern Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report exemplifies the courage, the stamina and the wisdom 
of people on the east coast.  The fact of the matter is that 
these people know the resource better than any of us.  They have 
worked it for hundreds and hundreds of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the tragedies of the policies of DFO, at the 
beginning of this year the town of Canso, Nova Scotia, which is a 
wonderful small coastal community, after over 400 years of 
self-sufficiency, will have to claim civic bankruptcy.  It is the 
first time it has ever had to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the young people are leaving and all of the businesses 
are slowly shutting down for one specific reason:  the town had 
no access to fish.  What they did get was minuscule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Friday before last I took a tour of Canso and the town of 
Mulgrave, Nova Scotia.  Mulgrave has the only shrimp peeling and 
processing plant in all of Nova Scotia.  Earlier this year the 
government of the day, in its wisdom, gave 28,000 additional 
metric tonnes to Newfoundland and Labrador.  Not one tiny little 
shrimp went to the town of Mulgrave.  These people begged, they 
pleaded, they argued, they did every single thing that could be 
done to convince DFO that all they wanted to have was 2,000 
metric tonnes of that 28,000 metric tonne allocation.  They got 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the provincial Liberals with their current minister of 
fisheries, Mr. Colwell, and Mr. MacLellan, the premier of Nova 
Scotia, did absolutely nothing to help these people.  That means 
that the premier of Nova Scotia has absolutely no clout with his 
current friends in the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of this will be that at the end of this year the town 
of Mulgrave will lose its shrimp peeling plant.  It will move to 
Newfoundland where it can have access to the shrimp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The owner of ACS Trading is a business person.  He loves the 
town of Mulgrave.  He pays very good wages to the people when 
they can get work, but the fact is that they have no access to 
the shrimp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a business person he will have to move his plant to 
Newfoundland where they have excess access to shrimp.  Parts of 
Newfoundland are asking for Nova Scotian boats to go up there and 
help them catch all the quota they have.  It is like a Klondike 
with the shrimp up there.  Mulgrave got absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to the town of Canso with respect to turbot. 
When I visited Canso there were 11 boats in the harbour, all of 
them from P.E.I.  Every one of those boats had lobster licences, 
they had crab licences and as a bonus to them all they had tuna 
licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this report we talk about adjacency.  Adjacency means that 
those people who live closest to the resource should have first 
access to the resource, working in conjunction with the other 
provinces in the area.  The problem is that Canso only has two 
tuna licences, while P.E.I. has hundreds.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These boats were catching tuna within a rock's throw of the dock 
in Canso.  The people in Canso watched all their tuna being 
caught by other provinces.  The people of Canso have no access to 
it, except for two little licences.  It is absolutely incredible 
that this government can pit one province against another.  The 
result is that these people have to go on EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, with the changes to EI, they cannot even do that.  They go 
right to social assistance.  These people have all the pride, all 
the love and all the hard-working skills to maintain themselves 
in a productive society.  What is this government's response?  It 
turns around and hits them and hits them and hits them with bad 
regulations that will do absolutely nothing for their future and 
their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the ultimate answer from this government?  Move.  In a 
town where their great, great grandfathers and grandmothers are 
buried, where all their ancestors lived, where they grew up, 
where they love to live, the response from this government is to 
move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Move to where?  Toronto?  Next fall 2,000 people at the Boeing 
plant, the McDonell Douglas plant, are going to lose their jobs. 
How are these people who fished all their lives going to compete 
for jobs with highly skilled people from the Boeing plant?  What 
is going to happen then?  It is absolutely criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish for once that members of the centrally based Canadian 
government would get out of their chairs, out of their offices 
and en masse go to the town of Canso to have a look at what is 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been 50 different requests in a year and a half from 
the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, from myself and 
from our party for the current Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
to go to Canso to speak to these people.  What is his answer? 
No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people even came up to Ottawa to speak to him.  What was 
his answer?  “I can't speak to these people”.  He is the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  His job is to speak to people 
from the fisheries and oceans world and he refuses to meet with 
them.  But he has absolutely no problem meeting with his friends, 
Mr. Bob Wright of the Oak Bay Marine Group, on the west coast. He 
receives one phone call and he is there.  Thousands of people on 
the east coast of Canada deserve and need this man's attention 
and his department's attention to the failures of the practices 
and policies of DFO, and the answer is no because it does not fit 
into the general plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion what I am going to be saying is exactly what has 
happened to these people and why it is happening.  The fact is, 
this government, in its slippery backhanded way, has privatized 
the fishery.  Through the ITQ system the five big corporations on 
the east coast control over 70% of the fishery resources on the 
east coast.  Right now they have 50% and through individual 
transfer quotas they have an additional 23%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a gentleman from the great town of Sambro, near 
Halifax.  He was 48 years old and had a grade five education.  I 
watched him baiting his lines and putting them into a bait box. 
He looked at me with all the experience of the world, with a 
really weathered face and said “You can have it this way in the 
fishing industry.  You can have one man make $210,000 a year, or 
you can have seven of them make $30,000 a year.  Make your 
choice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My choice was very simple.  People who can earn $30,000 a year 
are extremely proud people.  They are proud of who they are.  The 
recent Swissair disaster in Nova Scotia proved exactly how proud 
these people are.  That fisherman was one of those people who 
late at night risked his life to see if there was any possible 
way to recover bodies or survivors from that ill-fated flight. 
That is the type of people these fishers, plant workers and 
families are.  This government wants to shut down their 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least Joey Smallwood when he was premier of Newfoundland 
asked them to leave.  This government does not have the courtesy 
to meet with these people.  These people, to put it in ocean 
terms, are the salt of the earth.  It is an absolute disgrace. 
Every single Liberal member should be absolutely ashamed that 
these people can be treated that way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Liberals to go to the east coast to meet with these 
people.  I ask them to read the east coast report and ignore what 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and his useless bureaucrats 
have done.  I ask them to read it for themselves.  If they do not 
believe us, they should go there themselves, have a look and talk 
to these people.  Then they will understand once and for all that 
these people want to work.  They do not want the damn TAGS 
program.  They do not want the useless EI programs.  They do not 
want social welfare.  They just want to work.  These people have 
been working the resource for hundreds of years.  All they want 
to do is work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am giving this government one more chance to vote for 
concurrence in the east coast report.  There were nine Liberal 
members who voted for concurrence in the report at committee. 
They agreed to it.  It is a unanimous report.  When we have the 
vote today we are going to see those people sit like little sheep 
and vote against it because they have been whipped into cowardice 
and do not have the balls to stand by what they read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Perhaps the hon. 
member for Sackville—Eastern Shore will retract the statement 
and then proceed.  He has three minutes and 56 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, out of respect for the 
Chair and this House, I retract that last statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not have the courage to stand by what they wrote in the 
report.  Their own minister will not even go down to meet with 
these people.  The fact is that my beautiful province of Nova 
Scotia, the other three provinces of Atlantic Canada and Quebec 
have been devastated by the policies of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing this government has done with its so-called TAGS 
adjustment program is to off-load the responsibility for the care 
of these people onto the backs of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 1 over 9,000 people in Atlantic Canada had to apply 
for social assistance.  Before that they were either on the TAGS 
adjustment program or they were working, gainfully employed, but 
because of these policies they were destroyed by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are now the responsibility of the provinces.  What 
will the provinces do?  They will download that responsibility to 
the municipalities.  The municipalities will not be able to bear 
the burden.  We have the result of the town of Canso.  The people 
throw up their hands and say “We cannot handle it any more.  We 
have to claim civic bankruptcy in the new year”.  That is an 
absolute disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 we were in Catalina, Newfoundland, and there were 320 
kids in the school.  We were there in 1997 and it was down to 
125.  The town of La Scie, Newfoundland, does not have a 
volunteer fire department any more because all the guys left. 
There is no work for them any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how these Liberal people can sleep at night. 
Obviously they live in Ontario and Quebec.  They do not live in 
the areas that I represent.  Even the Liberal member for Labrador 
had tears in his eyes when we were talking to people in his area. 
These people are devastated and all he wants to do is help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give him, the member for Malpeque, the member for Miramichi 
and all of the other members who are from that region the 
opportunity to stand up once and for all for their people in 
Atlantic Canada and vote for concurrence in the east coast 
report. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too have travelled with the hon. member who just spoke 
and I have three questions I would like to ask him as he has 
again moved for concurrence in the report that was unanimous in 
having members rise in this House to stand up for their 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member knows, the former chairman of the fisheries 
committee was removed by the Government of Canada.  He has stated 
that publicly on the record.  He stated that before the media, 
along with other members of the committee.  I would like his 
comments on that.  Does he believe that the chairman was removed 
from the committee for speaking the truth and that other members 
of the committee were dealt with by the government in the same 
way and forced to vote against their report? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also ask the member if one of the major components of 
the report is that not only the minister but the current 
structure of DFO in every community is not working. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member for his comments on whether he believes 
the current structure of DFO can work or his comments on what he 
feels needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Reform Party 
member from Vancouver Island for his question.  He was with us on 
that tour.  We also had the opportunity to tour his province to 
discuss the concerns of the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I did not mention it in my speech, when I came to House 
of Commons I honestly believed that a committee could be 
independent of government.  I believed that a committee could 
listen to witnesses, write down their concerns in booklet form, 
in a pamphlet or in a report and present it to the House of 
Commons so that all Canadians could see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the response?  It was typical.  The government removed 
one of its most outspoken backbenchers, the member for 
Gander—Grand Falls.  He had fought for over 24 years for the 
rights of fisher people in his riding.  The response of the 
government was that he had to go.  The DFO could not handle the 
truth so the chairman of the committee was silenced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That chairman was able to bring five political parties together. 
We left our politics at the door and dealt with the problems on 
the east coast.  I congratulate the member for being able to do 
that and I scorn the government for removing him from the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the structure at DFO it absolutely has to change.  It 
has to get out of Ottawa and to where the resource is.  It has to 
start working with the people who work the resource.  We should 
do that right away. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened attentively to my colleague.  My question is based on 
what he was saying about the shrimp fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially we are dealing with Liberal provincial 
administrations in the four Atlantic provinces.  All this shrimp 
is being transferred to P.E.I. or to Labrador and Newfoundland 
for processing.  What does the government have against the 
premier of Nova Scotia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to clarify the shrimp 
issue, it was not transferred anywhere.  It was just given to 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ironic thing is that every time I rise to ask a question of 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans he is not here.  He happens 
to be the premier of Newfoundland at the same time so I have to 
ask the stand-in for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the Premier of Newfoundland has an 
awful lot of clout and an incestuous relationship with the people 
in DFO.  Because of that the rest of the provinces and Quebec are 
falling behind.  Our provincial premiers in the three provinces 
of Atlantic Canada and in Quebec have been unable to crack the 
dent within DFO and get it to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans does not want to meet 
with fisher people and their families, why would he want to meet 
with provincial premiers from those provinces? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would 
like to get some clarification from the NDP member who just 
spoke. I also want to congratulate him for caring about the 
groundfish fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did I hear that the government set up a committee with a 
majority of members from the Liberal Party of Canada and some 
opposition members? The committee drafted the report after 
hearing a number of witnesses from all over Canada, people who 
were experiencing problems relating to the fisheries, people who 
had been invited or who had asked to be invited by the committee 
to make representations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will agree that the government spent a lot of money on that 
committee, which was nothing but window dressing. 
The whole thing was just for show. The government said “We are 
listening to you, we are taking note of your claims and we will 
ask the minister, following your testimonies, to amend various 
clauses of the bill”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The report was unanimously approved and signed by all committee 
members. If I heard right, when the time comes to vote in this 
House, some members will go so far as to renege on their 
commitment and deny their involvement as well as the seriousness 
of the report, supposedly because the government does not 
recognize the time that members from the NDP, the Reform Party, 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Progressive Conservative Party have 
put into the report. We worked with diligence to produce that 
document. 
We members of this House have better things to do than just go 
through the motions when we sit on a parliamentary commission or 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the government and the members who sat on that 
committee to show some respect. When the House votes on the 
report, I hope that government members will rise and support it. 
I would appreciate it if the NDP member could tell the House, or 
explain more clearly, what happened to make these members vote 
against a report that they endorsed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I give praise to the nine 
Liberals who were on the previous committee.  They worked very 
hard.  I give the former chairperson top credit for the work he 
did.  The other eight Liberal members were extremely helpful.  I 
will not deny that for a second, but at the same time so were the 
members from the Reform Party, the members from the Bloc, the 
members from the Progressive Conservative Party and ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We actually got together and put our policies and politics aside 
to work on the problems of the east coast fishery.  It was a lot 
of fun to be part of that historical moment.  The co-operation 
and communication among all of us were fantastic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the member's question, the government voted against 
concurrence in the west coast report which was moved by the 
member for Vancouver Island North.  Those Liberals voted against 
it.  Some of them were not even here to vote against it although 
they were in Ottawa. If government members hold true to form I 
expect them to vote against it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are giving them the opportunity to stand in the 
House and prove one more time that the committee is not a waste 
of money, that when we meet these people in their communities, 
something the minister cannot or will not do, we actually listen. 
We offer them hope and encouragement to go on with their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have one more opportunity and I encourage every one 
of them to vote for concurrence in the east coast report.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on this motion by 
the NDP member because there is indeed a fundamental problem in 
Canada, whether in western, eastern or northern Canada, when it 
comes to fisheries management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Years ago, from 1922 to 1984 approximately, we benefited from 
devolution in the field of fisheries, and this was particularly 
true in Quebec. Then it stopped, and fisheries have done very 
poorly ever since. I would go so far as to say that the reason 
the fish are gone is because there is no more devolution. The 
fact of the matter is that the whole fisheries area has been 
terribly mismanaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All sorts of problems are being experienced. Two reports have 
been tabled in Parliament, but the federal government is still 
turning a deaf ear. 
In fact, the last report saw the chair of the committee resign 
and be replaced. Today, a new one is depicting a situation 
urgently requiring that the government act on this report. We 
are facing a crisis both on the west and the east coast. It is 
important that action be taken very soon, in the next few weeks 
or months.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should support this report and make sure that the government 
acts on it. Perhaps it has finally become clear that, with 
respect to fisheries as well as many other areas, the 
jurisdiction granted to the federal government under the 
constitutional document of 1867 should have been granted to a 
more local authority instead, an authority that could properly 
manage fisheries within that region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation of fisheries in western Canada, in the Pacific 
region, is not necessarily the same as in the Atlantic region, 
and the economic impact may not be the same either. We know how 
important salmon is to western Canada. Solutions must be found 
that are tailored to the situation over there. 
Viewed as a percentage of Quebec's overall economy, the fishery 
is not a key component.  But, for the regions affected, the 
Gaspé, the Magdalen Islands, the entire North Shore, the Gulf of 
St. Lawrence, the repercussions are serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be different solutions to this sort of problem in 
each of Canada's regions.  For many years now, a blanket 
approach has been taken.  Solutions have been imposed by the 
federal government, backed by technical and staff expertise that 
may be useful, but that does not include on-site visits to ensure 
that the decisions taken are advancing the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been forced to learn a great deal from the 
many errors made. 
Because there are no more fish in the oceans, the emphasis is on 
developing aquaculture.  This is a promising and important 
sector, but it should not be developed purely for lack of 
anything better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turn-of-the-century pictures depicted Europeans, Quebeckers and 
Canadians fishing off Canada's shores.  There were fish in 
abundance for people from throughout the world.  Today, we are 
faced with critical situations that have nothing to do with 
natural cataclysms and everything to do with bad management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the federal government has to approach this problem from 
a very different angle.  It has already received some very 
important messages from Canadian parliamentarians.  It is high 
time it listened.  It has to be able to tell the inhabitants of 
these regions that they have a future, that there will be better 
management in the future. 
This would also give local authorities improved control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the future of one's community is at stake, one takes a very 
different approach than if one were doing a report on the 
fishery for another part of Canada.  When one lives in Ottawa 
and does a study on the fishery in western Canada or in the 
maritimes, the implications are not the same as if one lived in 
the communities affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore hope the federal government will listen and that 
this House will take action on the member's motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened intently to the hon. member's statement and 
he is absolutely correct.  However I have a question for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After $4 billion being spent on readjusting the industry, 
thousands of people and hundreds of communities are in turmoil. 
The resource itself is in serious depletion and in serious 
trouble.  We have not even had an inquiry on this subject yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not agree with what I have been calling for since I got 
here, some form of a judicial inquiry into the practices and 
policies of DFO?  Would he not agree that an inquiry or a total 
review of the current DFO would be necessary? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, the present situation is rather 
desperate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago, the Atlantic groundfish strategy was put into 
place.  Judging by its words, the federal government's intent 
was to face the problem head on, and to try to find a solution. 
In practice, however, nothing has been done, and the program has 
served instead merely as a support program. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, people needed to survive, and they needed a minimum 
income to do so, but the fundamental objective of the program, 
which was to ensure diversity in regional economies, was not 
realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the hon. member is saying “Ought we not to have a 
committee, an in-depth study, a commission of inquiry?” Something 
to put the fisheries back on track.  We have to find the right 
solution, and we must not have commissions lasting two, three, 
four, five or ten years, because the situation is urgent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All manner of solutions have already been proposed by the people 
living on the coast, and proposals have been made in reports by 
various parliaments.  Let us find a solution.  It could be 
called a task force or go by some other name, but the important 
thing is that control over the decisions on this matter be given 
to elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have had proof already.  The government authorities 
have abandoned their responsibilities in this area, in many cases 
turning them over to people who did not necessarily share the 
same concerns for developing the regions in question.  The 
message I pick up from the hon. member is that yes, action is 
urgently needed, and that solutions require us to have a clear 
picture of the situation, but the action must be immediate. 
Action must be taken to allow these regional economies to get 
back on their feet promptly and not to have to continue to live 
with today's reality of a subsistence program for a number of 
years more, while the objective of economic diversification 
remains unmet. Nowadays, we no longer even dare refer to that 
objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The communities are up against a brick wall, with no future in 
sight.  If this were not the case, it would be worthwhile for 
the House to follow up on the hon. member's motion.

<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the hon. Bloc Quebecois member and also my colleague from 
Sackville—Eastern Shore for their comments about how important 
this east coast fishery report is for the Atlantic region.  It is 
of significance to my community of Halifax West where there are 
many fishing communities.  The importance of the recommendations 
in that report cannot be underscored enough in terms of how it 
will assist the people in those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member I find it very disturbing that people can deal with 
a report or an issue, come to a conclusion and then not have the 
strength and the courage of their convictions to vote in favour 
of what they decided was in the best interest of all. Before I 
entered politics I said that I would not allow politics to change 
me.  It saddens me as I sit in the House and watch time and time 
again the faces of people on the government side as they vote on 
issues in a manner other than which they believe. It is very 
discouraging. I have talked to many people individually.  We saw 
it happen with the APEC situation.  People have told me they 
believe in the human rights issues involved but when it came to 
the vote we saw a different thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report provides another opportunity for those people who 
are seriously concerned about the well-being of the fishers on 
the east coast.  It provides an opportunity for them to stand up 
and be counted and to do what is right in the eyes of all. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member's remarks made me think 
about the fact that the Bloc Quebecois critic on fisheries, the 
member for Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, is 
responsible for a committee covering between 70% and 80% of 
Quebec's fisheries.  The part not covered is the north shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This member has expertise in the area and has spent a lot of 
time in the past year working on a report.  He left it up to the 
Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans to produce a report 
on the situation in the Atlantic region. This report was 
unanimous on the whole situation.  The committee did a thorough 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was involved in consultations throughout the area and 
today he can say that the report on western Canada is valid as 
well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This Parliament should pay tribute to the members who took part 
in this task, especially those with expertise in the area, who 
claim to speak for the fisheries sector.  Their arguments should 
be heard and the report read so there will be a follow-up to 
provide a way out of the trap people are in today.  This trap 
has created a total catastrophe in the fishing industry. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask the member if he sees this as an overall pattern in the 
direction that the government goes.  The government denies or 
mismanages resources and forces people off the land and away from 
their resources, whether from the land or water.  Then the 
government makes it doubly difficult because the former support 
of unemployment insurance is no longer there to carry people 
through a hard time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if anyone in the House realizes this, but the 
fishery in the Yukon was severely affected this year.  Very few 
salmon came up the river.  The people who depend on it to catch 
three to fifteen fish a day to make it through the winter are no 
longer going to be able to do that. People do not think of the 
Yukon River flowing up into Dawson but it is dependent on the 
oceans and how we manage our oceans and the fisheries. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, the situation today in the fishing 
sector is the result of a fundamental choice made by “Canada's 
economic thinkers”, a few years ago.  Whether it be information 
on employment insurance reform or the government's budget 
choices, there is an underlying force encouraging people to move 
where there are jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision was made in Canada to no longer guarantee the 
future of communities.  Instead, the people in the communities 
would decide to go wherever the market required, regardless of 
their skills, expertise or the fact that they had raised 
families in a given community.  This basic choice underlies a 
number of government policies.  Today, several thousand people 
are living with the very negative effects of this choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member gave the agricultural sector as an example, but the 
same situation exists in the fishing industry.  I think it is in 
this industry that we see more of the effect of this basic 
choice, where a few years ago they were saying “the future is 
the law of the market, there is no need to guarantee the future 
of small communities.  We just have to move the people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first experiments in this regard were carried out in the 
Gaspé peninsula.  You will remember that some 20, nearly 30, 
years ago, the people who lived in the area were moved so 
Forillon Park, a federal conservation park, could be 
established.  The people living there were moved out and into 
low cost housing outside the park.  At the same time, people 
from outside were hired to work in the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sort of experience that resulted from a principle I 
consider unacceptable, one that should be changed.  We in Canada 
must debate the matter of priorities to make sure that people 
can live in their community—rural or urban—and that we never 
again go through experiences like those of today in the fishing 
industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too would like to comment on this issue.  I thank the member 
for moving concurrence. He is really asking for the government 
members who participated in the writing of this report to stand 
up for their constituents and to vote for the report.  This 
matter goes a lot deeper than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect what we are talking about is that the committee 
performed a consultation process as committees do. It spent a lot 
of taxpayers' money, and rightly so, going around listening to 
Canadians, coming back and writing a report with recommendations. 
The problem that has arisen out of all this is that we have ended 
up with a report that is deeply critical of the government, its 
policies and its department. The government had a very, very 
significant problem with this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had to make extremely radical changes.  The 
government had to remove the chairman of the committee.  The 
government had to make changes on the committee because it did 
not like what was reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made the committee ineffective. It has 
completely stripped the committee.  This was the government's 
solution.  It saw no other way around this.  The government could 
not stop the committee from writing this report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact a majority of the members of the committee who signed 
off on this report were Liberal members, members from the 
government.  They had an opportunity in committee to vote against 
this report.  Not only did they vote in favour of it, in many 
cases it was those members who wrote the recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue goes even further than that.  This demonstrates how 
ineffective this House is.  It is not just the committee. The 
government silenced the opposition members.  We need to change 
how this whole system operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spoke earlier of the systemic problems within DFO.  Every 
member on the committee talked about that.  They recognize what 
needs to be changed.  They recognize that we have to move control 
from Ottawa out to the regions.  That was talked about over and 
over and over again, that it did not work in a country such as 
ours with people in Ottawa making decisions on how to manage this 
fishery.  Again the record speaks for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to this House.  It makes this House ineffective. The 
Senate is ineffective.  This is recognized by all Canadians. We 
hear over and over again that there needs to be change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing in this House.  The Government of Canada, a 
very few people on the other side have control.  The majority of 
the people on that side of the House have to sit back and do as 
they are told.  They have to take their marching orders.  We have 
a handful of people running this country at a great expense to 
the taxpayers. It is appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just one small example of what goes on in this House. 
The east coast report is written.  The committee, 16 members of 
parliament, travelled through some 15 communities, five provinces 
in Atlantic Canada, wrote a very comprehensive report and made 
numerous recommendations to the government.  What was the 
minister's response?  The minister scoffed at it. He looked at 
this report and tossed it in the trash.  The minister was not 
going to listen to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's problem was that nine of his government's own 
members, his own parliamentary secretary, the junior Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, signed off on the report. The government 
said “We have to make some changes.  We have lost control of 
this committee.  First of all we had better fire the chairman. 
The chairman would appear to be part of the problem”.  The 
chairman has had a lot of experience, 24 years in this House. The 
government removed the chairman and started to make changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not had an adequate response from the government on this 
report.  There are a lot of good recommendations. Again I 
emphasize that this is an example of how we have to reform this 
federation.  It clearly is not working.  We have to look at that. 
Canadians are demanding that change, and it goes from the 
committees to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my most positive experiences in my first year as a member 
of parliament was the fisheries committee.  I said that over and 
over when I travelled through British Columbia and in my riding. 
One of the more positive experiences was working on a committee 
with 16 MPs from five political parties.  We left the political 
biases outside the door, focused on solutions, on what was best 
for Canada and how we could best put forward some alternative 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine trying to get 16 members of parliament from one party to 
agree, never mind from five.  We had the NDP, the Bloc, the 
Reform, the Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals.  Sixteen 
members of parliament agreed on some possible solutions which 
could improve the situation in Atlantic Canada and which could 
improve the disparity that is out there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the minister do?  He tossed it in the trash.  He did 
not want to look at it; it might have made some sense. Actually 
it might give the committee some credit.  It was not his ideas so 
there was no way he could listen to it.  He threw it away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to how ineffective the government is.  It sees 
an opportunity to do something positive, but it has that tight 
group that surrounds the Prime Minister.  He is the one who has 
control.  He is the one who fired the chairman of the fisheries 
committee.  That was stated by the member in the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt the Prime Minister is the one who is saying that 
we have to rein in this committee.  People across the country are 
listening to the committee.  The media is listening to it.  The 
media is reporting it.  I think we wrote three reports last year 
and are about to complete two more from one year's business.  It 
made numerous recommendations, but the government absolutely 
refused to pay attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need change.  Canadians want change.  I had people call me 
last week about this committee of which I am still a member.  My 
first thought was that if the government's response after 
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' 
money—and this is what it cost for us to travel here and there 
and do this work—is to literally toss it in the trash can, why 
would it spend that kind of money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the government is in power and is the ultimate 
decision maker.  However it tossed aside a report with which the 
majority of committee members agreed.  Nine of the government's 
own backbenchers including the junior minister of fisheries and 
oceans signed off on this report.  They participated in its 
writing.  They participated in going through the report line by 
line, word for word, and when it came to the House it was tossed 
in the trash can because the guy at the top of the triangle said 
“Sorry, boys, we cannot do that”.  This is inexcusable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a clear demonstration of how this federation has to be 
reformed.  From the committees to the House of Commons to the 
Senate the system is not working.  This is only one example, a 
minuscule part of the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the amount of money that has been spent and I have to 
honestly say to all taxpayers that they are not getting the bang 
for their buck.  They are not getting the value for the dollars 
spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not expect the Government of Canada to adopt every 
principle or to adopt everything we say, but it should have 
listened to us.  Its own members wrote this report and walked 
into the House, but the guy at the top of the pyramid said no. 
They all followed behind like a bunch of sheep.  Why did they go 
to the committee in the first place?  Why were they even there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government is doing is inexcusable.  It has been the 
most frustrating part of my experience in Ottawa, after spending 
a year in a good working relationship with members from all 
parties, for it to come to the House and be tossed aside and 
ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem lies at the top of this pyramid with the minister 
and the senior cabinet ministers.  The Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans had absolutely no interest in following any of the 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that this leads to a much bigger issue. 
The issue is that we have to reform this federation.  We have to 
reform how the government works.  We have to be accountable to 
the people to ensure that they are getting the best value for 
their dollars.  There has to be change.  This is a clear example 
of that.

Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been 
listening to this debate for some time.  Earlier this morning I 
listened to the member for Sackville—Eastern Shore.  I hoped 
that by the time we reached the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands 
a little common sense would creep into what members opposite are 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen here is rants from the opposition without any 
substance.  There was indeed a good consultation process.  The 
committee came up with some good recommendations.  If the members 
opposite would just read the response of the minister, they would 
see that the committee report had done some substantial gain in 
terms of moving DFO a little further down the path to better 
represent fishermen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listened in terms of the consultation process.  The 
member said in his speech that he did not expect to get 
everything the committee recommended.  Nor did we.  We heard from 
fishermen in earnest and we made very tough recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with members opposite is that when the facts on 
foreign fishing are outlined to them, they do not agree with them 
even though they are the facts and are articulated in terms of 
observer reports by DFO, by NAFO and by others.  They throw those 
arguments out.  They do not want to hear the facts.  They want to 
believe what they believe and not listen to the facts.  That is 
what we are getting from members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the people who signed the report.  Let me quote 
a dissenting report in the east coast fishery report signed by 
the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands who recommended that any 
program beyond May 1999 would be premature at this time.  The 
member likes to stand in the House and leave the impression that 
he wants to help those fishermen out when he recommended against 
a program, likely on the orders of his leader, to help them out. 
In the recommendations TAGS was extended and fishermen are 
benefiting from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a renewal strategy in place.  Members opposite should 
recognize that rather than this rant without substance.  We did 
strengthen management of a renewal strategy program.  We put $1.9 
million into recruitment and training programs for fisheries 
officers.  We are training fisheries officers now so that there 
will be better enforcement, so that we protect against illegal 
activities in the fisheries program, and so that we move ahead 
and have a fisheries for the future.  There is substantial 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member opposite not agree there has to be change in the 
fisheries and that hard decisions have to be made?  The minister 
was recently given a conservation award in New York. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  He gave $6 million to the people who 
gave him the award. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  The member for Sackville—Eastern Shore 
is saying that is not correct.  It is correct.  It was for 
conserving the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not agree that the minister is changing the fishery but 
conserving it so that there will be a fishery of the future?  He 
has a vision on where to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the junior minister of 
fisheries and oceans said they went through a consultative 
process and made great recommendations of which he was a part. If 
he is so proud of that report and I am wrong in what I am saying 
in the House, why will he not stand to vote for it in the House? 
Why will he not stand up for the people of Prince Edward Island, 
the people of Atlantic Canada, and vote for them in the House 
today? 
He will not because he has been ordered not to do so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that I had written a minority report.  Yes, I did, on 
one recommendation, recommendation 10F on the TAGS program after 
the government spent $2 billion to pay fishermen to sit at home 
and wait for the fish to come back.  I said that was not working 
and that we should invest some money in the fishery.  I have no 
problem spending money to invest in the fishery to ensure that it 
comes back.  Not everybody agreed with it, but I felt strongly 
enough that I had to put it on the record with one 
recommendation, that we would not spend $2 billion of taxpayers' 
money to pay fishermen to sit at home and wait for the fish to 
come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us fix the problem.  For five years the government's 
solution was that the fish were gone.  It threw in a couple of 
billion dollars and hoped the problem would fix itself.  The 
Liberals do not realize that they are the problem.  Their own 
department is the problem.  Their minister is the problem.  They 
made no substantive changes to the fishery.  The same people who 
destroyed the Atlantic fishery over the last 20 years are the 
people who are in charge today.  They are the people who are in 
the process of destroying the west coast fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is so proud of this report, he should stand today 
to vote for concurrence in the report.  He should stand up for 
the people of Prince Edward Island and all other Atlantic 
Canadians and show them that you are sincere in your comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I remind hon. 
members to address challenges to each other through the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the junior minister of fisheries and oceans was quoted 
as saying we now have much better observer reports from the 
foreigners.  Has the junior minister ever seen a foreign observer 
report?  I would put it that he never has.  How do we know they 
are worth anything? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans received 
a conservation award from the Atlantic Salmon Federation.  The 
fact is that the department which he runs gave the federation $6 
million, and a few months later the minister got an award from 
the same people he gave the money to.  He literally bought that 
award.  It has nothing to do with conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is concerned about recommendation No. 9 on 
foreign observer reports.  Have we ever seen a foreign observer 
report?  We have not.  Has the government ever seen a foreign 
observer report? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member from 
Nova Scotia for reminding me to talk about the observer reports 
to which the junior minister of fisheries and oceans has 
referred.  He said saying that we had all these wonderful 
observer reports with which to write this report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that we were denied access to them.  We put a motion 
to the committee asking for observer reports.  We made numerous 
requests through the chair who was fired for demanding the 
observer reports.  The government offered the reports to us in 
camera.  It said it would give the reports to us in secret but we 
could not let the Canadian people see them because there was a 
lot of stuff it did not want Canadians to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were not given the observer reports.  The Government of 
Canada kept them secret.  Why?  It was because they are 
ineffective.  We later learned that the observers on foreign 
vessels were coming from the nations where the vessels came from. 
They report when they get back to the port of their flag country. 
They are meaningless and the government would not release those 
reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ones we obtained where we actually had some input contained 
numerous violations by foreign states in Canadian waters of which 
the Government of Canada was aware.  What did we learn?  We 
learned there was no way the government would prosecute them or 
pursue them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We never saw the observer reports to which the junior minister 
of fisheries and oceans refers.  That is all on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  You were offered them and you refused 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  We were offered them in a secret meeting. 
The member is yelling at me from the other side of the House, 
saying that we were offered the reports.  Yes, we were, in 
camera, which means in secret.  We were not supposed to let 
anybody else know what was in them because the government was 
embarrassed and did not want them in the public domain.  That is 
appalling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have to say I was stunned to hear the member for 
Sackville—Eastern Shore bring this issue up again today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the House just dealt with it last week and voted on it 
last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the NDP had a full opposition day last week.  If this is 
such an important issue to the member for Sackville—Eastern 
Shore and to his colleagues in the New Democratic Party, they 
would have made this the subject of a full day of debate in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are known as Canadians for being somewhat self-effacing, but 
I am not sure why the member for Sackville—Eastern Shore has to 
be so self-effacing as to suggest that this country should not be 
proud that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans was awarded the 
conservation award of the Atlantic Salmon Federation and has to 
somehow suggest that the minister did not deserve that award. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians of course we do not think any of us deserve any 
recognition.  Personally I and my colleagues are proud of the 
minister for having won that recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may interpret this somewhat as picking on the member for 
Sackville—Eastern Shore today. But I was astonished as well to 
hear this member suggest that the only people in the House with 
courage and daring are those who happen to have certain male 
appendages.  I do not, but I consider myself pretty daring and 
pretty gutsy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
have the greatest respect for the member, but the fact is I did 
withdraw that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I recognize 
completely that the member withdrew his statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the circumstances, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK33">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the House do now proceed to orders of the day. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Actually the Liberals are quite incorrect. This is an important 
issue and we do have members here who are concerned about the 
east coast fishery.  I would like to ask— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is really a 
question of debate.  We have a motion on the floor so we have to 
deal with that before we deal with any subsequent questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The hon. 
government deputy whip stood when you resumed debate, gave a 
wonderful speech and talked about the member from Nova Scotia.  I 
believe we should get 10 minutes of questions and comments 
following that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is not a point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  All those in favour 
of the motion will please say yea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Yea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  All those opposed 
will please say nay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Nay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  In my opinion the 
nays have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And more than five members having risen:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Call in the members.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SECOND READING 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 21 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-43, an act to establish the Canada Customs and 
Revenue Agency and to amend and repeal other acts as a 
consequence, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee; and of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order, 
even though I do not really believe it is a point of order. I 
was just preparing to take part in the debate, but if my 
colleague from the Liberal Party is before me, however, I will 
defer to him.  You are the boss, Mr. Speaker. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I could 
have missed this but I thought we passed the motion and we were 
now going to the introduction of petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The superseding 
motion was to proceed to Government Orders.  We will not be doing 
petitions until tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You 
might find unanimous consent to revert to the presenting of 
petitions in order that I may table one petition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with any new government undertaking, the cost aspect must 
always be considered.  In the case of the proposed Canada 
customs and revenue agency, start up costs are minimal.  Only 
the direct costs associated with the board of management and its 
secretariat will be new.  In both cases, they will be minimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other costs will arise in the normal course of events for the 
management of human resources and other administrative skills, 
in order to maximize the new agency's operating flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these costs will be offset over time by the savings 
resulting from streamlined and more efficient internal 
procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will benefit from the greatly reduced time and energy 
spent on complex and unwieldy administrative procedures.  For 
instance, under the present system, it can take up to one year 
to hire the large number of auditors required every year.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reduction in hiring time and the elimination of numerous 
vacant positions will substantially lower staffing costs, as 
well as considerably improve service and the integrity of the 
overall tax system. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides these operating savings from productivity improvements, 
there are other potential savings from the new agency.  The 
Public Policy Forum, an independent organization with extensive 
experience in public sector management, undertook a study to 
examine the cost of compliance with and administration of 
Canada's tax systems and the savings from a single 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study concluded that there could be significant savings to 
Canadian businesses, particularly small businesses, from a single 
revenue administration.  Savings were expected from such 
activities as single registration for taxpayers, common 
federal-provincial databases, the combination of certain forms, 
greater consistency in tax rulings and greater simplification of 
procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was estimated that the level of compliance savings to 
business each year would be between $116 million and $193 million 
dollars at a minimum.  The study also examined the administrative 
costs to governments of tax collection and potential savings.  It 
found that there was a high potential for savings in the areas of 
personal income tax, corporate income tax and payroll tax because 
of the similarities at the federal and provincial levels as well 
as in a common collection system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medium levels of savings were expected in the areas of audit and 
enforcement, client service possibly through a single point of 
contact, excise taxes and the assessment of returns.  Other 
potential savings were seen to be possible through general 
reductions in administrative and technical support, such as a 
reduced requirement for management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total it was estimated that administrative costs to 
governments could be reduced by between $37 million and $62 
million annually at a minimum.  The critical point is that 
potential savings to individual Canadians, businesses and 
governments far outweigh the start up and new operating costs of 
the proposed agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having 11 directors on the board of management nominated from 
the private sector by the provinces and territories will ensure 
that the agency continues to operate in a cost effective and 
responsive manner as would the other accountability mechanisms 
built into the legislation before this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have Canadian businesses focusing on marketing, 
developing products and developing business rather than filling 
in forms and dealing with administrative matters not only once 
but twice, then we have efficiencies in the economy.  We have 
businesses out there doing what we want them to do, creating jobs 
for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada customs and revenue agency represents a very 
significant opportunity for the generation of benefits to the 
provinces and territories and to Canadian businesses and warrants 
speedy passage before this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of this House to support this bill when it 
comes to a vote. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as members 
will recall, on June 4, 1998, one week before the summer recess, 
the Minister of Revenue tabled Bill C-43 to establish the Canada 
Customs and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill stems from the Speech from the Throne delivered in 
February 1996, when the government announced its intention to 
set up a national revenue recovery agency. Initially, this 
agency will essentially be the existing Department of Revenue 
turned into an agency operating almost at arm's length from the 
government, whose mandate will be to negotiate with the 
interested provinces and municipalities an arrangement for the 
collection of all taxes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do the members of this House realize that the bill before us 
basically provides for two things? 
First, concentrating under one single organization the 
collection of all federal, provincial or municipal taxes. While 
there is no mention of it in here, it is very clear that school 
taxes, gasoline taxes and liquor taxes may also be administered 
by this agency.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the first point to consider is the centralization of all tax 
collection operations in the hands of a single organization. The 
second different but equally important point we must bear in 
mind is the creation of an agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the Minister of Revenue, who has been 
responsible so far for what was going on in his department, will 
now devolve to a quasi-independent agency the responsibility to 
collect all taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this House, when we question a minister about the actions of 
a government agency, the minister will often hide behind the 
fact that the agency is independent, competent, self-regulated, 
and thus enjoys his or her full confidence. In the end, we do 
not get an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that this House, which is made up of democratically 
and individually elected members, can no longer get a minister 
to account for an agency from which he is removing himself. This 
is precisely the situation that is proposed in the bill, with 
the creation of an agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing to centralize the collection of taxes in the 
hands of a single organization, so as to avoid duplication and 
reduce costs. 
Incidentally, Quebec's Department of Revenue—Quebec being the 
only Canadian province to have its own revenue department—is 
already collecting the GST for the federal government. This, of 
course, reduces costs, since the GST is collected at the same 
time as the Quebec sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, while we may achieve economies of scale by 
concentrating tax collection in the hands of a single 
organization, to give that responsibility to an agency is a very 
different matter and one that should be considered much more 
carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With an agency, the minister is not involved in the ongoing 
operations of the organization. Take, for example, the CRTC and 
various other federal agencies. 
Whenever something happens with these organizations, the 
minister tells the House “This agency, this entity, can 
self-regulate. It has investigative tools. In short, it will 
ensure transparency”. But that transparency is never there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention two cases where there were problems. One is the 
Somalia inquiry. A commission was set up and was going to take 
care of everything. Yet, as we know, in the end the 
commissioners themselves said they had not been able to find the 
whole truth, as we wanted them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the tainted blood issue and the Krever 
commission. I clearly remember asking a question in this House 
to the then Minister of Health, who replied gently and kindly 
“The issue is in the hands of the commission. The commission 
will get to the bottom of this”. 
As we now know, the commission was never able to get to the 
bottom of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, the government wants to create an agency that will once 
again operate at arm's length from the minister, with the result 
that, when asked about it, the minister will simply say “The 
agency is looking after all this”. In my opinion, we must oppose 
the establishment of such an agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now go back to the issue of concentrating the collection 
of all our taxes in the hands of a single organization.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that, on the face of it, this should result in 
savings. If this is the case, why not give the Quebec Minister 
of Revenue the responsibility for collecting all taxes in 
Quebec? The Quebec Minister of Revenue would then, as he already 
does with the GST, give the money to the federal revenue 
minister. Already, this would result in significant savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I start not being able to follow is when a body is created 
which would collect taxes not only at the federal level, not 
only at the level of Quebec or the provinces, but also at the 
municipal level, even the school board level, taxes on alcohol, 
on cigarettes, on gasoline.  In short, it would be a monster 
with tentacles reaching everywhere, up to and including the 
taxpayer's pockets, and worse still, able to keep track of what 
taxpayers are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we no longer have just a body for collecting taxes, but one 
that also collects information, a lot of information, collective 
and individual, from sea to sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a danger here.  I appeal to this House to consider the 
fact that, even if it were economically advantageous to give one 
single body the right to collect everything considered taxes, 
both direct and indirect, and any other kind as well, would it 
be socially acceptable to allow a single body like this one to 
have all this information concentrated in one place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say no.  When one body has powers this wide, economic 
considerations can no longer apply.  The consideration that must 
take precedence is respect of the individual, and of privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the very fact that the minister hands over to an agency 
powers that are allocated to him by the law is, to my mind, an 
unacceptable contradiction.  An agency cannot be allowed into 
the pockets of taxpayers to collect taxes which have been 
determined by this House. 
This is the minister's responsibility, and one he cannot easily 
slough off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the minute remaining to me, I would like to point out that 
20% of federal public servants work for Revenue Canada at the 
present time. It is my impression that the secret intention, the 
hidden agenda behind all this is to put 20% of federal employees 
into an agency where they will no longer be covered by the 
Public Service Employment Act.  This is totally unacceptable. 
If that is the hidden desire of the government, it is totally 
evil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that my time is up, and I thank you for your 
attention.  I hope the House will dump this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  For the ease of 
figuring out who is next, we will go now to the member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, then to the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle, then the member for Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert 
and then the member for Durham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not hear a member for 
the Reform Party on your list. It may be that we will take our 
turn as the time comes around, so we may stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will take that 
under advisement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou  Sekora (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one issue that arose repeatedly in 
consultations with the provinces and territories, the clients and 
the public was accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially there is a desire that the proposed new agency be 
accountable both to what it does and how it operates.  Bill C-43 
establishes a number of accountability mechanisms that will 
ensure that the agency despite its new structure and potential 
increase in services on behalf of the provinces and territories 
will remain accountable to parliament and its clients and to the 
public for its action.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Full ministerial accountability for the program, legislation and 
overall control of the agency by the government will be 
maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Revenue will remain responsible for the 
administration and enforcement of the program and legislation 
such as the Income Tax Act, the Excise Act and the Customs Act. 
The minister will be able to direct officials to exercise 
authority under the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is currently named in 1,470 various pieces of 
program legislation as the person with the authority to exercise 
specific actions such as assessing tax returns.  The minister 
will continue to be the person named to exercise those 
authorities.  This means that the minister will retain personal 
accountability for the way the programs are run.  This direct 
accountability ensures that the minister has the authority to 
inquire into any matters of program administration.  This is 
important because the minister can ensure that the clients of the 
agency have been treated fairly and equitably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will continue to respond to questions in the House 
and from the public on program and policy matters.  The minister 
will continue to be able to respond to members of parliament when 
their constituents seek their help in dealing with tax or customs 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will retain the primary role in establishing the 
strategic direction of the agency.  The minister will approve 
major corporate documents, recommend approval of the agency's 
business plan to Treasury Board and table an annual report to 
parliament on the operation of the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the minister is accountable for how the programs are 
carried out, the agency has a considerable amount of autonomy in 
the matter of internal management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will be directed by a board of management which will 
be accountable to parliament through the minister for management 
policies of the agency, such as human resource activities in 
staffing and compensation; mandates for negotiating with its 
bargaining agents and collective bargaining agreements; service 
and performance standards; and the appropriate allocation of 
internal resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have expressed concern that the board of management, 
consisting of private sector individuals, might ignore the public 
interest and act in a way that is motivated only by revenue 
generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are sufficient checks and balances in this bill to ensure 
that the agency will remain within the overall government policy 
framework.  These checks and balances include Treasury Board's 
mandate to approve the corporate business plan and the need for 
the agency to report annually to parliament.  Ultimately, if 
problems do arise, the minister will have the authority to give 
direction to the agency on matters within the board's 
jurisdiction if they affect public policy or materially affect 
public finances.  It is doubted that this direction authority 
will ever have to be used, but it is there as an insurance 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner, who is a full member of the board of 
management, would act as a full time chief executive officer of 
the agency and be responsible for the day to day operations of 
the organization.  The commissioner will be accountable to the 
minister for the administration and enforcement of the program 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to accountability for the administration of 
provincial programs, the commissioner will offer to meet with 
provincial and territorial finance ministers and to report on 
such matters as service and revenue levels and to receive 
feedback from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As indicated, the agency's corporate business plan will require 
Treasury Board approval and its appropriations will be made 
through the regular government estimate procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, certain human resources aspects will form part of 
the corporate business plan.  The public service commission will 
have authority to review and report on certain aspects of the 
agency's staffing program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance will continue to be responsible for the 
development of tax and trade policy and legislation.  The 
Minister of National Revenue, through the agency, will be 
responsible for implementation.  The important and necessary 
relationship now in place between the Departments of Finance and 
National Revenue will continue between the Department of Finance 
and the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Auditor General of Canada will be the auditor for the agency 
and will play the same role as with Revenue Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 also provides a full scale review of the legislation 
by a committee of this House five years after coming into force. 
This does not exist, of course, to prevent parliament from 
exercising its normal authority over the agency in the interim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament will have all of the normal opportunities to ensure 
that the agency is being properly managed, such as review of its 
corporate business plan, its annual reports and its annual 
appropriations.  It can require a further in-depth review at any 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, ministerial accountability, overall control by 
government and parliamentary oversight will be maintained for the 
new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those being served by the agency, especially the provinces and 
the territories, will have new means at their disposal to ensure 
that the agency is accountable to them for its performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability for fairness is the cornerstone of our 
government's legislation, policies, regulations and processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fairness is an essential foundation to the entire revenue 
administration.  It is a system based on voluntary compliance and 
if the clients do not believe they are being treated fairly, one 
cannot expect them to comply voluntarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of fairness is a priority for Revenue Canada and it 
will remain a priority for the Canada customs and revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada's record on fairness is excellent.  The fact that 
95% of filers comply voluntarily is a testament to that record. 
That compliance rate can be even higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, one can only maintain this level of compliance if 
taxpayers believe that the tax system is fair to them, fair to 
their neighbours and fair to everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One also knows that complacency is no way to deal with fairness. 
Canada's business, economic and social environment is 
dramatically changing and that is one of the reasons that the 
agency is being created:  to respond to those changes and to 
provide better service to clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring an initiative was launched to look closely at 
fairness:  what measures were in place; how well the department 
was doing at providing fairness; what improvements could be made 
to provide a greater level of fairness to the department's 
clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a broad and comprehensive consultation effort.  It 
has looked to the department's many independent advisory 
committees, to stakeholder groups, to the general public and to 
our own managers and front-line staff for their ideas and advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, an assessment was performed of the best practices 
of other customs and revenue administrations around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that this has been an open, credible and transparent 
exercise, the Confederation Board of Canada was retained to help 
design the consultation, gather and analyse the feedback and 
produce a report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fair treatment means being open, clear, courteous, responsive, 
timely and accessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Revenue Canada, applying legislation fairly means applying 
it impartially, justly and consistently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitments that Revenue Canada makes to fairness will be 
commitments for the Canada customs and revenue agency.  The 
agency is all about providing better, more effective and more 
efficient service to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fairness is part and parcel of service and an efficient 
organization that is not fair to its clients is not an effective 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Canada customs and revenue agency is created, there have 
been suggestions that an ombudsman forum be created to ensure 
that the rights of taxpayers are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be premature to consider the establishment of an 
ombudsman or any such office until this process of public 
consultation is complete.  In fact, early feedback from the 
fairness initiative is reinforcing the longstanding practice of 
building commitment to fairness throughout the organization as 
opposed to isolating it in a separate office.

Speaker, I would be curious if the last member could 
extemporaneously tell us what he said.  That would be very 
useful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the Bloc moved an amendment to delay for six months the 
creation of this great big new taxation agency which was created 
by the Liberal government.  I have three or four concerns about 
it which is why I support the amendment before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is setting up a taxation agency to 
collect GST, income taxes and corporate taxes.  The provinces can 
buy in.  They can collect the provincial sales tax, the liquor 
tax, eventually municipal taxes and so on.  It is a radical 
departure from the existing practice of the Department of 
National Revenue collecting taxes in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have three or four concerns about that.  My first concern is 
that this is supposed to be a federal-provincial agency.  A good 
friend of mine, a minister from Edmonton, is in the House today. 
He is concerned about federal-provincial relations.  I wonder if 
he could tell the House today which provinces have bought into 
the idea of a new taxation agency.  My impression is that the 
answer would be none.  Not a single province has bought into this 
agency— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  If Nova Scotia has bought into it I 
would like to see a letter tabled in the House which says that 
Nova Scotia will take part in this agency.  When the minister was 
defending the agency on October 1 not one province had bought 
into the idea to be part of this agency to collect taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are heading into a Quebec election— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  So what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  —and we are hearing a lot about 
federal-provincial co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal across the way says “So what?”  It is no wonder the 
Prime Minister is stumbling around making all kinds of mistakes. 
He is aiding Mr. Bouchard with some of his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe very strongly in co-operative federalism, the kind of 
co-operative federalism that was preached in this House by people 
like Robert Stanfield, Lester Pearson and Tommy Douglas many 
years ago.  That is what I believe in, but this government is 
bringing in an agency without the support of any of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  I am glad that medicare was referred 
to.  It was started by a CCF government in Saskatchewan in 1961. 
It was a popular idea that spread across this country.  It came 
into being federally after the royal commission headed by Mr. 
Chief Justice Hall.  There was a national consensus that we 
should have a national medical care program.  Medicare was 
supported by an overwhelming majority of Canadian people and an 
overwhelming majority of the provinces before it actually was 
passed by the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This case is the opposite of the medicare example.  No province 
has bought into the idea of a tax collection agency like the new 
agency the government wants to set up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is the idea of the quasi-privatization of the 
largest part of the federal government in this country.  Forty 
thousand people work for Revenue Canada and the Liberal 
government wants to take this department out of the public 
service.  Some 20% of the workforce of the Government of Canada 
will be, in effect, privatized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need to talk about the new right in this country.

is the Liberal Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here in my pocket the results of a byelection in 
Saskatchewan last night.  It shows that the NDP government is in 
touch with the people of Saskatchewan.  A Liberal MLA named Bucky 
Belanger resigned from the Liberal Party about two months ago. 
Mr. Belanger resigned his seat from the Saskatchewan legislature 
and sought the NDP nomination.  A byelection was held last night. 
The result of the byelection was that Bucky Belanger got 2,145

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Hallowe'en is being celebrated on the weekend, and the 
government will again try to scare people with its Bill C-43.  No 
doubt Quebeckers will be shaking at the prospect of the 
Department of National Revenue transforming itself into a semi 
autonomous government agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will they be shaking?  The President of the Treasury Board 
gave us part of the answer in the House. “No one likes paying 
taxes”, he said.  Obviously, no one likes paying taxes when they 
get nothing for their money.  Obviously no one likes paying 
taxes when we are deprived of the health care services our taxes 
are supposed to pay for. 
Obviously no one wants to pay taxes, when assistance to fishers, 
farmers and the unemployed is being cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why people are afraid.  They know that the government 
does not provide the services they are entitled to through their 
taxes.  They are afraid because the money they are paying in 
taxes will now be collected by another monster, the Canada 
customs and revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois totally disagrees with the bill.  One of the 
most important prerogatives of modern government is the power to 
tax.  Thanks to this power, Canada collects money from taxpayers 
that they worked hard to earn.  It is unthinkable that this 
power will be put in the hands of a semi autonomous agency that 
is not under the direct control of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has said there will be less overlap between the 
federal and provincial governments with the bill. 
That is not reassuring; it causes concern.  The fact there is no 
more encroachment is because the government will not be 
collecting income tax anymore, the agency will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, it is common knowledge that we are in favour 
of an end to overlap.  The Bloc has long wanted an end to such 
overlap between the federal and the provincial governments.  The 
solution is simple: combine all tax collection activities within 
Revenue Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 means savings, we are told. 
We have our doubts.  The government is going to create a 
quasi-autonomous agency that will be entrusted with billions of 
dollars, and the agency's managers will not be subject to any 
pay controls.  In today's economy, with the directors of banks 
and financial concerns often voting themselves outlandish 
salaries, we wonder about the size of the salary bill taxpayers 
will have to foot for the agency's managers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very status of the agency will allow senior managers to pay 
themselves salaries comparable to those of CEOs in the private 
sector.  Will the agency's commissioner, who will have hundreds 
of thousands of people reporting to him and a budget in the 
billions, demand a salary on a par with that of the chairman of 
the Royal Bank? 
Will the agency's commissioner have millions of dollars in 
annual income?  These are some of the questions we have.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will these managers be more motivated as employees of the new 
agency than they are right now?  We read in <I>Le Devoir</I> this 
morning that Pierre Sigouin, assistant director of the Customs 
and Excise information division, claims to have lost all 
motivation over the last four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Sigouin took paid sick leave to co-ordinate the election 
campaign of Pierre Bourque, the mayor of Montreal, who is 
running for re-election.  Apparently, it is unmotivating to work 
for this government.  Is this the reason the government has 
decided to create independent agencies such as the Canada 
customs and revenue agency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious what the government is up to.  It will at last be 
able to shift the blame for tax collection problems.  Those who 
had too much tax deducted will be told it is not the 
department's problem and referred to the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very fine and well for the minister to say he will 
retain some control over the agency.  The bill contains 
provisions that make the agency relatively autonomous. 
It will therefore be possible for the minister to authorize the 
commissioner or any person employed or engaged by the agency to 
exercise or perform on his behalf any of his powers, duties or 
functions under any act of parliament, with the exception of 
making regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada customs and revenue agency will be run by a 
super-bureaucrat who will not be accountable to parliament. While 
accountability is essential to our democracy, this principle is 
increasingly left out of the current political scene by this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will make it impossible to criticize the administration 
of an organization performing a function that the very existence 
of the state depends on. This is especially worrisome since it 
follows a trend of political patronage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under clauses 15, 22 and 25 of the bill, there will be a board 
of directors of 12 members appointed for three years on the 
recommendation of the provinces, but holding office only on a 
part time basis. Three other directors, that is the chair of the 
board, the commissioner and the deputy commissioner, will be 
appointed by the governor in council for a term of five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we will be witness to the political appointments 
made by a government that sacrifices competence to give jobs to 
political friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to be feared that the decisions made by politically 
appointed senior officials with a free hand for action would be 
prejudicial to taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that less than three years ago, the auditor 
general revealed a scandal that we in the Bloc Quebecois had 
condemned in the 1993 election campaign: the family trust 
scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general had revealed that, at around midnight on 
December 23, 1991, some senior officials of Revenue Canada, 
Finance and Justice decided, without even asking their 
ministers, to transfer two family trusts worth $2 billion to the 
United States without collecting a single cent in Canadian tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the mandarins of Revenue, Finance and Justice could do so 
under the present circumstances, imagine what things will be 
like when there is this customs and revenue agency they are 
trying to set up, which will be quasi-independent and not 
answerable to Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many similar cases will be swept under the rug, without 
Parliament even knowing about them, cases of scandalous 
decisions by senior mandarins who will now be in control of tax 
collection as well as of all the confidential data banks on 
Quebeckers and Canadians?  It makes no sense whatsoever to 
delegate so much to a new class of super-bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying too that creation of this agency will 
considerably weaken the Department of Revenue.  Once the agency 
is created, the Minister will have an overall business plan 
submitted to him, one to which he will have made little, if any, 
contribution. 
He will be confronted more or less with a fait accompli.  They 
will be dictating to the minister what he has to do.

collect taxes.  The government is on the wrong track here.  The 
provinces are calling for more control over the administrative 
powers that affect them, and the government is pulling the rug 
out from under them and rejecting their demands.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to enter this debate on Bill C-43, the Canada 
customs and revenue agency. This is all about getting government 
right.  We cannot continue to live with significant 
inefficiencies within our administrative structure.  This is a 
continuation of our government's desire to reinvent government 
and get government onto a course of efficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk about efficiencies, members will be interested to 
know that in the last budgetary estimates Revenue Canada's 
administration cost to run the department was $2.2 billion.  It 
collected a sum total of about $153 billion.  That means a ratio 
of 1.43%, that is to say, it costs us about 1.5% for every $1 
that is being collected by Revenue Canada which is good in 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people note that Revenue Canada is probably one of the most 
efficient arms of government today.  In my earlier life I was 
involved with Revenue Canada on a more direct basis in 
representing my clients.  Generally speaking the people at 
Revenue Canada carry out their jobs in a professional and 
diligent way with fairness and equity. Some people watching today 
might think that Revenue Canada is just a little bit too 
efficient in how much taxes it collects. However, the reality is 
that it undertakes its functions quite effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada today we have developed a multiplicity of taxes and 
tax regimes.  It is small business week.  Maybe we should be 
paying attention to some of the concerns of small and medium size 
businesses in this country.  One of them is the pure complexity 
of complying with our taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the federal and provincial governments collect excise 
taxes, transportation taxes, tourist taxes and corporate taxes. 
Both the federal and provincial governments have their own little 
tax regimes collecting corporate taxes from small and medium size 
incorporated businesses. We also collect the employment insurance 
and the Canada pension plan.  At the same time, the provinces are 
also involved in making separate collections for workers 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most insidious is the incidence of duplicity of sales taxes, 
the GST and provincial sales taxes.  This duplication is very 
expensive for our citizens and small businesses. The problem with 
the provincial sales tax is that it also cascades into the actual 
exports in the selling prices of commodities.  As Canada is an 
exporting country it causes great inefficiencies as well. It 
makes us less competitive as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for some of these reasons that the government has put 
forward the concept of this agency.  We talk a lot in this House 
about the underground economy.  Generally speaking we assume that 
people are simply cheating, but the reality is that a good number 
of people find it very difficult to comply with the level of 
complexity of the forms and requirements for different types of 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, people cannot afford the compliance. I can 
remember a small business operator saying that he needed to spend 
one day a week just to comply with the taxation system. It is 
very important that we develop an agency that will be efficient 
and smoothly run to try to reduce this complexity and make the 
whole concept of tax collection more efficient. 
I have been surprised to find out that Revenue Canada for 
instance does not do e-commerce.  We can pay our bills over the 
Internet, to Bell Canada and even to our local municipal tax 
authorities, but we cannot do it with Revenue Canada.  I suggest 
that one of the reasons is it needs a certain inertia. It needs 
to spend more time developing electronic commerce to make this a 
more efficient agency.  This is done for corporate structures but 
not on an individual basis.  We have to catch up with the times. 
When I hear the Bloc, the NDP and others saying leave it the way 
it is, these people are just standing in the path of progress.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get back to an issue which is dear to my heart, 
the harmonization of sales taxes. We have tried politically to 
deal with this issue in the maritime provinces and some of those 
provinces have signed on to harmonized sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle was actually challenging us as 
to what province would ever sign on to this.  I am surprised by 
that comment.  The reality is we are leaders, that we are leading 
in this area of efficiency.  We should be complimenting the 
government on its leadership role rather than saying if nobody 
else is ponying up to the cause, it must be a bad thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of what the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle said, I can 
remember when medicare was first brought on and I think only one 
or two provinces initially signed on to that agenda.  Of course 
all the provinces today are part of the medicare system. So it is 
not a reason to stand in the way of an agency that will be 
competitive within our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of harmonization of the sales taxes is probably one of 
the single largest inefficiencies in tax collection. Canada has 
to be the only country in the western world that actually has one 
federal sales tax and nine provincial sales taxes.  It does not 
take much thought process to realize how inefficient that really 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the agency were in place pure rationality between provinces 
and the federal government would try to find some way to solve 
that problem.  We as politicians quite frankly have not been able 
to do that.  I think that is possibly a failure of this place 
compared to what an agency could possibly do.  That does not mean 
those decisions are outside the political agenda. They are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to a question the other day the minister of revenue 
suggested Nova Scotia had already signed on to a service 
contract.  Three ministers along with our minister had signed on. 
So we can see how this is starting to evolve.  Once this agency 
is in place we are going to find many more ways to make the whole 
concept of tax collection more efficient and more relevant to the 
21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario, for instance, my province, insists on collecting its 
own provincial sales tax regardless of the fact that the 
provincial sales tax becomes a cost of production to our 
manufacturers.  In my area General Motors has to actually pay 
provincial sales tax on input components. When it buys stationery 
or other things for its operation, it pays provincial sales tax. 
Eighty per cent of its production goes across the border into the 
United States.  It goes across the border embedded with 
provincial sales tax as opposed to the GST, which has a 
methodology of removing that tax when it finally goes outside of 
our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence Ontario's provincial sales tax is a very 
inefficient, outmoded tax that is not serving the people of 
Ontario well, because 40% of our exports are coming from the 
province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to find better ways of doing business and I believe this 
is part of that solution, to create this agency which will be 
more efficient, will allow a broader base concentration of 
critical mass, will allow for possibly more spending in the area 
of technological efficiency and will allow people to interface 
with the government more efficiently and more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the act there are provisions where the provinces will be able 
to be consulted in the area of appointing directorships and so 
forth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can certainly see the window of opportunity to make a more 
efficient agency, allowing the provincial and federal authorities 
to work together to make this an efficient tax regime, an 
efficient, modern tax collection system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am supportive of this legislation and I hope the rest of the 
House will support it as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
address Bill C-43, an act to establish the Canada customs and 
revenue agency and to amend and repeal other acts as a 
consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A brand new revenue agency, that is what Canadians have been 
clamouring for.  I dare say it was one of the most mentioned 
issues for all candidates as we went door to door during last 
year's federal election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister probably still recalls that many people told him 
what they want is tax reform but not lower taxes, not a simpler 
system.  No, what they want is a new agency, one with wider 
powers, a new agency with less accountability to parliament, a 
new agency that runs outside the government with access to their 
most personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the minister is confused.  This is the Hallowe'en season 
and while he is very effectively scaring the Canadian public with 
this bill the time for pranks is still April 1.  All levity 
aside, I do not want to ensure that the Liberal Party is fully 
aware of the fact that this bill in no way addresses tax reform. 
In the interest of accuracy I am sure it would not want to see 
some overzealous campaigner insert Bill C-43 in the 2001 red book 
as an example of the Liberal's commitment to reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole bill is predicated on the level of trust between the 
provinces and the Liberal government, a level of trust that 
simply does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to be certain I will spell out why this situation exists. 
It concerns unilateral cuts to transfer payments, outrageous 
levels of unemployment insurance, overtaxation and ridiculous 
postering statements by the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Health against the most respected premiers in Canada, including 
the premier of my province, Mike Harris. These are just some of 
the reasons why there is no level of trust at the first ministers 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Kings—Hants has outlined the many 
shortcomings of this bill.  However, we do not have to have a 
Ph.D. in economics to understand why this national agency is 
destined to fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government offloads responsibility to the provinces by 
making draconian cuts to health care, for instance $7 billion in 
the last term.  The minister has said there is only one taxpayer. 
The provinces and municipalities have been faced with an ever 
increasing tax burden as a result of the government's failure to 
lead and to take responsibility for national matters, including 
such issues as health care funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister speaks of the provinces having greater 
opportunities to effect control and have control over the levers 
of this important agency than they now have with Revenue Canada. 
I suggest the provinces' lack of approval and their concern with 
this new agency is an indication that they do not believe in 
this. The provinces will not have greater powers and authority 
with this new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Liberal government to take a short walk back to a time 
when it still pretended that keeping red book commitments was 
important. After the Prime Minister's ridiculous claim during the 
1993 election that he would get rid of the GST, there was an 
attempt to create a renamed and more pervasive tax known as the 
BST, the blended sales tax.  This little attempt at massaging the 
red book promises was only adopted in three provinces, Nova 
Scotia, Newfoundland and New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coincidentally there are only three provinces in Canada with 
Liberal governments.  I am sure many will be shocked to learn 
that these governments exist in the same three provinces, proving 
that the tentacles of this government run very long and that the 
tendency of elected Liberals to imitate the nodding heads 
drinking birds is not limited to our federal parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless Prime Minister Bo Peep intends to elect a few more 
Liberal sheep in provincial legislatures across the land, he may 
as well stick a fork in Bill C-43.  As I do not see anybody 
rising on a point of order to withdraw this bill, allow me to 
provide the minister with a course of action that would give him 
a fighting chance at actually implementing this new agency with a 
certain degree of success.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first course of action would be put an end to the war 
against the public service in this country.  We are all friends 
in the House and I understand that the public service was 
probably a bit too trusting when it took the Liberal Party at its 
word on pay equity. However, this government made a commitment 
and those people are filled with righteous anger. Therefore I 
suggest the minister rethink the likelihood that these public 
servants are going to be very interested in assisting in the 
privatization of their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should they be helpful?  Bill C-43 is going to result in new 
people being paid higher salaries to do the exact same jobs which 
are being done now.  Of course Canadians will be thrilled to 
learn that along with this new agency comes a whole new level of 
bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see current employees who will lose existing rights, 
including job security and the right to bargain on staffing 
matters.  Keep in mind that there will only be a two year job 
guarantee and we are effectively dealing with about 25% of the 
public service.  We have to take a look at whether this agency 
would not be more flexible than Revenue Canada but less flexible 
in working with other government departments, including the 
finance department, and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At various times of the year Revenue Canada has between 40,000 
and 46,000 employees.  Revenue Canada has many responsibilities, 
primarily the collecting of federal taxes and various fees, 
harmonized sales taxes in three provinces, personal income taxes 
on behalf of nine provinces and corporate taxes on behalf of 
seven provinces.  The new agency is to assume all these 
responsibilities.  The new agency is supposed to be as efficient 
as the department was without any increased cost to the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that unless the provinces buy in and support this 
direction and this new agency, any claims by the government that 
this agency will lead to greater efficiencies and save the 
taxpayer money are suspicious at best.  The only efficiencies 
that can be achieved will be those realized through a slower 
transfer rate of funds to provinces.  As a former town councillor 
I can assure this House that in turn the municipalities will see 
foot dragging when it comes to receiving funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence this government is trying to implement a law that 
will cause greater discourse between voters and all levels of 
government.  The government is saying we could save between $97 
million and $162 million per year if all the provinces 
participated.  That is a very big if.  At this juncture currently 
the provinces have not demonstrated a significance interest in 
having Ottawa collect and have more authority in effect over 
taxes beyond what Revenue Canada does currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  You still have three minutes

I stand before you today to say that as a woman I am at risk 
because of an unknown and to date an unstoppable killer.  I am 
referring to the killer known as breast cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in 
Canada.  It is estimated that by the end of this year 5,300 women 
will die from this disease and 90,300 new cases will arise. These 
figures are frightening and they hit close to home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past summer I was reawakened to this terrifying disease 
when I witnessed my own cousin become one of those estimated 
fatalities of breast cancer.  Through research we know that the 
risk of breast cancer is slightly higher with a family history of 
cancer incidence and with increasing age, but while research has 
been ongoing over the past two decades the mortality rates for 
breast cancer have not changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewed commitment to breast cancer initiatives by the 
federal government was announced in June.  The first five year 
contribution amounting to $45 million will go toward reducing 
both the incidence of breast cancer in Canada and the mortality

provide short term illusions of relief.  We have to address the

Week is a time to pay tribute to the hard work and courage of

there are over 2.5 million jobs in a quarter of a million small 
businesses, and this does not include self-employed workers.

we must do more than just pay tribute to small business owners.

to baseball bats or the constitution; it was good.  There was no 
mention either of the Prime Minister's plan to take money from

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance made a statement on that not long ago to 
the House of Commons and to the nation in consultations with 
Canadians about what should be part of the next budget. The

questions that have been asked by the opposition on the subject 
of EI.  When the budget comes down we will know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a good position because of the administration and we 
have managed to deal with a very difficult problem.  For the

<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last night the Prime Minister talked about weathering 
the coming economic storm, but that would be easier for most 
Canadians if payroll taxes were lower.  Right now the average 
worker pays $350 a year too much for employment insurance and the 
average small business pays $500 more per employee, per year than 
it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the economy slowing down, why does the Prime Minister think 
that workers and small businesses can do without this money? 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to inform the member that when we started 
on January 1, 1994 the premiums were supposed to be $3.30. We 
have reduced them to $2.70 in the last four budgets.  We have 
been reducing them.  If the Leader of the Opposition were to look 
objectively at the situation of payroll taxes, Canada probably 
has the lowest level of payroll taxes of any of the G-7 
countries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to weather the coming economic storm that the Prime 
Minister himself is predicting, workers need an employment 
insurance fund they can count on and they need more dollars in 
their own pockets today.  Both of those objectives are damaged by 
a government raid on the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question again is why does the Prime Minister not call off 
the heist and cancel the government's plans to raid the 
employment insurance fund? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I said yesterday, there are some major problems on 
the international scene, particularly in Asia.  As I said, 
because of the discipline of the Canadian people and the 
management of this government, we are in a position today to be 
able to decide what to do with a surplus.  Of course we want to 
make sure that these moneys are used to create jobs in Canada and 
give the type of economic and social progress that is needed in 
Canada at this time.

the Prime Minister has absolutely no excuse for skimming money

can help himself to billions of dollars of workers' insurance 
premiums. He only has until mid November.  He and the Prime

recommending that any of the EI surplus be applied to reductions. 
Reformers were saying that all of the EI surplus must go against 
the deficit.  We did not follow their advice.  We reduced 
premiums in 1995.  We reduced them in 1996.  We reduced them in 
1997.  That is what we have done.

week the health minister insisted that health protection 
scientists appeared before the Senate agriculture committee with 
his full co-operation and encouragement. The facts are otherwise. 
The minister's office worked overtime to try to prevent the 
scientists from testifying.  An internal document shows that the 
minister's office tried to engineer the assistant deputy minister 
appearing instead of the scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why try to silence the scientists?  How does blocking the truth

I hope the hon. member's devotion to the truth will extend to her 
description of the history of these events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened last week was that scientists from my department 
appeared before the Senate committee at my urging.  I encouraged 
them to attend and to testify before the parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document she refers to which was disclosed yesterday from a 
bureaucrat does not represent the policy of the department.  The 
policy of the department is set by the minister and the minister 
asked those scientists to appear.  They did and they testified in 
full and answered all the questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, here we 
have a minister who knows so little about what is going on in his 
department and who is so scared to have the truth come out that 
he now has to distance himself from the spin control documents 
coming out from his own officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is once the minister could not block the scientists, he 
tried to send the scientists to the committee chaperoned by their 
own boss, like parolees on a day pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple.  Why did the minister tell the House 
one thing when the documents tell a totally different story?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us bear in mind what the issue is here.  The issue here is 
whether those scientists appeared before a committee to testify. 
They did.  They answered all the questions fully and I urged them 
to do so.

risk.  Search and rescue is about saving lives and we do not put 
up aircraft unless it is safe to use, safe for crews and safe for 
the people who will be recipients of this service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief of the air staff has examined this situation very 
carefully.  He is a professional man, a very caring man.  He 
knows the circumstances under which this decision had to be made. 
He believes, after consultation with crews, that this is the 
right decision to make and we will fly these aircraft only after 
further inspection and when they are fully safe to fly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on

investigation into the crash would take but “as soon as we get 
the results, the better”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have the results, nor do the families of the victims. 
It has been reported that crews not comfortable flying the aging 
Labradors will not have to.  Why are the crews being given this 
option? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister believes the Labradors are safe and if none of 
them want to fly the Labradors, what alternatives does the

<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

there is no evidence also to support any systemic failure.  So it 
has been decided by the chief of the air staff, and I fully 
support his position, that these helicopters can go back in the 
air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of the search and rescue crews want to get back in 
the air, want to get back to providing this service for 
Canadians.  Some of them were part of the squadron where the six 
deaths occurred.  They will be given a little more opportunity to 
make their decisions before going back into the air and I think 
that is a good way to move it.

government repeatedly argues that employment insurance money does 
not really belong to workers but the very fact that the

from the EI fund is an admission that the government does not 
even believe its own story.  Otherwise, why would it be paying 
interest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, as it has claimed, the fund belongs to the government to 
spend however it wants, then why in the world is it paying $711

<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is the government's position that contributions to 
the government, whether they come from EI contributions from 
employers or employees or whether they are taxpayer dollars, they 
come from the taxpayers of this country and they must be 
administered with great prudence.  That is what we are in the 
process of doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  So in other 
words, Mr. Speaker, the finance minister is saying the government 
is paying interest to itself.  That is what he seems to be 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you take money that does not belong to you, you go to jail. 
You do not pass go, you do not collect $350 per worker.  Why

benign, when Japan was not in a depression, when Russia's 
government was operating, the Reform Party recommended that the 
government use the EI fund to reduce the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now outside our borders the situation is certainly stormy and 
the government must protect itself and the Canadian people.  By 
what twisted logic does the Reform Party decide all of a sudden 
that we should abandon that cushion?  The issue is what torturous

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario is looking to attain greater authority over its tax 
levers.  It cannot simply be said to the provinces that someone 
will have more authority over their spending without providing 
them with more direct authority over tax policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the provinces feel this agency may ultimately lead to 
less.  If the provinces are not interested, obviously the agency 
will not save money or lead to greater efficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are on the subject of privatization, I draw to the 
minister's attention Bill C-54 which essentially deals with 
electronic privacy.  This bill was tabled by the Minister of 
Industry for a very important reason.  Canadians by and large do 
not have a sufficient degree of trust in the level of privacy 
accorded by the Internet.  Without privacy legislation which 
Canadians are willing to buy into, electronic commerce would be a 
whole bunch of wishful thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing applies here.  The combination of privatization, 
taxation and privacy is a very interesting dynamic, one which 
leads to great anxiety for Canadians.  The question that needs to 
be answered is if most Canadians are unwilling to give personal 
information over the Internet, why should we suppose that they 
are prepared to have a large, faceless private agency with access 
to their most sensitive, personal information? Quite frankly 
Canadians are not interested in such a situation occurring.  We 
can offload a lot of things but we cannot really offload 
leadership.  That is what the government has tried to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than the issue of privacy Canadians also have 
traditionally expressed their frustration with the complexity of 
our income tax regime.  There quite simply can be no 
justification for the fact that Canadians need to hire 
accountants to fill out their personal income tax forms.  The 
notion that somehow a privacy agency will succeed in simplifying 
this process in a way that our present system cannot is 
completely without merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we create incentives with all our public agencies or 
departments that recognize and award excellence as opposed to 
encouraging mediocrity we introduce market incentives without the 
existing agencies.  We can achieve economies without necessarily 
creating new agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the bill will not lead us toward a simpler tax 
system.  It will not help us develop a fairer tax system. It will 
not achieve the goals of a flatter tax system.  It is bureaucracy 
for the sake of bureaucracy, and that is the kind of legislation 
whose day has passed us by.

such lengths to transform a full department with one-fifth of all

this agency?  With the minister saying that few things will 
change, why set up such an agency, as I said a moment ago? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is to be found in the remarks by the President of the

a number of employees of Revenue Canada among his constituents 
who are watching us on television.  I would hope that, in the 
next election, these people who live in the riding of the

government and this minister have no interest in them as public 
servants.  They are being left to the mercy of privatization and 
to be part of a semi-autonomous agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is boasting here in this House almost of having the 
vote of the federal public servants.  I hope that, for once, 
they will really make it clear to the member for Hull—Aylmer, the 
President of the Treasury Board, what they think of this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer lies in the comments of the President of the Treasury 
Board, who says that the creation of the Canada Customs and 
Revenue Agency is an essential part of the government's 
commitment to modernize the federal public service.  In the 
government's opinion, therefore, modernizing the federal public 
service is sort of like privatizing it; it means removing public 
servants from the effect of umbrella legislation such as the 
Public Service Employment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agency will employ about 40,000 public servants, some 20% 
of the entire public service, who will now be at the mercy of 
its board of management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a ten-minute speech, it is difficult to cover all the bases. 
I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate my 
colleagues on this side of the House, who worked very hard 
studying this bill, including the hon. member for 
Terrebonne—Blainville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to list the main reasons for rejecting this agency. 
First, we will have a mega tax collection agency that will 
enable the federal government to extend its influence to our 
communities. Moreover, with this agency, accountability to the 
public and to Parliament will be weakened. We also feel that the 
agency could be prejudicial to the privacy of Quebeckers and 
Canadians. This agency is a classic example of the building of 
an empire by Ottawa's senior bureaucrats locked up in their 
ivory tower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois thinks the primary reason for creating this 
agency is to conclude new tax agreements with the provinces, 
something which, incidentally, has not materialized. We also 
think that small and large businesses are not impressed with the 
new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that the hon. member for Mercier, who is our industry 
critic and who pays very close attention to the concerns of 
small businesses, agrees with what I just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the business community was supposed to be the first 
to benefit from the agency. However, reaction to the new agency 
was mixed, to say the least. Organizations representing small 
businesses, including the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business, were particularly suspicious of the enormous powers 
that would be concentrated in the hands of the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A full 40% of the businesses that participated in a Public 
Policy Forum study commissioned by Revenue Canada see no point 
in having this agency. We are not talking about 2% or 3%, but 
about 40%. 
Forty percent of the businesses polled feel that the agency 
would increase or maintain the costs of their relationship with 
the department.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we in the Bloc Quebecois are of the opinion that 
this agency will bring about new hidden taxes.  Its supposed 
purpose is savings, but we believe it will bring new costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the agency is already wasting money even if it does not 
yet exist.  We know that, even before gaining parliamentary 
approval, it is already costing the taxpayers money.  Hundreds 
of departmental employees have already been relieved of their 
usual duties and assigned to design teams or other exercises 
serving the ambitions of senior bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any public servant listening to us knows what we mean by senior 
bureaucrats in the federal public service.  We do not need to 
spell it out.  They know, for they live with it every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This costly diversion has also prevented the department from 
concentrating on its usual tasks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One final point we would draw to the attention of this House is 
that this agency will be more bureaucratic than Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to meet in my riding an employee of 
Revenue Canada working in the Quebec City region, who made me 
very aware of the nasty effects and aspects of this agency.  To 
protect him under the provisions of the Public Service 
Employment Act, I will not name him, but he and his colleagues 
know who they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employees of Revenue Canada are concerned and anxious.  They 
tell us that the declared intention is to create a headless 
bureaucratic monster that can go where it will and do what it 
wants.  I am not sure this agency will look after the public 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Quebec does not support the desire of the federal 
government to centralize all activities related to the 
collection of federal revenues in a countrywide agency.  We in 
Quebec already have our own department of revenue— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt you, but I thought you were 
concluding.  In any case, your time is up.  Perhaps you could 
come back for the next round. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in the House today to debate this very 
important issue.  I do so on behalf of the residents of 
Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by pointing out an important element of the 
proposal for the Canada customs and revenue agency and that is 
that it is a framework for the participation of the provinces and 
the territories.  By setting the right conditions for greater 
co-ordination of federal and provincial tax administration, the 
agency can and will serve both the national as well as the 
provincial interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success of the Canada customs and revenue agency does not 
require the participation of every province and territory.  In 
fact participation in the agency is fully voluntary.  The agency 
is intended to provide a framework and a platform to work for the 
benefit of all the provinces, not to take over any provincial 
powers.  The creation of a new agency will reduce overlap and 
duplication between federal and provincial revenue 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Mr. Speaker, there is only one taxpayer. Why not 
then a single administration to collect taxes? This approach will 
allow governments to reduce their administrative costs and at the 
same time provide savings in compliance costs to taxpayers.  Only 
where provinces and territories agree that a sound business case 
can be made for a specific service to be supplied by the agencies 
will these arrangements in fact be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec has been consulted along with all other 
provinces since the beginning of this process. Quebec has told us 
that although it does not want the new agency to administer any 
of its programs, it is willing to stay informed about its 
progress. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT48"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT48"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1520

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency legislation in fact simply represents a framework for 
closer collaboration.  There is no obligation on the part of 
Quebec or any other province to have the agency administer more 
programs on its behalf if it is a matter completely for each to 
decide on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if Quebec chooses not to participate, Canadian businesses 
will still benefit by saving between $116 million and $193 
million annually in compliance costs. In addition, governments 
would save between $37 million and $62 million in administrative 
costs. Any new programs that the agency will administer will be 
based on a business case analysis.  This will apply to Quebec as 
it will to all other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time Revenue Canada collects personal income 
taxes for nine provinces and corporate income taxes for seven. 
Revenue Canada administers provincial social benefit programs for 
British Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, the 
Northwest Territories and Nova Scotia.  Revenue Canada also 
collects provincial sales tax, and alcohol and tobacco taxes at 
the border for a number of provinces.  It also administers the 
national child benefit. There is ample precedent for this 
co-ordination and consolidation of services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed agency by its very structure should expand even 
further the level of co-operation and at the same time increase 
the provincial voice in tax administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces and territories will be able to supply lists of 
nominees from the private sector for 11 of the 15 directors on 
the board of management which will direct the business planning 
of the agency.  These directors will not, I repeat not, be on the 
board to represent the specific interests of their province, but 
rather to bring a provincial and regional sensitivity to the 
management of the board and the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The powers of the agency will be broad enough to allow it to 
enter into service agreements with individual provinces, for 
example for the collection of a non-harmonized provincial tax. 
Until now Revenue Canada could only administer provincial taxes 
if they were harmonized with federal taxes, limiting the number 
of programs that could be administered by Revenue Canada.  Under 
Bill C-43 the agency will be empowered to administer 
non-harmonized taxes such as the provincial sales tax which is 
not harmonized.  There are still economies of scale under a 
single administration even if a tax is not harmonized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will enter into an agreement with a province to 
administer a tax, but all of these agreements will have to follow 
guidelines which will be established by federal and provincial 
finance ministers.  These guidelines will ensure that any taxes 
collected by the agency on behalf of the provinces and the 
territories will first of all, be legally valid; second, not 
jeopardize the system of self-assessment; third, not involve 
double taxation; fourth, ensure fairness; and finally, be 
undertaken under mutually acceptable contractual arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last criterion demonstrates an important aspect of these 
agreements.  They are service contracts with the agency providing 
a service to a province or territory according to specific terms 
and conditions of a contract between the two parties.  This means 
that the province or territory will retain full authority over 
the tax and will be accountable to the taxpayers for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will have to strengthen its accountability to the 
provinces for the administration of programs on their behalf so 
that they in turn can be accountable to their own taxpayers. Once 
a year the commissioner of the agency will have to report to 
provincial and territorial ministers on the programs and services 
managed on their behalf and offer to meet with them also on an 
annual basis to obtain their feedback on the agency's performance 
on their programs and their services.  This strengthening of the 
accountability and performance bonds between the agency and the 
provinces and the territories will ensure that programs and 
services remain innovative, responsive to clients and cost 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that a study of the Public Policy Forum 
estimates that Revenue Canada could administer current provincial 
taxes for about $97 million to $162 million less than is 
currently spent, an overall reduction of 6% of the current costs 
if all provinces participate.  The agency is currently 
undertaking joint studies with some provinces to examine specific 
possibilities.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Savings to individuals, businesses and governments increase as 
more provinces and territories participate.  So it is in the best 
interests of all Canadians to have as much provincial and 
territorial participation as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 will make the Canada customs and revenue agency a 
reality.  The agency will be structured and positioned to earn 
the support of the provinces and the territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that all provinces and territories as well 
as the federal government have worked hard to put their financial 
houses in order.  The Canada customs and revenue agency is an 
opportunity to reduce costly overlap and duplication between the 
orders of government even further.  That is important to note and 
certainly something all Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge this House to pass Bill C-43 as quickly as possible so 
that Canadians in all provinces can realize the tangible benefits 
of better and more cost effective tax, customs and trade 
administration services in Canada.  I believe that is what 
Canadians want and I sincerely believe that is what Canadians 
deserve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I regret very much that I have the opportunity to debate 
Bill C-43 this afternoon because I do not think this bill is 
necessary at all. This is a good example of unnecessary meddling. 
It is ideological child's play, or incompetent bungling, or a 
hidden agenda.  I am not sure what to call it when it comes to 
this government and Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly have never had constituents, other than people who 
felt they had been done some particular injustice, cry for the 
quasi privatization of Revenue Canada.  I do not think the 
government is responding to any real need, except perhaps a need 
to cook the books with respect to how many employees there are in 
the federal public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada's 40,000 employees make up about 20% of the 
federal public service.  This particular bill would also involve 
the transfer of more than $2 billion in annual parliamentary 
estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that what the government is up to here is it is 
creating the impression that it is somehow downsizing the public 
service.  Then two or three years from now, whenever this becomes 
a reality, the government can say that it eliminated 20,000 
employees from the public service payroll and that it should be 
lauded or should get some right wing award or medal for how many 
public servants it eliminated. It seems to me that is part of 
what is going on and I want to say how strongly I object to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to have the taxation data centre for western Canada in 
my riding.  Many hundreds of Canadians work there, many full time 
as well as part time early in the spring when people's tax 
returns are due. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was recently there to participate with many of the workers, 
hundreds of them again, when they were demonstrating in favour of 
pay equity, when they were showing their anger at this government 
for not respecting the judgment of the tribunal. This government 
is now adding insult to injury.  Not only is it saying to these 
people that it will not respect the tribunal's judgment on pay 
equity, but it is also going to change the nature of the 
government department they work for in such a way as to make them 
much more vulnerable than they are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say with confidence that I speak on behalf of hundreds 
of my constituents and those who live in surrounding 
constituencies who work at the taxation data centre when I 
register my opposition to Bill C-43 and the intention of the 
government to establish the Canada customs and revenue agency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said earlier that I thought this was completely unnecessary. 
One of the arguments for that is that there is certainly not the 
kind of support we would want from the provinces if we were going 
to create such an agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is moving toward this independent agency without 
the support of four major provinces and, as I have already said, 
it does not have the support of the majority of its workers.  The 
major stakeholders are not buying it.  Certainly the citizens of 
this country have not indicated any great desire for this to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario, Quebec and Prince Edward Island are firmly opposed. 
B.C. and Saskatchewan have not endorsed the concept.  All 
provinces generally see the agency as an intrusion into 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian businesses have major reservations about the proposed 
agency.  There is certainly a concern that a lot of people have, 
whether they be in business or ordinary citizens or whomever, 
that we might see down the line this new Canada customs and 
revenue agency becoming out of control, becoming something like 
the IRS in the United States which has a history of working 
according to quotas, of intimidating and harassing taxpayers in 
order to get a certain return on its investment one might say. 
We do not want to have this kind of system in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no demonstrable need or desire for changing 
Revenue Canada in this drastic way.  The jobs of tens of 
thousands of civil servants are being put in jeopardy here.  It 
seems this is one more instance of an ideological fetish or 
fixation on the part of this government for forms of 
privatization and quasi-privatization that it would do well to 
give up on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the downside of privatization in a number of other 
instances.  We saw it just last week when CN was laying off 3,000 
people simply to please its shareholders, not because there was 
any particular need to lay off these people, not because there 
was not work for them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Lay off Tellier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  There is an idea.  However, when Paul 
Tellier leaves the CNR with all his stock options and everything 
else he takes with him, chances are the next CEO of CN 
headquartered in Montreal will be American. Mark my words.  It 
will be an American imported from some American railway and we 
will have the absolutely shameful spectacle of Canadian National, 
headquartered in Montreal, being operated and directed by an 
American.  This is not many years away. All this is because of 
this Liberal government which did and is doing things that not 
even those who we knew to be ideological, those who we knew to be 
right wing, the Conservatives, did in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the betrayal that we have seen since 1993.  At least 
many of things the Conservatives did they said they were going to 
do.  They were at least up front about their philosophy and about 
where they stood with regard to crown corporations and the role 
of government.  They were not deceitful like the Liberal Party 
was in its campaign of 1993 in particular.  By 1997 people had 
reason to at least know where it was at but for a variety of 
reasons it is still the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Liberals have not learned a lesson and we see here 
before us Bill C-43 where they are proceeding with another form 
of privatization.  I just wanted to register my strong objection 
and the objection of my party, which was registered before by the 
hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle and many other members, to 
this particular measure and our contention that it will prove to 
be a mistake and one that many Canadians, particularly those who 
now work for Revenue Canada, will pay dearly for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, we 
have heard a lot of fearmongering on the other side with regard 
to the establishment of this agency.  I would like to point out 
the many reasons for moving to a departmental agency status, none 
more important than the demands of clients for better, 
streamlined and more responsive tax, customs and trade 
administration services, and more of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time of economic expansion the demand for tax, customs 
and trade services also increases.  A million new jobs in Canada 
since 1993 means many more tax filers both individual and 
corporate.  Resources at Revenue Canada have remained relatively 
stable during the period of economic expansion and steep 
increases in business volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the new demand has been accompanied by internal 
operating efficiencies.  There is little room left for more 
efficiency gains at Revenue Canada under the present structure. 
Hence the need for a new framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency model proposed, Canada customs and revenue agency, is 
unique.  It combines the strengths of both public and private 
sectors while remaining fully accountable to parliament and to 
the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In developing the Canada customs and revenue agency, the 
department has been sensitive to the concern of the concentration 
of too much power in one place.  Tax, customs and trade 
administration affect the lives and livelihoods of Canadians. 
They want to be sure they are dealt with fairly and that their 
rights are protected.  The intention is not to create a new 
agency with unlimited power and unlimited scope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the design of the new agency, the essential checks and 
balances that govern the activities and ensure the accountability 
of Revenue Canada have been maintained.  For example, the 
enforcement powers of the new agency will be the same as those 
currently provided to Revenue Canada through legislation like the 
Income Tax Act or the Customs Act.  If there is a problem or a 
complaint the minister will still be fully accountable to 
parliament and to the public for the administration and 
enforcement of specific legislation.  The minister will also have 
the authority, as in the case now, to answer questions in the 
House and ensure the agency is acting properly in its dealings 
with the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The confidentiality of a taxpayer's personal information will be 
protected under the agency as it is currently with Revenue 
Canada.  The authorities governing confidentiality are clearly 
set out in legislation.  They will not be changed by this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 will permit the agency to offer new and better 
services to the provinces and territories.  For example, at the 
present time Revenue Canada can only collect provincial taxes 
that are harmonized with federal taxes.  The new agency will be 
able to collect non-harmonized taxes, expanding the potential for 
single window tax collection with considerable savings for 
businesses and individual Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greater co-ordination between the federal and provincial and 
territorial governments will simplify tax administration for 
Canadians and reduce costs and overlap and duplication between 
governments.  This is what Canadians expect and this is what we 
are going to deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major change that will allow the new agency to adopt a more 
client oriented approach would be increased operational 
flexibility in the management of internal resources.  The new 
legislation will allow the proposed agency to tailor its human 
resources and administrative functions to meet the needs of its 
clients as well as those of its employees.  All this means better 
service to provinces and territories, to businesses and to 
individual Canadians.

compliance costs for businesses, savings in administration costs

the checks and balances for a superior agency.

<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-43 is 
a bureaucratic aberration, a serious blow against democracy, 
protection of personal information, respect for jurisdictions 
and service to the people, nothing less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our colleagues opposite just offered an explanation as to 
why the Minister of Revenue is acting this way. He said that 
there is little room left for more efficiency gains at Revenue 
Canada under the present structure, so the minister is creating 
a so-called outside agency to achieve more efficiency gains. 
To this end, 20% of the public service will be transferred to 
this agency and will no longer by subject to the Public Service 
Employment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize a number of elements of particular 
concern to me. What sparked off anger, or at least serious 
concern, in me was rereading the remarks contained in the 
February 1996 throne speech, where the government announced its 
intention to set up a national revenue recovery agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague opposite spoke of modernization requiring that the 
agency have a new attitude toward its clients. He suggested that 
the public should be reassured about that. The problem in this 
bill, as it often is with bills brought in by this government, 
is that they are trying to create an illusion the way magicians 
do. 
When we take a closer look at the bill, we see that the opposite 
is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are the agency's clients?  Looking through the bill, we see 
that they are governments, municipalities and organizations that 
sign agreements with the agency.  The public is not a client. 
It is the target of recovery measures.  And just what does 
recovery mean?  It means something along the lines of “You have 
committed fraud.  You have not paid what you owe.”  This is not 
at all the relationship we were led to believe was the goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many of Canada's provinces, the public pays voluntarily at a 
given time, because our system is different from many others. 
People pay their taxes voluntarily, because they know the law. 
It is not a question of recovering income of which the 
government would have been deprived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is rather serious.  It is more than a change in culture. 
It is a change in government ethics, with productivity being 
given as the excuse, as I have already said.  But what will this 
bill produce?  My colleague opposite said that it combines the 
best of the private and public sectors.  I do not bet, but I am 
prepared to debate this statement a few years from now with any 
comers.  What it does is combine the worst of the private and 
public sectors.  The worst of the private sector will be 
bureaucracy instead of efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In administration we learn that bureaucracy has nothing to do 
with being in the private or the public sector.  It has to do 
with the size of an enterprise. 
GM, a private corporation, has become a bureaucracy, with 
significant problems as a result.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we know about this body is that it will have a tendency to 
become a bureaucratic organization.  Moreover, in the public 
sector, what would the guarantees of quality and reliability 
have been?  The people can have confidence because, for one 
thing, some of the MPs here will be able to defend them and to 
debate issues with the responsible minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that the minister will continue to be responsible for 
this super-agency, but let us look at the powers he is able to 
confer on others.  He can delegate them to a commissioner or any 
other employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of generating confidence, the opposite will be true. 
Much can be said about this. 
The fact that public servants are unionized is of concern to 
some, but it actually does allow them to act ethically in their 
duties as they must, particularly in collecting taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on, they will be in a completely submissive position. 
They will, of course, try to get another union, but that will 
not be easy.  They will no longer be covered by the Public 
Service Employment Act; they will be in a totally different 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some really juicy parts to this bill.  Care has been 
taken to state, under human resources, that one of the functions 
of the agency will be to provide for the awards that may be made 
to persons employed by the agency for outstanding performance of 
their duties, for other meritorious achievement in relation to 
those duties and for inventions or practical suggestions for 
improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where recovery of revenues is concerned, which means tax 
collection, let us say that any member of the public would find 
this a matter of concern. 
The government is not reaffirming the trust between taxpayers 
and this organization, which is a crown agency. Rather, it is 
trying to convert it into a bureaucratic agency—there is no 
other word to describe it—that will escape the necessary 
monitoring of the House and its parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I absolutely must discuss the issue of privacy. We are currently 
reviewing Bill C-54 on electronic commerce and the protection of 
personal information. In today's world, it is quite easy to 
match data and to obtain information on people from all sorts of 
sources, and to use this information in a way that might not be 
in compliance with the law, particularly if what we had in mind 
was to add things, to sign contracts with businesses and 
organizations, for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enormous agency that some dream about would be a perfect 
place to match data. 
We know how concerned the privacy commissioner was because the 
Department of Human Resources Development was matching data 
that, in his opinion, were supposed to be personal information. 
The right to privacy is a fundamental human right. We must not 
forget that. We are not living in Orwell's world, in <I>1984</I>, 
although we may sometimes think that even that world would be 
better than the one we are living in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public trust is the foundation of an effective tax collection 
process. But for that trust to exist, there must be 
accountability. How can we expect to convince the public that 
ministerial accountability would be exercised, given that this 
revenue collection agency will be evaluated based on its 
profitability?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On what grounds will the agency be judged cost-effective?  How 
will the public's rights—this has to be addressed—be defended? 
How will these two issues be reconciled?  Tragic situations can 
sometimes arrive; right now, recourse is available—through one's 
member of parliament—but this will no longer be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public must be warned that it is losing an important 
democratic right.  It is allowing the creation of an 
organization where personal information may not be safe.  When 
the workers are public servants with job security and a union, 
they are accountable to us. This, however, will no longer be the 
case.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, we are debating Bill C-43, an act to establish a Canada 
customs and revenue agency.  There is no question that we in the 
Reform Party believe in streamlining government and making sure 
there are efficiencies in any way we can save taxpayers' money. 
We have an obligation to do that for all people across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there are problems with the legislation we are debating. 
There needs to be time for it to go through a process where it 
can be amended and debated so that it runs its course to ensure 
that taxpayers are getting the best possible result and the most 
efficient piece of legislation that will work in their interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the Liberal government has brought in closure on 
debate against the will of all opposition parties.  They all 
voted against closure.  I will read some quotes.  This is what 
one government members said in this regard: “It displays the 
utter disdain with which this government treats the Canadian 
people”.  This is with respect to closure, shutting down debate, 
and was said by Lloyd Axworthy on April 1, 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must warn the hon. 
member again that we do not refer to members by their names in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  This is what the government House leader 
stated with respect to closure: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—I am shocked—. This is just terrible.  This time we are 
talking about a major piece of legislation—. Shame on those 
Tories across the way. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was on November 16, 1992 in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kingston and the Islands, the Deputy Speaker, 
stated “What we have here is an absolute scandal in terms of the 
government's unwillingness to listen to the representatives of 
the people in this House.  Never before have we had a government 
so reluctant to engage in public discussion on the bills brought 
before this House”.  That was a government member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government has come into power we have had 40 time 
allocation motions and 3 closure motions.  This is a disgrace. 
We are all elected to the House.  All 301 including the Speaker 
represent Canadians from coast to coast.  We all have a right to 
have our voices heard in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we see the government shutting down the process the 
minute those members get a bit squeamish or uncomfortable about 
anything, whether firing the minister of fisheries, trying to 
close the lid on government documents, not releasing them to 
committees, or bringing forward closure.  It goes on and on and 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the point I wanted to make with respect to closure and I 
want to leave some time for other members.  We have very limited 
time in this debate.  It is an absolute disgrace that the tactic 
the government uses is to shut down the debate every opportunity 
it can, the minute those members are a bit uncomfortable.  I 
think they should be ashamed of themselves. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the revenue agency act is another word for privatization 
affecting 40,000 employees at a time when the morale is low 
already for a large number of employees being affected by the pay 
equity issue.  The Liberal government is refusing to bring 
justice to the men and women within the Public Service Alliance, 
but it made a promise in 1993 that it would honour the tribunal 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is long awaited enabling legislation required to 
convert Revenue Canada from a government department into an arm's 
length special operating agency.  When the notion of the Canada 
customs and revenue agency was first mentioned in the 1996 Speech 
from the Throne, it was presented as a cost effective, more 
efficient vehicle for improving service to the public. However, 
events have overtaken the agency to the point that it fails to 
meet all its stated objectives.  It cannot now be justified on a 
basis of either bureaucratic efficiency or cost effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its supporting arguments are riddled with contradictions, 
misstatements of fact and flimsy rationalization.  The concept of 
the Canada customs and revenue agency is bad public policy and 
should be stopped before it starts.  The agency will be a 
mega-person, extending Ottawa's reach down into our community and 
our life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It proposes to administer everything from provincial sales taxes 
to gasoline taxes and liquor taxes.  Its vision would see a 
mega-taxperson that would offer services to municipalities. Do we 
really want Ottawa involved in our property taxes?  Do we really 
want to put this much power into one government agency? Of course 
not.  However left unchecked this may very well happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will reduce accountability to the public and to 
parliament.  Revenue Canada, as presently structured, is fully 
accountable to parliament and the taxpaying public through the 
Minister of National Revenue.  The department's policies, 
programs and activities are open to daily scrutiny during the 
House of Commons question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the Canada customs and revenue agency poses a 
challenge to parliamentarians as guardians of the public trust 
and interest.  Although its promoters repeatedly stress that the 
new agency would be fully accountable to our elected 
representatives, this is misleading at best and deceitful at 
worst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To gauge the commitment of the agency's promoters to 
parliamentary oversight, one need look no further than the senior 
bureaucrats April 1997 progress report.  This document brazenly 
suggested exempting the agency's operations from fundamental 
principle of ministerial accountability to the House of Commons. 
The elitist and anti-democratic proposal was withdrawn in the 
face of furious opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will face less scrutiny from parliament than is now 
the case.  The auditor general has expressed his concerns over 
protection of the public interest. 
An agency will likely be less concerned than a fully accountable 
government department in responding to questions or concerns 
raised by individual MPs on behalf of the public.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an arm's length separate employer the agency would find it 
easier to stonewall parliament while at the same time providing a 
pretext for the minister of the day to shift the focus of 
accountability to the top agency bureaucrat, the commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency's enabling legislation would permit a full 
parliamentary review only five years after it has begun 
operation.  A lot can go very wrong over such a broad expanse of 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency could jeopardize the public's personal privacy.  We 
live in an electronic world where more and more information about 
us and our families is readily bought and sold by private sector 
organizations, from credit card companies to charities to 
consumer goods companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the agency meet its stated objectives, an incredible 
amount of personal and financial information would be 
concentrated in one institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will renew Ottawa's effort to harmonize the GST and 
provincial sales taxes beyond the maritimes.  Originally the CCRA 
was conceived as a bureaucratic blunt instrument to help 
government keep its 1993 election promise to abolish the GST. 
The agency was supposed to enable Ottawa to harmonize the 
unpopular GST with provincial sales taxes across the country.  I 
think it is important that we talk about the harmonization of the 
GST and the PST.  We ended up with a terrible sales tax in New 
Brunswick with the HST.  We now have a 15% tax on electricity, a 
15% tax on heating oil and a 15% tax on children's clothing.  It 
was an increase of 8%.  That is what we got with harmonization. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point that out.  It came with the 
harmonization of the taxes.  In New Brunswick we pay huge taxes 
on children's clothing, on diapers, on electricity and on 
heating oil.  The people being hit with increased taxes are the 
same ones being hit with toll highways at home.  They have lost 
all sorts of income, for having lost their jobs, among other 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also cuts in the employment centres, jobs that have 
been lost, employment insurance cheques that have vanished or 
been halved. 
Our taxes are now even higher, because the Liberal government 
refused to keep its promise to eliminate the GST. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency has also failed to impress small and big business. 
The business community, both small and large, was supposed to be 
the biggest beneficiary of the new agency.  Small business 
organizations such as the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business are particularly leery of the massive centralized power 
the agency would possess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A full 40% of business respondents to a public policy forum 
study commissioned by Revenue Canada saw no advantage to the 
agency.  More than two-thirds thought it would either increase or 
maintain their costs of dealing with the department as currently 
structured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, the agency will likely have to turn to user fees in 
order to deliver on its promise of cost savings.  As planned, the 
agency would deliver the bulk of its costs by harmonizing the GST 
and the PST and by taking over provincial and municipal tax 
administration.  But neither seems to be in the cards.  So what 
is likely to happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One scenario would see an over-ambitious agency move to trim 
costs by reducing staff and services to the public.  I think 
we have to look at that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that, with an agency, the service will not improve. 
That has been proven in many areas.  It is also a reason for 
cutting more jobs.  The government finds reasons for cutting, 
and it is always the low person on the totem pole whose job is 
lost. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A more probable direction would see the imposition of user fees. 
User fees are something we see more and more of everywhere. 
Again, the one at the bottom with the lowest income has to pay 
all the user fees, be they to Revenue Canada, National Parks, 
trying to get a driver's licence or a medicare card.  There are 
more and more fees and more and more people who cannot afford 
them.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As proposed, the agency would be empowered to set user fees for 
services that provide a specific benefit to service recipients. 
This immense loophole could see both individuals and small 
businesses paying additional fees for the privilege of paying 
their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No less a person than the auditor general has expressed his 
concern over the proposed agency's accountability.  Denis 
Desautels asked in his December 1997 report to parliament: “How 
will Canadians and parliamentarians have assurances that the 
public interest is protected?”  He was not able to get an answer 
to that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that I think going to an agency is 
terrible for Revenue Canada.  Perhaps for Parks Canada it would 
be all right.  It is a way for government to cut and to bring 
down salaries.  It is another word for privatization. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be concerned about these issues.  We must understand the 
government has a hidden agenda.  This has to stop. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
with Bill C-43, the Minister of National Revenue is proposing 
today the establishment of a new Canada customs and revenue 
agency. The federal government seems to be abdicating its 
primary responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this rate, why not privatize the Canadian Armed Forces and 
establish a government agency responsible for looking after the 
well being of Canadians? Why not privatize the RCMP while we are 
at it? Is there no end to this government's absurdity and 
irresponsibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an educator, I can give you an example: the Post Office 
Department. Control over this organization was transferred away 
from the government when Canada Post was established. Naturally, 
this agency is accountable to the minister responsible for 
Canada Post. This minister is also the minister responsible for 
Public Works and Government Services Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post rents a number of buildings from Public Works and 
Government Services Canada. 
In my riding, the tenant is not too happy. Dozens of residents 
of Disraeli have paid special attention to the grounds in front 
of the existing post office on St-Joseph Street, in Disraeli. 
This post office has been for sale for many years. There is a 
“For Sale” sign on the decrepit building and the cedar hedge is 
all dry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament, I took upon myself to write the Hon. 
André Ouellet, the former minister who resigned to make room for 
the new Minister of Human Resources Development. As a reward, he 
was offered the title of chairman of Canada Post Corporation, 
which comes with an annual salary of $154,000 and a bottomless 
expense account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sent a letter to André Ouellet to draw his attention to the 
fact that the exterior of the Canada Post building, a building 
rented by Canada Post Corporation but owned by Public Works and 
Government Services Canada, was in a sorry state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My letter to the Minister responsible for Public Works and 
Government Services Canada was mailed in August, and the reply 
arrived two days ago. It read in part “In response to your 
letter of August 18, 1998, addressed to Mr. André Ouellet, 
chairman of the Canada Post Corporation, regarding the 
appearance of the Disraeli post office, which is owned by Public 
Works and Government Services Canada”.

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter goes on to say “First of all, the fact that it has 
been planned for some years now to vacate this building has had 
an impact on the approval of renovation projects.  In 1995, 
certain repairs were recommended in an expert evaluation, but 
since the building had been declared surplus, only priority 
projects were undertaken, among them the installation of an 
automatic door opener to bring the building in line with 
accessibility standards”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A short paragraph follows that will definitely be of interest to 
the people of Disraeli.  “Moreover, I will take advantage of 
this opportunity to inform you that this building is about to be 
sold.  A purchase commitment was accepted on September 30, 
contingent on financing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The danger that lurks behind the creation of an agency like the 
one here, which would collect taxes, including the federal GST 
and the provincial sales tax, is that everything will be allowed 
to deteriorate.  The building I have referred to here is located 
in a town of 3,000, but serves most of the surrounding rural 
municipalities as well, and it has been totally neglected. It is 
an embarrassment to Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post says “But, you know, this building is not our 
property. 
It belongs to Public Works Canada”. Public Works Canada says “It 
is pointless to repair the building, we want to sell it”. You 
can see what happens under a government led by the Prime 
Minister and member for Saint-Maurice, who gets bad, very bad 
advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I want to quote a statement made not too long 
ago by the President of the Treasury Board, who said “Creation 
of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency is an essential 
component of the government's commitment to modernize the 
federal public service”. The minister did say “to modernize the 
federal public service”. He should come to Disraeli. The member 
of parliament had to ask that a totally dried out hedge be 
removed to get things moving. Everything is neglected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the building in Disraeli is sold, what will Canada Post 
do? 
It will sign a long term lease, probably for a period of 10 
years, with an option to renew at conditions that are usually 
very reassuring to the new buyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with the statements made by the Prime Minister to <I>La Presse</I> a 
few days ago, one can see that they are totally out of touch 
with rural areas and people who want a certain quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister should get out of his bubble and meet 
ordinary people. If he does not want to come to Frontenac—and I 
can certainly understand why—he should at least go to his own 
riding of Saint-Maurice. His constituents only see him once every 
four years—when he is seeking re-election—along with about 100 
people working for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point I want to make. At first, the agency will 
be created by converting the existing revenue department into a 
semi-independent government agency. 
That agency will have the mandate of negotiating, with the 
provinces and municipalities that are interested, the collection 
of all taxes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you another example, that of the RCMP and the QPP in 
Quebec, or the OPP in Ontario. As members know, the RCMP, which 
provides police services in the other eight provinces and in the 
territories—and even in certain large cities—only charges 
those provinces and cities 77% of its actual costs. This means 
that Quebec and Ontario indirectly pay 23% of the RCMP services 
in New Brunswick, British Columbia, Alberta and the territories.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That could happen.  The provinces and municipalities not using 
this new tax, revenue or customs collection agency—if Quebec or 
Ontario fail to join—will pay indirectly for the other provinces 
using its services.  An injustice will occur, just as is the 
case with the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, they say it will be the same thing and that 
they will comply with the Access to Information Act, the Privacy 
Act and the Official Languages Act.  The Department of National 
Revenue is not even able to comply with the Official Languages 
Act now. 
I have had dozens of complaints in my riding from passengers and 
truckers going through Lacolle, who claim that the officers they 
see are unilingual English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I promise one thing, and I have a pretty reliable 
memory.  The member for Verdun—Saint-Henri will run into me when 
he speaks.  He is one of the most vulgar and rude members of the 
Liberal Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley,

talk about the new tax agency and compare it to what exists now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament, as do all members of this House, I 
meet with people on a daily basis who are having difficulties 
with Revenue Canada.  These difficulties generally result from 
the adversarial approach that Revenue Canada uses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen individuals who have been in heart-wrenching 
situations where Revenue Canada has seemed to compound the hurt 
these people are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give one example of a young mother who had a premature 
baby which weighed under two pounds and was put in a special 
hospital unit in the city of Vancouver. This child survived 
because of the hospital and the mother bonding with the child, 
giving it the incentive to be a real little fighter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mother at the end of the year tried to claim the expenses of 
travelling from South Surrey to Vancouver on a regular basis to 
make sure this child was bonding with her and to be supportive of 
the health care the child was getting.  The mother was told it 
would not be covered because she should have gone to the hospital 
closest to her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hospital closest to the mother happens to be a palliative 
care hospital, a hospital which specializes in the treatment of 
the elderly, not newborns who are facing serious health problems. 
The hospital that specialized in this type of care just happened 
to be in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada, in dealing with this situation, said it was 
unfortunate but the hospital just happened to be a little bit too 
close.  The hospital should have been another 10 kilometres away

</I></B></P><P align=left>Tell that to a mother who is trying to make ends meet and who 
has extra costs because of the health needs of her child. Because 
the hospital happened to be 10 kilometres too close she did not 
qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that there does not seem to be any kind of 
flexibility or compassion in the existing system.  The existing 
system is managed by a minister of the crown, responsible to this 
House of Commons and accountable to the people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give many other examples of people who have lost their 
homes and whose families have broken up because of the attitude 
within the existing Revenue Canada of “You owe us money and 
under all circumstances you will pay that money”.  When people 
find themselves in distress and unable to pay, whether it is GST 
or income tax, or when they have a problem and are appealing a 
decision, a year or two years later when the appeal process is 
underway they find that what they owe has tripled or quadrupled 
because Revenue Canada is charging interest on the amount that is 
under dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot tell the House how many families I have had in my 
office who are just beside themselves because they are unable to 
pay the government.  The government is unwilling to be flexible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that if we have this independent agency, which is 
really only accountable to the minister, what is the attitude 
going to be?  Is it going to be like the IRS?  It wanted to 
charge a young lad who happened to catch the baseball which Mark 
McGwire hit when he was building up his home run record. This 
young lad gave the baseball back to Mark McGwire, but the IRS 
actually talked about taxing him on the amount that baseball 
would have sold for on the open market.  That is the kind of 
irresponsible decision making that agencies make that are far 
removed from accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that we are talking about setting up an agency 
that is only accountable to the minister.  I am afraid it will be 
a little bit more hard-nosed than the existing system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say that this agency is a good thing.  There are people 
at the provincial level, for example the minister of finance for 
Alberta, who feel that a proposal to handle federal-provincial 
tax collection would be a great thing and that it should go to 
any province that wants it, potentially gutting a key federal 
power.  Provinces that ought to collect all taxes on their 
territory would remit the federal portion back to Ottawa, which 
is a reversal of the existing system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People would say this is a provincial minister who is out to 
lunch.  But he is not the only one.  I will quote from a document 
from a provincial MLA who was asked to do a study for the 
provincial government of British Columbia.  In his report he says 
“The division of taxing powers between the federal and 
provincial governments is an important part of what defines 
Canada as a federated state”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say “It is time that our Confederation was 
renewed with a transfer of taxing authority from Ottawa to the 
provinces so that the provinces have the resources to adequately 
fund the programs that they are legally bound to deliver”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people across this country and provincial governments 
who believe that maybe we should be looking at a taxing 
authority.  Where they differ from the federal government is that 
they feel it is time for these taxing powers to go back to the 
provinces so that the provinces can use the money to deliver the 
services, as they are the government closest to the people.  Then 
they will release the funds that are necessary to the federal 
government so the federal government can do that which is its to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a debate that has occurred over a number of years. There 
are two sides to the debate.  We have the Liberal government that 
feels it wants to get federal control of this agency and that the 
provinces will go along with it, not acknowledging that there are 
provinces and people in the provinces who feel it is the 
provincial government that should be taking this initiative, not 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that if the government is serious about 
this manoeuvre of having an arm's length agency to collect taxes 
in the country that it take hold of the accountability factor a 
lot more than other ministers of the crown have done.

this House to tell us that the IRB, the Immigration and Refugee 
Board, is an arm's length board which they cannot control and 
have no say in.  The solicitor general has said that the Public 
Complaints Commission is at arm's length from the government and 
he has no say in it.  At some point there has to be 
accountability.  Somebody has to take responsibility for the 
decisions that are being made.  If the minister of revenue is 
intent on establishing this agency, then he will have to accept 
responsibility for the decisions this agency makes on behalf of 
Canadians.  Because it is an arm's length agency does not remove 
the fact that the buck has to stop somewhere, and it stops with 
the minister who is responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern of the opposition is that if this agency goes 
ahead there has to be some protection for the Canadian taxpayer. 
Canadian taxpayers who feel they are being taxed unjustly must be 
able to go to someone for help and assistance.  We would like to 
see an office for taxpayer protection established before this 
agency comes into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayer protection office would report to parliament each 
year, issue taxpayer protection orders, act as an advocate of 
last resort for taxpayers, assist taxpayers in resolving 
disputes, identify areas where taxpayers have been consistently 
having problems with the agency, propose changes to 
administrative practices where these problems arise, and identify 
potential changes to legislation in order to minimize problems 
encountered by taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the protection is there for the Canadian taxpayer, if there 
is a government commitment not to throw the taxpayer out to the 
wolves, we might be more willing to support this legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, employees, their unions and managers all agree that the 
current human resources framework of Revenue Canada is not 
suitable to meet their needs and those of the department and the 
clients.  Employees want profound change in the human resources 
management system, yet they want principles such as fairness and 
equity protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Managers faced with the prospect of ever increasing workloads 
want the flexibility of a human resources system that recognizes 
the nature of the work that must be done and that permits 
innovative ways to provide tax, customs and trade administration 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To its credit, the Public Service of Canada has taken several 
initiatives to reform itself and to provide better services to 
Canadians, but none of the alternative service delivery models 
developed to date can meet the unique requirements of Revenue 
Canada, its clients and its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The departmental agency status, as set out in Bill C-43, will 
permit a human resources framework that can be customized 
precisely for Revenue Canada's employees and clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the announcement in the Speech from the Throne of February 
1996 to create a tax, customs and trade administration agency, 
the department has been meeting regularly with its employees to 
develop a human resources vision for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six working groups were established during 1997 to look at the 
key aspects of human resources management.  Approximately 7,000 
Revenue Canada employees, including managers and union members, 
were contacted directly for their suggestions, ideas and 
consideration. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important findings were the need for human resources 
management based on values and principles rather than complex 
rules and processes, the importance of simplicity and flexibility 
in all aspects of human resources management, and the requirement 
to value employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concurrent with these consultations, the legislative framework 
was developed for the new agency taking into account what the 
working groups said.  As it presently stands, the Treasury Board 
of Canada and the Public Service Commission have different 
responsibilities for various human resources matters in Revenue 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 will establish an agency that would be a separate 
employer under the Public Service Staff Relations Act with the 
authority to bargain directly with its union.  The agency would 
have the authority for personnel management matters such as 
classification, training and development, terms and conditions of 
employment, and travel allowances, currently the responsibility 
of the Treasury Board under the Financial Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency would no longer be subject to the Public Service 
Employment Act. Therefore staffing and related matters would be 
subject to policies approved by its own board of management. This 
is an important change since for example recruitment that can now 
take anywhere from three to six months under the government's one 
system fits all approach could be reduced to less than four weeks 
in most cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency would develop its own staffing program in accordance 
with certain stated principles. The Public Service Commission 
would report to the agency on whether its staffing program was 
consistent with these principles which would be set out in the 
summary of the corporate business plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For any new human resources initiative, principles such as 
fairness and equity would always be safeguarded.  For example, 
any new classification system would be designed to ensure gender 
neutrality, and all human resources policies would promote and 
reflect Canada's diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time the exact details of the human resources 
framework for the agency have not been worked out. A document of 
intent signed with the unions in December 1997 established how 
management and the unions would work together with employees to 
establish these details.  Five design teams made up of managers 
and employees and with some union participants have already 
submitted reports on staffing, classification, recourse, training 
and development, and employment equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many possibilities created for employees because of 
the flexibility afforded by departmental agency status.  For 
example, the reduction of the number of occupational groups and 
levels, a possibility under the new departmental agency status, 
would make it easier for employees to move between jobs, thus 
enhancing career mobility while addressing the business needs for 
the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agency control over the staffing process would mean that 
vacancies could be filled quicker and employees would not have to 
wait as long for promotions and transfers. One suggested 
improvement in working conditions would be more extensive use of 
flexible hours or work at home arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of prime concern to most employees is what happens during the 
transition to new departmental agency status. Employees would 
remain public servants during and after the transition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agency employees would still have access to jobs in federal 
government departments. 
The agency would provide similar access to its jobs for persons 
in government departments.  The Public Service Commission would 
have the opportunity to ensure that employees being hired by the 
agency met the requirements of the Public Service Employment Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Collective agreements in force at the time of the start up of 
the agency would be carried over until they are renegotiated. 
Existing unions would continue to represent employees for a 
period of 120 days after which time a new certification process 
would occur under the Public Service Staff Relations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employees would maintain their existing pay and benefit 
entitlements, including pension rights and leave credits.  They 
would be given offers of their same positions with the same 
duties and have 60 days to accept or refuse those offers. An 
employee who refuses the offer would be given the benefits of the 
government's existing workforce adjustment policy for alternative 
service delivery situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeterminate employees would be given a two year employment 
guarantee beginning from their date of transfer to the agency. 
Term employees would continue under the same terms and conditions 
as before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A union-management design team is presently developing 
recommendations for an employment adjustment policy designed 
specifically for the agency. I am very confident that the agency 
will be able to design a policy that will give its employees the 
protection they require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would life be like for employees in the new agency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the expected expansion in programs and services on 
behalf of the provinces and territories, many new types of 
opportunities would be created.  New types of programs and 
services would require new working relationships and new ways of 
performing work, including the expanded use of technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing efforts to respond to client needs and demands would 
spawn a whole new work philosophy based on continuous learning 
and development.  In fact, employees themselves are so convinced 
of this need that they suggest having a performance management 
system that links performance criteria to career development. 
They also proposed that managers under the agency be rated on 
their ability to support learning in the workplace.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on 
Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that a lot of us who are able to speak on the bill 
today feel very privileged. Many others will not be able to speak 
because of the heavy-handed measure by this government of 
bringing in closure.  Why is it that every time a major public 
policy issue is before the House, this government rushes to bring 
in the hammer, to bring in the hook, to bring in the heavy-handed 
measure of closure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time in this chamber has been relatively brief.  I have been 
a member for one and a half years, since the 1997 election. It 
seems to me that the dominant method by which this government 
chooses to operate is the undemocratic approach of bringing in 
closure whenever the debate gets difficult.  Whenever there is a 
need for us to discuss in serious terms, to share ideas, this 
government cuts off debate and denies us that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first pieces of legislation we had to deal with was 
Bill C-2, the changes to the Canada pension plan, a bill of 
serious importance for Canadians.  It was a matter that should 
have been debated at length in the House but it was cut short by 
the heavy-handed measure of closure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with gratitude that I just made it under the wire. The 
clock will strike in another hour and this debate will end. There 
will be no more opportunity for debate in principle on this very 
important piece of legislation. I want to echo the sentiments of 
many in this chamber today and express dismay at this 
heavy-handed approach by the Liberal Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very clear, as many of my colleagues have been, 
about our opposition to Bill C-43.  Our opposition is to a piece 
of legislation that enables this government to convert Revenue 
Canada from a government department into an arm's length, special 
operating agency. In essence, as so many have said in this House, 
it is the privatization of a large component and a major function 
of government.  This proposed agency is probably the largest 
privatization project of this government to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many in this chamber, I have searched in vain for 
substantive reasons for the bill before us today.  We have heard 
time and time again from Liberals in this chamber today and 
previously that this bill is another important initiative on the 
part of the Liberal government to move in the direction of 
efficiency and cost effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I researched and read as much as I could on this whole issue and 
I found very little support for those arguments of efficiency and 
cost effectiveness.  In fact most of the information suggests the 
opposite, that this attempt to remove the operation of taxation 
and tax collection from government to an operating agency one 
step removed from government is in fact a more cumbersome, time 
consuming and costly process than what is presently in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from professionals in the field, from provincial 
governments, from academics, from chartered accountants, from 
businesses and from trade unionists very actively involved in 
this issue. These individuals and organizations have said almost 
with one voice that there appears to be no valid business case 
for an independent agency.  Many have even gone a step further 
and said that the proposed Canadian customs and revenue agency is 
an idea in search of a rationale and one has not been found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is not based on sound public policy, if it is not based on 
the goal we all share of making something better, of making 
changes to improve the situation, then what are the motives of 
this government?  The answer can only be found in this 
government's never ending pursuit of privatization, of downsizing 
the public sector, of diminishing the role of government in areas 
historically and traditionally fundamental to the very notion of 
what government is all about and what government should be there 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My goodness, it seems to me that in the area of tax collection 
we are talking about something that has been seen as the 
prerogative of the state, as an important role of government 
historically and traditionally in this country and around the 
world.  Yet here we have a proposal, an idea looking for a 
rationale, that abandons this important public sector role and 
responsibility.  By stealth this government abandons this role 
and responsibility to the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that the answer must be found in this ideological pursuit 
of privatization, offloading, deregulation, cutbacks and 
outsourcing.  One only has to look at what has happened under 
this government over the last number of years to put it all 
together and come to that conclusion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One only has to look at what this government has done every step 
of the way to dismantle social programs, to privatize important 
public services and to cut back on every area possible in order 
to ensure that the actors in the marketplace are able to operate 
on an unfettered basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a stretch to suggest that the government is very much 
interested in this philosophy that the least government is the 
best government instead of looking at what makes the most sense 
for government to be involved in, when is it important to have 
strong regulatory approach to a policy area, when is it important 
to value the work of our public employees, and when is it 
important to ensure that we maintain within the public domain 
certain functions in order to ensure that all people in this 
country are served to the best of our ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many in Canada have commented on the government's agenda.  I 
quote from a paragraph written by Daniel Drache and Meric 
Gertler: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No area of government policy has been spared.  Across a broad 
front that includes not only trade but regional development, tax 
and fiscal polices, old age pensions, family allowance, labour 
market policy, social income programs, and collective bargaining, 
the government moved persistently and systematically to reshape 
the institutional and legislative character of Canada.  Its 
strategy is to water down Canadian redistributional programs so 
as to make them equivalent to the (American) lowest common 
denominator, and to cut the direct and indirect labour costs to 
business. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not what we are dealing with?  Is that not what is 
really behind it all?  Is that not why so many Canadians are 
concerned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may not be able to convince the government to change that mad 
pursuit of privatization and deregulation but I hope that it 
would at least listen to the words of the employees who are 
impacted by this decision and recognize the kind of hurt and 
worry it is extending to 40,000 employees in this area, in 
particular to the large number of citizens in Winnipeg who are 
affected directly by this decision and whose voice ought to be 
taken into consideration by this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, 
allow me to congratulate my colleague, the hon. member for 
Frontenac—Mégantic, on what I would call an excellent speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see government members, from their seats, lapse into 
vulgarity as they did during my colleague's speech, I think that 
he is on the right track. He is an opposition member, he says 
the right things. We are here to express our views and that of 
our constituents. I wanted to congratulate him on the excellent 
speech he made earlier, in spite of what the member for 
Verdun—Saint-Henri said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My reasons for taking issue with this bill are many. 
I counted six, but I am sure I could find many more. In my ten 
minutes, I would have approximately one minute and a half to 
cover each of the six. I think I will address them globally, to 
say that this bill represents some kind of loss of control by 
the Canadian government and indeed Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this government took office, we have witnessed a major 
increase in the number of agencies and commissions created. As a 
result, when we want to question the minister responsible, in 
our capacity as MPs, we are told “Look, it is at arm's length 
from the government, it is a private corporation now”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nav Canada is a good example. In my riding, we have a control 
tower at the Saint-Jean airport. I cannot even question the 
minister on the future of this tower. His answer would be “As 
the member for Saint-Jean, you know full well that Nav Canada is 
in charge now”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>ADM is in charge of airports. The Canadian Wheat Board looks 
after wheat. Any time we question ministers, they run and hide 
behind the screen of agencies, commissions and the transfer of 
their current responsibilities to semi-private organizations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do the interests of private enterprises lie?  Often with 
their pockets and their shareholders.  Very rarely are their 
interests common ones.  Very rarely are they the interests of 
voters and of the public in general.  Their goal is to make sure 
that shareholders and directors earn as much money as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support capitalism.  There is nothing wrong with the 
government making money, but it has responsibilities.  What I 
cannot stand is watching this government continually handing 
over its responsibilities to private enterprise or to agencies. 
That is my first reason for opposing the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for anti-union measures, rarely has a government pushed so 
hard—probably because it was being pushed by the Reform Party, a 
party of the far right—for anti-union legislation, return to work 
legislation, legislation suspending the right to strike, and I 
could go on.  I have spent 20 years of my life defending 
workers, and I find it outrageous that the first thing this 
government wants to do is to get rid of its public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, it is very close to doing so because, in my 
riding, at least 30% go 40% of those who used to work for 
federal institutions located in the riding of Saint-Jean no 
longer do so. It is the same throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With an anti-union provision, the government is getting rid of 
employees and paving the way for poorer working conditions and 
lower salaries.  What will become of government employees? 
They are being told “Leave, but it is not certain the agency 
will rehire you. Are you a Liberal? This will help when we 
decide whether we can rehire you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know the patronage havens of the Liberal Party. How much 
will the commissioner of the customs and revenue agency earn? 
Earlier, I heard the member for Verdun—Saint-Henri hurl insults at 
my colleague. He is probably interested in getting the job of 
commissioner of the agency after his political career. Quite a 
few are appointed by the governor in council, actually by 
cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the salaries paid to these people are much 
higher than that of a member of parliament. In their career 
plan, many members of the Liberal Party sincerely hope that, 
after their stint in the House of Commons, cabinet will say 
something like “The member for Verdun—Saint-Henri was a good 
member. 
He used to lash out at opposition members because they were 
telling the truth. Therefore, we will appoint him commissioner 
and we will make sure that his salary reflects the fact that he 
is a friend of the party”. The agency will be a patronage haven 
and this is another reason why I oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a problem for Quebec. I represent a Quebec riding. 
The government introduced this bill, even though no province has 
said “we would agree to let the federal government's agency take 
over collecting our revenues”. No province has said that, and 
this is particularly true in the case of Quebec, because we have 
always been proud of the fact that we kept our revenues in the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We even have agreements under which we collect the GST. In this 
regard, Quebec has always followed the same logic, namely that 
if it is going to control its fiscal policies, it must not let 
the federal government decide what to do and then say “I am the 
one collecting the money now. 
If you don't like it, re-establish Revenue Quebec”. That would 
not be an easy task, because everything will have been handed 
over to Big Brother in Ottawa.  This is not in keeping with 
Quebec's history or culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec agrees on the harmonization of tax legislation, but it 
must be the sole collector.  That is what Quebec wants.  Quebec 
is never going to say “Take our money, collect Quebeckers' taxes 
via the federal agency”.  I say to the House, no one in Quebec 
would agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, to look at small and medium size businesses.  Of those 
surveyed, 40% see no advantage to this agency, and 68% feel that 
it is going to cost more.  Some might react by thinking “This is 
just a jurisdictional problem with Quebec, the other provinces 
and the federal government”.  But that is not what the problem 
is.  It goes further than that. 
Even the private sector does not agree with the government's way 
of doing things.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very significant aspect is the problem of privacy.  When 
one looks at the bills introduced by the government, there is a 
strong tendency to give more and more control to super-agencies, 
which are going to control a lot of information that concerns 
pretty well everyone.  This is what I would call the “Big 
Brother syndrome”.  The federal revenue agency will come along 
and say “Well now, Mr. Bachand, you took out a loan a few years 
back”.  This is monumental interference in the privacy of all 
Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if this agency controlled all of Canada.  They would 
call upon the services of the Department of Justice and the RCMP 
to do a kind of giant information collection, and we would end 
up with unacceptable interference in our private lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Big Brother is watching you”.  With the federal government's 
ultra-centralist tendencies, it is not surprising when bills like 
this one crop up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It runs counter to public opinion.  The public is tired of being 
watched all the time.  People are tired of having to deal with 
super-agencies, where there is nothing but a huge muddle and a 
total lack of sensitivity toward those who have to deal with 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will serve as a sort of cover. People with tax 
problems will have to take them to this huge agency whose 
employees will be working for low salaries and to low standards. 
Job performance will deteriorate.  Employees will adopt 
inflexible policies and the poor taxpayer will once again be 
victimized by the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agency will be a patronage haven, like all the agencies 
created by the federal Liberal government in the last few years. 
There are members in the House who look forward to a long 
career as public servants, people who will earn high salaries 
and wield considerable power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the power of the commissioner of the Canada Customs and 
Revenue Agency. 
He will decide that he is entitled to as big a salary as the 
director general or the president of the Royal Bank, because the 
agency's budget will be much larger, and the value of its shares 
much higher as well.  It will be a patronage haven and the 
delight of our Liberal friends, but it is not in the interests 
of voters and taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore agree with my colleague that the bill should be 
withdrawn.  If it is not, I will vote against it, as I imagine 
all Bloc Quebecois members will do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, one of the things that makes me nervous about speaking 
in support of this bill is that I understand many members of the 
Reform Party are going to support it.  Whenever I see that happen 
I have to take a second look. I have done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the fact that it appears some members opposite, 
perhaps Conservatives and Reformers, see the logic in this bill, 
I would like to correct the record. Very seldom have I heard so 
much misrepresentation by so few to so many on the facts 
surrounding this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue I would like to address is the point made by one 
of the speakers for the NDP on the issue of closure.  The member 
argues that the big bad government is bringing down the hammer. 
The fact is, as members know, this is a vote on second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Shame on the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The member says shame on the Liberals. 
I say shame on the NDP for distorting the facts around this bill 
and for trying to perpetuate a number of myths that are simply 
not based on fact, many of which I will point out hopefully with 
some clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the issue of closure, we have had 12 hours of debate in 
this place.  Members opposite know full well that if they want to 
put amendments to a piece of legislation, the place to do that is 
in committee.  One would almost think that members opposite, 
whether Bloc members who have their own agenda or NDP members who 
would like to see changes to this bill, would prefer that this 
bill be taken out of this place and put into the hands of a 
committee so that they could then put forward their amendments. 
They just might be surprised. 
Perhaps some of those amendments, if they make sense and if they 
are researched properly, which I do not have that much confidence 
in, might survive at the committee process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One fundamental point is that the bill does something that I 
talked about in my former days in the province of Ontario, that 
is sets up one tax collector.  Canadian people do not understand 
why we have so much bureaucracy to collect taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has received tremendous support from across the 
country.  Members, particularly in the NDP but also in the Bloc, 
are stating, as the previous speaker said just moments ago, that 
provinces across Canada in addition to Quebec are not supporting 
the bill.  That is simply not true.  It is very unfortunate that 
a member can stand in this place and say something as false as 
that kind of statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example.  I will admit that the province of 
Quebec does not want the agency to administer its revenue 
programs.  That is not a surprise.  The Bloc Quebecois members 
are in the wrong house, I would respectfully suggest.  They are 
provincial politicians.  They openly admit they are not 
interested in a federation that works from sea to sea to sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should come as no surprise that they would oppose any kind of 
agency that would streamline, reduce costs, reduce overhead and 
make the federation of Canada work better.  That is not in their 
interest.  They want to destroy our federation.  We understand 
where they are coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the minister of revenue in Quebec has a 
strong working relationship with Revenue Canada.  It has admitted 
that it collects the GST.  That shows we are working together. 
That is clearly a federal task.  People from the revenue ministry 
of the province of Quebec have already indicated, to correct the 
statements made, that they may participate on the board of 
management by submitting a list of nominees to help establish the 
process and make it work.  Why do Bloc members not admit that? 
Why do they continue to falsify the record by saying that their 
province is totally opposed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada has not received a single, unequivocal no from 
any other province.  I want to share some quotes.  Revenue Canada 
just concluded a service contract with the province of Nova 
Scotia.  Let us go across this great land and take a look at what 
the provinces are saying.  Mr. Don Downe, minister of finance for 
Nova Scotia, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This contract builds on the current strong, co-operative 
relationship between Nova Scotia and Revenue Canada and provides 
the means for our relationship to evolve under the new agency. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sure does not sound like no to me.  That sounds like 
federal-provincial co-operation.  I will continue.  Mr. Keith 
Colwell, Nova Scotia minister of business and consumer services 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The details of this framework make good business sense— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And I know the NDP does not understand: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and will mean better, more cost effective service, for the 
citizens of Nova Scotia. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a responsible statement by a provincial minister taking 
a look at some rejigging of the system and how the federation 
works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several members opposite have said that my province, the 
province of Ontario, opposes this agency.  Let me give them a 
quote from my sometimes good friend Ernie Eves, the Ontario 
minister of finance who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that an agency like the CCRA could be a way to achieve 
Ontario's objectives of a simple, flexible, certain and 
transparent income tax system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that Ernie and Mike and the boys in Ontario are more 
in line philosophically with the Reform Party.  Their common 
sense revolution clearly outlined principles and documentation 
that were extreme to the right and we have seen the impact in 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, here is the treasurer, Mike Harris' number one golfing 
buddy and number one hit man, saying that it could be a flexible, 
certain and transparent income tax system. 
Ernie went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CCRA could also provide a platform for a more flexible 
partnership between Ontario and the federal government. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not say it.  It was Ernie Eves and I agree with him. I 
have another quote as recently as September 22 from my pal Ernie: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CCRA could benefit Ontario taxpayers if it is able to 
administer Ontario taxes (both non-harmonized and harmonized) 
more cheaply and efficiently than the Ontario government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He does not have his head stuck in the sand.  He realizes that 
there is only one taxpayer and that a change like this could 
benefit that taxpayer.  That is what he said, that taxpayers 
could benefit if the CCRA were able to improve services available 
to them.  He has left the door wide open to negotiate with the 
federal government.  He is being responsible in this instance. It 
is not often that I would say that about the provincial Tories, 
but in this instance they realize the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go to New Brunswick.  Those folk over there have been 
saying that every province in the country is against it.  So far 
I have not found one on my journey across Canada. I know members 
opposite hate this because they do not like to hear the truth put 
on the record, the facts in terms of what provincial ministers 
are actually saying.   NDP members would rather fabricate the 
information.  They would rather take their interpretation of the 
bill, cry foul, say that it is awful and that the sky is falling. 
It is just not true.  This is common sense, although I hesitate 
to use that word, being from Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Edmond Blanchard, minister of finance for New 
Brunswick, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reiterate New Brunswick's full support for this 
initiative. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that sound like a maybe?  Does that sound like he has some 
doubts?  It is pretty clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is one the NDP should make a phone call on right now to try 
to find out how this could have possibly happened.  The minister 
of finance for the province of Saskatchewan, the seat of 
socialism, the home of Tommy Douglas, the founding province of 
the CCF and the NDP.  It cannot get any better than this. I quote 
the minister of finance, Eric Cline, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated previously, we are generally supportive of 
the proposed agency since it provides an opportunity to create a 
more effective and efficient organization for all taxpayers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDP members should talk to their own people and find out that 
all provinces support this federal initiative. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to make a short speech on Bill C-43.  I know it will be 
short because we will probably run out of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Someone is happy anyway.  I will address a 
couple of points.  According to the government, the Canada 
customs and review agency is being established to increase 
efficiency in the collection of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure I have ever heard that from any of my 
constituents.  No one has ever written, faxed or phoned me to say 
“I want a better tax system.  I want the government to be more 
efficient in relieving me of my money”.  I have not had a single 
person tell me that would be his or her highest priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have had people tell me of some other priorities 
related to efficiency.  Because of lack of time I will not be 
able to talk about all of them.  One priority that comes 
immediately to mind is the income tax system.  It is complicated 
and long.  Most Canadians have to hire someone in order to file 
their taxes.  It is too complicated even for a person with a 
grade 12 education.  That is not acceptable. 
Surely we can come up with a system of tax collection that is 
straightforward and not convoluted but one which people can 
understand and participate in.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then have that much hated GST, the GST that the government 
was to eliminate if it were elected.  Members may recall—and I 
certainly do, having run in the 1993 election—that the cry on 
the hustings was “Elect the Liberals, get rid of these scoundrel 
Tories and we will eliminate the GST.  It will be gone, poof”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened in most provinces is that it is now harmonized 
in the interest of a more efficient system, so we are told, but 
the fact of the matter is that many people in eastern Canada in 
the so-called harmonized provinces are distressed because their 
total tax bill has gone up, up, up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think not only of the fact that we still have the GST, but if 
we want to make the tax system more efficient one of the places 
to look at is the GST.  I have other words that are sometimes 
used for it.  GST can be an acronym for more than just the goods 
and services tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to people who think that it is absolutely insane 
for money to be going in circles, in a vortex, sucking us all 
down.  The government collects the money and then instead of 
spending it on operating the government and government programs, 
it creates a huge bureaucracy with an army of people whose job it 
is to send the money back that has been collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am absolutely amazed that the Government of Canada, with all 
its experts, cannot come up with a tax that is a little better 
and a little more fair than simply saying it will collect money 
from us and then send it back.  Thousands and thousands of 
individuals and businesses get back all the GST they pay.  There 
are some individuals who get a refund of GST which exceeds the 
GST they pay.  It has become a way of giving money to people who 
do not have a great deal of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not opposed to helping people who are poor, but it is 
ludicrous to force them to file an income tax return, which they 
have to hire someone to do, in order to get money from the 
government to which they should be entitled in any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to a number of small business people.  Most of 
them nowadays have access to computers and other things that help 
them become more efficient in doing their arithmetic for tax and 
bookkeeping purposes.  I have also talked to a farmer not too 
long ago who said that during the summer he was so busy farming 
that he just did not have time to put together his books and file 
his GST rebate every three months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes to town to buy a part that costs $10 plus the GST of 70 
cents.  He takes this piece of paper which is worth 70 cents and 
puts it into a box because he does not have time to do it until 
the whole summer operation is over and harvest is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then gets out the box and starts adding up all the little GST 
payments to apply for his credit.  He says he cannot afford not 
to do it because if he does not apply for his GST rebate he will 
end up giving the government $5,000 to $6,000 to which it is not 
entitled and which he really needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that his time spent in doing that book work is worth 
about $2 an hour and he would rather be spending his time 
becoming more efficient in his farming operation.  He would 
rather use that time to do things that helped him to produce a 
better crop and maybe spend time with his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely crazy to say that the only way we can improve 
efficiency is to come up with a customs and revenue agency. I do 
not know whether the government is sucking or blowing.  It 
certainly does not know whether it is coming or going.  It is 
privatizing parts of the military and the airports and now it 
wants to privatize the tax collection agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding a private agency has been preparing coin blanks 
successfully and without ever missing a contract for 30 years. 
The government is saying it is needed there and is building this 
new coin plating plant in Winnipeg under government auspices.  On 
the one hand it is privatizing and on the other hand it is 
putting private business out of business and taking it over as a 
government agency.  We do not know whether the government is 
coming or going.  I am distressed that this type of thing is the 
best it can come up with to try to make our tax system more 
efficient and more equitable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subject matter of Motion No. 7 was debated in the House on 
May 2, 1996.  It was not selected as a votable item at that time 
and it is unfortunate that Liberals on the committee decided not 
to give members an opportunity to vote for fairness in this 
parliament either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion goes right to the heart of equality.  It asks that 
all job applicants be evaluated solely on the basis of merit, 
which means how well they can do the job, how qualified they are 
to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hearken back to a headline from a recent news release from the 
office of the Minister of Labour which stated the minister 
supports equal opportunity at employment equity council meeting. 
Great, I thought.  This minister sees the need to treat people 
equally. According to the news release the main goal of this 
council is to work with all levels of government in removing 
barriers to employment of members of visible minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is a goal to which we can all subscribe.  Members 
of the Reform Party want to ensure that visible minorities have 
an equal opportunity to compete for jobs.  What we object to are 
the quotas and segregation of visible minorities. Canadians who 
wish to pursue a particular career path should not be face 
barriers of discrimination and those with the ability and 
discipline deserve the rewards of their hard work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Labour is truly concerned about equality he 
will introduce legislation in this House to repeal the 1996 
Employment Equity Act.  While the legislation does not specify 
quotas it establishes a mechanism whereby the inspectors, 
auditors and those administering the law can force companies to 
comply with numerical goals that are nothing more than quotas in 
disguise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know all too well that this government is always looking for 
ways to intrude into the activities of the provinces and the 
private sector.  The Employment Equity Act enables the government 
to cast its net even farther, not only in those industries are 
under federal jurisdiction but in private, public and crown 
corporations. They are forced to comply but now the quota law 
extends to provincially regulated private sector businesses with 
more than 100 employees who undertake contract work for the 
Government of Canada valued at $200,000 or more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To qualify for federal government contracts employers must sign 
a commitment to undertake the following four measures.  First, 
they must conduct a workplace survey to determine its composition 
by race, sex and disability for each type of work in the 
organization.  Second, they must also compare the results of the 
workplace survey with national and local averages based on the 
most recent census data.  Third, if there is a significant 
discrepancy between the workplace representation and national or 
local averages in any of the 12 designated categories, they must 
determine why this discrepancy exists and develop measures to 
correct them. Fourth, they must establish goals and timetables 
for increasing the representation of the designated categories in 
the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just the sort of thing that business and industry do not 
need.  They simply do not need more red tape, more government 
intervention and more expense added to the product they 
ultimately deliver in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting last November auditors representing the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission began conducting proactive audits to determine 
compliance in those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we examine the complex set of goals demanded by the 
government we can see how easily the cost of compliance can 
escalate.  Under the guise of fairness and equality this 
government increased its bureaucracy and added to the regulatory 
burden of the private sector.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we expect these companies to compete in today's fierce 
global marketplace when they are mired in red tape and paperwork? 
If businesses are forced to comply with this sort of thing it 
naturally adds to the cost of their product which consumers will 
pay for in higher product prices, whether it is the Government of 
Canada or whomever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a human resources development committee meeting last year the 
member for Mississauga East said that the additional costs to 
individual employers in her riding for outside consultants and 
accountants amounted to approximately $1,000 per employee. 
Instead of hiring workers to increase productivity, these 
companies are forced to hire consultants and accountants to fill 
out their government forms.  This demonstrates how misguided 
enforced equity really is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some reason the government subscribes to the misguided 
theory that it can solve the problem by regulating.  As a result, 
it ends up with a lot of regulations and no solutions.  The 
firearms registry is a prime example of that.  Instead of dealing 
with the misuse and criminal use of firearms by dealing with 
criminals, it set up an expensive registry to tax law abiding gun 
owners.  Instead of helping visible minorities compete in the job 
market it has imposed a set of complex staffing rules and quotas 
on employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that equity programs do not remove sexual, racial 
or other biases from the workplace.  They institutionalize it. 
Employers should be free to hire the best person for the job 
regardless of their race, sex or disability.  Employees want to 
compete fairly and be recognized for their expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hiring quotas place unnecessary obstacles in the career path of 
Canadian workers.  They tie employer's hands and are another 
contributing factor in the migration of skilled workers to the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been said and written about the brain drain that we are 
suffering at the moment.  At a time when the flow of skilled 
workers to the United States is a national concern, the 
government should remove the equity quota of all employers to 
hire and promote the best qualified people for the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of government is not to set the terms and conditions 
under which private companies hire employees.  A diverse 
workforce is a plus for any business.  The market will dictate 
the diversity of the staff.  Employers will do it on their own 
because they cannot afford to ignore valuable resources.  The 
last thing they need is hassle and government red tape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario policy director of the Canadian Federation of 
Business said it is better not to have a regulatory scheme 
because these things tend to discourage job creation.  It is 
exactly the opposite of what the government has intended it to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is really serious about helping visible 
minorities it should work with employers to create an environment 
that encourages diversity and raises awareness about the special 
needs of the disabled and minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has skilled and competent workers.  Let us remove the 
shackles of excessive government regulation and give them an 
opportunity to compete on a level playing field.  I think it is 
time that common sense prevailed in this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
support the right of all job applicants to be evaluated solely

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is asking a lot from a government that, as late as

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, Vivian G. Albot of Winnipeg, Manitoba, was 
appointed to the position of office manager for the board of 
directors of Canada Post.  Ms. Albot was a contributor to the 
Liberal Party of Canada's campaign fund, I even have the amount 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have other examples, including the appointment of Gérald 
Préfontaine of Ottawa, Ontario, as a member of the board of 
Canada Post.  Janis Cochrane was appointed a director of the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What these people have in common is the fact that they 
contributed to a political party, specifically, the one handing 
out the jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is Cecil Mervin Ozirny of Melville, 
Saskatchewan, who contributed to the Liberals' election fund and 
who was given a position with the National Energy Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the prime requisite for such appointments the fact of having 
contributed something to the Liberal Party election fund or do 
these people really have skills not easily found or at least the 
same level as those of individuals who might apply or contribute 
to the management of the organizations I have just named? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to express my doubts, because I have a newspaper 
article here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the 1993 election campaign that brought the Liberals 
and the current Prime Minister to power, on October 25, 1993, to 
be precise. 
This election also produced the official opposition of which I 
was a member, with its then leader, Lucien Bouchard, who has 
since moved on to another stage. He has proved to the Prime 
Minister that he is a good manager and that he can practice in 
Quebec what he was preaching here, as he has brilliantly 
demonstrated.  What he used to preach here, he put in practice 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their red book, the Liberals vilified the former Prime 
Minister of Canada, Mr. Mulroney, who, just before he left and 
handed power over to the newly elected leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party, appointed 500 people to positions all over 
Canada.  For instance, he appointed the manager of Montreal's 
Ritz-Carlton Hotel to the Senate, along with his wife's 
hairdresser, and he was roundly criticized by the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the red book, the Liberals were very critical of this kind of 
appointment. 
But who was recently appointed to the Canada Post Corporation? 
Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais, who used to sit in this place, who 
unfortunately—for her, of course—was defeated in the Edmunston 
region in New Brunswick.  There have been others.  There was 
Ross Fitzpatrick, a gentleman who had the bright idea of helping 
the Prime Minister to a capital gain of $45,000 by giving him 
shares in his company, which the Prime Minister sold at a profit 
of $45,000.  He was another Liberal appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to name a few members I have known in the House, André 
Ouellet was appointed to the Canada Post Corporation, David 
Berger was made Canada's ambassador to Israel, Ron Irwin was 
appointed to an important post, Canada's ambassador to Ireland, 
I believe.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are thanking the friends of the Liberal Party. When the 
current Prime Minister returned to political life, he needed a 
safe riding. He had to win a seat somewhere to be able to sit in 
this House as the Leader of the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member by the name of Robichaud, a nice fellow from 
Beauséjour, in the maritimes, was kind enough to give up his 
seat so that the Prime Minister could get elected in a safe 
riding. It worked. Mr. Robichaud had to wait a few months for a 
national general election to be called and for Mr. Chrétien to 
win back his traditional riding, Shawinigan, and give him back 
his seat as the member for Beauséjour, which had become vacant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Robichaud was elected in Beauséjour. He sat with us here 
during the 35th Parliament. 
Then came a young Liberal star and the Liberals said “The son of 
the governor general, now that is somebody”. They told him he 
would run in Beauséjour and asked Mr. Robichaud to step aside 
and let Mr. LeBlanc, the governor general's son, run for the 
Liberal Party in Beauséjour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, it does not always work and, this time, it did 
not, but Mr. Robichaud was not blamed for the Liberal loss in 
Beauséjour. Mr. Robichaud, for whom a seat had been set aside in 
the Senate, soon replaced a good friend of the party who had 
been appointed to the Senate barely 14 months short of the 
compulsory retirement age in the Senate. He was obviously 
appointed to keep the seat warm until Mr. Robichaud was ready to 
make the move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sad to say, the good turns Mr. Robichaud did the Prime Minister 
were not done out of generosity. 
He did them because he knew that the payoff would be 
substantial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no big deal if, in order to get some job, one must be a 
member of the Liberal Party and give $200, $250, $300 or $400. 
Many people in my riding would be quite willing to pay $400 to 
get a job in the Senate or with the Canada Post Corporation, or 
to sit on the board of directors of the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think, among others, of my friend Michel St-Laurent, a 
carpenter who does all sorts of jobs for me and someone whom I 
really admire. I am convinced that he too would give $200, $300, 
$400 or $500 for such an appointment, but he never had that 
chance. He was never informed of any vacancies. They do not want 
him because he is not a Liberal, and being a Liberal is the 
first condition, the prerequisite for such an appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Reform Party member, for whom I have a lot of respect, 
tables his bill on what he calls quotas, but what I would rather 
call employment allocation equity, we should also discuss the 
type of jobs given to friends of the party, who get huge 
salaries or fees—whatever you want to call it—and who often do 
no work at all, killing time at taxpayers' expense while, in 
some cases, pocketing millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider the case of the friend of the government who was 
appointed ambassador to the OECD. This gentleman is paid 
$255,000 per year and he is barely 52 or 53 years old. If he 
retires at age 75, he will have had an annual salary of $255,000 
for 23 years. This amounts to quite a bit of money. It pays to 
be a Liberal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I welcome the chance to 
add my voice to this discussion and to demonstrate to the House 
that the motion is unnecessary and unwarranted.  After having 
heard the comments across the aisle I can see why this issue is 
as I stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's employment equity legislation supports hiring based on 
merit.  Employment equity aims to reinforce the merit principle 
by ensuring that members of groups that were underrepresented in 
the past and continue to be underrepresented now have an 
opportunity to compete on a level playing field. 
Its objectives are to open up the workplace and to ensure that 
employment policies and practices are free of any subtle biases.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However a myth has been created that employment equity 
contradicts the merit principle.  Yet one only has to read 
sections 6 and 33(1) of the Employment Equity Act to see that 
this is not the case.  These sections make it very clear that no 
employer can be required under any circumstance to hire or 
promote unqualified individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind my hon. colleagues exactly what the Employment 
Equity Act actually does.  The act requires the implementation of 
employment equity in the public service as well as in the wider 
public sector and federally regulated private sector.  The act 
seeks to remove barriers that restrict the employment of 
qualified individuals in four employment equity designated 
groups:  women, aboriginal people, members of visible minorities 
and persons with disabilities.  Hon. members cannot deny that a 
fair and barrier free workplace means a better working 
environment for all employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act gives substance to the guarantees of equality under 
section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
enshrined in the Constitution of Canada.  It calls for broadening 
the recruitment pool so deserving Canadians from all groups 
receive due consideration for employment.  Utilizing the full 
potential of our diverse workforce is essential to Canada's 
future success and prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the public service these sections also make it 
clear that there is no conflict with the Public Service 
Employment Act which governs selection according to merit.  The 
law also clearly stipulates that employment equity will not cause 
undue hardship for an employer.  It does not force firms to hire 
and promote unqualified people or to create new positions in the 
workforce to satisfy some arbitrary numerical goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the member for Wetaskiwin that the government is fully 
committed to merit.  We vigorously support and promote excellence 
in the workplace.  We are also committed to improving conditions 
for members of the four designated groups who have faced 
disadvantage in the labour market.  This is not a myth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is ample evidence to indicate that certain groups have 
been and continue to be disadvantaged in employment for reasons 
that have nothing to do with their ability to do the job.  They 
have faced unfair barriers to employment because of personal 
characteristics totally unrelated to merit.  One of the core 
values of Canadian society is a profound belief in the equality 
of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are proud of Canada's linguistic and multicultural 
diversity.  We actively promote tolerance and acceptance of 
differences.  We have a global reputation as a caring and 
equitable society.  The spirit of employment equity further 
enriches that reputation.  A number of countries are using our 
Employment Equity Act as a template for their legislation.  They 
include Australia, Holland and most recently South Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Striving for fairness and equality for all citizens not only 
enriches our national character but generates significant 
economic advantages.  A highly qualified, highly motivated 
workforce that reflects the richness of our diversity is 
essential if Canada is to remain competitive in the expanding 
global marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers and labour organizations recognize the benefits of 
employment equity.  This was evident in their support of a more 
comprehensive Employment Equity Act when it was considered in 
1995.  They recognize that as unfair barriers to employment are 
eliminated the pool of qualified applicants is expanded. 
This leads to the full utilization of the skills, talents and 
abilities of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly we already support hiring and promotion based on merit 
which is why I am convinced that we need not entertain this 
motion any longer.  Instead, I encourage the member for 
Wetaskiwin to support the millions of Canadians who benefit from 
employment equity.  By doing so, we can all contribute to a 
better future and a better Canada for all of us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member 
for Wetaskiwin moved that in the opinion of this House the 
government should support the rights of all job applicants to be 
evaluated solely on the basis of merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we lived in a perfect world, there would most likely be 
unanimous support for the motion but unfortunately we do not. If 
all persons regardless of their sex, ethnic origins or 
disabilities were treated equally, there would not be a need for 
employment equity programs.  But unfortunately we do not live in 
a perfect world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The realities faced by women, visible minorities, natives and 
the disabled are not the same as those faced by able-bodied white 
males. I speak from firsthand experience as I have a daughter who 
was born with cerebral palsy.  I know firsthand the reactions 
some people have toward those of us in society who might not be 
or seem not to be as able-bodied as others. The discrimination 
these people face is real.  It still occurs today.  It is not a 
thing of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the current response of the Liberal government with 
regard to the issue of pay equity for women in the federal civil 
service.  Even though the human rights commission has ordered the 
Liberal government to pay the salaries it owes to these women, 
the government has refused to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people say that employment equity is to solve problems of 
the past, they are wrong.  Discrimination is still very much a 
reality in the workplace and in the hiring process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party says that employment equity is itself a form of 
discrimination, that it prevents able-bodied white males from 
getting jobs, that there are barriers.  When the Reform Party 
says this, it is turning the issue of employment equity on its 
head. Employment equity does not prevent white males from getting 
jobs.  What it does is it creates a level playing field so that 
everyone who applies for a job is considered equally and on the 
basis of merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Employment Equity Act instituted by the Conservative 
government in 1986 is designed to ensure that women, natives, the 
handicapped and members of visible minorities are evaluated on 
the basis of merit when they apply for a job in federally 
regulated institutions or in crown corporations.  In other words, 
the act is designed to eliminate the discriminatory barriers to 
employment that these four groups face.  It ensures that 
employers focus on an objective assessment of the applicant's 
knowledge, skills, experience and personality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party fails to see how such an act can be 
discriminatory.  In fact this act represents an important step 
toward making merit in the true sense of the word the basic tool 
in evaluating job applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party says to let the competitive forces of the 
workplace take over and discrimination will be eliminated.  It 
should be pointed out that for hundreds of years market forces 
did regulate the hiring process and it is because of the 
inappropriate way in which the market regulated itself that the 
Employment Equity Act became a necessity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not and cannot return to the ways of the past, at 
least not until discrimination itself is a thing of the past. 
That is why the Progressive Conservative Party cannot support 
this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to say off the top that I am at 
a loss to understand why we are even having this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government fully agrees with the member for Wetaskiwin that 
Canadians should be hired on the basis of merit.  It is precisely 
because we believe profoundly that all qualified individuals 
should be given an equal chance to gain employment that we 
supported amendments to the Employment Equity Act in 1995, 
amendments I might add that enjoy widespread public support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment equity simply means that everyone is treated fairly, 
not preferentially.  It means that all qualified job candidates 
regardless of gender, race or physical and intellectual capacity 
will be given equal consideration for recruitment and will be 
retained and promoted on the basis of merit.  Employment equity 
ensures that all individuals are given a fair chance to prove 
their merit and are not penalized because of their physical 
appearance or gender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, women, aboriginal people, members of visible 
minorities and persons with disabilities do not always receive a 
fair shake when applying for a job.  Excluding qualified people 
from employment opportunities results in enormous economic waste 
and social disintegration.  Employment equity is about human 
decency, fairness and equality, the cornerstones of a true 
democracy. Equality regardless of race, gender, disability, 
creed, marital status or family conditions is a right which is 
guaranteed by the constitution of this great county. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic arguments for employment equity are equally 
compelling.  The many private sector employers who appeared as 
witnesses before the parliamentary committee that reviewed Bill 
C-64 said repeatedly that promoting employment equity gives them 
a competitive advantage.  These employers said that effective 
employment equity policies and programs help them attract and 
retain employees from all backgrounds.  This in turn facilitates 
their entry into more diverse domestic and international markets. 
Far from being a burden to business, employment equity enlarges 
the pool of qualified workers from which businesses can draw 
while increasing their access to new markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improving the lives and opportunities of Canadians also enhances 
this country's economic performance.  Employment equity removes 
barriers to full participation in Canadian society, barriers that 
have been insurmountable for far too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the member for Wetaskiwin that the act clearly 
stipulates that no employer can be required under any 
circumstances to hire or promote unqualified individuals, nor are 
employers required to create new positions in order to satisfy 
some arbitrary equity targets.  What the act does do is it 
vigorously supports and promotes excellence in the workplace by 
ensuring that all Canadians have an equal opportunity to make a 
contribution to our economy and society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This progressive approach helps Canada keep pace with changing 
times, changing demographics and a changing economy.  It enables 
us to ensure both the spirit and practice of legal and social 
equality. Other countries have recognized the benefits of 
employment equity and have used our act as a model.  We should be 
proud of our leadership in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion would have us turn back the clock, no doubt about 
it.  The motion would have us return to a time when there was 
little guarantee of respect for diversity in the workforce. If 
adopted, there is a very real danger this motion could result in 
an increase of the very inequities and unfairness which the 
Employment Equity Act seeks to eliminate.  It would create an 
unacceptable working standard for millions of Canadians.  It 
would condone racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination 
which we know already exist in the workplace.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly unacceptable to Canadians, particularly to the 
millions of Canadian women, persons with disabilities, members of 
visible minorities and aboriginal peoples who make up more than 
half of this country's population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment equity is necessary to make equality of opportunity a 
reality, not just an ideal, for all Canadians. The member for 
Wetaskiwin I hope would agree that equality of opportunity is a 
basic human right, yet we are still a long way from achieving 
that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, Canada cannot afford the attitude 
embodied in this motion.  It must not stand in the way of 
progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that we as representatives of the people of 
Canada have both a legal and a moral obligation to uphold the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the cornerstone of the 
constitution of this country. To deny the need for employment 
equity seriously compromises our ability to carry out this duty. 
I must therefore urge the member for Wetaskiwin to withdraw his 
motion.  I encourage him instead to support the values of 
fairness and equality embodied in employment equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strengthened Employment Equity Act has now been in effect 
for almost two years.  We are once again among those nations that 
lead the world in moving toward an egalitarian society not only 
on paper but in practice.

continue to pursue and achieve major milestones in the pursuit of 
fairness and equality for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, first may I take a few moments to thank my hon. 
colleagues and the Speaker for allowing me the wonderful 
opportunity to bring the latest addition to my family into the 
House this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with some disappointment I rise to debate this motion 
today.  It is clear from the mover's comments that he intends his 
motion to be an attack on employment equity.  Unfortunately, the 
wording of his motion seems designed to obscure this fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If his intent is to oppose employment equity, it is a shame he 
did not have the courage of his convictions and spell that out in 
his motion.  Instead he has given us a platitude which is open to 
a host of interpretations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can disagree with the motherhood statement in his motion. 
Of course hiring should be based on merit.  Where we start to 
disagree is in how we ensure people are hired based on their 
merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment equity was introduced because it was clear many 
people were not having a chance to be assessed on the basis of 
merit.  The degree to which women, aboriginal persons, persons 
with disabilities, and members of visible minority groups are 
under-represented in many areas of the workforce makes it obvious 
that the problem is more than just a lack of qualified 
candidates. What makes this even clearer is that in sectors where 
the groups designated under employment equity are well 
represented, they were often concentrated in lower paid 
occupations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment equity legislation focuses on removing barriers 
that may prevent people from the designated groups from finding 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are targets, these are to be met by ensuring the 
hiring procedures and workplaces are free of discrimination. The 
legislation does not set out hiring quotas. There is also nothing 
in the legislation requiring employers to hire unqualified 
candidates.  In fact, the reverse is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 6 of the legislation states specifically that private 
sector employers are not required to hire or promote unqualified 
persons.  It also states that in the public sector there is no 
requirement to hire or promote persons without basing the hiring 
or promotion on selection according to merit in cases where the 
Public Service Employment Act requires that hiring or promotion 
be based on selection according to merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to my hon. colleague, we can rely on the marketplace 
to solve the problem of the under-representation of women, members 
of visible minority groups, persons with disabilities and 
aboriginal Canadians.  Unfortunately this has not proven to be 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is right when he says that there are many economic 
advantages to employers in having a workforce which reflects the 
community as a whole. 
What he ignores are the barriers that exist for people from 
under-represented groups when looking for work.  It is these 
barriers employment equity seeks to eliminate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The barriers members of designated groups face range from racist 
or sexist behaviour in the workplace to hiring practices which 
exclude many people from even having a chance to be considered 
for jobs. Eliminating these barriers is crucial to ensuring we 
have hiring based on merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also not be forgotten that we all benefit from some of 
the changes required by employment equity.  One of the complaints 
I hear from people in my riding who are looking for work is that 
they have difficulty even hearing about vacant jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many young white males, the group the mover claims to be 
worried about, this is a particularly serious problem.  Finding 
out about a large number of jobs depends on networking.  In other 
words, who you know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people just starting out are ready to work.  They have the 
ability to work.  However, they are not getting that opportunity 
for some of the same reasons members of groups designated under 
employment equity legislation are being excluded.  Even getting 
information about job openings can require an extensive network 
of contacts, something most people who are just starting out do 
not have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more disturbing is any attempt to link the high level of 
unemployment among young males to employment equity.  Across 
Canada 1.4 million people are unemployed.  We have this level of 
unemployment because the federal government has chosen to deal 
with the deficit by cutting and slashing instead of trying to get 
people back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are genuinely concerned about the plight of unemployed 
young people we should be supporting measures such as 
reinvestment in health care, a cut in the GST or work experience 
programs which will put young people back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to touch on an aspect of the employment 
equity debate which the government would rather we forget.  A key 
part of employment equity is the assumption that there should be 
equal pay for work of equal value:  pay equity.  During the 1993 
election campaign members of the Liberal Party agreed with it. 
They promised public employees they would receive a fair 
settlement.  Five years later public employees are still waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First the federal government forced employees to go through the 
Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to get justice.  When the 
employees were successful at the tribunal the federal government 
appealed the decision.  There is an old saying “justice delayed 
is justice denied”.  The way the Liberal government has broken 
its word on pay equity has left many questioning its commitment 
to promoting fairness in the workplace. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to voice my support for my colleague's motion which 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should support 
the right of all job applicants to be evaluated solely on the 
basis of merit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, although I firmly believe in the substance of Motion 
M-7, I want to make it very clear that this in no way means I am 
not aware that prejudice and discrimination exists in Canadian 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Merit and ability should be the only things that matter in the 
workplace.  However, there are times when one is not evaluated 
solely on the basis of these attributes.  Women, ethnic 
minorities, aboriginal people and the disabled are examples of 
groups that continue to face hurdles which are put in place by 
ignorance and lack of understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one is faced with discrimination, one must have access to 
the processes which allow for redress.  These processes are the 
human rights commission and the courts of law.  We must ensure 
that people have easy and affordable access to the instruments 
that can correct injustices like discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, having said this we must also recognize that Canada is 
renowned throughout the world for its tolerance and compassion. 
We should recognize that although we are not yet a society 
completely free of prejudice, we have made tremendous strides 
over the last 40 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to Canada because I wished to be judged as an individual, 
not as a mere representative of some ethnic group.  Twenty years 
later I have the honour to sit in the House of Commons, having 
been elected by men and women of all races, religions and creeds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the type of country we live in, a land which offers 
opportunity and promise to all those who show determination and 
hard work.  Every member of this House will know that and agree 
that every individual should be equal before and under the law. 
Every individual has the right to equal protection and equal 
benefit of the law without discrimination based on such 
attributes as race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, 
sex, age or mental or physical disability.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If this last statement sounds familiar to some it is because I 
was loosely quoting from the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should all be given the same opportunity to succeed.  The 
role of the government is to ensure that no one is barred from 
employment for factors which have nothing to do with their 
ability.  The role of the government is not to set numerical 
goals commonly referred to as quotas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to comment briefly on some of my past experiences. 
Regardless of where I have lived, I have spent my entire life as 
a visible minority, first in Tanzania and then in Canada.  I have 
faced discrimination in both of these countries on numerous 
occasions.  In Tanzania I was denied employment on numerous 
occasions because of the colour of my skin.  I could have given 
up.  I could have thrown in the towel.  Rather than doing that I 
chose to fight these injustices and I am proud to say that on 
numerous occasions I overcame these arbitrary barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had similar experiences during the 1970s when I came to 
Canada.  On several occasions I was denied employment in this 
country because of my race.  This was happening at a time when I 
faced the added difficulty of raising a young family. 
Nevertheless, I persevered and fought on and today I find myself 
in Canada's House of Commons, having been elected, as I said, by 
men and women of all backgrounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that discrimination is also not always based on 
colour or race.  I have faced discrimination within my own 
community, within other cultural communities and within the 
business sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all of this experience one would think that I would be a 
very strong supporter of affirmative action programs.  But I am 
not.  Why?  Because of the very fact that I hate discrimination. 
I hate it whenever anyone's dignity is robbed.  Everyone should 
have equal rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore ask this question:  Is affirmative action not 
reverse discrimination?  I would venture to say yes.  Somebody 
will lose based on factors which have nothing to do with their 
merit or ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My experiences have also taught me that affirmative action 
programs do little to address the systematic discrimination which 
exists within our society.  As well, affirmative action programs 
do not take into account that people may gravitate toward certain 
professions.  So it is quite possible that there could be a 
higher proportion of individuals from a particular group in a 
certain profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this necessarily a bad thing?  I would venture to say no 
because this is their choice.  If the required target is 
unattainable due to lack of interest on the part of the targeted 
group, then what?  Would we force it?  Would this not create an 
artificial correction with disastrous consequences?  Affirmative 
action programs fail to take these factors into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the quota systems are not the answer, then how do we address 
the issue of discrimination in society?  In my view, we address 
it through education coupled with common sense legislation that 
ensures that Canadians are treated fairly and equitably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through education, companies and employers must be made aware of 
the consequences of discrimination in the workplace.  It should 
be done through education, not affirmative action.  Education 
must sensitize employers to the various groups that could be 
subject to discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As previously mentioned, applicants should also have the right 
and access to a system that will resolve their grievances.  This 
should be the solution, not affirmative action programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hate to be the successful candidate for a job simply 
because of my colour, gender or physical disability.  On the 
other hand, I would be proud to be selected based on my abilities 
and qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a simple statement.  However, it carries with it a 
strong principle, a principle which I believe should be the 
foundation of our society and, henceforth, I give my wholehearted 
support to this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleagues for their participation in this debate.  It 
is funny how sometimes we get support from quarters that we least 
expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I am reading a little more into it than the member from 
the Bloc actually stated, but he did talk about how he was not in 
favour of patronage appointments or anything that was attached to 
political favours making sure that a person got the job.  As a 
matter of fact he even had some examples that he cited for 
<I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have to assume from that—and I hope I am making the 
right assumption—that he would not think an appointment to the 
Senate based on patronage is the right way to go.  As a matter of 
fact he said that, so I would have to assume he would be in 
favour of senatorial elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That reminds me that just a few weeks ago I was speaking in a 
constituency and made a similar statement.  One of the questions 
in the question period afterwards was “The latest senator is a 
very qualified person so if you were to select a senator he is 
probably an excellent applicant”.  I agree with that assessment. 
However it is not the person's qualifications that are in doubt 
in that case.  It is how he got there.  He got there because he 
was part of the old boys club who just happened to have 
qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggested that because he had such good qualifications he 
should have thrown his hat into the senatorial election race that 
was taking place at the time in Alberta anyway and he might have 
got himself elected as a senator and made history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues across the way in the government was saying 
that the imposition of quotas was in no way any sort of a burden 
on the employer and that it did not impose any undue hardships. 
Perhaps he should have a chat with his colleague in the Liberal 
Party from Mississauga East who obviously does not agree with 
that assessment.  She said in one of the HRD committee meetings 
that in her estimation it cost at least $1,000 per employee to 
qualify and to comply with all employment equity conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lest people who have spoken to this are misunderstanding what we 
are trying to get across today, a person should be selected, as 
my colleague from Calgary East has said, on the basis of how well 
trained he or she is to do the job.  If the person is of visible 
minority, a woman, an aboriginal or disabled, it should have 
nothing whatsoever to do with it.  The sole basis should be if 
the person has the qualifications to do a good job for their 
employer so that their employer can produce and compete in the 
global environment.  It should have nothing whatsoever to do with 
imposed quotas by the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that this was not selected as a votable item. 
I would be most interested to see how members of the government 
would have voted on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  There being no 
further members rising for debate and the motion not being 
designated as a votable item, the time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped from the order paper.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to 
have been moved.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I believe it 
was last June that I rose in the House and asked the Minister of 
Human Resources Development to visit the Acadian peninsula to 
see the problems there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise tonight and again ask the minister to visit 
the Acadian peninsula.  Last night I was at a meeting in the 
Restigouche region, and people wanted the Minister of Human 
Resources Development to visit, because they are suffering as a 
result of the changes to employment insurance.  All the cuts are 
making things miserable in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have even had calls from people in the Gaspé, who want to meet 
and discuss the problem that arises wherever there are people 
who fish, who work in the forest or who work in construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know, tonight, we voted on the business of small weeks. 
Some members still do not understand the problem that can create 
in the regions.  I was disappointed to see the Liberals voting 
against. 
I was also disappointed to see the Reformers voting against it, 
because they are always on their feet in the House asking 
questions about employment insurance.  Every day they get up and 
say that the government is taking money from workers and must 
return it to them.  When the Reformers get the opportunity to 
vote for something good, they turn around and vote against it. 
I am disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also disappointed to see how Liberal members voted. The 
government opposite, which set up the pilot project in April of 
last year, knows full well that people with small weeks cannot 
get equitable EI benefits that will put bread on the table for 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are inviting the minister to come and visit us. 
What is he afraid of?  Is he afraid the same thing will happen 
in Thetford Mines, Newfoundland or Vancouver?  Is he afraid of 
that? 
I can organize meetings with people, and he would not have to be 
nervous about coming.  He ought to come and find out right away 
for himself what is going on.  I believe it is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, 40 women employed by fishers lost their employment 
insurance.  All of these work for small family businesses and 
all lost their employment insurance.  They are concerned.  They 
have to get through the winter.  This is not the first time I 
have risen in this House to invite the Minister of Human 
Resources Development to come down to my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development claims that the 
solution is to create employment.  Let him come down to visit 
us, sit around a table with us, and we will try to find some 
solutions.  Until then, people must not be punished.  They must 
not have what they are entitled to taken away from them.  These 
are workers who have contributed to the employment insurance 
fund. 
It is theirs.  There is $20 billion in the employment insurance 
fund.  How can the Minister explain that there are people 
suffering today, that there are people drawing $36 a week in EI 
benefits because of the changes to the system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, that is what the people of Restigouche were asking 
me.  They said “We want the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to come down here so we can talk to him and show him 
how the system is making people suffer”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not unusual for a minister to travel around the country in 
order to fulfil his responsibilities and to talk with people. 
Once again I am asking the minister— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I must interrupt the hon. 
member, for his time is up. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
minister has been travelling across Canada and has been listening 
to all Canadians regarding their views on employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old employment insurance system was 25 years old and needed 
updating.  We had to find a balance between giving workers the 
temporary support they need between jobs and giving the people 
the tools they need to get back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far we think the new program is having some success.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 31,000 jobs have been created in areas of high unemployment 
because of the new transitional jobs fund program.  In New 
Brunswick this initiative has helped to create over 2,300 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the labour market development agreement we are 
transferring $228 million over three years to New Brunswick to 
deliver active employment measures tailored to the needs of the 
people in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, under the new EI system seasonal workers who work 
long hours in the high season get credit for all time on the job. 
The hour system is enabling many seasonal workers, up to 45,000, 
to qualify for benefits for the first time.  It also helps 
seasonal workers to qualify for more weeks of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the tourism worker in Gaspé who works for 15 weeks and puts 
in 45 hours each week.  Under the old system he or she qualified 
for 29 weeks of benefits.  Under the new EI that worker could 
collect the equivalent of 31 weeks of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because EI represents such a fundamental reform of the system we 
are monitoring its performance constantly.  This monitoring 
demonstrates the government's accountability for its decisions to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member advocating a return to the old system of 
dependency on passive income support?  Surely not. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.20 p.m.)
