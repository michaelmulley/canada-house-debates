<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MI'KMAQ EDUCATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (for the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-30, an act 
respecting the powers of the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia in relation 
to education, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to address the House on second reading of Bill C-30, the 
Mi'kmaq education act.  I will be asking hon. members to join me 
in supporting this proposed legislation which provides for the 
transfer of jurisdiction for education from Canada to nine 
Mi'kmaq first nations in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 is neither a lengthy nor a technical bill.  It deals 
with a very specific issue for a distinct group of people.  Yet, 
this is a truly historic piece of legislation that will stand as 
a milestone in the strengthening of aboriginal communities in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this bill so important?  It is for the simple reason that 
it represents the first time in our history that jurisdiction for 
education will be transferred from the federal government back to 
first nations where it belongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one sense Bill C-30 is a step into the past because we are 
returning control of an important community activity to the local 
level, but it is also a step into the future in that it signals 
the beginning of a new relationship between governments and Nova 
Scotia first nations.  We are hopeful it will lead to many more 
undertakings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government unveiled its aboriginal action plan in 
January it made a clear commitment to strengthen aboriginal 
communities by investing in people.  In my view the single most 
important investment we can make in a community is in the 
education of its youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For aboriginal people in particular education is an essential 
instrument for achieving self-sufficiency and solidifying Mi'kmaq 
identity.  By providing the tools children and youth need in 
today's society education can help break aboriginal peoples' 
traditional reliance on governments and social assistance. 
Higher levels of education are critical if aboriginal people are 
to achieve self-government, take full advantage of land claims 
agreements, participate effectively in the new economy and live 
longer and healthier lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, education will open many doors of opportunity that 
have been closed to first nations people for far too long. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the members of this House are in favour of providing 
aboriginal people with quality education. I am sure also that 
some of my distinguished colleagues will agree that decisions 
regarding the education of Mi'kmaq children and youth should not 
be made here, in Ottawa, but in the communities where these 
children live and go to school, communities like Eskasoni, 
Wagmatcook, Whycocomagh and Pictou Landing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to this transfer of jurisdiction over education, the 
Mi'kmaqs of Nova Scotia will be able to preserve their past and 
participate in their future.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 will allow the nine participating first nations to 
determine their children's curriculum. They will be able to 
develop programs and courses in keeping with their own customs, 
traditions and culture, all in their own language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative will have a huge positive effect on the sense of 
identity in Mi'kmaq communities and on students' self-esteem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new concept. It has long been recognized that 
there are tangible long term benefits to transferring education 
management to aboriginal communities. 
That is why, in the past 30 years, it has been a policy of 
successive governments to transfer educational responsibilities 
to the first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 goes well beyond the mere transfer of responsibility 
over the program. This delegation of powers is based on the 
recognition of the inherent right to control education locally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative is fully consistent with this government's 
inherent-right policy and responds to a recommendation of the 
Royal Commission on Aboriginal People to give aboriginal people 
more power over education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While not a self-government agreement per se, Bill C-30 will pave 
the way to self-government for these first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will also help meet the objectives stated in the 
document entitled <I>Gathering Strength: Canada's Aboriginal Action 
Plan</I>, which is the government's recent response to the royal 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of these objectives is for the federal government to work 
with aboriginal people, the provinces and territories, as well 
as other partners, to develop practical, sustainable governance 
arrangements for aboriginal people that are built on legitimacy, 
authority and accountability. The bill is an important step 
toward this objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 provides the necessary legislative framework to 
implement the agreement to transfer the powers and duties 
related to education, which was signed in February 1997 by 
Canada, Nova Scotia and the leaders of the nine Mi'kmaq first 
nations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this proposed legislation the government will delegate 
to the participating first nations the authority to pass laws for 
primary, elementary and secondary education on reserves for band 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 also transfers jurisdiction for post-secondary student 
support funding for members of participating communities living 
on and off reserve.  In accepting this jurisdiction the Mi'kmaq 
agree to provide equivalent education to non-members living on 
reserve.  The level and the quality of education they provide 
must ensure that students can successfully transfer to any other 
education system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to exercise education jurisdiction, each Mi'kmaq first 
nation will establish its own education authority.  These 
authorities will adopt a constitution that clearly outlines their 
responsibilities, accountability and reporting structure, the 
process that will be used to pass laws, and a transparent appeals 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 also provides for the establishment of the Mi'kmaw 
Kina'matnewey, a new corporation that will assist first nations 
in the exercise of their education jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chiefs of the participating first nations will form the 
board of this new corporation, which will provide collective 
services such as curriculum development, culture and language 
initiatives, special education and post-secondary support 
services, and reporting functions.  Like the education 
authorities, this corporation will be governed by a constitution 
that ensures a fair and open accountability regime and dispute 
resolution process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final agreement also provides for the transfer to the nine 
first nations of approximately $24 million per year.  This 
funding will be used to operate and maintain education facilities 
and for related band administration and capital requirements. 
Funding levels will be reviewed after five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This funding will come from the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development's existing education budget.  It is not new 
money, but money that has already been allocated on a per student 
basis to provide education services to these nine Mi'kmaq first 
nations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss today if I did not acknowledge the Government 
of Nova Scotia for its support of this transfer of education 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, education is primarily a provincial 
responsibility and the Government of Nova Scotia has a long and 
effective partnership with first nations in the province.  In 
recognition of the aspirations and capabilities of the Mi'kmaq 
people, the provincial government has acknowledged Mi'kmaq 
jurisdiction for education on reserves.  This will be affirmed 
through separate provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The participation and co-operation of the provincial government 
in this transfer process is indicative of the commitment that 
exists in Canada today to build new partnerships with aboriginal 
people.  It is also further proof that the Canadian federation is 
flexible and can accommodate the interests and expectations of 
all people. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are transferring jurisdiction over education to certain 
Mi'kmaq communities, because they want it, they need it and they 
deserve it. The transfer process began in 1991, when Mi'kmaq 
leaders made representations to the federal government to have 
greater control over education programs in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After several years of discussions and negotiations, we reached 
an agreement that satisfies everyone's needs. In January 1998, 
the nine participating first nations approved a resolution 
asking the federal and provincial governments to pass 
legislation to implement the agreement. 
Today, I am asking members of parliament to take that resolution 
into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure them that Bill C-30 was drafted in close co-operation 
with Mi'kmaq leaders and provincial officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The views of individual band members were also taken into 
consideration, through a vast consultation process held in the 
communities, and a ratification process conducted by the first 
nations. We received letters of support from many non-aboriginal 
groups in Nova Scotia, including colleges and universities, 
school boards and the Diocese of Antigonish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also point out that this legislation is not imposed on 
any first nation. 
The other four Mi'kmaq first nations will be able to benefit 
from the bill at a later date and any of the signatory first 
nations can opt in or out just by having their names added to or 
withdrawn from the Schedule to Bill C-30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the government hopes that this legislative 
measure will be the first of a number of similar agreements with 
first nations throughout the country. In fact, I can tell the 
House that similar negotiations are underway with several first 
nations in Ontario. Bill C-30 and the final agreement it will 
implement could be used as a model for future devolution of 
powers in the area of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 positively recognizes the capability of the first 
nations to take control over their lives and their future. 
It will give control over the Mi'kmaq education system back to 
the native people, at the local level, back to the parents and 
officials who take care of the Mi'kmaq children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is certainly an initiative that members from both sides of 
the House can support and I would ask them to quickly pass this 
bill, so that we can implement the final agreement in spring, in 
time for the 1998-99 school year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to request the unanimous consent of the House to 
divide my time with the hon. member for Calgary East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak 
about Bill C-30, the Mi'kmaq education act.  I want to take a few 
moments to acknowledge my appreciation of those leaders of the 
Mi'kmaq communities who came to my office to discuss Bill C-30 
with my staff and me. They came with the purpose of promoting the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, during the course of our discussions we also delved 
into the more substantial issues of how aboriginal people relate 
to society at large.  While we did not agree on many things 
regarding technical arrangements by which we co-exist, I am 
encouraged by the good will expressed and the willingness to 
build and maintain friendships in the future. 
I look forward to the day when I will be able to travel to the 
Chapel Island Reserve and enjoy their promised hospitality.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Bill C-30 I considered many factors in deciding 
whether to support it.  I concluded that I cannot support it in 
its present form.  Most of the reasons for withholding support at 
this time I also discussed with the members of the Chapel Island 
Reserve who came to my office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the proposed legislation is to implement an 
agreement signed by the government and nine of the 13 Mi'kmaq 
communities in Nova Scotia.  The communities will, under the 
terms of the bill, exercise control over both primary and 
secondary education.  It sets up a corporation to be known as 
Mi'kmawkina'matnewey which will have no share capital.  Twenty 
four million dollars of capital will be injected into the 
corporation for existing department of Indian affairs funding, 
with an additional unspecified amount for start-up costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stated purpose of the corporation is to support delivery of 
educational programs and services under the proposed act.  Its 
members will be the chiefs of the participating communities and 
they together will constitute its board of directors and will be 
responsible for management and conduct of the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As laudable as the stated aims of the bill are, the Reform Party 
cannot support the legislation at this time and I will explain 
the reasons for withholding support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main objection to the bill is the provision which makes the 
chiefs ex-officio members of the Mi'kmawkina'matnewey, the 
governing body.  This key portion of the bill concentrates too 
much power in the hands of one group.  When this point was raised 
during discussions the comment was made that to have an elected 
board is to create one more level of bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are talking about the provision of education anywhere in 
Canada we always assume the existence of a board of education 
charged with the sole responsibility for both management and 
delivery of educational services.  There are times when an 
elected board dedicated to one purpose is in the best interests 
of the people.  Furthermore, it also makes sense for the 
electorate to hold an education board accountable for education 
and to deal with it at the polls on that one issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Political leaders by necessity have a broader outlook and 
responsibility for the overall leadership and management of the 
community as a whole.  The objection was raised, probably 
correctly, that neither governments nor other educational 
authorities would give credence to an elected board.  I would 
submit that after an initial period of adjustment a board of 
education would achieve credibility in its own right, 
particularly if it had the full support of the bands from which 
its membership was drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill is amended as I am suggesting then support for the 
bill could be extended.  There are, however, other concerns with 
the proposed legislation and consequences flowing from it that I 
would like to draw to the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are no doubt aware the Reform Party has a 
longstanding position on equality of all citizens and will find 
it extremely difficult to support legislation which furthers the 
separation of Canadians from one another.  Full participation in 
society by all people including aboriginals is the goal of our 
party.  It is our belief that the best interests of Canada's 
aboriginal people can best be addressed through equality and full 
participation in all matters pertaining to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another matter, while I realize the chiefs have been elected 
to represent their people it does not appear the bill is before 
the House today has the full backing of all members of all the 
communities.  As I previously noted, 4 of the 13 bands in the 
area are not participating in the planned education system.  From 
what I have seen in aboriginal communities so far there is no 
consensus on much of the process of devolving responsibility for 
program management to local communities.  On the point previously 
mentioned, the fact that there is wide disagreement about 
devolution of powers to local band councils and chiefs is also 
important to the debate over the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The press kit which accompanied the bill to my office mentioned 
that the legislation is historic in that it establishes a new 
relationship between aboriginal people and the federal government 
in the area of education.  Undoubtedly the bill, if enacted, will 
be used as a model for other agreements of a similar nature. 
When developing legislation of a historic nature there must be 
widespread discussions by all groups, both those immediately 
affected and those potentially affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of education, as in so many others which affect 
people's relationship with governments and with one another, a 
broad consensus must be obtained.  The general public must be 
involved in the process as well as any group attempting to 
establish a special education system, and this does not appear to 
be the case here.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There appears to be a fair amount of uncertainty about the 
effects of the bill on smaller communities in terms of how they 
would benefit economically from arrangements like those 
envisioned in the proposed legislation.  Concerns such as theirs 
have not yet been heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While withdrawing from society, which is the point of this bill, 
appears to be attractive in some measure, I do not believe its 
long term effects will prove beneficial.  The world is changing, 
and the conditions that led to the reserve system and to the 
separation of native and non-native cultures are long past.  I 
believe both the Mi'kmaq and society at large will be better 
served by refusing to be separated and consequently 
misunderstood. Aboriginal people can and should be full and equal 
participants in Canadian society with all its benefits and 
privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for amendments to Bill C-30 that would make the 
governing body, responsible for administering education on 
reserve, more responsive to the band members' direction. 
Acceptance of this key amendment will improve this legislation 
immensely and I request serious consideration of it by all 
members of this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to speak to Bill C-30 which gives educational 
rights to Mi'kmaq nations.  It is a privilege for me to talk from 
a minority point of view on this bill.  I would very much like to 
support this legislation.  However, as my colleague pointed out, 
we do have some serious reservations.  We would support this 
legislation if our amendments can be incorporated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party's cornerstone policy is equal treatment for all 
Canadians.  We want all who live in Canada to be equal 
participants in the Canadian mosaic.  We recognize that the first 
nations have a very unique culture and unique customs, which we 
encourage them to maintain.  We also want them to be an equal 
part of this Canadian mosaic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about issues like this one, allowing education to 
be run by cultural groups, these questions arise.  What kind of 
education?  How will that education relate to joining in the 
Canadian mosaic?  The bill states quite clearly that this 
educational system should be compatible with other Canadian 
educational systems so that students can transfer from one system 
to another.  However, our concern is that in past experience this 
has not been the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board is set up so that chiefs have the power and they will 
be the board members, but there is the concern of who the chiefs 
are accountable to.  The chiefs are supposed to be accountable to 
the people of the bands but past experience indicates this has 
not been going on.  This raises the concern of how this board 
will be run.  School boards are technically run by parent 
councils, teachers and elected trustees.  Why should that 
principle not apply here?   Why should they not have trustees 
elected by the band members to run the schools? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not see that happening here.  This is a top down approach 
where the chiefs will be the board members and there will be no 
elections. That is our first major concern.  How will the band 
member be part and parcel in directing school policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will be used as a precedent for other aboriginal 
communities so it is right for us to address the important issues 
related to the accountability of these systems.  We would not 
have much problem if there were a board to address the needs of 
the full native community, if the board were elected by the band 
members, the teachers and others in the education field.  Then 
they could provide the best education for these children who 
would go on to become future Canadians of excellence in their 
fields. 
This is possible in providing a framework for native Canadians.

something which is a cornerstone of my party's policy.  Are all 
Canadians and we should be learning to build bridges with each 
other. Canadians should not be separated.  Canadians should not 
be compartmentalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we create schools and compartmentalize people into 
different areas, when will these Canadians interface with other 
people who have come from all over the world to live in this

understand brotherhood?  Where will they understand comradeship? 
Where will they understand being proud Canadians?  Even the 
military would not go to this extent because we need brotherhood. 
We should be together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are creating what to us is a division but we also recognize 
that there are unique requirements of the first nations, their 
culture and their customs.  We understand that and we respect 
them very highly. We feel that can become part and parcel of a 
broader picture of teaching native culture and native customs not 
only to Mi'kmaq but to all Canadians in schools.  In that way we 
can build bridges with each other, we can understand each other.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure this morning to speak to Bill C-30 concerning 
the Mi'kmaq people.  Because this is a technical bill and the 
product of many years of research, I will refer to my notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an associate member representing the Bloc Quebecois on the 
Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development, I wish to comment on Bill C-30 at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us must be passed in order to give effect to an 
agreement signed by the chiefs of the nine Mi'kmaq first nations 
and the governments of Canada and Nova Scotia on February 14, 
1997.  This agreement provides that the federal government, by 
means of federal legislation, will delegate authority for 
education on reserves to Mi'kmaq communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final agreement sets out the nature and scope of the powers 
transferred, including support for primary, elementary, 
secondary and post-secondary students.  The agreement also 
defines the powers, responsibilities, functions and structures 
of the Mi'kmaw-Kina'matnewey, which would be the Mi'kmaq 
organization responsible for education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all the discussions that have taken place between January 
1991, when the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs was 
initially approached about setting up a Mi'kmaq organization 
responsible for education, and February 14, 1997, when the final 
agreement was signed with the Chapel Island first nation, it is 
altogether understandable that we should do our utmost to wrap 
this up quickly.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mi'kmaq have been calling for full authority over education 
during all this time.  Apparently, all the prior stages having 
been completed, the bill before us must be passed in order to 
implement this agreement, which was approved, as I mentioned, by 
all the chiefs of the nine Mi'kmaq first nations and the 
governments of Canada and Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that a tripartite agreement has been worked out between the 
province of Nova Scotia and the federal government, which has 
jurisdiction over first nations education, it seems to me that 
it is time to wrap things up and proceed to the implementation 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been in the works since 1991 in a kind of 
one-step-forward, one step back negotiation process.  The first 
agreement between the federal government and the 13 Mi'kmaq 
chiefs of Nova Scotia dates from 1992.  At that time, the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development agreed to 
transfer educational programs to the first nations.  Agreement 
after agreement followed and finally, on February 14, 1997, a 
final agreement was signed by 9 of the 13 Mi'kmaq communities, 
which stipulated that the first nations would have power over 
education at the primary, elementary and secondary levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the federal government, which is today wondering 
about the impact of such a transfer of powers to the Mi'kmaq 
communities or about the first nations' ability to assume the 
responsibility for educating their members, that there is a 
precedent in this area, the Cree school board which was created 
by the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement.  That agreement 
was signed more than 25 years ago, on November 11, 1975.  If the 
federal government is questioning this situation, perhaps it is 
because of its memories of the negotiations with the Cree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also point out to my colleagues from Nova Scotia that 
they need to be very cautious about one thing.  When the 
agreement with the Cree and the Inuit was negotiated, all points 
appeared to have been clarified, but Quebec ran into an obstacle 
nevertheless.  That obstacle came from the federal government of 
the day. 
It is very certain that, when the famous tripartite agreement 
was signed, the federal government was acting in good faith.  I 
will merely point out that my colleagues from Nova Scotia need 
to be very certain of the government's willingness to fulfil all 
conditions of the contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people perhaps do need to be given power over 
education, but it must be kept in mind that, in 1966, Quebec was 
forced to claim $119 million from the federal government as 
reimbursement of the federal share of the costs of educational 
services put in place by the northern Cree, Inuit and Naskapi 
communities.  Although as we speak, the three parties appear to 
have reached agreement on all points in this matter, there may 
well be a flaw in this agreement, as there often is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Quebec and the New Quebec school board signed this 
agreement with the Cree and the Inuit, everything seemed to be 
clear.  But surprises were still to come, particularly where 
capital assets were concerned. 
In order to remedy this situation, Quebec had to make 
investments, but when it came to foot the bill, Quebec had to 
wait to be reimbursed by the federal government.  Quebec 
therefore had to wait from 1980 to 1996 before getting 
reimbursed for the federal government's share.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time the refund came in 1996, the federal government owed 
Quebec $130 million. We should therefore have assurances that, 
if necessary, the government will pay its share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Nova Scotia should remind the federal government 
that it cannot speak from both sides of its mouth. It cannot, on 
the one hand, boast by saying “Look how nice we are, we have 
decided to allow the aboriginal people in Nova Scotia to take 
control over their children's education” and, on the other hand, 
hinder the development of Nova Scotia and its aboriginal people 
by denying them the large sums owed to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind this House that the agreement signed on February 14, 
1997, has been approved by all stakeholders in the non-aboriginal 
population of Nova Scotia. All these groups, from the Assembly 
of first nations to the Nova Scotia Association of School Boards 
and the diocese, unanimously agree that this agreement, which is 
a historic one for the province, is a step forward and was the 
best way to go. This is an opportunity for the aboriginal people 
in Nova Scotia to demonstrate how autonomous they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an opposition party, the Bloc Quebecois has intervened and 
continues to intervene in favour of aboriginal people. We have 
made statements in the House of Commons and through our 
involvement in federal politics we have been able to build ties 
with the first nations, the Metis and the Inuit. Our party 
advocates an ongoing dialogue with all aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal groups in Quebec's planned society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes it is important that there be focus 
groups like the forum with equal representation from Quebeckers 
and aboriginal people. The Bloc Quebecois recognizes aboriginal 
nations as distinct and, as such, entitled to have their own 
culture, language, customs and traditions as well as the right 
to develop their own identity. They should therefore enjoy 
greater autonomy. The bill before us today is a fine example of 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to reach a consensus through non-violent means, based on 
the principle of peaceful co-existence between aboriginal 
nations, Quebec and Canada, both before and after Quebec 
achieves sovereignty. That is why Quebec asks that the Canadian 
government speed up all discussions and negotiations on 
self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group has written a manifest on the future of relations 
between aboriginals and Quebeckers. We hope that similar 
initiatives will foster a better understanding of our vision of 
a sovereign Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Bloc Quebecois critic on this issue, the hon. 
member for Saint-Jean, and the leader of the Bloc Quebecois have 
initiated discussions with aboriginal groups. A series of 
meetings are underway between the Bloc Quebecois and the leaders 
of the Assembly of first nations, including Phil Fontaine and 
Ghislain Picard, from the Quebec section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, in the bill before us, the government will have to be 
vigilant in transferring legislative and administrative 
responsibilities for education to these nine first nations. 
If this bill allowed the Mi'kmaq to put in place education 
systems and institutions that would preserve and respect the 
values and traditions of their culture, it would still be 
important to ensure that the programs are in line with those 
offered in other Nova Scotia schools so as to facilitate the 
transition from these schools to institutions that are under the 
jurisdiction of that province or any neighbouring province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the agreement says that school results 
obtained under the education standards specified in the final 
agreement must be transferable, without penalty, to any other 
Mi'kmaq or Canadian teaching institution. If this bill applies 
to the preschool, primary and secondary levels, members of the 
first nations who want to pursue their studies should be able to 
do so without having to readjust.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's action plan on aboriginal issues recognizes the 
important role played by education in ensuring a promising 
future to aboriginal communities in general, and to young people 
in particular. If the bill is passed, we will have to ensure 
that these young people—who will have attended elementary and 
secondary schools run by the first nations—are prepared to make 
a smooth transition to post-secondary institutions. I do not have 
to tell you how hard it is nowadays for people to find work if 
they did not get a proper education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill becomes law, the three parties involved, namely the 
federal government, Nova Scotia and the participating first 
nations, will know how to make a success of this initiative. 
While the federal government should not have to hold the hand of 
those who will run the new institutions, it will have to form a 
partnership with aboriginal people, until they are fully able to 
look after their own institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, the federal government is only involved in 
education when it comes to aboriginal communities, since 
education is under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia agrees with transferring to the Mi'kmaq jurisdiction 
over education on the reserves. We must now ensure that the 
federal government takes into consideration the province's 
co-operation and agreement regarding this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultations that led up to the bill took a long time. The 
consultations with Nova Scotia's first nations alone lasted 18 
months. The Mi'kmaw Kina'matnewey did everything necessary to 
distribute the information to all the first nations concerned. 
It not only informed those directly involved, namely aboriginal 
people, but also all the stakeholders in Nova Scotia's education 
system. All agree that this must be done, and nine of the 13 
Mi'kmaq communities, which represent about 8,900 people, are 
prepared to go ahead with the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just used a term we should use with great care. I am referring 
to the word “community”. I wonder about the definition of that 
word in the bill. Does it mean that a band council does not 
represent only one community? Also, in French, do the words 
”collectivité” and “communauté” mean the same thing? There is a 
reference to negotiating with band councils, but the Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal People recommended that agreements be 
negotiated with nations, not band councils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the costs 
that will go along with implementation of this system if the 
bill is accepted.  It is said that, in order for the signatory 
communities to be able to exercise their powers under the final 
agreement, the parties will have to reach agreements providing 
financial resources.  There is talk of $24 million from the 
financial framework already in place within the department.  Is 
this a one-time payment, like a separation payment, or is it a 
recurring amount, to be paid for by all of the taxpayers, year 
in and year out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I hope that the scenario proposed is for there to be a 
single school board for all nine communities, or some sort of 
consolidation of boards if there is not just one, so as to 
minimize expenses and avoid the taxpayers' having to pay for 
unjustified infrastructures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is not the case, allow me to point out that the 
Government of Quebec, in its desire to put public finances on an 
even keel, is doing absolutely everything within its power at 
the present time to reduce education expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The educational field has been hard hit, as have many others, 
and decreasing the number of school boards by combining a number 
of them into one has not always been the best solution.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But rationalization is the new watchword, and school boards have 
bowed to government demands.  In my riding of Manicouagan alone, 
the five school boards have been reduced to three.  The distance 
between cities is enormous in some cases.  The Fermont school 
board, for instance, has been merged with that of Sept-Îles.  The 
only means of transportation between these two cities is by air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers would therefore take it very ill if their tax dollars 
were used to fund small school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also draw the House's attention to the precedent that could be 
set by this new bill.  It would not be surprising, in fact, if 
other first nations were to call for the same powers with 
respect to education. 
Although the Mi'kmaq live within a well-defined and fairly 
limited area, at least in Nova Scotia, the same is not true of 
aboriginals such as the Montagnais, who are scattered throughout 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginals are calling for increasing autonomy and, as I 
mentioned a bit earlier in my speech, the Bloc Quebecois has 
heard the message loud and clear.  To those who have perhaps not 
taken it in yet, I will quote something the late René Lévesque 
said at a historic meeting with aboriginals in 1978. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lévesque said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we do not know each other, we cannot know what, in each 
other's identity, we must respect.  We cannot know what 
aspirations and ideas to respect because they are unknown to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing can be built on ignorance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would mention that the Bloc Quebecois is in favour 
of Bill C-30, which deals with the transfer of jurisdiction over 
education from the federal government to the nine first nations 
in Nova Scotia that signed the February 14 agreement, but would 
remind the House that all aspects of the bill must be examined 
and analysed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my speech, I referred to the fact that the Bloc Quebecois is 
still in favour of autonomy for provinces and aboriginal 
peoples, and especially for Quebec. We feel that education and 
the health system are the purview of Quebec alone.  The federal 
government has pulled out, taking the money with it, and told 
the provinces:  Make it work.  We are keeping the money and 
leaving you to look after the education system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-30, an act respecting 
the powers of the Mi'kmaq in Nova Scotia in relation to 
education.  I am not going to speak too much on the actual 
content of the bill, as former speakers have done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to implement an agreement signed by 
the government and nine of the 13 Mi'kmaq communities in Nova 
Scotia.  It gives these communities control over primary and 
secondary education, at least for those band members and non-band 
members who live on reserve.  It is interesting that it does not 
apply to band members who do not live on reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has been presented by the minister as part of the 
answer to RCAP.  However, the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia have been 
working on this since January 1991.  It is something that has not 
just come up, it has been in the works for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is the first of its kind.  It is interesting that Phil 
Fontaine has referred to this bill as a historic piece of 
legislation.  That concerns me.  If viewed as a historic piece of 
legislation, my guess is that it will be applied in the future to 
other reserves across the country.  Therefore, it should be of 
concern to any member of parliament who has a reserve in his or 
her constituency.  I will speak later on this from that point of 
view.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to again stress that this has not been supported by all 
13 Mi'kmaq reserves in the area.  There are four groups which so 
far have not supported the legislation.  Two of the four are not 
supporting it because they are waiting to see how it all comes 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get too far into my presentation, I would like to ask 
for the unanimous consent of the House to share my time with the 
hon. member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member does not need consent 
to share his time.  He is entitled to divide his time because we 
are now into 20 minute speeches.  His colleague needed it because 
he was on a 40 minute speech.  Therefore, if the hon. member 
indicates he is dividing his time it is divided ipso facto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I appreciate 
the explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation has not been supported by all 13 reserves. 
There are two reserves which do not support it because they want 
to see how it will all come together.  However, there are two 
other reserves that think the federal government should not 
abandon its responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning last November and early December I put together an 
aboriginal task force in my constituency.  From a group of 20 we 
came up with four members who helped me with the process.  The 
purpose of this task force was to hear concerns from aboriginals 
in the constituency and to hear their recommendations with 
respect to dealing with these concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things this task force heard as it listened to 
aboriginal Canadians in the constituency, both status and 
non-status Indians, Metis and anyone else who wanted to make a 
presentation to us, was that there was certainly not unanimous—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today I am honoured to celebrate the official heritage 
designation of Sts. Cyril and Methodius Ukrainian Catholic Church 
in St. Catharines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The church was constructed from 1944 to 1946 to support a 
growing Ukrainian population.  The first Ukrainian settlers had 
come to St. Catharines in the early 1900s.  They came to work on 
the Fourth Welland Canal, in the papermills and the automotive 
industry.  More importantly they came to work the soil for the 
tender fruit, vegetable and wine industry, for it was the warm 
weather and the rich soil of Niagara that reminded them of their 
native land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Canadian of Ukrainian descent I am proud to say that my 
father Michael was one of the church pioneers.  He and many other 
Ukrainian settlers founded this beautiful church, designed in the 
Byzantine revival style by Belgium architect Reverend Philip Ruh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join with the congregation in honouring those who built this 
church and in celebrating its official heritage designation. Sts. 
Cyril and Methodius Ukrainian Catholic Church has always been and 
will continue to be a special place of worship and fellowship in 
St. Catharines.

made tremendous progress since 1948. However as Tiananmen Square

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as Premier Romanow was saying last Friday when he visited Ottawa, 
governments are doing the right thing.  They are showing 
leadership; the federal government most of all by offering 
compensation to those who were injured at a time when governments 
could have prevented it.  The governments of Canada are taking 
that position because it is the right thing to do and the hon.

must be done to compensate all hepatitis C victims.  If the

repeatedly that he has the support of the provinces behind his 
limited compensation package, when the fact and the truth is that 
he does not have that support.  It is being shredded away every 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the health minister has misled the House on this issue of 
provincial support for his package, why does the Prime Minister 
not demand his resignation?  Why should we listen to the repeat 
of these arguments?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

outstanding minister.  He is doing a first class job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Reform Party has brought forward no 
information to say that the provincial governments, as such, have 
left the accord.  They are still there.  They are accepting 
responsibility.  If that was not the case why did they put $300 
million on the table and not leave everything to the federal 
government?  The facts show that this is a shared responsibility 
and the federal government has certainly accepted more than its

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this brilliant Minister of Health has advised us there are four 
volumes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order.  What we have here is one member 
saying this fellow is discredited, the other one is discredited, 
and we are just going back and forth.  I appeal to members to 
address one another as hon. colleagues.  I think that would help 
matters a bit for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this health minister who 
has done so much research into the hepatitis C issue just advised 
us that there were four volumes of the Krever report.  The last 
time we checked there were three volumes. I wonder if he has 
actually read them, because the provinces certainly have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This health minister told his caucus members, implied, to allow 
themselves to be run roughshod over in the vote the other night, 
he would open up this file again. Then he said it is closed.  Now 
the provinces have opened it up again.

<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
now we see what the source of the problem is.  The Reform Party 
has not read the fourth volume of the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that it is a careful and detailed report which 
indeed I have read.  Mr. Justice Krever went through the history 
of this whole matter, examined what happened and when. It was 
very clear that from and after early 1986 those responsible for 
the system should have acted.  They did not.  People were harmed. 
The principle on which we are offering cash payments is not 
because people became sick.  We do not do that in this country. 
We cannot. We are offering cash payments because there was fault. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Actually, 
Mr. Speaker, maybe he missed the fourth volume because that was 
the one with the recommendation that every victim should be 
compensated. That seems to be a section of the report the 
minister seems to be completely unaware of. The province are not 
now.  The same government which has accused the provinces of 
being cheap is the government that cut health transfers by 
billions of dollars, which has offloaded the medicare costs for 
hepatitis C victims on to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How dare this minister and government take shots at the 
provinces which are doing their best to solve this problem. Why 
do they not exercise co-operative federalism instead of attacking 
their provincial partners?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member may not have read all the volumes of the 
Krever report but we have read the Reform platform. That platform 
says that if there is a Reform government it would scrap 
medicare.  It would scrap the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to point the finger on health care, he 
had better point the finger back at his own party and his own

before he lectures anybody else.

money, it's the principle, you know it's the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every Canadian can see it is not a matter of principle or 
precedent.  It is the money.

first of all, there is no question there were tests available

there was enough information that those responsible here in

speculation, it was uncertainty.  January 1986 was the turning

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> In so 
far as the Ministry of the Solicitor General of Canada is 
concerned, the answers are as follows.  Concerning the 
acquisition of a parcel of land for the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police, in Amos, Quebec, in 1991: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) The RCMP began planning to build a detachment in Amos 
around September 1989.  Steps to purchase land were initiated 
after the funds required to purchase land had been approved, 
i.e., on October 22, 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) The RCMP only dealt with Public Works and Governmnent 
Services Canada, PWGSC.  PWGSC dealt with the onwer of the land, 
Clair Foyer Inc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>c</I>) The land was located on 3rd Street West which is located 
just south of the court house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>d</I>) The RCMP commissionned PWGSC to start looking for a 
suitable piece of land in April 1991.  Following this, the 
recommendation to purchase the land was made on December 12, 
1991.  The option to purchase was exercised on January 5, 1993, 
and the purchase contract was signed on or around October 21, 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>e</I>) The surface area of the land was 3969 square metres (63 m x 63 m). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>f</I>) The land was purchased for a sum of $77,201.00.  If we 
take the fee paid to PWGSC into account, the total cost of the land to the 
RCMP was $92,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>g</I>) Building a new detachment in Amos had been discussed since 
1989 and the purchase cost of the land was included in the 
1992-1993 budget.  The purchase of the Amos site was identified 
under Vote 40 in the amount of $50,000 in fiscal years 1992/93 
and 1993/94 of the main estimates.  The actual expenditure was 
$92,000 in fiscal year 1993/94 and was paid out of the 
capital construction program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>h</I>) The project to build a new detachment in Amos was put on 
hold on December 14, 1993, and the construction file was closed on 
September 1, 1994.  Those decisions came as a result of the 
following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>—On September 16, 1993, a message from the commissionner 
announced that the RCMP had to cut its overall budget by some 
$32.7 million during fiscal year 1994/95 and by an additional 
$36.9 million over the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>—On February 18, 1994, a letter was sent from the deputy 
commissioners, criminal operations and corporate management to 
the commanding officers asking them to start reviewing the 
operation of their respective divisions for the purpose of 
streamlining and restructuring their resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>—On March 4, 1994, the commanding officer, “C” Division, 
Assistant Commissioner Mr. Thivierge, announced the creation of a 
divisional streamlining committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The divisional streamlining committee first met on April 13, 1994, 
and it was then decided to set up subcommittees which would be 
each responsible to review some RCMP activities in Quebec.  One 
such subcommittee analysed the organization and restructuring of 
the police function.  On August 18, 1994, this subcommittee 
submitted a report on the project to streamline “C” Division 
RCMP detachments in the Abitibi region.  This report contained 
seven recommendations, which are summarized as follows: to close 
down Amos and Val d'Or detachments and to centralize RCMP 
activities in Rouyn-Noranda; to relocate RCMP personnel from Amos 
and Val d'Or; not to staff the vacant position of NCO in charge 
Amos detachment; to make sure that a 1-800 line be available to 
Amos and Val d'Or residents; to check with PWGSC that extra space 
be available on the first floor of Rouyn-Noranda detachment; to 
sell the land purchased in Amos and to allocate part of the funds 
set aside for the construction project in Amos ($874,000 in 
1995/96) to fit out and renovate Rouyn-Noranda detachment; to 
make sure that the civil authorities and clients departments in 
Amos and Val d'Or be sensitized accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those recommendations were approved by the division executive 
committee as well as by headquarters, Ottawa, with the result that 
the construction project in Amos was cancelled on September 1, 
1994, as mentionned above. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 30, 1994, the commanding officer, “C” Division, and 
the officer commanding Montreal subdivision met the member of 
parliament for Abitibi at the time, Mr. Bernard Deshaies, to 
advise him of the RCMP's intention to amalgamate its detachments 
in the Abitibi.  The latter approved of the initiative.  On 
October 14, 1994, Val d'Or mayor, Mr. Tétrault, was met.  He 
expressed his disapproval but, according to correspondence dated 
November 23, 1994, signed by Chief Superintendant G. Zaccardelli, 
then acting Commanding Officer Mr. Tétrault understood that we had 
to cope with budget restraint and had no choice but to streamline 
our services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 7 and 8, 1995, meetings were also held with the 
mayors and chiefs of police of Amos and Val d'Or.  According to 
correspondence dated February 17, 1995, signed by Insp. P. Droz, 
acting officer commanding, Montreal subdivision, those 
representatives unanimously denounced the choice of 
Rouyn-Noranda.  However, the mayor of Amos expressed his interest 
in an exchange program between the RCMP and Amos police 
department.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Soliciter General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
In so far as the Ministry of the Solicitor General of Canada is 
concerned, the answer is as follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) The Royal Canadian Mounted Police began planning to build a 
detachment in Rouyn-Noranda in 1988-1989.  Steps to purchase 
land were initiated after the funds required to purchase land had 
been approved, i.e. June, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The RCMP dealt with Public works an Government Services, 
PWGSC.  PWGSC dealt with the owner of the land, which in this 
case was the Rouyn-Noranda school board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) The RCMP's initial requirements to PWGSC were for a lot 
between 21,000 to 45,000 square feet.  The surface area of the 
land eventually purchased was 56,822 square feet (294ft x 174ft). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) The land was purchased for a sum of $179,557. If we take 
the fee paid to PWGSC into account, the total cost of the land to 
the RCMP was $205,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) No; a competitive process was held and a follow-up was put in 
place by PWGSC who issued a request for public bids in June 1997. 
In July 1997, 6 bids had been selected and following a 
comparative analysis, a final site was selected in July 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) Building a new detachment in Rouyn-Noranda had been discussed 
since 1988 and the purchase cost of the land was reflected in the 
“C” Division budget in the 1997/98 RCMP capital construction 
program.  It was not reflected in the main estimates because the 
project was being advanced.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
not exactly sure where I was in my speech when the interruption 
took place. I will begin by saying that with regard to this bill 
on education, the Reform Party supports national standards for 
education and apprenticeship across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a broader way, the Reform Party's ultimate goal on aboriginal 
matters is that all aboriginal people be full and equal 
participants in the Canadian citizenship, indistinguishable in 
law and treatment from other Canadians.  I want to clarify that 
just so there is no doubt about what we are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By saying that the aboriginal people should be full and equal 
participants and indistinguishable in law and treatment, we are 
not saying that it means they should be indistinguishable in 
cultural, language, dress or character.  That is not what we are 
saying at all.  I am clarifying this because I have had people 
interpret it that way to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally very much enjoy the culture of aboriginal people. 
Over the last few months I have had ample opportunity to enjoy 
that culture, the character and the formal ceremonial dress of 
the aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to end my presentation by asking the government four 
questions in response to the bill.  I will also make some 
comments on the questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, do the grassroots aboriginals on the reserves that are 
being covered under this legislation support the change that this 
legislation would make? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT26"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT26"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1210
<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know that only nine of the thirteen reserves that are 
covered support the legislation.  We have no idea whether the 
grassroots people themselves on the nine that have supported it 
support this legislation in any way.  It is crucial that this be 
determined before the bill continues. We know Phil Fontaine 
supports the bill.  We know that the chiefs and councils from the 
nine reserves support the bill, but do the grassroots 
aboriginals?  I would like an answer to that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, $24 million will go into this fund to be managed by the 
chiefs and councils.  It has been said that there will be a 
requirement for an independent auditor and some accounting for 
that spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically my question is what level of accounting will be 
required?  In what detail? How will the auditor be chosen?  Will 
the Auditor General of Canada who after all is the final auditor 
on federal spending have the final responsibility to check into 
the spending of this money?  This is critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the aboriginal task force I set up, in the private 
presentations and at the public meetings, and in the 
presentations made to the questionnaire, the issue which came up 
more than any other issue was that of accountability on the part 
of chiefs and councils to the grassroots aboriginals.  That 
question must be answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, if this deal is being made to help status Indians move 
toward self-government, has this government determined in fact 
that is what they want?  It is an important question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the largest of the public meetings I had on this issue, there 
were about 75 people.  About 70 people were aboriginal and I 
would think 40 of them were status Indians. Television cameras 
were there.  I asked how many would support self-government.  Not 
one hand went up.  One woman stood up and said “What do you mean 
by self-government?” I said that that was a very good question. 
That question remains unanswered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly is self-government?  Do grassroots aboriginals 
support it?  Certainly the people we have heard from do not. They 
support no new level of control on the part of their governing 
bodies until the time that they are assured that there will be 
real accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fourth point is a comment.  With regard to the quality of 
education, the task force found, and it was expressed very 
clearly and strongly, that better education is required.  Better 
education is the key to two things.  It is the key to things 
becoming better on the reserves. It is also the key to giving 
those people who choose to leave the reserves a fighting chance 
when they go. This was expressed very clearly. That is why I need 
some assurance that this change will provide a better quality of 
education.  I really do not feel that I have that assurance right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we go through the rest of the process, through the amendments 
to the bill at committee, at report stage and at third reading, I 
ask the government to provide that assurance in a way that really 
means something.  I also ask that the government answer my 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, there are too many unanswered questions.  I 
certainly cannot support the bill as it is now, but I will look 
at what happens over the rest of the process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not wish to address the technical details of this 
bill.  This has been done by other members.  My objections to the 
legislation are more philosophical than technical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I object because the bill in my eyes is a reflection of the 
government's agenda to create a system of benevolent apartheid, 
velvet glove segregation enforced not by truncheons and attack 
dogs but with chequebooks and devious dealings.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister of Canada was the minister of Indian 
affairs some 30 years ago, he knew better than to perpetuate the 
system we have in this country today.  In fact, he issued a white 
paper which would have brought the native people holus bolus into 
Canadian society.  Had he had his way at the time, the majority 
of the problems the native communities are now facing in Canada 
and by extension the rest of us would not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he was not a senior member of the government at that 
time.  He was beaten down by Prime Minister Trudeau.  He was 
beaten down by the Indian chiefs.  Now apparently he no longer 
recognizes the wisdom of his thoughts in those days.  The 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is off and 
running on the same track which this government has followed ever 
since it was elected, which is to maintain segregation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear that when we talk about not segregating the 
native people, we in the Reform Party are not saying that there 
should not be any cultural distinctiveness.  Any group in 
society, if it has a culture to protect and defend, should be 
able to so.  What we object to is administrative distinctiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The southern United States used to refer to facilities, 
primarily education facilities, being separate but equal.  This 
was the line of the Bull Connors type of person or, if we want to 
get someone a little more civilized, George Wallace.  Surely 
these are not the models which we in Canada should follow in 
developing our social policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak for a moment about what I think may be one 
of the impetuses behind the establishment of a natives only 
educational system.  I would like to speak about the much 
maligned residential schools.  One should remember that at the 
time when most natives, particularly in northwestern Canada, 
lived on the land, these were the only available options for an 
academic education for native children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to work with a number of young men who graduated from the 
Fort Providence residential school.  They had formally completed 
what was then referred to as a grade eight education.  I would 
say their general level of sophistication and general knowledge 
was at least equal to that of the average contempory high school 
graduate.  Had it not been for the residential schools, the 
construction of the educational foundation on which to build 
native political power would have been delayed by at least 20 or 
30 years.  Where do members think the leaders came from who were 
able to integrate themselves into the system—I use the word 
integrate advisedly—and effectively they beat the caucasian 
migrants at their own game? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know some of these residential schools were tough.  The one 
that my friends went to was apparently tough.  When they talked 
about it, they did not talk about it in tones that would suggest 
they had been devastated by it.  They spoke about it in a rather 
jocular fashion.  In the days they were there all schools were 
tough.  I attended a school where corporal punishment was the 
norm.  I somehow survived. 
As has been admitted, there were perverts and sadists in the 
system, as there are everywhere in society. There were some 
terrible events. But that does not condemn the entire system 
which by and large was run by dedicated, sensitive people who 
really had the best interests of their students at heart.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, with modern communication and modern 
transportation there is now no need for residential schools.  If 
the Mi'kmaq children were to ride school buses to universally 
accessible community schools there might be some cultural shock 
but certainly much less than would be experienced by native 
people in other parts of Canada.  Segregated schools are 
unfortunately a geographic and demographic necessity in some 
parts of the country but certainly not in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has been watching the events on television lately the 
disputes over logging would certainly have been struck by the 
down home Nova Scotia accents of some of the disputants.  These 
people are for all intents and purposes integrated into general 
society. This government is proposing what I would call a policy 
of dis-integration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people would like to forget the band system in Canada, 
which this new educational policy would help to perpetuate, was 
the model for South Africa's system of homelands.  The designers 
of that system actually studied our reserves at a time when our 
domestic apartheid was not benign, as it is today.  They thought 
this was wonderful and went home and did the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have the apartheid system. We still have the reserves. 
Thank heavens they are now a little more benign, but at what 
cost?  We have created this gigantic bureaucracy both in Ottawa 
and in and about the reserves. We have a class of people known 
outside of the Indian community as the Indian industry which 
comprises not just bureaucrats but the chiefs, the bands, all the 
people in power, the people who have their hands on the money and 
who will retain their power, their influence, their trips, their 
meaningless meetings and their good life as long a we continue to 
boost up the band system.  It is a classic example of this type 
of band boosterism when we give people their very own schools 
apart from the rest of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I cannot in conscience support this type of 
legislation.  It is wrong to divide people.  It is wrong to set 
up a system where we have a money elite with power bestowed by 
the federal government, both economic and social power, who are 
in effect the representatives, whether the people being 
represented like it or not, of the vast majority of rank and file 
natives who have no choice in the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the old colonial system.  This is the way it was done in 
colonial times.  They set up a leadership system that would 
eagerly collaborate with the senior governments.  They gave them 
lots of perks and privileges and through that they were able to 
maintain permanent control, permanent separation, permanent 
economic subjugation of the vast mass of the people allegedly 
being represented.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Bill C-30, an act respecting the powers of the 
Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia in relation to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said by some that the Mi'kmaq should blend in with 
the rest of society and become a part of the rest of the Canadian 
society.  I think interface was a word that was used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History has recorded very well the results of the attempt to 
assimilate and have first nations people blend in through the 
residential school system which robbed them of their culture, 
history, dignity and heritage.  It is time for a change, to face 
the reality of today's situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will be the first of its kind in transferring 
jurisdiction for education to first nations communities.  The 
royal commission on aboriginal peoples argues strongly that 
education in all its dimensions be placed under the control of 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 14, 1997 the chiefs of nine Nova Scotia bands signed 
an agreement concerning jurisdiction for education.  I emphasize 
that the chiefs represent their communities.  Bill C-30 would 
allow for the transfer to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chiefs of Eskasoni, Membertou, Chapel Island, Whycocomagh, 
Wagmatcook, Pictou Landing, Shubenacadie, Annapolis Valley and 
Acadia signed the agreement to transfer jurisdiction for 
education on reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This development is not a new idea.  Mi'kmaq have been 
struggling to preserve and develop their education for a very 
long time.  Marie Battiste, a Mi'kmaq, stated as cultural 
curriculum co-ordinator for the Eskasoni school board in 1992: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Eskasoni we do have language instruction going on in the 
school.  We do provide cultural integration into the curriculum 
and we do a lot of things toward cultural enhancement, enrichment 
and appreciation.  And those have many kinds of positive 
outcomes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the royal commission hearings presenters told the 
commission and wrote in their reports that education must in part 
develop children and youth: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As aboriginal citizens, linguistically and culturally competent 
to assume the responsibilities of their nations.  Youth that 
emerge from school must be grounded in a strong, positive 
aboriginal identity.  Consistent with aboriginal traditions, 
education must develop the whole of the child, intellectually, 
spiritually, emotionally and physically. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I extend my congratulations and those of my caucus colleagues to 
all those involved in the negotiations and discussions that have 
brought us to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final agreement, signed less than three months ago, sets out 
the powers, duties, functions and structures of the Mi'kmaq 
Kina'matnewey, or the Mi'kmaq Education Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement provides for the corporation to have the ability 
to pass laws for primary, elementary and secondary education on 
reserve for band members only.  However, the Mi'kmaq under this 
agreement are obligated to provide equivalent education for 
primary, elementary and secondary education to non-members.  This 
point will need to be discussed in committee because Mi'kmaq must 
provide education to non-band members on the reserve under this 
agreement but there is no capacity to cover Mi'kmaq not on 
reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the highlights of the agreement is that an education 
standard is transferable between the Mi'kmaq nation and any other 
education system in the country.  If we are concerned about 
addressing the interface and the reality of Canadian society, 
this is provided for in the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 will give effect to that final agreement.  It is about 
time.  Since schools have been operated by religious missions for 
over 300 years much of the history of aboriginal formal education 
has been about so-called educating the spirit, culture and being 
out of aboriginal youth.  One description given to the royal 
commission is that it has been tantamount to beating the Indian 
out of the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are some people who would still advocate that today 
by their policies and philosophies under the guise of mixing and 
interfacing, it is important that aboriginal people maintain 
their heritage, their identity and their culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many schools were explicitly used to break down the transmission 
of culture, language, history and spirit from one generation to 
the next.  Mi'kmaq educator Marie Battiste said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cognitive imperialism—is [the attempt to change] a whole way in 
which people see things.  I think it is important at this point 
to tell you a bit about the Mi'kmaq language.  It is a beautiful 
language.  It has many, many ways of expressing things. There are 
more ways to express things in Mi'kmaq than there are in English 
and the language is built around relationships— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The language is the cement and the bonds.  It provides the moral 
communion, if you will, of the community.  And when we begin to 
take that language away from the people, when we tear the people 
away from the very rudiments of that language in terms of the 
relationships of people to each other, the relationship to their 
universe, their relationships to the animals and the plants, we 
take away their interconnectedness and we leave them empty, lost 
and alone.  This is a tremendous loss the people feel— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, thanks to the resolve and creativity of the Mi'kmaq 
leaders, sets to change the course of education in a significant 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the recommendations of the royal commission report calls 
for: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—federal, provincial and territorial governments to collaborate 
with Aboriginal governments, organizations or educational 
authorities, as appropriate, to support the development of 
Aboriginally controlled education systems by introducing, 
adapting or ensuring the flexible application of legislation to 
facilitate self-starting initiatives by Aboriginal nations and 
their communities in the field of education. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a significant first step in that direction.  I know 
my colleague, the hon. member for Bras d'Or, recently spoke with 
Chief Lindsay Marshall from Chapel Island about these issues, as 
did I.  I am sure the member for Bras d'Or is proud that this 
history is being made in her riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just before I conclude my remarks I would like to add a personal 
note with respect to the value of education for all peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father had probably less than grade six formal education and 
my mother had about grade nine formal education, but those two 
people were very well educated, much more educated perhaps than 
people who had gone through university.  They were very wise in 
their years.  They were self-educated and self-taught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was due to circumstances beyond their control that they were 
unable to complete their education in a formal sense.  My 
father's father died when he was quite young and he had to take 
charge of trying to help support his family.  My mother came 
from a larger family and had to, because of economic 
circumstances, take part in trying to help support her family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing that was of great significance to me as a young 
person growing up in that family setting was the importance that 
my mother and father stressed upon education.  I can remember my 
father saying to me “Son, never let any man or any person put 
you down because of the colour of your skin.  Get your education. 
Pursue education, be proud of who you are and what you are, and 
work hard to become educated so you can compete in this world”. 
It is because of those words of encouragement and support that I 
am here today and I am the person I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not an attempt to mix or interface with the rest of 
society.  This was being proud of who you are based upon your own 
personal being, your own values and the mores and the values that 
came as a part of the family in which I grew up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many aboriginal people did not have that opportunity.  They were 
torn away from their families, from their homes and from that 
kind of support. 
They did not have that advice because they were taken away from 
their mothers and fathers who cared for them in the same way as 
my mother and father cared for me.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can recall my mother and father going to school meetings, 
discussing our progress with the teachers of the day and taking 
great pride in our report cards.  Many aboriginal children did 
not have that opportunity because they were torn away from their 
culture.  They did not have the opportunity to discuss their 
progress with their elders and the people within their community 
who meant so much to them and who could have provided the kind of 
support which I received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about moving in the direction of giving aboriginal 
people control over their own affairs, I feel it is time this was 
done.  We know the message that history has given us of 
non-aboriginal people trying to take control of aboriginal 
people's lives.  So many people are afraid to move to something 
different and allow people to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge very strongly that every member of this House give 
serious thought to the principle that is involved in this bill 
and not the technicalities about how much money is going to be 
involved and how the taxpayer is going to be involved.  Those are 
incidentals that can be worked out in a different forum.  It is 
the principle and the heart of the bill which are important.  The 
bill will enable people to take charge of their own lives.  They 
will be able to do the kinds of things they should be able to do. 
They will once again have pride in their heritage.  They will 
have control over their own destiny and their own affairs.  There 
is nothing for people to fear about that concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to all members that we should think seriously about this 
bill and lend it the support it has been given by the aboriginal 
communities and by the province of Nova Scotia, which have signed 
this agreement with the federal government.  We should move 
forward so that every aboriginal person may take their rightful 
place in Canadian society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to compliment the member for St. John's 
East on his presentation.  To me the member is representative of 
the very philosophy which I was trying to espouse in my speech. 
In other words, here is a man who has succeeded.  He was 
encouraged and helped by his family, but he went out and did what 
had to be done within general society and has finally arrived 
here as a member of the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member if he attended a segregated school 
when he was on his way up.  If he did attend such an institution, 
did he think that was a good idea? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would applaud you for 
referring to my riding correctly as Halifax West.  It is not St. 
John's East, as my hon. colleague has indicated.  One of the 
problems in our society is that quite often we do not get things 
straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the question, I would like to comment first upon 
my hon. colleague's remarks about the general society.  Part of 
the problem is that many times we do not recognize that 
aboriginal people are a part of the general society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By that very terminology we are excluding aboriginal people.  We 
are isolating and doing the very thing that he is trying to 
purport he is not doing, which is segregating and separating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people are a part of the general society.  It is just 
that they have not been afforded within that context the 
opportunities that have been afforded to other people.  One of 
those opportunities should be to allow people to have their own 
culture, heritage and form of education.  There is nothing wrong 
with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many systems of education today which are quite 
different.  There is no one common system for Canadian society. 
There are public schools and private schools.  There distance 
education via computers.  There is home schooling.  Are people 
who teach their children at home less a part of the general 
Canadian society than someone who sends their children to the 
public system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would someone who is pursuing education within the confines 
of the Mi'kmaq community be any different from someone who is 
pursuing a home education course? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be careful not to apply our standards to other people 
and feel that because their standards do not apply or conform 
with our standards that they are not a part of the general 
society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so far as my own schooling goes, I grew up in the north end 
of Halifax.  The school I attended had people from various races 
and that in itself does not necessarily support the member's 
contention that I would have done any better or any worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What made me do well, and I emphasized this during my speech, 
was the support I received within the confines of my home 
environment, which can be accomplished by aboriginal people in 
the confines of their home environment within the context of 
self-education controlled by the Mi'kmaq community.  The two do 
not conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fail to see the point the hon. member is getting at.  I feel 
it is very important that this bill be supported and I stand on 
that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Bill C-30, an act respecting the powers of the 
Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia in relation to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 is a historic piece of legislation that will provide 
the Mi'kmaq communities in Nova Scotia with jurisdiction over 
education on reserve.  This will be the first piece of 
legislation transferring jurisdiction over education to first 
nations and it will set a precedent across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is a provincial matter, but the federal government is 
responsible for programs and services for aboriginals living on 
reserve.  As such, the federal government, the provincial 
government and the Mi'kmaq first nations worked together to bring 
about this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give a little history and background to this legislation I 
would like to point out that the process which led to Bill C-30 
began in 1991.  At that time the Mi'kmaq first nations in Nova 
Scotia, namely a group of band chiefs and concerned citizens, 
approached the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development requesting control over education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This led to the signing of a framework agreement in 1992 between 
the federal government and the 13 Mi'kmaq first nations in Nova 
Scotia.  These first nations are:  Acadia, Annapolis Valley, Bear 
River, Chapel Island, Eskasoni, Horton, Membertou, Millbrook, 
Pictou Landing, Shubenacadie, Wagmatcook and Whycocomagh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the signing of the framework agreement meetings were 
held between the federal government and the Nova Scotia chiefs 
and culminated with the signing of a political accord in November 
1994.  This accord began negotiations for the transfer of 
jurisdiction over education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A process of consultation with band councils preceded this event 
and consultations were conducted with the Mi'kmaq people and the 
general public to apprise them of the current state of 
negotiations and the extent of jurisdictional control requested 
by the Mi'kmaq first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point here is that we have had seven years of negotiations 
and discussion on this bill already.  It has been in the public 
eye for seven years.  This is not the first time the public has 
heard of it.  Parliamentarians should not think that all of a 
sudden there is some type of conspiracy going on which will 
threaten education on native reserves across Canada.  This is a 
piece of legislation that has been discussed prior to today, 
which will hopefully be enacted after this discussion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation, known as Mi'kmaq Education, was established to 
help with the anticipated transfer of jurisdiction to the Mi'kmaq 
communities.  Mi'kmaq Education's purpose is to facilitate and 
support the Mi'kmaq communities in the setting of objectives to 
ensure a program and structure is in place to deal with the 
administrative requirements associated with such a transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mi'kmaq Education established by the 13 Mi'kmaq first nations 
hired three Mi'kmaq people to consult with the Mi'kmaq community 
members and the general public.  These consultations were carried 
out in a number of ways, including newsletters and information 
booths, in an effort to reach as many people as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the team met with Nova Scotia first nations schools, 
Nova Scotia universities and the Nova Scotia School Board 
Association.  The team visited each community twice, meeting with 
both the band council and community and business members.  This 
led to the negotiation of an agreement in principle which was 
signed on May 3, 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final process at the community level was conducted through 
the signing of band council resolutions which demonstrated that 
each band council had the support of its community and there was 
support for the chief to sign the final agreement on their 
behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, no referendum was conducted to determine community 
support and the Millbrook first nation later raised this as a 
point of contention. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nine of the Mi'kmaq first nations signed the final agreement on 
February 14, 1997.  The four that did not sign, Afton, Bear 
River, Horton and Millbrook, did not feel they had informed 
consent from their respective communities.  However, clause 12 of 
the legislation allows these bands to join the process at a later 
date if they have the support of the band council to sign the 
agreement.  The governor in council may then add the name of any 
Mi'kmaq first nation in Nova Scotia, thus granting the band 
jurisdiction over education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reverse may also occur.  If the band council authorizes the 
withdrawal of the first nation from the agreement, the governor 
in council may do so.  Both these procedures would be effective 
as of April 1 the following year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the act allows for bands that have 
not signed on to this agreement to come into it.  It also allows 
for bands that have signed on to the agreement and that may later 
see it does not suit their purposes to leave the agreement.  It 
encompasses all Mi'kmaq first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four of the thirteen first nations in Nova Scotia did not sign 
the final agreement for various reasons.  Horton first nation 
consists of a small number of Mi'kmaq, most of whom live off 
reserve.  The advantage of the legislation is therefore minimal 
for this group.  Two of the others, Afton and Bear River, still 
have questions regarding the process and are content to wait and 
see how the legislation progresses and how successful the program 
is.  It is expected that they will join at a later time which the 
process allows for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millbrook was looking for legislation that would establish an 
inherent right process. While Bill C-30 is a step in that 
direction it does not go that far toward self-government since 
this remains a delegated jurisdiction.  Chief Lawrence Paul of 
the Millbrook first nation expressed concerns over the funding 
arrangements supporting this legislation.  Chief Paul felt the 
funding should be guaranteed for a period greater than five years 
agreed on by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty-seven Mi'kmaq first nations currently exist in Canada. 
They are located in four of the Atlantic provinces and in Quebec. 
Thirteen of these bands are in Nova Scotia.  They are situated 
across the province.  They have a long history and a strong 
culture.  There are approximately 9,000 Mi'kmaq in Nova Scotia, 
with 6,200 living on reserve.  There are 2,200 Mi'kmaq students 
in Nova Scotia with this number split evenly between those living 
on and off reserve.  Half the on reserve students go to public 
schools off reserve.  This legislation does not provide the 
Mi'kmaq with greater powers or control over schools that are not 
on reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mi'kmaq culture historically relied heavily on story telling as 
a means of entertainment and communication.  It incorporated 
songs and dances into these stories which were a means of passing 
on Mi'kmaq history.  It is a goal of Mi'kmaq education to 
preserve Mi'kmaq culture and traditions.  Giving control of 
education to Mi'kmaq communities ensures this is possible. The 
goal of Mi'kmaq education is to incorporate traditional languages 
and cultures back into the school system.  This was one of the 
reasons the 13 Mi'kmaq first nations requested the federal 
government to transfer jurisdiction to their Mi'kmaq communities 
in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation covers elementary and secondary jurisdictions 
and the allocation of funding for post-secondary education. Thus 
first nations will have control over what is taught to their 
students but they will have to ensure the education is equal to 
that of other students in Nova Scotia and that it meets 
university entrance requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without this legislation, the Mi'kmaq have no opportunity to 
make laws for education on reserve.  The Indian Act gives the 
federal government this authority.  Bill C-30 repeals sections 
114 to 140 of the act and delegates jurisdiction to the Mi'kmaq. 
This will force the Mi'kmaq to develop structures to properly 
manage education and to make laws in line with standards set out 
in a constitution.  Each community will first have to develop a 
constitution before it makes up its laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation should increase accountability for the Mi'kmaq 
with regard to their education system.  Currently band councils 
are not accountable to members.  Instead they report to the 
federal government. 
Bill C-30 will increase community involvement, and accountability 
will improve through the preparation of financial statements and 
the annual report.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some detractors to this important piece of legislation 
but if we read the legislation thoroughly and carefully, which I 
would encourage all hon. members to do, this is a very precedent 
setting piece of legislation and increases accountability.  It 
does not diffuse accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mi'kmaq communities recognize there will be challenges ahead 
such as the construction of schools on reserves, in particular 
for those bands outside Cape Breton.  Moreover, there are 
challenges of finding Mi'kmaq who can teach students their own 
language and there are challenges of maintaining standards as 
required to meet both school board and university requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most first nations in Nova Scotia seem to be happy with the 
proposed legislation and feel this is a step in the right 
direction not only toward self-government but to improving the 
education their students receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke with a number of bands affected they stated they 
were pleased to be getting control over education.  While they 
expect some hurdles along the way ultimately this is seen as a 
positive move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation also has its critics within the Mi'kmaq 
community but the legislation is designed and written to 
encompass those critics and to give them the opportunity to have 
their say and also to perhaps make changes in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 would be a stepping stone for other first nations 
across Canada to begin taking an active role in educating their 
own people.  Taking an active role would mean that the 53% of 
natives living on reserve under age 25 would have some say in

want and need an education that will prepare them for the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Mississauga East, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-251, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act (cumulative sentences), be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, volume discounts for rapists and 
murderers, that is the law in Canada today.  It is called 
concurrent sentencing.  It means that serial predators can serve 
penalties for multiple crimes at the same time and be out on the 
street in only a fraction of the total sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concurrent sentencing cheapens life.  The lives of individual 
victims are erased from the sentencing equation.  The suffering, 
the pain and the death of the second, third or eleventh victim is 
of no consequence to the courts.  The minimum penalty always 
applies for even the most prolific killers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the third time in two years I am presenting a bill which 
offers parliament the opportunity to correct one of the justice 
system's most jagged obscenities.  My bill, now called Bill 
C-251, asks that Canada stop giving volume discounts to its 
rapists and murderers through concurrent sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this third attempt my bill has finally been deemed votable 
and for that I extend my heartfelt thanks to the 166 members of 
the House from all parties who lent their names in that cause. 
Their support will give all members the opportunity to weigh the 
arguments and determine whether consecutive sentencing will bring 
our justice system a little closer to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current penalties for murder were imposed over 20 years ago. 
Yet I can find no record of any minister or member of Parliament 
for that matter who spoke in the House in favour of concurrent 
sentencing for Canada's most vicious criminals.  As near as I can 
tell, it was never discussed and certainly never available for 
public debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is time for the people's representatives in 
parliament to determine whether serial killers and rapists 
deserve special leniency they are currently afforded under the 
law and by our courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 has as its purpose three simple objectives, to reduce 
our inhumanity to the families of victims, to restore some truth 
in sentencing and to stop gambling away lives on the chance that 
a multiple murderer or serial predator will not attack again.  It 
seeks to achieve these ends not by increasing the penalty for any 
one crime but by ensuring that these penalties have meaning by 
being served consecutively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have concurrent sentencing for parking tickets.  If 
one parks illegally 10 times, one pays 10 tickets.  One does not 
get a volume discount.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill seeks the same proportionality for the most serious and 
vicious crimes committed against Canadians.  I believe very 
simply that justice is about proportional penalties, about relief 
for victims and about protecting the safety of citizens. Clearly, 
concurrent sentencing runs counter to each of these principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the five years that I have been working on this issue, I have 
seen the human consequences of the current legal framework which 
is indifferent to the crimes committed against the second, the 
third or the eleventh victim of a serial predator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to the families of victims and to victims 
themselves, some of whom never had their case prosecuted because 
the crown determined that any additional sentence would only be 
washed away by concurrent sentencing.  Many of these victims have 
mustered the courage and drawn purpose from their personal horror 
by trying to change the system which treated them with such 
callous indifference.  They journey here to Ottawa thinking that 
MPs, that parliament, will listen and spare future victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the summer of 1996, not just one but two multiple murderers 
were free on parole in Mississauga.  Concurrent sentencing had 
given these repeat killers volume discounts for their crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For John Lyman Kehoe, the second child he murdered did not 
affect his sentence so he was free to create yet a third victim. 
On July 2, 1996, Kehoe and another paroled multiple murderer 
ambushed a real estate agent by the name of Wendy Carroll, 
slashed her throat and left her for dead.  She survived, but no 
thanks to the justice system or the parole board which opened the 
cages of her assailants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wendy Carroll's life was nearly erased because our sentencing 
system erases victims.  Had John Kehoe served a second 
consecutive term of parole ineligibility for the second child he 
murdered, he would not have been free to prey on Wendy Carroll or 
anyone else. Wendy Carroll wrote to me, after narrowly surviving 
these predators.  She wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some reason our politicians have decided to grant rights to 
violent criminals who have taken every right away from their 
victims.  What are they thinking?  How many people must endure 
the horrific and extremely painful experience I did in fighting 
criminals like these for my life?  How many more innocent people 
must die before parliament decides to make some changes? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wendy Carroll cannot understand how two predators who had been 
convicted of killing four people between them could have been set 
free to attack again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Albert Einstein once noted that “the world is a dangerous place 
to live in, not because of those who do evil, but because of 
those who let them do it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the cages were flung open by volume discounts 
applied to their sentences which disregarded all but the first 
victim and left two predators eligible for parole in half the 
time.  Of course the National Parole Board proved to be no 
barrier between predator and prey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 does not ask the parole board to be any less 
irresponsible.  It does not increase the penalty for any crime. 
What it asks is that penalties that currently apply to each 
murder or rape conviction be served and not be written off as 
part of a bulk rate for carnage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consecutive sentencing approach proposed by my bill is an 
uncomplicated attempt to restore a degree of truth in sentencing. 
It recognizes that each sentence applies to a specific crime, an 
individual victim, a personal horror.  It insists that the price 
for murder must not be marked down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer I had occasion to witness the obscene spectacle of 
Clifford Olson's 745 hearing.  His remarks reinforced my resolve 
to continue to resubmit this bill until the issue was dealt with 
by this parliament.  Olson read out a letter from his lawyer 
advising him to admit to all his murders at once.  This way, the 
lawyer indicated, Olson could take full advantage of concurrent 
sentencing.  Olson mocked in the court “They can't do nothing. 
They can only give me a concurrent sentence”.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have to answer why Olson and other predators should 
only be given a concurrent sentence, and why our justice system 
should continue to offer a bulk rate for brutality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only persons negatively affected by my bill are future 
serial killers and serial rapists. This is not a bill that 
affects shoplifters, tax evaders, drug dealers, vandals, or petty 
thieves.  Concurrent sentencing will still be available to all 
but our most vicious criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of this House to place their compassion where it 
is deserved.  There is no compassion in inflicting a lifetime of 
parole hearings on a family already destroyed by a serial killer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just two weeks ago I was visited by a father in my own riding 
who begins each and every year by going to a parole hearing to 
prevent the murderer of his 11-year old daughter from getting 
back on the streets.  He owes it to his daughter to keep going 
because he knows that without his intervention the parole board 
would release her killer on to other victims.  This father 
suffers from legislation that is focused on the welfare of 
killers rather than compassion for victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debates over the past two years I have heard no 
compelling arguments being offered by those who support volume 
discounts for serial predators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In <I>Hansard</I> members will find it argued that we have too 
many people in jail and that we have to double bunk a quarter of 
all the inmates.  I am not kidding.  This was raised in this 
place just last year as a reason to give serial killers early 
release. I would hate to tell Wendy Carroll that she was nearly 
killed by two paroled multiple murderers just to increase the 
percentage of single cells.  That sadly is what has been argued 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also argued that we cannot have consecutive life 
sentences.  Canadians are gradually catching on to the deception 
of life imprisonment.  Half of all those convicted of second 
degree murder and sentenced to life are released after less than 
12 years.  Denis Lortie, who machine gunned three people to 
death, was released after serving only 11 years, about three and 
a half years of lost freedom for each person he murdered.  That 
is the bargain basement price of life in our courts and under our 
parole system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sickeningly, Denis Lortie was not an exception.  He was 
representative of the fact that the only meaningful part of his 
sentence is the period of parole ineligibility.  The rest of the 
sentence is just an option, an option our system allows to 
revictimize the parents or the relatives of the victims. It 
potentially forces them to join countless other victims in having 
to dredge up gruesome memories just to provide impact statements 
and petitions to keep the cages closed.  But the quality of mercy 
is not strained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been argued in this House that concurrent sentences 
“counter any need to reduce sentencing dispositions for 
individual offences in order to achieve an overall just result”. 
It is never a just result to reduce a sentence for rape or 
murder just because the victim was not the only victim of the 
predator involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worse yet for the courts to mask the fact that they do 
discount sentences in precisely that way time and time again 
through concurrent sentencing.  There is no more justification 
for disguising a volume discount than there is for giving one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts should not be able to placate victims by hiding the 
ugly truth behind their decisions.  They should have to impose 
consecutive sentences when the crimes are as devastating as 
murder and sexual assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument has also been made in this House to suggest that we 
give volume discounts for rapists and murderers so that we can be 
different from the United States.  I quote “I question whether 
we want to follow the American example of building more 
prisons”.  This is the kind of hyperbole and exaggeration that 
protects an utterly flawed system with respect to Canada's most 
dangerous offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the most efficient use of our prisons is to keep those 
predators who have killed or have sexually assaulted multiple 
victims securely away from future victims. 
If space in prison needs to be found, more creative forms of 
punishment and rehabilitation should be found for non-violent 
offenders guilty of property or commercial offences.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to serial predators, public safety must be our 
first concern.  We know that each convicted serial predator is 
capable of more horrific crimes.  Their actions have identified 
them as a permanent threat to society.  To ignore that threat is 
to negligently endanger innocent lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A corrections research and development study from the Department 
of the Solicitor General showed that released child molesters who 
targeted boys had a 77% recidivism rate.  That means for every 
100 of these child molesters released, at least 77 more children 
are victimized. If a children's toy had that record, it would be 
banned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Parole Board considers its record, its annual 
slaughter to be a success story.  I have heard it argued that the 
National Parole Board is fit to decide what predators should be 
released, but the fact that the average murderer can get full 
parole within two years of eligibility illustrates that our 
parole system has lost its balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Olson hearing proved to everyone who witnessed it that 
absolutely any predator can appear with a corrections worker who 
will attest to his good character and press the parole board for 
release. I was amazed when the corrections worker responsible for 
Clifford Olson testified in court as an Olson witness and talked 
of how he was more concerned with Olson's safety than he was his 
own, and how he relied on Olson to keep him informed on current 
events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Corrections Canada employee was even a member of the prison 
program planning board.  He told the court that Olson was a 
diligent worker who did a good job. Addressing Olson directly, 
the same corrections worker said “Most of our interactions were 
done in an open room sitting side by side at a table.  I never 
saw you as a threat to me.  My main concern was more for your 
safety than for my own”. He went on “I am sure everyone is well 
aware that you are considered a jailhouse lawyer.  They consulted 
you for advice. You gave them advice.  You helped them prepare 
documents and by the peer group, you were well thought of”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corrections worker added later “I always found you very 
interesting to work with as a matter of fact, for several 
reasons.  One is you are well read.  Because I live in a rural 
part of Saskatchewan, I do not have television facilities and you 
had several channels on television.  You kept me informed of what 
was going on”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Clifford Olson can get such an endorsement from Corrections 
Canada, every other murderer must deserve the Lady Byng trophy. 
That experience was a demonstration of the distorted picture 
parole boards must be given on a regular basis.  If Clifford 
Olson can find champions among corrections personnel, so can any 
criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some time ago I watched a television debate where one of the 
commentators suggested that consecutive sentencing for Clifford 
Olson, which would amount to genuine life imprisonment, would 
amount to nothing more than revenge. This sort of hyperbole is 
common in the predator protection industry. Life imprisonment is 
not some form of revenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the families of the Olson victims were to hack him to death 
with a rusty axe, that would be revenge.  Sentencing Olson to 
life in prison where he can educate corrections workers on 
current events is not revenge but very civilized and measured 
justice in response to a series of vicious crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has always been the tactic of those who earn their living 
defending predators to accuse anyone who opposes the early 
release of serial predators of being emotional, vengeful and of 
giving in to their primitive instincts.  They think instead it is 
somehow superior to test their pompous theories by releasing 
known serial predators on to an unsuspecting public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By far, the most distasteful argument I have heard in the 
defence of the status quo also had the most impact.  When I first 
brought this bill to the House, one of its chief opponents told 
me that he could not support my bill because he did not want to 
create a victims industry. 
That is right.  He did not want public policy to result in a 
victim's industry that would continuously challenge established 
legal practices.  In short, he wanted to preserve the silence of 
the lambs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead it is the predator protection industry that is 
supported.  It is that industry that thrives on the endless parole 
process that annually threatens to unleash the chained savagery 
of predators, consuming untold tax dollars while dismembering the 
future of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me summarize the arguments to defend volume discounts for 
rapists and murderers.  They say we need concurrent sentencing 
because we do not want to double bunk predators.  We do not want 
to reveal the fact that the courts are discounting sentences for 
individual crimes.  We want to be different from the United 
States.  We do not want to be emotional.  Most importantly, we do 
not want to create a victim's industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all I have heard in the past two years to defend a 
system that cheapens life, revictimizes the families of the dead 
and recklessly exposes every Canadian to unnecessary risk from 
released predators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking members of this House to reach beyond the grasp of a 
legal system that not only fails victims but fails us all.  I ask 
them to smooth the barbed face of Canadian justice and allow 
victims to find justice in our laws.  I ask them to defy the 
predator protection industry by ending volume discounts for 
rapists and murderers.

thank my colleague from Mississauga East who has just spoken, not 
only for bringing forward this bill for a second time, but for 
the words she has given this House to consider as well as all 
Canadians who are struggling to understand why we have a justice 
system that allows this kind of thing to go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely it is fair and just that we take a look at what our 
courts are doing in terms of sentencing individuals like the 
Clifford Olsons of this country to terms of imprisonment that are 
in fact a bargain price for criminality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise in support of this private member's bill.  This is a good 
bill.  It was a good bill when it was introduced last parliament 
as private member's Bill C-321, a bill that may have been law 
today if our Liberal colleagues had deemed it votable.

backbenchers more weight in this government through added private 
members' bills.  For those members new to this House, in the last

dominated, four-member committee that determines which private 
members' bills will be votable of short-circuiting controversial 
bills.

court.  You can't see them at work and they run.

because she had not attended caucus that week and as a result had 
nothing to say.  Could it be that the issue of consecutive 
sentencing has been at more caucus meetings than she?  Or perhaps 
she simply doesn't read newspapers about serious issues of crime. 
Another cruel remark dealing with sentencing of serial predators 
made by another bright light, Liberal—. chair of the women's 
caucus is equally inane.  Her diatribe that she might support 
consecutive sentencing if [the member from Mississauga East] 
brings the issue to the forefront again, is mindless and absurd 
to say the least.

has to say.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that she made this comment after consulting with [the] 
Justice Minister and the Liberal [member from Mississauga East] 
adds to the obscenity.  With this calibre of consultants, I 
suggest it is time for [the member from Etobicoke—Lakeshore] to 
seek better advisors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about our justice system and those in this House 
who are responsible for amending our laws and bringing forth new 
initiatives I cannot help but be reminded of an article in 
yesterday's newspaper by Jeffrey Simpson.  It is headed “A 
Justice Minister with a Lower Profile than a Groundhog in 
Winter”.  That is not very flattering, but I think it strikes 
very close to the truth.  The reason for that is because our 
justice minister has really done very little, if anything, during 
almost a year of holding one of the strongest portfolios in 
government.  It is certainly one of the two portfolios that 
has the mandate and the responsibility to look into things like 
ending concurrent sentencing and moving toward more just and 
applicable pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to read from an article which appeared on 
November 27, 1996 in a B.C. newspaper regarding the standing 
committee on justice's national forum on youth justice, which 
occurred at the end of the 10 year review of the Young Offenders 
Act.  For the record, I could not support the expenditure of 
$60,000 to host this meeting.  That was what the estimate was.  I 
do not know what the actual cost was, but that is what we were 
asked to support.  I could not do that because I felt we would be 
going over old ground by hearing from a number of witnesses who 
had already appeared before our committee.  My opposition to this 
wasteful use of taxpayers' money caused me to endure a bit of a 
berating from the chair of that committee, which is hard for me 
to forget, although I have forgiven that member for that type of 
an attitude toward me because of the feelings the member 
experienced at the time.  Nevertheless, it did happen.  That 
displays an attitude that is all too prevalent in those who are 
responsible for the direction that our justice system has been 
taking, certainly during the last five years since I have been a 
member of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from that article: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa was a bust for [the member for Surrey North].  [The member 
for Surrey North], whose teenage son Jesse was stabbed to death 
by another teen four years ago, was invited to speak before the 
federal standing committee of justice affairs last weekend in 
Canada's capital city.  But the Guildford dad, who founded the 
victims' rights group Crime, Responsibility and Youth (CRY) after 
his son was murdered, says the trip was a waste of time. “I 
spoke maybe five minutes total,” he said.  “It was a joke. I 
shouldn't have even bothered going.”  The meeting was poorly 
chaired, he charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of 33 participants, [the member for Surrey North] said, only 
himself and a representative of Canadians Against Violence 
Everywhere Advocating its Termination (CAVEAT), another victims' 
rights group, spoke from the victims' perspective.  The other 
participations were lawyers, criminologists and members of groups 
like the John Howard Society, a group advocating convicts' 
rights.  Everything else was geared to the rights of offenders 
[the member for Surrey North] said.  “I was the only person in 
the whole damn bunch who took the victims' side to anything,” he 
said, “and someone from CAVEAT.”  He said he appreciated being 
asked to attend, but added, “it was so obviously one-sided.”

</I></B></P><P align=left>By December 1996, three years after the 1993 election, 16 
private members' bills were introduced to reform Canada's 
criminal justice system.  None have become law. It is unfortunate 
that despite the hard work and effort of many parliamentarians 
from all sides of the House, a similar pattern is emerging in 
this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Included in those bills that died was one introduced by the 
member for York—South Weston, Bill C-234.  This very necessary 
bill did not become law.  It did not even come back to the floor 
of the House of Commons because the Liberal members of the 
justice standing committee killed it. They did this despite the 
fact that Bill C-234 had the overwhelming support of the Canadian 
Police Association and Victims of Violence.  Bill C-234 most 
certainly had the support of the Reform Party because this 
private members' bill would have repealed section 745 of the 
Criminal Code.  It would have quashed the killer's glimmer of 
hope for being released before serving his full sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleague from Mississauga East for her courage in 
standing in a caucus where there is not much support for what 
many people across this country are asking for.  I assure her 
that she has my support on this bill and the support of my 
caucus. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Bill C-251, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  This enactment 
provides for the imposition of consecutive sentences where a 
person commits sexual assault and another offence arising out of 
the same events or where the person is already serving another 
sentence at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment also provides that a person sentenced to life 
imprisonment for first or second degree murder is not eligible 
for parole until the person has served, in addition to the 
portion of the sentence that the person must serve for murder, 
one-third or a maximum of seven years of any other sentence 
imposed on the person in respect of an offence arising out of the 
same events or that the person is already serving. The mandatory 
portion of each life sentence imposed on a person who is 
convicted of a second murder must be served consecutively before 
the person is eligible for parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two main parts to this private members' bill.  The 
first section deals with consecutive sentencing for those who 
commit sexual assault and another offence arising out of the same 
events, for example, sexual assault and a break and enter, or 
where the person is already serving time for another sentence at 
the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sentencing in Canada is a relatively complex matter.  Sentencing 
principles are set out in section 718.1 and section 718.2 of the 
Criminal Code.  Degrees of punishment are set out in section 
718.3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two types of sentencing in penitentiary:  consecutive 
and concurrent.  Concurrent is when the time runs together.  For 
example, in a case of eight months for break and enter and four 
months for theft, the offender would serve eight months. 
Consecutive is when the sentences are cumulative.  In this case 
the offender would have the two sentences added together for a 
total of 12 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges can currently impose consecutive sentences under section 
718.03 of the Criminal Code, but not for life imprisonment. 
Sentencing is complicated by the principle of totality which says 
that the total sentence, that is combined sentences, is “just 
and appropriate” and will rarely exceed the harshest sentence 
for the most serious crime of all those being considered at the 
time of sentencing. 
This is a common law principle and is well entrenched in law. 
Consequently with regard to the first section of this bill, Bill 
C-251 provisions already exist which address consecutive 
sentencing.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second aspect of the bill provides for a consecutive portion 
of another sentence to be served upon an offender who is serving 
time for murder.  Thus someone who is serving 25 years for murder 
and who is also found guilty of sexual assault and sentenced to 
nine years would have three years added to any parole eligibility 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section of the bill recognizes the nature and severity of 
certain crimes and imposes additional penalties to serious 
offenders and deals with public safety concerns. In that area I 
would support this part of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, while I could support the second part of the 
bill and appreciate the intent of the first part, the first 
section of the bill complicates existing law and is contrary to 
the principles in common law.  Consequently we find we cannot 
support the bill in its present form. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am also very pleased to speak on Bill C-251, an 
act to amend the Criminal Code and the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act. I would suggest at the outset that this 
is a very timely and important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start my remarks with a quotation from the mover of this 
bill, the hon. member of Mississauga East, from a speech which 
she gave in the previous parliament. The bill was then labelled 
Bill C-321, the ancestor to the present bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I reintroduced this bill I have sadly been visited by too 
many victims of crime who have now come to realize that they are 
also victims of parliament. Some had lost children, some had lost 
parents, some had lost spouses, but all had lost faith in the 
courts, lost faith in parole boards and, most of all, lost faith 
in parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very sad words.  I must say again at the outset that I commend 
the hon. member for Mississauga East for her dogged determination 
and pursuit of this very important principle and for bringing 
this bill forward again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How true her statements ring when we look at what has happened 
this week in the House. We and the Canadian population have seen 
that the Government of Canada has displayed some callousness 
toward victims. Although I listened very carefully to her words, 
I must say that the quality of mercy is strained by what has 
happened to the victims of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to say with that on the record that I am glad to see 
there is at least one member who does care for victims. I know 
she has been working very hard over the past number of years to 
bring this matter forward in the form of a votable motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She stated in her remarks that there were three basic principles 
behind this bill: inhumanity and to avoid it, improving humanity 
toward victims, and certainly to protect us against those who 
offend.  I congratulate her on her work. I am happy to see that 
members in this House and some members of her own government have 
decided to make this a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga East has moved this important bill 
and has given a very eloquent speech before this House. This is 
the kind of intelligent, impartial and passionate speech we see 
far too seldom.  Her speech clearly described how difficult it is 
for victims of crime in this country to face the justice system 
and how far too easily it is for them to lose faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today parliamentarians have an opportunity to speak on this 
important piece of legislation to help improve our justice 
system, to help bring to Canadians confidence in the system and 
more important to improve the protection of society from violent 
offenders.  These are very collective and substantive suggestions 
the hon. member has made. Again I state on the record that I 
wholeheartedly and unequivocally support her motives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 provides for truth in sentencing, something we must 
see. It is a very brief, straightforward and easy to understand 
amendment to the Criminal Code, something which we and all 
members of this House should encourage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the issue of sexual assault and section 271 of 
the Criminal Code there is a substantial need for this amendment. 
There is a need that sentences which are imposed by judges be 
served consecutively so that the punishment reflects the gravity 
of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time there is the ability for these types of 
sentences to be served concurrently.  That is, if there is more 
than one offence or the offence of a sexual assault occurs at the 
same time as other offences such as break and enter, theft or 
simple assault, the sentences are served at the same time. 
It is tantamount to having loans from three different 
institutions and only having to pay back one loan, to put it in 
simple terms.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of sentencing are set out in the Criminal Code of 
Canada.  Section 718 of the code sets out what legislators in the 
past have tried to do and tried to reflect in the sentencing 
principles. Section 718.1 states: “A sentence must be 
proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of 
responsibility of the offender”. It goes further in setting out 
what these principles are and it speaks of the need for 
reformation and rehabilitation to be balanced against the more 
important, I would suggest, principle and that is the protection 
of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code states: “Where consecutive sentences are 
imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or 
harsh”. Try to explain that to victims.  Try to explain that to 
those who have lost their loved ones or had their loved ones 
attacked, beaten or killed.  It is hard to impose this very 
strict and I would suggest heartless, callous principle and make 
them understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to revisit the principles of sentencing. The suggestion 
by the hon. member is a good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 would expand the ability of judges to impose a fair 
sentence.  No one should be getting a free ride in our justice 
system. Sadly, that is precisely what happens on occasion. We 
permit sexual offenders and other offenders who commit two, 
three, four or more crimes to serve one sentence at one time.  It 
is absolutely absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The name Clifford Olson has been mentioned in this Chamber far 
too often. I shudder to even mention that man's name. This is an 
individual who killed 11 children and is serving one life 
sentence.  He should be serving 11 life sentences.  The 
manipulative and self-serving evidence that he gave at his 
section 745 hearing is an absolute disgrace. It is a black eye 
for the entire country and our justice system in particular. 
There is no meaningful sentence that would ever reflect the 
heinous nature of the crimes that waste product committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot help but be alarmist and reactionary when one hears 
the individual circumstances that surround some of these crimes, 
but one has to be thoughtful and thorough when approaching the 
subject of sentencing.  Common sense has to apply at some level. 
For people like Olson and Bernardo, to suggest that 15 years to 
life is an adequate response is absolutely ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I hope that the member for Mississauga East will 
also support members of parliament on the opposition side when we 
continue to call for the abolition of section 745 of the Criminal 
Code, the so-called faint hope clause.  I am sure that based on 
the time she spent watching this debacle in British Columbia she 
will be of a similar mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of her bill are completely undermined and useless 
as long as we continue to have section 745 in the Criminal Code. 
It is my belief that each of the innocent lives that were taken 
deserve at least the validation of having a consecutive sentence 
to represent their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentences are another subject, but that is another 
matter that has to be revisited.  I would suggest that serious 
sexual assaults and violence should never be considered by judges 
for the imposition of conditional sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also my belief that a person who commits multiple crimes 
should be given an appropriate sentence to reflect each and every 
one of those offences if committed at a different time with 
different circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 addresses that.  It does so in a substantial and 
common sense fashion. Therefore I support the member and I 
support her bill.  I support truth in sentencing.  I support a 
justice system that does not marginalize by bargaining away the 
ability of society to protect itself and reflect its revulsion of 
violent crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second clause of Bill C-251 also amends section 120 of the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  It requires offenders 
sentenced for first and second degree murders to serve their full 
parole ineligibility period on the sentence, plus one-third of a 
maximum of seven years, whichever is less. Again it is an 
innovative way to ensure that there is some truth in sentencing.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times and factual circumstances when the judge should 
impose a sentence that would really reflect what the crime 
represents.  If a judge says 25 years, it should be 25 years and 
that should be the end of it.  That would give the offender and 
society the belief in their justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a person is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for life 
for first or second degree murder, and after being sentenced to a 
term of imprisonment for life in respect of another crime, why 
should that sentence not be served consecutively?  It is a very 
good motion on the part of the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, cumulative sentences play a very important role when 
it comes to parole eligibility.  With a double murderer, Bill 
C-251, would be the best way to address this.  The victim's 
family of the second murder, are left with the fact that their 
victim is not being addressed by the justice system when the 
sentence has to be served concurrently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person capable of serious violence and sexual aggression is a 
risk.  It has to be a priority.  It has to be something that we 
are prepared to address.  This bill is worthy of our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 is a step toward improving our justice system overall 
and our sentencing principles.  We must do more.  We must 
continue to work toward this important goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I and the Conservative Party support this bill 
wholeheartedly and congratulate the member for Mississauga East. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
speak in this debate on Bill C-251. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Mississauga East on her tenacity and dedication to an issue that 
concerns us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem that, for the rest of this session, the criminal 
justice system will be a major focus in this House. The Minister 
of Justice is continuing consultations on the subject and 
proposing changes on various criminal justice issues, including 
legislation regarding young offenders, the difficult situation 
we are all aware of concerning victims and recommendations made 
as a result of recent investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the solicitor general, he is presiding over the review of 
legislation including the Criminal Records Act and the Transfer 
of Offenders Act. He is also involved in reviewing the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act. This review is a major 
initiative of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, the government is open to suggestions to bring 
about positive change and is fulfilling its responsibility, 
which is to provide Canadians with a more efficient criminal 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly not give the impression that our legislation, 
even the most comprehensive and recent, is perfect. Lawmakers 
have the duty to keep an eye out for changes that may require a 
reform of existing legislation and for legislative 
inconsistencies and anomalies that may create inequalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' bills are a tool to put forward corrective 
measures, which are sometimes adopted. I firmly believe in the 
value of debating issues raised in private members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, I am concerned that Bill C-251, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, 
may take away flexibility and discretionary power from our 
courts and add to the already heavy burden of correctional 
bodies, when it comes to administering sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes would introduce new elements to the 
legislation adopted by parliament not so long ago. They would 
amend existing legislation in ways not foreseen by those who 
drafted it, who took part in discussions, and who made the 
amendments that give them their present form.  If adopted, these 
amendments could well lead to serious challenges under our 
charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments proposed by the hon. member for Mississauga East 
seem to be the solution that has always been called for by any 
groups calling for heavier penalties for law-breakers.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other hon. members have said, Bill C-251, in its present form, 
and the prior forms of these proposed amendments are aimed at 
responding to the demands of a group which is attempting to 
convince us that longer sentences and later releases will 
enhance public safety.  This admirable group is made up of 
police officers and victims, that is well-intentioned people who 
deserve our respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, like to respectfully submit that law 
enforcement agencies are sworn to enforce the law, while 
lawmakers are the ones responsible for drafting it. 
Moreover, it is an underlying principle of our justice system 
that the state guarantees the objectivity of the criminal 
justice system by prescribing penalties, and thus eliminating 
any element of personal vengeance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impressive list of legislative measures drafted by previous 
hard-line governments, as well as the improvements introduced in 
recent years, have had an impact on a large number of criminal 
justice issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases, the new legislative provisions were the direct 
consequence of suggestions from police and victim assistance 
organizations.  They were consulted in all cases. Most of the 
time, the measures that were adopted lengthened sentences and 
made the system more stringent. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that sometimes unusual and tragic events put considerable 
pressure on hon. members in the House to find solutions to 
problems in the area of criminal justice.  The public reaction to 
recent deplorable and senseless crimes is also quite 
understandable.  The efforts of individual Canadians and groups 
to exert positive influence are for the most part very 
commendable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments, however, invoke punitive measures that 
far exceed the restrictions now set out in the Criminal Code and 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act as well as threaten 
freedoms defended by the charter, as I mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, Bill C-251 is before us today and as described by 
its subtitle proposes cumulative sentences that could in some 
cases double or triple current levels of sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I do not doubt the motives or intentions of the hon. 
member for Mississauga East, I must point out that support for 
the bill will come from those who believe that life should mean 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a certain element here that has been addressed in past 
sessions when similar attempts were made to achieve the same 
objectives.  The thrust of these proposals applies to those who 
might otherwise anticipate earlier eligibility to be considered 
for conditional release under current rules of sentence 
calculation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will attempt therefore to provide some details of how the 
government has come to address corrections and conditional 
release issues.  In so doing I submit that it will become clear 
to my hon. colleagues that the proposals now before us do not at 
this time reflect the best interests of the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are living in times of tremendous change, as hon. colleagues 
are well aware.  Change is experienced no less by the criminal 
justice system than by any other institution in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the criminal justice system the past decade has been a 
period of difficult and sometimes painful questioning.  Is our 
justice system working?  Is it protecting our most vulnerable 
citizens?  Can we assure Canadians that their safety is of 
paramount concern to the Government of Canada?  These are all 
valid questions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1988 report of the Standing Committee on Justice and the 
Solicitor General was entitled: “Taking Responsibility”. In that 
report, the committee recognized the need to make certain 
improvements to sentencing, conditional release and the 
correctional system, and included detailed recommendations to 
that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of that committee is greatly appreciated, and its 
members know that their concerns were instrumental in the 
reforms proposed by our government. These reforms seek to 
improve public security and to restore public confidence in the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second half of the 1980s, the country had been shaken by 
a series of unusual and tragic events that made our criminal 
justice system look rather bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, because of an increase in the crime rate, the public 
was urging the government to change the system and to adopt 
harsher measures that would reflect the new limits of tolerance 
for certain types of crimes. The 1988 report, along with other 
basic reviews of the correctional system, led to the adoption, 
in 1992, of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This radical reform of legislative measures pertaining to 
correctional matters and parole responded to public pressure by 
making the system more open, more just and more accessible and 
recognized the need for significant change to bring it into line 
with public opinion and values.  The current government 
considered it appropriate on two occasions to change the law, 
after consulting with interested Canadians and with its criminal 
justice system partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the process, the first priority was to re-establish 
public confidence.  We must continue to respond to public fears 
about crime and concerns about criminal justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must, however, take account of the change in the landscape. 
The number of violent crimes has consistently and considerably 
dropped in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us to properly respond to public concerns, we must work to 
improve understanding of the nature of crimes currently 
committed and of our criminal justice system, which has changed 
appreciably in recent times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the government now intends to keep the criminal 
justice flexible in part through a review of the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Solicitor General of Canada will be addressing the House 
justice committee on Monday in introducing its review of the 
CCRA.  I encourage the hon. member to put forth her 
recommendations under that exhaustive review.  I will work with 
her on that committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
want to add my congratulations and thanks to the hon. member for 
Mississauga East for her tenacity and courage in continuing this 
fight and bringing this important debate to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very pleased to see that after the third time this 
private member's bill has come this far and is going to be 
votable.  We will find out when the vote is held who actually 
speaks for Canadians and who speaks for victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am actually really restraining myself in my reaction to the 
speech we just heard.  I cannot use the words because they are 
unparliamentary.  It is really deplorable that the frontbench of 
this government has so little regard for victims in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I was sitting here listening I thought of the word empathy 
which means feeling with someone who is hurting.  It is different 
from sympathy.  Empathy is feeling with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I went to Saskatchewan to visit my parents.  We drove 
down a road that we drive every time we come from our home in 
Alberta down into Swift Current, Saskatchewan where my parents 
live.  When we make a certain corner I always think of a person 
who died at that corner.  That person was Eugene Martens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a rancher who gave part of his farmland in order to put 
up a camp for children and young people.  I attended that camp as 
a youth and later on as a counsellor.  It was one of those 
situations where a man had a significant influence in my life 
because of his generosity.  He was killed on the corner of 
highway 4 north of Swift Current because, I believe, of icy 
roads.  It was not because of drunken driving.  It was an 
accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though this man was not a member of my family, every time I 
go by that place I think of that person and I say a little prayer 
of gratitude for his life and for what he did.  That helps me to 
empathize with a person whose family member, a loved one, has had 
their life taken from them by someone else's negligence or by 
someone else's misguided and wilful act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think of their pain and how they must hurt it absolutely 
drives me to distraction to think that there is a government in 
Ottawa that cannot empathize with those victims. 
I cannot understand how that can be.  All one has to do is try to 
put oneself into the same situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with the question of changing the rules for 
sentencing.  How should a criminal who was charged and convicted 
of committing a serious crime be sentenced? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present system is that individuals who are charged with more 
than one crime at a time often get concurrent sentences.  That is 
incredible.  One can take a life, or two, three, four or more and 
at a certain time their sentence starts and they are able to 
serve all sentences at the same time whether they have killed one 
person, two, three or eleven, a significant number in this 
country. It is unconscionable that we allow that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our media paid quite a bit of attention to the application of 
Clifford Olson for eligibility for early parole last summer. I 
was interviewed by a local person and I said really he should 
have had 275 years. When we think of each of those victims, if 
life sentence means 25 years in prison, ll times 25 is 275. Then 
I said if he behaves, we will let him off after 250.  That is not 
to make light of it in any way. Here are families of victims with 
an inescapable sense that some of the lives taken do not matter. 
There is no penalty for them at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am indeed one of those who believe that a life sentence should 
mean life.  It should at least mean 25 years.

the time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom 
of the order of precedence on the order paper.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The next time the matter is under consideration, the hon. member 
will have four minutes remaining in his time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 1.56 p.m., this House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
