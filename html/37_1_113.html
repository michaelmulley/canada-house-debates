	moved that Bill S-31, an act to implement agreements, conventions and protocols concluded between Canada and Slovenia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Senegal, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Germany for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-65424"></A><a HREF="#Int-65426"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-65429"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John McCallum (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill S-31, the income tax conventions implementation act, 2001, at second reading.  The bill would enact tax treaties that Canada has signed with eight countries, five  of which  are new treaties with countries with which we did not previously have a treaty, namely, Slovenia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru and Senegal. We have revised conventions with  Germany and the Czech and Slovak republics.   The reason being that the latter two countries were previously one country so we now have a new tax treaty with each republic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will provide the House with a brief overview as to why these tax treaties are important.  The first reason is fairness in taxation and the avoidance of double taxation because in the absence of a tax treaty it is highly probable  that citizens would be subjected to double taxation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second and related reason is that  foreign activities of Canadians and foreigners in Canada are increasingly important.  This is  true for foreign trade which now accounts for more than 40% of the Canadian GDP. In addition, foreign investments in both directions are increasing in importance.   Having a tax treaty increases the certainty for both Canadians and non-Canadians as to how they will be taxed in Canada and foreign countries.  This increased certainty on the tax liability encourages more foreign trade and investment.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that now, if one wishes to see a connection with the events of September 11, there may be some potential obstacles to international exchanges and the flow of foreign investments as a result.  It is even more important than ever, therefore, to adopt measures to encourage foreign investment and international exchanges.</p>


	<A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the principal disadvantages of not having a tax treaty is double taxation.  Double taxation is something that citizens and companies do not relish.  Double taxation is to be avoided because it represents a very important potential impediment to international transactions which are becoming increasingly important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really  a simple matter.  I do not know if I have to say  much more. I am a bit less longwinded than some of my opposition colleagues because I  have made the essential points.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important element of these tax treaties is that they affect withholding taxes.  Withholding taxes are those taxes imposed by Canada on income earned by non-residents.  In the absence of tax treaties, the withholding tax rate would be 25%.  However, as a consequence of these tax treaties, those withholding taxes would be reduced to a range of 5% to 15%.  This greases the wheels of international commerce and international investment and, hence, is in the national interest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-31 is not something radical.   It is not rocket science.  It is standard, routine legislation to increase our stable of countries with which we have tax treaties and to improve the tax treaties from some of the existing cases.  In general, these tax treaties are modelled on a standard OECD model.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In saying that the bill  is not terribly radical, I do not want to belittle the work done by our public servants because the devil is in the details.  There are important technical differences across the various tax conventions depending upon the nature of our relations with those countries and the state of those negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope  hon. members will  support the bill.  It is pretty simple stuff in principle, although the details could get quite technical.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three basic advantages to adopting these tax treaties: first,  it would avoid double taxation, which is good for corporate and private citizens and good from the point of view of the national interest;  second,  it would lead to a simplified tax system; and   third,  it would enhance the degree of certainty and provide a more stable environment for international transactions.  Given that the global scene is becoming more important for Canada, this increased ability to conduct foreign transactions is definitely in the national interest.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to speak on behalf of my party to  Bill S-31 and to speak on behalf of the people of Cariboo--Chilcotin as I participate in the debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation is an act to implement agreements, conventions and protocols concluded between Canada and Slovenia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Senegal, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Germany for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an act to ratify tax conventions agreed upon between Canada and the countries listed.   The agreements were set out to avoid double taxation between the respective nations and to establish a co-operative framework to prevent fiscal evasion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a technical tax bill that sets out to simplify arrangements and serves as a measure to further the economic interests of Canadian companies and individuals doing business and collecting revenues from abroad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax conventions, such as the one to be implemented in Bill S-31, seek to arrange an agreement under which each government agrees to limit or modify the application of its domestic taxes in order to attempt to avoid double taxation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance has traditionally encouraged all measures to further equalize and liberalize foreign trade and investment.  In this regard, Bill S-31 is a positive measure.  Nonetheless it was introduced in the Senate instead of the House of Commons.  This is a problem for me. Why does it originate in the Senate?  Why is it not that the Senate is brought into play as the chamber of sober second thought rather than introducing bills into the House?  It is an unelected group that  does not represent   electors in the same way that members of this Chamber do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance policy book says that  we support securing access to international markets through the negotiation of trade agreements.  Our trade agenda will focus on diversifying both the products we sell abroad and the market into which we sell those products.  It goes on to say that we will vigorously pursue reduction of international trade barriers, tariffs and subsidies, that we will work with international organizations that have relevant expertise to ensure Canadians' concerns about labour practices, environmental protection and human rights are reflected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding that the bill was introduced in the Senate, which is unelected and lacks the legitimacy to address legislation prior to the House of Commons, the Canadian Alliance will be supporting the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that we talk about a bill concerning trade with the countries I mentioned when at the same time we have a very serious and profound problem to solve in trade with our largest trading partner, the United States.  The government needs to be reminded that even though it talks about conventions and treaties with other countries, the United States has added an anti-dumping tax of 12.6% to the 19.3% countervail duty announced in August.  This  is a political statement  on behalf of the special interest U.S. lumber lobby.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next six weeks, Canadian exports of lumber will be subject to an added tax in the amount of 31.9%.  After December 16, and until we hear a final countervail announcement expected in March, the 19.3% falls away and we are only dealing with the anti-dumping tax of 12.6%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next several weeks, the United States lumber lobby will have a maximum leverage to wring concessions from the wounded Canadian industry.  This is something  that should and must be of profound importance to the Canadian government, as it is to the citizens of Canada.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like we need a tax treaty of some kind  or a convention with the United States, does it not?  It is expected that the final countervail duty determination in March 2002 will be much less than the preliminary determination in our case of 19.3%.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-dumping duties are refundable when industry corrects deficiencies.  Observers anticipate most companies will be fully refunded in the first year.  Canada has a strong case for free trade access before NAFTA and the WTO trade tribunals and the U.S. lumber lobby knows this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if we negotiate and reach an agreement more quickly than going through the trade tribunal process, the government must ensure that we stay the course toward free trade.  We will hold it accountable for that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen years of harassment have taken a major toll on our industry.  If we do not  go back to free trade now we will see further permanent job losses and disinvestments in the industry.  There is too much at stake to otherwise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. lumber lobby did not anticipate that Canada would hold out this long.  It  thought that we would negotiate rather than pursue the dispute resolution mechanisms to their fullest extent.  That is what we have done in the past and we have won there.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has changed is the strong alliance Canada enjoys with the U.S. consumer movement and its strong and effective lobby.  We can negotiate a good treaty any time; the sooner the better.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should be doing that.  The government in fact should have already done that. In the United States, consumers are speaking clearly to their politicians about the economic pain that they are experiencing.  They want Canada's softwood lumber at the best price. They need it during these difficult economic times.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration of President Bush wants the long running Canadian lumber dispute resolved before Christmas.  Let me say, so does everyone in British Columbia, particularly the lumber workers whose jobs depend upon this.  President Bush appointed an envoy vested with power to negotiate a settlement.  Our Prime Minister has the authority to appoint an envoy to negotiate for Canada.  Such a person would understand the industry, be an honest broker and stand for what is right regardless of politics.  Such a person would not let personal biases or political ambitions stand in the way of a balanced solution.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Prime Minister have the political courage to appoint such an envoy and does the Minister for International Trade have the strength of character to accept such an appointment?  I sincerely hope that they do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much pessimism today but there should be optimism as well.  If we can hold our alliance together among the lumber producers of Canada, it is the Canadian lumber producers who will be the winners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can anyone imagine   the government forcing the House to debate a tax treaty between Canada and places like Peru, Senegal and the Czech Republic without having first dealt with the most important issue facing British Columbia and other parts of Canada, the  softwood lumber crisis with the United States?  Thirty thousand jobs are at stake in British Columbia.  Over 30,000 forestry workers in British Columbia alone will be unemployed by the end of the year.  B.C.'s mill towns are at  risk of becoming ghost towns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to speak to  Bill S-31.  I am happy that, in the case of the countries involved,  we are reaching out to regularize and facilitate commerce and provide certainty in this foreign trade.  I trust that  regularization will take place with the United States concerning  the softwood lumber industry. As I said before, the Canadian Alliance will be supporting the bill. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this bill, the purpose of which is to establish tax conventions between Canada and certain countries, including  Slovenia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Senegal, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Germany, for the avoidance of double taxation of companies and investors with activities in those countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not disagree with the principle of tax conventions and, moreover, our position has been totally consistent  since  1993.   Tax conventions must help Quebec and Canadian businesses with foreign subsidiaries—as well as the opposite, foreign companies with subsidiaries in Canada—and avoid double taxation, or having the same profits  for the same industrial or financial activities taxed twice.  This would also apply to services, such as transportation by ship or other means, abroad or domestically, by subsidiaries of foreign companies.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when speaking of tax conventions and this principle of  avoiding double taxation, it must be kept in mind that these conventions must be signed between countries with more or less similar tax rates.  Thus, they must not involve countries  with  a taxation rate half as much, or even one-tenth as much as here, the countries considered tax havens, as  is often the case.  When the taxation rates are compared, one can see that there may be  incredible distortions in taxation rates in  the countries with which tax conventions are signed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the problem lies, because a Canadian company may have a foreign subsidiary that is being taxed at 1% or 2% on the revenue earned in that country, and then its profits are brought back to Canada after being taxed at that 1% or 2% rate, and are totally exempt from federal and provincial taxes because they have already been taxed in a country with which we have a tax convention.  That is the principle of tax conventions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not make sense if the convention is signed with a country where the  tax rate on profits is 1% or 2%, or where profits are not taxed at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we sign a tax treaty with Germany, for example, its makes sense, because our tax rates for businesses, depending   on their size and the index used, whether it is a composite index of taxation on revenues, capital and so on, are essentially the same, give or take a few percentage points.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when we look at the tax convention between Canada and Barbados, which we have been criticizing since 1994, it no longer makes sense. The new tax conventions included in Bill S-31 give us the opportunity to reconsider the principle underlying these types of conventions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two or three years ago, the FATF, an OECD task force, said that it was worried about the proliferation of these tax conventions and the proliferation of agreements between industrialized countries and countries considered  as tax havens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is even more reason to be concerned since the events of September 11, as we try to track  money  laundered by terrorist groups. We wonder about the proliferation of these conventions and about questionable taxation practices adopted by certain countries around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, there are 1,500 bilateral tax conventions signed by various countries around the world. According to most experts, including OECD experts, we have somehow lost control over the nature and content of these conventions and the taxation practices of some of these countries.  The OECD, like the Bloc Quebecois, among others, has criticized the harmful taxation practices adopted by countries considered as tax havens. </p>


	<A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of tax havens around the world. Incidentally, the auditor general, like the Bloc Quebecois, has often criticized the existence and proliferation of these conventions with countries whose taxation rates differ greatly from those of Canada. The auditor general has even said, four times since  1993—and you were there, Mr. Speaker—that these harmful practices threatened Canada's tax base.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite something for the auditor general to state that throughout the world there are countries like these and that it is easy to funnel Canadian capital into them, with their harmful tax practices, with taxation rates that are vastly different from those of any of the industrialized countries in the world, thereby threatening the federal tax base. This is  a sign of the severity of the situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did the auditor general criticize the situation, but so did the OECD, through the FATF. We have criticized these tax havens and so have international specialists. However, what is cause for concern is that, until quite recently, the web sites for certain departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, encouraged Canadian investors and businesses to use tax havens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pretty serious problem when government web sites and official publications encourage Canadian business and investors to practice tax avoidance by transferring their capital to countries that are considered tax havens, where there are harmful tax practices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an example. The July 16, 1999 issue of <i>CanadExport</i>, which is the magazine published by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to promote and encourage international trade in Canada, contained an article on a “Tax Havens Conference.” The topics discussed included the origin of tax havens, their use as a financial strategy and how to choose a tax haven that's right for you. Basically, the message was, not only can one take one's capital out of the country and avoid paying taxes to the federal government, but the government will say where the best place is to do so. The fourth topic dealt with tax havens and  Canada's tax laws, and how to get the most out of one's tax havens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite serious when we find in a government booklet of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade the promotion of these tax havens, which have been condemned by the 29 OECD countries, including Canada. They have been condemned here by the Auditor General of Canada, by the Bloc Quebecois and by experts who are tired of seeing the government's inaction in the transfer of capital to foreign countries and in the fact that some people can avoid paying federal taxes in Canada. This has to do particularly with very large businesses, some financial institutions—we will have the opportunity to get back to this a little later—and with international marine transportation companies. It is quite strange that a booklet of the department is promoting these havens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are two discourses. At the OECD, Canada says we must fight against harmful tax practices. Within departments, these harmful tax practices are being promoted. We cannot have it both ways. At some point, there must be some concrete action to avoid the disturbing proliferation, which has been condemned by the auditor general several times since 1993, of these harmful tax practices by some countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even on its website—this is high technology—the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade  was promoting offshore trade and investment in countries that are considered as tax havens. It said that serious investors and businesses had to examine this opportunity to avoid federal taxation by using tax havens. This is quite disturbing to see.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more disturbing is that not only there is the promotion of tax havens, but there is also a tax convention between Canada and Barbados. </p>


	<A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barbados is considered one of the best tax havens in the world.  A tax convention makes it even easier to transfer funds there in order pay nothing or next to nothing in taxes.  In Barbados, the corporate tax rate for companies with assets of over $20 million U.S. is 1%.  It is about 28% here, but 1% in Barbados.  For mid size companies, with revenues under $20 million, it is 2%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, companies, subsidiaries of Canadian companies, major Canadian investors in all sectors, find themselves treated very well when they invest in Barbados, a country considered one of the world's best tax havens that Canada has signed a tax convention with to prevent double taxation.  They pay tax once, 1% of their revenues and when they bring their money back here, they pay nothing more, because of the tax convention between the two countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they pay nothing or next to nothing in Canadian taxes, it means that taxpayers who cannot benefit from tax havens, and tax conventions, like the one between Canada and Barbados, are at a disadvantage.  They have to make up for the shortfall in taxes occasioned by this tax haven and many others, because we maintain a convention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that for three years now, the financial action task force on money laundering, which is doing analyses and taking action in connection with tax havens and harmful tax practices, has asked OECD member countries, including Canada, to denounce tax conventions or agreements with countries that divulge no information or that are unco-operative in connection with money laundering.  In tax havens, there is a certain nonchalance about money laundering.  I will come back to this a little later, because I have some interesting statistics.  Canada was not prepared to denounce its convention with Barbados, a country on the list of tax havens with dubious tax practices and money laundering practices that are very closely guarded secrets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is disturbing, all the more so since the Minister of Finance recently chaired, in Toronto, a meeting of countries of the three Americas. Representatives of the finance ministers of the three Americas were meeting to discuss ways to deal with  harmful tax practices. Nothing came out of the meeting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand. There is no political will to settle anything; meanwhile, tax havens are being promoted. I will come back to the case of the Finance Minister later.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is being done about tax conventions. However, we have to be incredibly cautious about the choices  we make when we sign such conventions with foreign countries, in order to prevent tax havens from making harmful practices worse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  would like to give a few statistics, which speak volumes about the extent of tax havens and which show that every time we sign a tax convention, we should ask ourselves if this is really the right thing to do. We should ask ourselves if the objective of those conventions, which is to avoid double taxation, is the only possible result, or if there are not other possible undesirable results, such  as harmful tax practices or money laundering.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here a few statistics which might enlighten the House. Since 1993, we have been asking for a review of practices under tax conventions and also  of conventions signed with some countries, in order to ensure  they do not contain irregularities, obvious flaws or very undesirable negative results.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worldwide, assets worth $8 trillion U.S. are controlled by tax havens. This is mind boggling. We are not used to figures of this magnitude.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank deposits in offshore companies and institutions located in tax havens presently amount to $3 trillion U.S.</p>


	<A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Interpol, the FATF and the experts who have been working on this issue for years, 15% of these assets may come from the worldwide drug trade. We are talking 15% of $8 trillion U.S. in tax havens. There is $3 trillion in bank deposits. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, some 140,000 companies are created in tax havens. I am not saying there are 140,000 such companies now. I am saying that, every year,  140,000 new companies, which are often fronts, are created in countries deemed  to be tax havens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this day,  four million corporations have been set up in tax havens. That is right, four million. We do not know who the owners are. We do not know where the money comes from, since there is some laxness regarding the money coming in and out. These tax havens—at least some of them, which were  clearly identified recently by the FATF—launder every day about $1 billion U.S. generated by the drug trade at the world level.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem is not a simple one. It must not be taken lightly, as the government has been doing since 1993, and as it recently did when the issue of a free trade area of the Americas was discussed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have repeatedly asked the government to take action, to reconcile the two different views, that is the one expressed at the OECD, which says that we must fight harmful  taxation practices, and the one presented here, which consists in signing tax conventions with various countries without asking too many questions, or in maintaining existing ones such as the convention with Barbados, knowing full well that Barbados is one of the worst countries for harmful taxation practices and for the laundering of money generated by all sorts of illegal activities.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the list of countries deemed to be tax havens, which was recently released by the FATF, 10 of these tax havens are in countries with which we will create a free trade area of the Americas. These countries are Barbados—as we mentioned—the Bahamas, Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Panama, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and St. Lucia. These countries are located in the free trade area that we propose to establish with the countries of the three Americas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying we should not sign such an agreement.  On the contrary, we should.  However, at the same time, we should ask ourselves some questions.  Will we ever get people who can think on the other side?  Before signing an agreement concerning a  free trade area of the Americas, one must stop to ponder the issue.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that the service industry will be included in the FTAA.  Therefore, financial services will also be included.  That will bring about a huge tax treaty  between    countries of the three Americas.  Could we stop for a second and think about the impact of such an agreement on  financial services, given the fact that several countries of the free trade area—I just mentioned 10—have some very harmful tax practices?  These countries have tax levels  totally alien to  reality, they grant incredible tax    holidays, they are against any disclosure of information on the origin of the funds in bank accounts or  other types of assets.  They are also closed to the idea of revealing  the names of business owners,  those people who own the 140,000 corporations I was talking about earlier.  Some are created   every year in those 10 countries in  the area of the Americas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we not  ask ourselves if maybe we should  examine  the tax  levels and  practices in those countries and their attitude towards transparency and disclosure of information on the source of funds,   the capital outflow,  and  on who owns these corporations? </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that it might be appropriate to kill two birds with one stone, or in other words sign a free trade area agreement with these countries and, at the same time, require a review after a certain number of years of their harmful tax  practices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of businesses  are already benefiting from the existence of tax havens, among them the banks, of course,  but Canadian banks,  not foreign ones.  The parliamentary secretary must be aware of this,  given  his background as chief economist of a major bank.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often raised these matters with the Canadian Bankers Association, but have never received any answer as to why the five major Canadian banks have more than 50  branches  in the Caribbean.    Why are there 50 bank branches in a region of several million inhabitants?   How much banking activity can there be in those region?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a visit to the Barbados website will find it stating “Barbados has an international business centre”.  I will read, if I may, a     few rather interesting excerpts concerning Canadian banking institutions:</p>


	<A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Major international accounting firms continue to provide professional services on the island for many years, as have the commercial banks, including: Barclays Bank, Royal Bank of Canada”--the bank of provenance of the parliamentary secretary--“the Bank of Nova Scotia and CIBC Caribbean Limited.  Barbados is the only international business centre which offers all of the following features in a single location: offshore banks, ship registration, double taxation treaties with seven countries including the U.S.A., Canada and the United Kingdom; tax holidays and other incentives; and no capital gains taxes”.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the businesses mentioned are not specified, but we can identify some of them here.  They  include branches of Canadian banks on which information is not all that forthcoming concerning  what type of activities they might be carrying out in centres such as Barbados and other countries that are considered tax havens, with their dubious practices of  accepting deposits without question,  which are then recycled through other  dummy companies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a serious matter to find ourselves in a situation like this, with no information forthcoming on the international activities of Canadian banks, and to see  Canadian banks being promoted abroad as a means of Canadian tax evasion.  The fact that the Canadian government asks no questions of Canadian banks concerning their activities abroad, whereas these come under federal jurisdiction, is a serious matter, as is the fact that the subsidiaries of Canadian banks are not subject to the new legislation that has just been passed concerning money laundering. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government says that it is putting in place a centre and a new piece of legislation so that any suspicious transaction of $10,000 and over made by company representatives or whomever else may be reported, these transactions analyzed in a central office, and cross referencing done to determine whether this money is not dirty money related to drug trafficking or other illegal practices, and that this legislation applies only to companies located in Canada, and not to subsidiaries of Canadian companies operating in other regions considered tax havens and, by some, money laundering havens, it is not surprising that nothing was found in the bank accounts when people began to go after  al-Qaeda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government offered to help the American FBI track down Osama bin Laden's money but, apart from a few hundred thousands here, almost none of it was found.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leaves the question of whether foreign subsidiaries of Canadian companies, including subsidiaries of banks, do not also have some little  activities which we cannot investigate, because the new federal legislation does not apply to them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are questions which need to be asked.  We have a responsibility, not just nationally, but internationally as well.  Why does the Canadian government not equip itself to manage its treaties with these countries and to monitor the activities of these companies abroad, in countries with suspicious tax practices and say, at the same time, that it is making a positive and really serious contribution to the fight against drug traffickers, who launder money in these countries, or against the terrorists? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that one must wonder when we how the Canadian government deals with  tax treaties, tax conventions, and the absence of questions about the very likely existence of suspicious practices in these countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that there is double talk from the OECD, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, that the Minister of Finance is saying “Yes, we are going to do something about harmful tax practices” and, at the same time, he heads up a meeting of ministers of finance from all countries in the three Americas which produces nothing at all, although according to Canada's Minister of Finance, it was held to discuss these dubious tax practices, worries me just a little.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mean to accuse the Minister of Finance,  but I feel that there is a lack of resolve. I wonder if this is not due to the fact that the Minister of Finance himself carries out activities in these countries that are considered tax havens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance is also a shipowner. He owns 11  companies in the Caribbean and down south. He owns eight companies in Barbados. I could list all of the companies the Minister of Finance owns, I have them here: CSL International Barbados, etc. Our Minister of Finance owns eight maritime transport companies in Barbados.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could this explain why he is not in any hurry to criticize this tax convention that exists between Canada and Barbados?  Could this be the reason?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get tired of hearing the comments expressing outrage from members on the other side of the House, as though the Minister of Finance were in the same situation as a poor widow with an orphan child. There is a limit laughing at us.</p>


	<A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance owns eleven shipping lines, this is a fact. He owns eight in Barbados and three in Bermuda, countries that are considered tax havens. Barbados is considered one of the worst  countries  in the world, in terms of tax havens, according to the OECD group I mentioned earlier. Could there be a link between this ownership and his lack of political will to proceed with major reforms? We have the right to ask the question and I think that taxpayers have the right to know. They have the right to know this information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We bring this up not to run a smear campaign, but because these are the facts. It is not my fault if he acquired these ships, if he has eight companies in Barbados and if there is a tax convention between Canada and Barbados that has been denounced by the OECD. These are the facts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government is going to talk about fighting harmful tax practices, about satisfying the requirements set out by the OECD, about making a real contribution to eliminate harmful tax practices and trying to reduce the money laundering that goes on in some of these countries, then it is going to have to put its money where its mouth is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to condemn and support at the same time.  When things are white, they are not black.  For the past five or six years, we have been hearing comments internationally to the effect that  Canada is not carrying its weight in this regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude by saying that we will support this tax convention.  We have gone over the tax practices of each country with a fine-toothed comb. There is no problem, as there might be in the case of a convention such as we have with Barbados, which we have always condemned.  The OECD has been doing the same thing recently.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will support it, but encourage the government to change things.  If the Minister of Finance is in conflict of interest, he should move over, as when ships are involved.  But, good grief, could the government be seriously analyzing the situation and taking specific action and saying black on the one hand and white on the other, supporting tax havens on one hand and fighting them on the other?  That will not work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the government assuming its responsibilities?  It should go a notch above what it has put in place to fight money laundering.  It should denounce its convention with Barbados, subject Canadian subsidiaries abroad to rigorous control of their activities and require them to report any dubious transactions.  That is what we are calling for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government wants to maintain its past reputation for  integrity, there are things it must do, especially since the events of September 11.  It says it is joining with its allies to fight international terrorism.  We must take specific action to show we mean business.  I think it would be a good idea for the government  to wake up.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will say a few words about Bill S-31 that is before the House today. As the House knows, it is a bill to implement a tax treaty between Canada and a number of countries with which we have had no treaties in the past, countries such as Slovenia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Senegal, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Germany.  This is the kind of tax treaty we obviously need between our country and other parts of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I get into the substance of my remarks on the tax treaty  I want to say I have a fundamental objection to the way the bill has proceeded through the Parliament of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill comes to us from the Senate.  It originated in the Senate.  The Senate is not elected. It is not accountable to anyone.  Yet it initiates a bill that comes to the House of Commons.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b>  Hear, hear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</b> The member from Kitchener or Cambridge on the Liberal side of the House thinks that is pretty good and says hear, hear.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Consider the source, Lorne.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:  </b>Considering the source  of the comment I am not too surprised, as someone across the way has said.  Here is a Liberal member applauding the idea that the unelected and unaccountable Senate that costs Canadian taxpayers $60 million a year can initiate a piece of legislation and come to the House of Commons with a bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has the government House leader, whom I have known for many years, not brought in serious parliamentary reform in this place to give committees of the House of Commons more power,  independence and research help so that they could be doing this kind of work instead of committees of the Senate? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has come to have serious parliamentary reform. The minister across the way knows from the last polls that only about 5% of the Canadian people support the existing Senate. The other 95% want the Senate either elected or abolished.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same Liberal member across the way who does not seem to have much of a knack for reading newspapers says that  is not true.  All he needs to do is to look at the polls regarding the Senate.  How many people does he know who support the existing Senate besides senators, their friends, husbands, wives, girlfriends, boyfriends,  family members and close associates?  That is about it, so I object to that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the substance of the bill we must have treaties with other countries.  We must be concerned about tax loopholes.  We should be doing a real review of our taxation system to make sure we have a more progressive  tax system based on the ability to pay.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, Veterans Week from November 5 to November 11 is a week long time of remembrance designed to honour those who served Canada in the causes of both war and peace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's theme is “in the Service of Peace”, which seems especially fitting considering Canada's large role in United Nations peacekeeping efforts.  Nearly 125,000 Canadians have served in peacekeeping missions over the past 53 years and as of October 2000, 113 Canadians have given their lives in the line of duty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Events for  youth have been organized such as an activity called “Postcards for Peace” in which students are encouraged to send postcards to show their support and concern for the 2,000 Canadian men and women currently participating in Operation Apollo.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veterans Week is a week for all Canadians to come together in gratitude to our veterans and peacekeepers for the sacrifices they have made in the name of freedom and peace.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mid-September within a week of the disastrous and deadly attack on America, Cody Woodward, Cody Foley, Drew Gosselin and Mason Herzog, all grade five students from Wainwright, Alberta, raised a substantive sum of money to assist our neighbours to the south.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These selfless young men took it upon themselves to sell hot dogs and pop to help provide much needed funds for Red Cross relief in the United States. In one night these boys raised $3,200.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This handsome sum of money represents both the tremendous efforts of these young people and the kindness and charity of the people of the wonderful rural community of Wainwright.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government should continue to work with all levels of our education system in the national and international interest, but at this time when there is concern about skills shortages the federal government should reassess its relations with the 1,000 community colleges of Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colleges are the rapid response level of our education system. They adapt quickly to change and deliver new educational products quickly to our communities.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children need a clean environment, pure air, clean water, nutritious food and a healthy home environment.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, November 11, several ceremonies will be held in Brome--Missisquoi to commemorate Remembrance Day. These ceremonies will take place in Knowlton, Farnham, Phillipsburg, Bedford, Cowansville, Mansonville, Sutton and Magog.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 11 we will thank the 116,000 Canadians who made the ultimate sacrifice for peace. This should  give us plenty to think about. We must show the same determination as those who gave their lives for Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these difficult times, we must work hard for peace and for our democratic values, while also paying tribute to our veterans this week.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today I honour the remarkable occasion of the 80th birthday of Doris Anderson, a true feminist, role model and friend.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doris has always been a shining example of how age has very little to do with the date of one's birth. She has forever been ahead of us in her ideas. As editor of <i>Chatelaine</i> Doris brought previously private issues like domestic violence to the public sphere. In many ways she changed both Canadian journalism and the politics of gender. In so doing she has affected the lives of all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As president of the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women she helped enshrine equal rights for men and women in the Canadian constitution. She is still hard at work as chair of the Ontario Press Council and as a powerful advocate for proportional representation in federal elections.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight there will be a sold out birthday celebration for Doris in Toronto where Governor General Adrienne Clarkson will speak and CBC's Shelagh Rogers will be the emcee. Her birthday present will be the Doris Anderson Ontario Graduate Scholarship in Women's Studies at York University. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recipients will be given $5,000 from the scholarship fund and $10,000 as a double matching grant from the province of Ontario. Donations are still being accepted and additional money raised will go to the Doris Anderson Bursary Fund for $15,000 scholarships for out of province students and for research.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to congratulate Doris on her continuing contributions and wish her the very best as she turns 80. She continues to teach us all so much.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this week we celebrate Information and Communications Technologies Week.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past two decades, we have been witnessing the rapid development of a new technological field,  computer science, which has completely revolutionized our ways of doing things and our perception of the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not we are familiar with these new tools, we have to recognize that they are now playing a major role in our daily lives, both at work and at home.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, we must praise the various governments for recognizing early the importance of information and communications technologies for the economic, social and human development of our communities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosperity of a nation is now closely related to its quick adjusting to the so-called “new economy”, which is an economic order built around the development and use of new technologies.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to mention the Quebec government initiative to promote access to information and communications technologies for less fortunate families. This program allowed 217,500 low income  families in Quebec to buy or rent a computer. Moreover, close to 286,000 additional households in Quebec can now surf  the Internet. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the Quebec model should once again serve as an example to provide equal opportunities for all. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, there is no better time to stand with pride to pay tribute to all the great men and women who served our country with distinction and yes, even those who continue to serve us with pride today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembrance Day is a time to honour our Canadian veterans whose supreme sacrifice permits us to live today in a free and democratic society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already hundreds of commemorative activities have taken place in communities across our country.  From memorial services to story telling, Canadians are recognizing, remembering and thanking those who dedicated their lives to the pursuit of freedom and democracy over tyranny.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we pause to salute our veterans I ask all Canadians to say a prayer for our Canadian forces who are serving here and abroad and to offer our blessings to their families during this most difficult time. I would also say to all Canadians, but especially to our youth, that we must never forget. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, Zimbabwe is poised to descend into a bloodbath.  President Mugabe says he is trying to redistribute land from wealthy white landowners to the poor black majority.  This is simply not the case.  Land reforms are a smokescreen so that Mr. Mugabe can terrorize his population and get re-elected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just returned from Zimbabwe where black farm workers have been beaten, brutalized and sometimes murdered by Mr. Mugabe's thugs.  Their homes have been burned, their wives have been raped and they face starvation.  Until this brutality ends Canada and the international community must suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, freeze the personal assets of Mr. Mugabe and his government members, and implement an arms embargo on Zimbabwe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the rule of law is implemented, all illegal farm occupants are removed and election monitors are on the ground these sanctions should not be lifted. Unless we do this thousands of people are poised to be slaughtered in the months coming up to their next election.  We must act now.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  many years ago in Quebec, there was a popular song about a doll that said no.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was pretty much what happened yesterday in the initial hours of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and Natural Resources as the Liberals  kept saying no to amendments from the Bloc Quebecois and the opposition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indifference of the Liberals was striking when we put forward our suggestions to improve Bill C-27 on the management of nuclear waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeatedly, they rejected the creation of a board of directors representative of the local community, including the aboriginal community, in order to ensure public confidence and add some credibility to the bill, which needs it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said no to  blocking the import of nuclear waste from other countries, no to including an environmental clause, and no to referring the recommendations of the new waste management organization to the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois has interesting proposals to make and the public has a right to know what they are.  The Liberal puppets with their “no, no, no, no, no, no” will not stop us.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Léger Marketing-<i>Le Devoir-The Globe and Mail</i> poll shows that support for sovereignty has dropped to 40.9%.  The CRIC poll places it at 39%.  Furthermore, 54% of Quebecers feel that sovereignty has had its day. And three out of five persons polled are no longer interested in a referendum between now and 2005, which is what the BQ and the PQ would like.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois was formed to promote the sovereignist option federally.  It would appear that their plan has failed.</p>

Did he know at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon that Canada 3000 was on the verge of shutting down, yes or no?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, that decision to shut down was taken last evening by the board of directors and was made official at midnight. Therefore, of course I did not know at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, there is a problem of confidence in the airlines among consumers. Personally I find that security is greater than ever and that is why I do have confidence flying, but many people are not flying because they do not see the government stepping up to the plate with increased training, with increased technology and with a commitment to air marshals. We do not see any commitment on any of this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will the government table the legislation that shows it will deal with these matters and that it will deal with the question of who is going to be funding the extra security? How much longer do we have to wait?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is typical for the Leader of the Opposition. Once he is knocked off his game plan he goes to plan B, which in this case is security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come back to the earlier issue because  he talked about the airline policy. I wish to remind him it was his party, his members, that supported the government on Bill C-26. We have all supported the policy that got us to a competitive state before  September 11 and I think the hon. member should not stand in this place and say the contrary.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians deserve the best in airline competition that we can possibly have but the transport minister is failing them.

In fact, my officials and my deputy minister have been in discussions with the privacy commissioner and his officials. We hope that in working together in a constructive fashion, we will be able to deal with his concerns.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that globally these are turbulent times.  Let us look at  what has happened in Canada since September 11. In the  month of October  unemployment went down in Canada.  We actually created 1,800 jobs.  The United States lost 415,000.  Our housing starts were up 12.7% in October and Canadians have record real disposable income.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a further question.  He brags about having paid down the debt.  The fact of the matter is that under this government's watch the net debt has gone up $39 billion since 1993.  It has not been responsible.  It had an opportunity during the good times of the last four or five years to reduce that debt and it did not do it nearly enough.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, that is just absolutely ridiculous.  We have been paying down our deficit through four successive surplus budgets.  Thirty-five billion dollars of debt has been paid down.  That is a huge saving in interest to Canadians.  We will continue to do that.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we took over, the record reached was 71% of GDP in terms of debt.  We were paying one-third of every tax dollar on the interest on that alone.  We are now down to 25%.  We are down to 50% of GDP in terms of our debt.  This is a record accomplishment.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the pine beetle is destroying forests in northern British Columbia. The Minister for International Trade has done his best to destroy the softwood lumber industry in the country as well as in British Columbia. The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has abdicated his responsibility for land claims to the provincial level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government did not value British Columbia when it was paying its way and making its  best contribution to the country. Now that British Columbia is in trouble, it has  been abandoned. Does anyone on that side have a plan for British Columbia?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  bill goes along with the coalition's position on approaches to international trade, international business and international agreements.  Certainly with recent events it is obvious  we are going to be broadening our international interests.  This type of treaty is important.</p>

The other is the prevention of evasion of taxes  by foreigners working in Canada.  I suspect the latter  was the real catalyst that brought this bill to fruition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the bill, but we would like to put some issues on the record about taxation.  The bill raises other issues.  In regard to competitiveness it tries to bring us into line with our international agreements and competitiveness, but there are other parts of our taxation system which leave us very non-competitive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first purpose of the bill is to remove barriers to cross-border trade and investment which is obviously in our interests as a trading country.  Canada is very dependent on trade and it is important to us for this reason.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is to ensure unintended consequences, which means  to not have tax evasion.  This is done through the bill in a number of ways.  It allows tax authorities to deal directly with each other to solve international transfer pricing issues, complete audits and engage in other discussions aimed at improving tax administration.  Mostly it opens the lines of communication and sharing of information, which raises some concerns which I will deal with in a second. Basically, we agree with this philosophy, but it does raise concerns that should be watched.  We must be careful and prudent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the Canada-Germany agreement, this is the only set of treaties that provides for mutual assistance in the collection of outstanding taxes.  We have other agreements with other major countries, including the United States and the Netherlands.  We tend not to have such agreements with smaller partners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts 1 to 7 of the bill  implement tax treaties with Slovenia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Senegal, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.  This is the first time that Canada has concluded a tax agreement with any of these states.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax treaties implemented by this bill reflect efforts to update and expand Canada's network of tax treaties, so as to have better access to information back and forth.  This will increase the ability of Canadian companies to invest and deal in these other countries through financial agreements, business agreements and treaties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some of the pros that we recognize. It goes along with a broader vision of international trade which the coalition and the Progressive Conservative Party have really established and led the way on with respect to free trade agreements.  We have been traditional leaders in reducing the taxes and trade barriers between countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is strong support for the bill in our party.  Income tax conventions have been signed with countries where a commonality of security and other linkages was sufficiently and traditionally entrenched.  In  that way there would be some confidence in their taxation systems and  they would mirror ours.  There would be  consistencies at least in the two systems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill primarily seeks to serve the best interests of Canadian investors and the Canadian government.  We support foreign trade.  The bill allows countries that are not fully developed to create quality jobs and allows us to export our abilities, technologies, services, money, traditions and  values.  All of those certainly hold a lot of appeal especially to smaller countries.  This will help us provide those services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's philosophy has always been to promote the economic progress of these countries.  The more the wealth is shared, the more jobs and the more opportunities there are  to educate the public.  Again, the more the wealth is shared, the more stresses and tensions between countries are reduced, with a resultant lowering in terrorism acts and all kinds of different manifestations of misunderstandings and hate.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more we  work with other countries the more we  understand each other by sharing cultures,  business, educational ties and health care ties to better the chances  of avoiding things like September 11 and the ongoing threats of terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have some disagreements with this proposal which  does not focus on the tax issues.  They focus on the human rights  records of some of the countries involved. We feel that  we should encourage countries to increase their focus on human rights  as part of these ongoing negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want to be seen endorsing countries that have bad  human rights records.  We could be perceived to be endorsing their policies by signing treaties with these countries.  We want to ensure that is not what we are doing.  We are signing business treaties and not endorsing human rights policies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are parts of the bill that we applaud.  The bill  was in fact referred not only to the Senate banking committee for the study of  tax conventions but  also d to the foreign affairs committee for the study of human rights aspects.  That was a good feature of the bill and we would support  future bills of this nature going through the same process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's influence has expanded into other countries around the world.  The tax department does not perform a full and complete country by country analysis of the acceptability of the taxation system and the procedures surrounding taxation   to determine what issues in those countries were receptive to such an agreement.  It goes back to the human rights issues and should be an integral part of the negotiation  process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue that concerned us was the privacy aspect.  There is a lot of information in our tax files on Canadian citizens.  If a double taxation agreement was in place the information could and often would get into the hands of other countries.  We want to ensure that our privacy laws and standards would apply to other countries that had access to our information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition supports the bill  and encourages it as a further step in the enhancement of Canada's international relationships.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier that the bill raises other aspects of competitiveness as far as taxation is concerned.  There are many ways in which Canada is not competitive in its tax regime.  The bill would attempt to bring  some tax aspects in line with other countries.  However it  does not address Canada's income tax rate, which is much higher than the average rate of  OECD countries, and many other aspects of our capital gains tax and other taxes that discourage competitiveness, investment and jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Kingdom, Germany, Norway and Sweden have adopted more aggressive tax cutting strategies than Canada with respect to capital gains.  Germany  reduced its capital gains tax by  50%, Great Britain by 75%, and Norway completely eliminated all forms of double taxation on capital income. The United States has an accommodating capital gains rate of approximately 20%. Last year Canada reduced the capital gains inclusion rate to 50% putting it closer to the U.S. level of 20%, but there is still a vast difference.  It discourages investment and people from withdrawing their funds from one investment and reinvesting in another way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition encourages the government to review taxation at all levels  to see if there are other ways to reduce taxes which would put Canada in line with other countries in the same way it is doing with Bill S-31.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am again pleased to participate  in debate in the House of Commons.  It has been a little over eight years since I was first elected with the class of 1993.  My hon. friend from Edmonton North used to tell us that we would probably wonder for a long time how we ever got here.  We also wonder from time to time how some of our colleagues ever got here.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been a very interesting time.  I feel particularly honoured and privileged to represent not only the people of Elk Island but  hopefully the views of Canadians across the country as we discuss various issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope in my short intervention that I will be able to get past the first letter in Bill S-31.  When I hear the letter S I think of various words. The letter S means that the bill originated in the Senate.  I pretty well take  every opportunity I can to put in a little barb in this regard. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member from the NDP  spoke about the Senate in his intervention.  That party has the erroneous idea that it would like to eliminate the Senate.  I would  like to retain and strengthen it.  I would like to see the Senate have a genuine democratic role to play  in parliament.  I wish its members were elected so they would have a high degree of respect and legitimacy in our parliamentary system  instead of being, as so many have said, a source of patronage appointments.  That is very unfortunate.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our colleagues in the Senate  probably work as hard as some of the lesser working MPs in this place, so we ought to be very careful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standing orders state that I am not supposed to say anything to denigrate any other member of parliament, including those in the Senate.  I am very careful not to do that.  However the fact that those individuals  are not elected is a flaw.  The bill is  diminished by the fact that it originates in the Senate and  that senators are not elected but are instead appointed at the will of the prime minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I  think of the letter S I also think of some other priorities that the government should have. Softwood lumber is an example of a high priority issue.  The conflict in this regard is costing people in British Columbia and Alberta jobs on an ongoing basis.  I would like to see our time in parliament spent on high priority items such as this one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue which is consuming Canadians and  North Americans these days is the issue of security.  I wish we would pay more attention in the House to the issue of security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of Shawinigate and the fact that there is not enough accountability in government.  I had a conversation with some people the other day from Alberta, not from my riding, about how we could make government more accountable.  We had a pretty good indepth discussion on this subject.  I said that one of the things we ought to do was to have more openness and public disclosure. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government expenditures are subject to  loose privacy laws.  If taxpayer money is being spent, taxpayers should be able to see what it is spent on. We want to guard people's privacy, but at the same time we must be aware of some of the mismanagement that has occurred in government not only under the watch of the present Liberal government but also under the watch of the previous government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be a much greater appetite for accountability if parliamentarians, cabinet ministers and bureaucrats knew that these things would become public, if not now, three  or five years down the road.  Disclosure is one of the things we all recognize as being an important feature. Other things  came to mind when I saw the letter S.  However I must move  past the first letter and get to Bill S-31 that is before us today.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not hesitate to compliment colleagues when  they do some really good work even if  they are not from my party. I listened intently and with great interest to the speech given by my Bloc colleague, the member for Saint-Hyacinthe--Bagot. I recommend to individuals who happen to be reading this part of today's record in <i>Hansard</i> 10 years from now  that they page back to that speech because it was an excellent one. I commend the member for it. He made many  interesting points that were relevant to the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a  great time  with the teachers this week  discussing parliament, democracy and how government works. One teacher asked me how  we get along with members of other parties.  I said that we treat them with  respect  as friends and  colleagues even though we may differ with their ideas.  We are  like a hockey team: When we are on the ice we fight like crazy but when we go to the restaurant after the game we are colleagues and friends.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would  say the same thing about the Bloc members even though  we disagree very strongly and emphatically with the main reason for their being here. They have softened their stance a little bit in the last couple of years but they want out of the country. I disagree profoundly with that concept but at the same time they are wonderful people and I respect them.   I have no hesitation giving an accolade to the member for Saint-Hyacinthe--Bagot for his  excellent speech earlier today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things  he talked about was the  taxation agreement.  He did not use the word tax avoidance, or at least it did not come through that way from the interpreters. The purpose of the bill  is to make agreements with   eight countries.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada  has two reasons for  making agreements with respect to taxation.The first reason is to avoid double taxation. It is not fair for people  to pay taxes in the country where their business operates or where they may have investment income and also in Canada and vice versa. Someone who is from another country who has business interests or investment interests, or somehow earns income here should not have to pay taxes on both. This would make it impossible because if we take federal, provincial  and property taxes into consideration, Canadians work approximately half  the time for the taxman. Our total cumulative tax rate is about 50%. This is underlined by organizations such as the Canadian Taxpayers Federation proclaiming June 30 as taxation freedom day. We work for the taxman from January to the end of June and for the rest of the year we  work for our families to provide for them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had two countries that had similar tax rates, 100% of everything that one earned would go to the taxman. Double taxation is something to be avoided. That is one of the purposes of the bill.  It would provide for agreements between Canada and the other countries so that only one country would tax the individual.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, exceptions. I do not know how many members have read the bill but it is a lengthy one.  There are many  different clauses in it that indicate a few exceptions where both countries could get a portion of the tax from earnings. I noticed one  interesting clause that dealt with certain pension income. </p>


	<A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget which country it was.  It may have been with all of them, but I did not have time to check the similar clause  for all  seven or eight different agreements with respect to certain pension income.  However I found it intriguing though, that with respect to certain pension income, the first $12,000 of income is considered tax free.  There is no  tax  on the first $12,000 of pension income from the other country.  When tax is paid on the amount over $12,000, lo and behold it is a single rate of 15%.  I feel sort of good about that because as members know we have tried to work on reducing the punishment of people who earn money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say that if a person earns twice as much, let them pay twice as much tax. However under the graduated system, a person who earns twice as much could pay five or eight times as much tax, depending how much of that proportion they are hitting before they have used up their basic exemption.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important for us to recognize that there is an important principle here, and I commend the government for utilizing that principle in this particular instance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could carry on at length about the bill. In principle, it is good because it solves the problem of double taxation for people who have business interests and who have earned income from more than one country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one of course is the issue of tax avoidance.  The actual preamble in the bill states that the purpose of it is to prevent fiscal evasion.  That is basically a case of doing what we have to do so that we do not have to pay taxes at all.  That is when Canada might think the person is being taxed in Slovenia and Slovenia thinks he or she is being taxed in Canada.  Without an agreement that is specific, it could be that the person gets away with being taxed no where.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion,  it is very important for us to have these tax agreements.  I would like to see them enlarged, as my hon. colleague from the Bloc stated, so that we do not have people avoiding taxes or  hugely reducing them by registering their companies in tax free havens and thereby avoiding their share of being part of the Canadian citizenry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be remiss if I did not really emphasize that.  We all know of some significant examples of individuals who have said taxes in Canada are too high and we agree with that.  However they have a mechanism to avoid the taxes by simply moving offshore.  We think that all citizens, including all members of parliament, should pay their fair share of taxes  to fund a very good government  that we should have, which would be one that spends   taxpayer dollars in a   careful way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my intention to vote in favour of Bill S-31.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in the House today to speak to the second reading for my bill, Bill C-329.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill seeks to repeal section 43 of the criminal code.  This section of  the criminal code that is not very well known to many Canadians, but it allows the use of force as a means of correcting or disciplining a child. I believe very strongly that this section flies in the face and is contrary to everything else about which we speak.   We  have policies which we promote in terms of upholding the rights and the well-being of children.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many other people have not only supported the bill but have really taken up the issue  of raising public consciousness about why the section needs to be repealed.  In fact one of the people I especially want to mention is a very active parenting advocate, Kathy Lynn from Vancouver, who has a program on positive parenting .  She has been a real leading light and strong advocate about the choices  we have as parents and what we need to do to  promote the health and well-being of children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to join with these organizations to move along and to urge the government to consider the issue seriously and the impact that section 43 has had.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that it is contrary to basic human rights.  I believe it is contrary to the rights of children that Canada is a signatory to through international convention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth noting that this section of the criminal code is actually very old.  It has been in our criminal code since 1892.  It is  based on English common law that did allow corporal punishment of wives, servants, apprentices and children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think everyone in the House  and every Canadian would agree, that absolutely it is unacceptable that people would  beat their wife or their spouse, their servant or their apprentice.  Those aspects of our criminal code have long since gone.  They have been done away with. However in 2001, the section that pertains to the use of force for correcting or disciplining a child still remains.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really an anomaly.  It is an archaic part of the criminal code that sanctions violence rather than penalizing the use of violence.  Not only does it violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, it  also violates the UN convention on the rights of the child in denying children the fundamental freedom of protection from acts of violence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason the section must be removed is that it is not just sitting there silently in the criminal code and somehow has no visible impact on what takes place in our society.  The reality is  section 43 has been used successfully as a defence in our court system by parents who have hit children with straps, belts, sticks and extension cords, causing bruises, welts and abrasions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put this in context,  research completed through the Canadian incidents study that showed that in 1998 there were 44,000 investigations of child physical abuse in Canada.  Sixty-eight per cent of physical abuse investigations were deemed to be inappropriate physical punishment. That is an absolutely serious issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we see that the section  creates an environment of sanctioning violence rather than prohibiting it, then   hopefully we will begin to see why the section must be removed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first came across the section and understood what was going on,  one of my concerns was that  it really put the government in a very conflicting position.</p>


	<A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the government has defended the maintenance of this section in the criminal code.  On the other hand, there have been numerous studies, some of them funded by the federal government, that show that corporal punishment is not effective in raising children.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995 a review funded by federal departments of health and justice found that corporal punishment was associated with increased levels of aggression, that it was a predicator of delinquency and violence and crime in later life and that it was a risk factor for child abuse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems one hand of government, in terms of studying the cause and effect of allowing physical violence against children, understands that the impacts and the consequences for children are severe both individually and for the interest of society as a whole. However the other hand of the government has not been prepared to move on the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen federal government sponsored reports over the past 20 years have recommended the repeal or reconsideration of section 43, yet the government has refused to act on those recommendations. I find that astonishing, </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the question, the major argument is that somehow the state does not have a right to intervene in  how parents raise or discipline their children.  Making decisions about discipline, how we teach our children a right from a wrong and how we help them develop self control, is certainly one of our greatest challenges   as parents and as a society.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent in the bill before us today is not to deny parents the right to discipline their children. That  is absolutely not the intent.  The purpose and the point of the bill is to say that this particular section does not belong in the criminal code.  There have been arguments to suggest that, if the section is repealed, somehow there will be a flood of criminal investigations and prosecutions and parents will be charged.  Again,   as Corinne Robertshaw said this morning, this is something of a red herring.  It is a smokescreen.  Police and prosecutors have discretion in laying and prosecuting charges.  It is very rare for minor breaches to be prosecuted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other argument I have heard against repealing section 43 is that sometimes educators or other persons, who are in positions of authority or substituting parents, say  they then will not have the ability to defend themselves or that they will not be able to use reasonable force to defend themselves.    Clearly  sections 34 to 41 of the criminal code allow the use of reasonable force for self-defence, defence of others, defence of property and prevention of trespass.  If there are concerns that the repeal of this section will somehow mean that teachers cannot properly defend themselves or use reasonable force,   there are other aspects of the criminal code that would allow that to happen.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the section has been the subject of legal challenge.  This past September a case went before the Ontario court of appeal.  Basically, the case was to have this aspect of the criminal code declared unconstitutional on the grounds that it was a legalized form of child abuse and therefore a violation of children's equality under the charter of rights and freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the decision was not positive in terms of repealing section 43, the justice who came down with the decision found evidence that spanking and corporal punishment was bad and that it was not a good thing to do.  In fact he urged parliament to consider amending or changing section 43 to provide parents, police and teachers with specific criteria of what sort of force was reasonable.  Clearly the courts, in considering this issue, have said it really belongs back within parliament and within government policy to sort this out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origin of the legal case is  very interesting.  Ailsa Watkinson, a social work professor at the University of Regina, began the court challenge in 1997 after a man who administered a spanking to his child in an Ontario parking lot was acquitted under section 43. That is really the clear evidence of how this section has been used in a way that undermines the health and well-being of children.</p>


	<A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the minutes remaining I want to  look at the international situation, because it is not just within Canada that we are dealing with this issue. There  is a debate going on.  There is information available to show that corporal punishment both in the home and at school is banned in nine European countries, including Austria, Croatia, Norway, Italy, Latvia, Denmark, Finland, Cyprus and Sweden.  Further, the countries of Italy, Germany, Bulgaria, Belgium and the Republic of Ireland are in the process of bringing forward legislation against the  physical or corporal punishment of  children.  Clearly there are a number of national jurisdictions considering this issue and recognizing that they need to be proactive and positive in terms of upholding the rights of children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of being at the press conference today and having worked on this issue for a number of years now, I really believe that this is an issue on which  the federal government must show some leadership.  There have been  a lot of studies done. There has been a lot of public debate.  There have been legal challenges.  I firmly believe that if the government is of the opinion that the international covenants on the rights of the child that have been signed by the government are to mean anything, then we must come to terms with the contradiction that exists in terms of section 43 and these other international conventions and all the studies that have been done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that in the interests of upholding protection for children and the well-being of children we should actually have a more fulsome debate on this matter.  It should go to committee, and today I certainly welcome hearing from other members of the House their opinions about this important issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, while I recognize that there are concerns from people about whether or not this is an interference in parenting rights, I   believe  there is an interest in society as a whole in making  sure that we support families,  that we support the health and well-being of children.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just hard to believe that this section in the criminal code is left over from 1892 when it was legally sanctioned that a man could beat his wife or servant or apprentice. It is left over from that period.  We now have  to come to terms with the contradictions that exist and we have to say that section 43 has no place in the criminal code.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we should focus on  is providing support,  information and help to parents who are facing challenges. We should tell parents that there are many alternative forms of corrective discipline, which  do not have to involve physical harm and physical force, and there are many programs and supports.  In fact, it is very important to get the information out there.  Parents do not have to rely on  beating  their child or  hitting their child to change behaviour in the long run or to somehow improve what that child is doing. Most parents who engage in that kind of discipline often regret it.  They often wish   they  had not done it. We have to reinforce that.  We have to work positively with parents.  That is a very important message that must come from the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the government to consider the bill and to consider that it needs to have further debate and discussion.  I ask the government   to back up its own studies,  to come through with the recommendations from its own studies and to make it clear that we should be removing section 43 of the criminal code.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to discuss and talk about Bill C-329, which proposes that  section 43 of the criminal code be repealed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say that as a government we agree with what the member just said a minute ago, that is,  we on this side of the House, like she articulated, consider our children to be paramount in terms of their protection, safety and security. That has certainly been the agenda of our government because, after all, they are our most precious resource, not only in our family units but for the nation as a whole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. members know, section 43 is currently the subject of a charter challenge. On July 5, 2000, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice dismissed an application brought by the Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law seeking a declaration that section 43 is unconstitutional. In its July 2000 decision the court upheld section 43 and held that this provision reflects a reasonable balance of the interests of children, parents, teachers and Canadian society in accordance with the charter. This judgment was appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal. The appeal was heard from September 10 to 12, 2001, and judgment was reserved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it would be inappropriate for me to speak in any detail about a case that is currently before the court in Ontario, I would like, however, to discuss a few important points. I think they have merit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to begin by confirming the government's commitment, as I said at the outset, to promoting and protecting the rights and interests of our children, but as the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held in its July 2000 judgment, children's rights and interests, including the issue of section 43, must be viewed in the larger context, which includes the responsibility and role of parents and the best interests of children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look, for example, to the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, to which Canada, as you know, Mr. Speaker, is a party, we see that the convention provides that children's best interests shall be primarily considered in actions concerning children. It also recognizes, however, the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents to provide appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise of these rights by the child. The convention acknowledges the family as a fundamental group of society responsible for the growth and well-being of children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's position in supporting section 43 reflects this balanced view of children's interests. Section 43 balances all societal interests concerning the raising of children in a healthy and safe social environment, that is, in the family, while respecting their constitutional rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly does section 43 say? I believe that there is a general misunderstanding of the purpose and ambit of section 43. Section 43 does not condone or authorize physical abuse of children. Equally important, it does not shield parents or teachers from interference by the state or guarantee freedom of parents to discipline children in any manner they see fit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 43 acts as a limited defence, for example, to the charge of assault. In this regard several key points must be emphasized. First,  the section applies only to a narrowly defined group of persons, namely a parent, teacher or person acting in the place of a parent and only in respect of a pupil or child under that person's care. Second, the force must be used for the purpose of correction. A person who uses force in a fit of rage or in order to hurt a child cannot claim a section 43 defence. Third and finally, the force used must be reasonable in the circumstances. The standard or test of reasonableness is one that is well understood and often applied within the Canadian criminal justice system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked to consider applying section 43 in any given case, a court typically looks at the nature of the child's behaviour or action calling for correction, the age of the child and the severity of the punishment, including any injuries suffered by the child in that circumstance. When determining whether the force used was reasonable, the standard the courts apply is the community standard of reasonableness found in Canada and not in the practices of the individual family, or the school, for that matter.</p>


	<A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is defending section 43 based on its belief that this section can be interpreted and applied in a constitutional manner which balances the interests of children, parents and Canadian society. Loving, well intentioned Canadian parents who engage in normative disciplinary conduct that is undertaken in a reasonable way and takes into account the needs and best interests of children should not be criminally charged for such conduct. Absent section 43, this would be precisely the result.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government recognizes, however, that parents should be provided with the tools necessary to help them raise their children. To this end I would note that the federal government, primarily through Health Canada, supports parental education materials, for example, that specifically advise against the use of physical punishment and support the use of alternative methods of child discipline.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very concerned, as are all Canadians, about instances of child abuse in our society. It is simply  unacceptable. We are also concerned about how best to protect vulnerable children in Canadian society, but in Canada protecting children from abuse is done through a number of measures of which criminal law is but one important measure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another such measure is provincial and territorial child protection legislation, which do not permit any form of child abuse. As a result, even if charges are not laid under the criminal code, child protection authorities can still intervene under provincial or territorial legislation where parental discipline is inappropriate or excessive. That is as it should be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government appreciates the objective of the bill as it is presented, namely the protection of our children, again, a very valuable resource, but we disagree that the bill would achieve this objective. It should come as no surprise to anyone that section 43 raises a divergence of opinion among  Canadians. It does so because it touches upon something very near and dear to our hearts, most particularly our children and how best to parent them. In our view, however, the government's balanced approach to this important issue is by far the better approach.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we weigh that all out I think we can see that the Government of Canada in taking this view is indeed taking into account the best interests of not only our children but their parents as well, and in so doing, by extension the broader Canadian society.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of conviction that I rise in the House today to speak to Bill C-329, a bill to repeal section 43 of the criminal code which states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child, as the case may be, who is under his care, if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's Annual Criminal Code 2001 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The persons who may rely upon this section are schoolteachers, parents or those standing in the place of a parent...This section authorizes the use of force only where it is by way of correction, that is, for the benefit of the education of the child.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in a time when people of all ages, walks of life and viewpoints are following the philosophy of looking out for number one.  That means they are concerned only with what is best, easiest or most beneficial for them.  It is not easy to train, teach and discipline a child in the right way but it is the responsibility of parents and teachers to do that very thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's Annual Criminal Code 2001  says the use of force is authorized when it is for correction to benefit the education of the child.  In this day and age we confuse ourselves by always trying to be politically correct.  Today it is politically correct to trumpet the rights of everyone from children to burrowing owls.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights are fine and good as long as we maintain a proper perspective.  I am for human rights, children's rights and parental rights.  I believe  parents have the right to the best means at their disposal to train their children the way they feel they should.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the Canadian Alliance nor I condone the abuse or neglect of children in any form.  However we believe parents are the ones primarily responsible for the training and disciplining of their children.  Children are not wards of the state.  They are the gifts of God to a set of parents to whom He has given the right and responsibility of parenthood.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not for the government to interfere with the exercise of parental rights or responsibilities.  Guidelines may be given. That has been done in section 43 of the criminal code.  To remove that section would be to revoke the God given right parents have to carry out the proper training and disciplining they desire.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protection is already provided in section 43 to ensure against physical abuse of the child.  It also protects the parent or teacher who needs to take physical measures to properly contribute to the education or training of the child.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people today are neglecting and abusing their children by failing to correct, discipline, teach and train them properly.  Some are afraid to take up the challenge for fear of damaging the poor child's self-esteem.  Many are afraid of being accused of abuse and seeing their child whisked away by some bleeding heart social worker.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are perhaps afraid because of recent Canadian incidents or other people's opinions but are totally frustrated by the difficulty of their own children.  They are unable to cope and so they yell, nag and verbally abuse their children.  This to me is a greater and more damaging way to abuse the child.  It is much harder on the child's self-esteem than properly administered and well timed corporal correction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children cannot be left to themselves.  They are not capable of making the proper decisions on their own.  They must be taught and directed to understand and know the right choices.  They must be taught honesty, work, kindness, respect and responsibility.</p>


	<A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What child has real self-esteem if he has never experienced the loving correction of a parent? What child has real self-esteem if he finds he can no longer read well enough to keep up with the rest of his class because his teachers were afraid to take disciplinary action?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children have the right to be given proper attention, teaching, training, correction and, yes, even discipline. Discipline is more than talking, yelling or complaining. Many parents mistakenly assume child discipline is simply instructing children by telling them what to do. Instruction is only part of the process. Instruction is  only what we say. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do plays a part. That is influence. It shows whether  parents are honest and respectful of themselves. It shows who they really are. Through it the image of who and what they are is revealed. One's influence and image may contradict what one says.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child is likely to follow the image and influence rather than the instruction of the parent. To learn to follow is the greater part of one's education. To learn to follow the right things requires the right discipline.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's Criminal Code 2001 states that section 43 of the criminal code:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--authorizes the use of force only where it is by way of correction, that is, for the benefit of the child.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To learn to follow a course of life that results in the positive aspects of personhood requires numerous course corrections as does an airliner's trip across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discipline is for the benefit of the child. It assists the child in making the course corrections known by the parent or teacher to be necessary. Discipline and correction are for the benefit of one's education. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Concise Oxford Dictionary</i>, ninth edition,  defines discipline as “mental, moral or physical training” or “adversity used to bring about such training”. It defines disciple which is of course the root word of discipline as “a follower or pupil of a leader or teacher”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were all made or created to learn mental, moral and physical lessons from physical consequences to our bodies. In Regina we learn to put on a coat in winter so our skin does not freeze when we step out the door. We learn not to eat little green apples or we will get a bellyache. We learn not to jump from the top of the apple tree lest we hurt ourselves. In other words, physical correction and discipline is a natural form of education and learning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diana Baumrind, a research psychologist at the University of California in Berkley, calls into question the current claim that any physical punishment is harmful to a child. She said in a recent study on the effects of corporal punishment:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We found no evidence for unique detrimental effects of normative physical punishment...I am not an advocate of spanking, but a blanket injunction against its use is not warranted by the evidence. It is reliance on physical punishment, not whether or not it is used at all, that is associated with harm to the child.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baumrind said that in the absence of compelling evidence of harm parental autonomy and family privacy should be protected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has already been mentioned, Ontario Superior Court Justice McCombs held up the constitutionality of corporal punishment in his recent ruling and said it was within the sphere of respectability and exceptionality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would we want to undo something as important and reasonable as that? I could never support such a limitation on the freedom of parents and the right of children to receive proper and lawful discipline from their parents and teachers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways to discipline. Every child is different. Corporal correction is not the first line of discipline. Of my four children three required almost no corporal discipline. However one of my children's needs was entirely different. I needed the option of section 43. I strongly oppose the repeal of section 43 of the criminal code. I find the idea oppressive and offensive.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not able to listen to all of the speech by the member for Vancouver East but I did listen to the latter part of it.

Section 43 clearly prohibits hitting and beating children. That is the point of the section. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  will take a moment to read section 43 of the criminal code as a few other speakers have done.  It reads:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child, as the case may be, who is under his care, if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quote should read “their care” rather than “his care.”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a lawyer nor do I pretend to be.  However it could be argued that without section 43 of the criminal code we would be prevented from using reasonable force to prevent children from seriously hurting themselves by, for example,  riding a bike off a cliff or running in front of a car.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such circumstances may require force.  This could seem unreasonable at the time but would be reasonable in that it may  prevent children from injuring or even killing themselves. That is not what this debate is about nor do I think it was the intent of the hon. member for Vancouver East. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have before us a subject which has been debated in other countries and other lands.  Some nations have chosen to move away from corporal punishment for children and have made it against the law.  Does that mean they are right and Canada is wrong?  I question that. Does it mean we should follow in their footsteps?  Not necessarily. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it mean we should engage in this debate?  Perhaps it is time we had this debate.  Perhaps it is time to look at the law as it is written.  Perhaps it is time we dust it off, look at its bare bones, expose it to the sunlight and decide if we want to keep it on the books.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think if we do that we will choose to keep the section on the books and allow parents the right to use force to discipline their children if it is deemed necessary.   In no way, shape or form does section 43 condone physically beating or hitting a child. It should not be interpreted or used that way.  It is not a defence for improper use of force.  It is a defence for correcting a child, not for beating or abusing a child.</p>


	<A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very end of section 43 states “if the force does not exceed what is reasonable”.  I suspect that would be up to a judge to interpret.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's society violence is not tolerated in the same way that it was a generation ago which  is a good thing.  Family violence is no longer tolerated at all.  Society's values have changed. Because of the good, tireless work by family and children's services throughout the nation, along with the intervention of the courts, increased protection for children is now offered. That increased protection is offered because it was required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no corporal punishment today in public schools. However, there remain instances where, after everything else has been tried, physical correction is necessary to stop dangerous behaviour, to  protect other children, protect society in general, or protect the very child whose behaviour is endangering themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 43 enables parents to do the best job possible of raising their children and gives them an option. It is not an option that most parents choose to take.  It is not an option that is abused on a continual basis.  The law very clearly prevents that abuse.  Parents can be charged. They can be taken to court and their children can be taken away from them. It protects the rights of parents in accordance with their particular moral and religious beliefs. It reflects their personal knowledge of the unique characteristics of their own children, of how best to discipline their children, through knowledge gained from their parents and their own experiences during childhood.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be understood that this does not condone corporal punishment.  This says that corporal punishment is one way of disciplining a child.  Certainly for myself, my friends and my peers it is absolutely the method of last resort. I do not think we say that enough.  People do not get up in the morning thinking of how they are going to punish their children.  People react to circumstances.  When circumstances require corporal punishment, I do not think the state can intervene if the force used is not excessive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current law, parents are allowed to use physical correction to discipline their children as long as it is not abusive and is reasonable under the circumstances. Before the implementation of section 43, there was no law placing limits on physical correction. This is an important point. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 43 does exactly that.  It places limits on physical correction. Without question, those  limits are needed. There were no government agencies at that time to protect children from abuse.  Section 43 was implemented to protect children from abuse.  It was well conceived.  Even though it may be 100 years old, it continues to serve its purpose today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are critics of section 43. Some children's rights advocates want section 43 declared by the courts to be in violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  I understand there is a case before the courts now and a decision will be brought down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implications of this effort are that the state is directly interfering with good and loving parents who believe there are circumstances where the most responsible means of discipline is judicious physical correction.  This would make those individuals criminals under the law.  I do not think that is what the Parliament of Canada is about.  I do not think that is what we want to do.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we engage in this debate?  Absolutely.  I have no difficulty in doing that.  We should expose section 43 to the full light of day and at the same time recognize its positive aspects  and look at some of the negative aspects of section 43.  Is it time to update the law?  Perhaps it is.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn particularly to the member for Windsor--St. Clair because if push comes to shove, if I could use that expression, he will have the floor. If the members would agree to each take five minutes, the Chair is disposed to splitting the last 10 minutes between the two gentlemen.

	Mr. Speaker, I am happy to share my time because it will produce some additional points on the debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit I was driven to speak to this matter because of the member from the Bloc who spoke earlier. On personal and professional levels, I have had a great deal of experience in dealing with section 43 and the whole issue of discipline and child abuse. I want to say to the House that if we go back in history and look at where this came from, it is the spare the rod, spoil the child theory. It came out of Roman law, even before Julius Caesar.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my friend from Vancouver has said, it was incorporated into the English common law. It adopted the same type of theory which at that time allowed for the intentional physical application of force to another individual, to put it in a technical lawyerly way. It allowed men to beat their spouses, their servants and their children. My friend from the coalition raised the point that this section is 100 years old and maybe it is time to take another look at it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section was brought in at that time  because of the very serious abuse that was going on. There were no restrictions on that abuse. Until the end of the last century, one could literally get away with the murder of one's children in the common law system. We badly needed the section.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am suggesting that today, a century later, we are at one of those milestones in our development as a human race. I do believe the human race does evolve and develop. We are at one of those periods  as a society when we have to look with experience at section 43 and  how we treat our children and say that we have evolved. It is time to say to parents that no matter what their religious persuasions are, no matter what their philosophical underpinnings are as to how they raise their children, they no longer can apply intentional physical force to their children. We have evolved as a society to the stage where we can deal with our children and raise them as good citizens of Canada and of the world without the use of intentional physical force.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard the argument from the member from the coalition of what to do in a situation where they are out of control. We are not applying physical force to stop them. We are applying restraints but we are not there to punish them with the use of physical force. There are ways of doing that in the existing criminal law system. In several ways it allows us to do that without using  section 43. That argument does not amount to a valid advocacy position in terms of retaining section 43.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at the experience of section 43. My colleague from Vancouver referred to a couple of cases. I have to say to her that those cases were mild. I practised in this area fairly extensively earlier in my career. I think of some of the cases that I reviewed and was involved in where section 43 was used to defend people who by any standards were abusive. That is why it is important that the bill  go for further review, discussion and debate. If those cases came forward and we looked at the way the section has been applied at various times, and not all times by any means, to defend people and justify their conduct successfully, I believe the House would be shocked.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I  thank my NDP friend  who  has so graciously  agreed to split his time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few things I need to add  to the debate. I  listened  very carefully to the member for Vancouver East and  I agree 100% with  her commitment to protecting children.  I would even add that we, as parents and teachers, should have a genuine love for the long term well-being of children as they are growing up, otherwise  we are disqualified from the position.  I am speaking specifically here of teachers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a youngster  I remember that our teacher had a strap in her desk.  It was a hunk of a belt.  I am   also proud to say that I went through my entire schooling without ever having had the belt  applied to me.  Just knowing that it was there was more than sufficient to  guide my behaviour where perhaps there might have been a lapse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also confess  that  my own beloved dad applied  the rod of correction twice, that I can remember, to the seat of understanding.  In both instances, and I have clear recollections of this many years later, he explained to me that I had erred and that he was doing this  to help me to become a responsible, decent person  and to not show disrespect.  In one case it was disrespect for a teacher and in  the other case it was misbehaving in church, believe it or not.  I was disturbing  people around me so my dad took me out and  explained to me that it was his duty to do this   or I would not turn out to be a good kid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, despite the fact I  received two spankings, not whippings or beatings, delivered by a loving parent in a rational way, I believe I have a well rounded personality.       Members can take   that two ways if they so choose.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it abhorrent  to think that in this parliament we would consider taking a parent like my dad and saying that he was guilty of a criminal sanction because of his excessive love for me and wanting to correct me.  I cannot believe we would contemplate that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I underline that the abuse or beating  of children is wrong.    I believe that anyone, be it a parent, a teacher or  anyone else, who abuses a child should not be allowed to hide behind section 43 of the criminal code.  There is no  judge in the land who would let a person  get away with that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of the long term effect.  What do we do with   a youngster in grade two or  three who is using excessively bad language in the schoolyard?  We can talk to the youngster and try to persuade him or her not to continue but  eventually  we must stop the behaviour. Although I was not involved directly, I have seen a  situation where other parents were saying that they did not want that youngster to be teaching  their children bad language.  This was in grade two. How do we correct the behaviour if we cannot persuade the youngster?  A good, gentle and loving spanking, at the same time as a good clear explanation of what it is for, could retract that behaviour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless people are socialized properly and they learn to live with each other in kindness and consideration we will have youngsters growing up on the other end of the spectrum.  We will then have to deal the ultimate sanction to them which is to take away their freedom.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the saddest times I have had since becoming a member of parliament was visiting the youth detention centre in my area.  I saw 12, 13 and 14 year olds in detention because they had assaulted someone in the schoolyard with a knife.   Whatever we can do to train them and to train them properly is good in the long term.  I would much rather have my children get a good, careful, and loving spanking than have to  visit them in jail.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank members of the House who have participated in the debate.  I think we would all agree it was actually a very interesting debate. Certainly diverse viewpoints were  put forward.   I welcome that because as other members have pointed out it is important that we debate the issue even if there is disagreement.  The debate in public is important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened carefully to the points that have been made. Beginning with those of the member for Elk Island, I think it is really somewhat misrepresentative to suggest that if section 43 were repealed it would mean that every parent who then strikes or slaps a child  would be criminally charged.  I am not sure if he was present for the beginning of the debate, but that is just simply not the case.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with section 43 is that, first,    in an overall sense it condones the use of force as a means of correction and discipline and I think that is a negative message to send out.  Second, and more critically, it has successfully been used as a defence, as was so well pointed out by my colleague, the member for Windsor--St. Clair,   when  clearly physical correction has gone too far.  Removing the section would make sure that does not take place in the future.  In fact, I note that the member for South Shore who spoke for the PC/DRC   admitted himself that there have been abuses of children through physical correction. However, he then  went on to say that is okay because somehow the courts will protect children.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this gets at one of the contradictions we are dealing with. Some of the organizations I have been working with, in particular the National Youth In Care Network, are made up of young people who actually have been placed in foster care under our child protection agencies.  The network is clearly opposed to section 43 and wants  to see it repealed. It has  pointed out  that the use of physical force as a discipline method can lead to abuse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The network states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> It is a common report of youth in care who are child abuse survivors that serious physical abuse escalated out of  “discipline” methods such as spanking.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, states the network, and again  this is where I  feel there is a contradiction in terms of what we believe is really taking place here,    in actual fact section 43 can impede the work of child protection agencies.  It states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The “discipline excuse” that is created by Section 43 obscures child abuse investigations, making it very difficult for police and child protection workers to make a legal distinction between abuse and discipline.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to what remains in the criminal code,  I think we have to be very careful about what  we are advocating.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say in response to the comments from the member for Regina--Lumsden--Lake Centre that this debate is not about being politically correct. To suggest that this is about political correctness to trumpet the rights of children is really quite offensive and does not  do justice to the seriousness of what is before us.  Nor is it about bleeding heart social workers.  I think this kind of rhetoric really divides people.  This debate is   about the well-being and health of children. I absolutely agree and acknowledge that there is a right and a responsibility of parents to raise their children and to discipline their children.  What we are talking about today, though, is whether or not this  section has allowed an environment to be created which allows physical abuse to take place.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government member said it was important that we have a balance.  I guess life is about a lot of balances, but I do believe that in our society there is one very important balance and that is the right to protect our children, both as parents and as  society as a whole.  I think there is growing evidence to show that this section has actually harmed children.  I believe we should continue the debate.  There are important things to look at  and consider.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would like to thank those who participated and  the groups who have done so much work  to repeal section 43.  I know that their work will continue.   I would like to seek the unanimous consent of the House to have this go forward to committee for further debate.</p>
