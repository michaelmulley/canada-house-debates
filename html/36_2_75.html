Speaker, I have the honour to present two petitions this morning. 
The first is with respect to the issue of economic sanctions on 
Iraq.  It is signed by residents of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners note that the sanctions have resulted in serious 
shortages of food, clean water and medicine; that water and 
sanitation systems have collapsed spreading disease; that there 
have been over one million fatalities according to United Nations 
estimates, mainly children under the age of five; and that 
sanctions, even under the oil for food program, continue to cause 
the deaths of approximately 250 people each and every day 
according to UNICEF. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the petitioners call upon parliament to end all 
Canadian support, including military personnel and equipment now 
involved in the blockade of Iraq, and to ensure that the Canadian 
government use effective diplomatic pressure to urge the UN to 
end the economic sanctions against Iraq.

as well as others in British Columbia, on the issue of religious 
freedom in China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners note that Falun Gong is a traditional Chinese 
Qi-gong practice for physical and mental health, the 
practitioners being guided by the principles of truthfulness, 
compassion and tolerance, striving to become better people and 
responsible citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They note as well that the Chinese government has conducted a 
campaign against Falun Gong and its founder.  They set out some 
very serious concerns about abuses taking place with respect to 
Falun Gong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, they appeal to parliament to strongly urge the Chinese 
government to release all arrested Falun Dafa practitioners in 
China immediately, to lift the ban of Falun Gong practice, to 
withdraw the international arrest warrant for Mr. Li Hongzhi, and 
to begin a peaceful resolution through open dialogue.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>USE OF PROPS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, right after the voting, my colleague, the 
whip of the New Democratic Party, raised a point of order about 
my friend from Calgary West who, when rising to vote, held up 
sign which had a message on it.  In terms of the rules of the 
House of Commons, that is not really appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the whip of our party wanted to do, was to 
have you rule on whether or not that was appropriate, or whether 
or not that vote should be counted and what the future behaviour 
should be in the House.  If that is permitted for one member, 
then other members should feel free to do the same thing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, no more loan guarantees.  I opposed the bill.  I wanted 
everyone to know why I opposed it.  I am sure there are some 
value differences among myself and members of the New Democratic 
Party.  If I had been holding up a sign which said soak the rich, 
it probably would have been something the NDP would have been 
okay with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is sufficient demand for the ships to be 
built.  Therefore, the loan guarantees would make little economic 
sense.  It is not my fault that there are politics when it comes 
to right and left, but in economics there is right and there is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair regards the using of props 
in the House with the utmost seriousness.  It has been consistent 
practice in the House for many years to enforce the rule that 
members may not use props.  Occasionally, members are able to get 
away with it because either it is not noticed or sometimes the 
member uses it before the Chair can intervene, not realizing it 
is about to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say to the hon. member for Calgary West, who gave what I 
regard as a wholly insufficient explanation of his conduct, that 
this problem has arisen before.  When I have personally been in 
the chair I have had to deal with the fact that he has held up 
signs, in particular during the course of voting in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member and all hon. members know, points of order 
are generally not permitted during voting.  It is for that reason 
that the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst was not permitted to 
pursue the matter last evening.   When the voting was complete, 
the hon. member for Calgary West had left the House, so I 
directed the matter to stand over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night was the second time I personally warned the hon. 
member and I know that one of the other occupants of the chair 
has had this difficulty.  It is not something which the Chair can 
lightly tolerate because if one member, as the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle has said, can hold up a sign, so can other 
members.  In my view, it is entirely inappropriate and out of 
place in the House.  We are here to carry on a legislative 
function, not an advertising function.  If the hon. member wishes 
to make his views known on a bill, he can do so by participating 
in debate, by making a speech or by putting a question or making 
a comment on another hon. member's speech.  I invite him to do 
that if he wishes his views to be known.  Or, better still, he 
could put it in his householder, which he is allowed to do four 
times a year in his constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair will say that if members persist in using signs during 
voting or some other demonstration of that kind which is 
inappropriate in the House, the Chair will have no reluctance in 
directing the clerk to strike the hon. member's name from the 
list of those who have voted and continue to strike it if the 
conduct persists and, if necessary, take further measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that it will not be necessary to revisit this issue.  In 
the Chair's view, it is entirely inappropriate.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SECOND READING AND CONCURRENCE IN SENATE AMENDMENTS 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 14 consideration of the motion 
in relation to the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-6, an 
act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting 
personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in 
certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic 
means to communicate or record information or transactions and by 
amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act 
and the Statute Revision Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  Discussions have taken 
place between all parties and pursuant to Standing Order 45(7), I 
believe you would find consent for the following motion.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK38">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That at the conclusion of today's debate on the consideration of 
Senate amendments to Bill C-6, all recorded divisions to dispose 
of the said motion be deemed requested and deferred until the end 
of Government Orders on Tuesday, April 4. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the chief whip have unanimous 
consent of the House to move this motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to say a few words about Bill C-6 dealing with 
electronic commerce that is before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know the bill we are dealing with today has already 
passed third reading in the House of Commons and our party voted 
in favour of it at third reading stage.  We think it is the right 
way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is supported by a number of consumer groups and by a 
number of other groups and agencies around the country, such as 
the B.C. Civil Liberties Association and so on.  It is a bill 
that is seen as going in the right direction. It sets out a legal 
framework for electronic commerce, commerce on the Internet, 
commerce online in this country and it deals with such issues as 
privacy and security for individuals who are dealing on the 
Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this bill is back again before the House is because 
the Senate has dealt with this particular legislation and has 
submitted amendments to the bill, in particular one dealing with 
medical records.  This amendment is actually a good amendment 
that we support in terms of medical records being part of this 
legislation.  That is the right way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that very difficult to say because I do not think in 
principle that the Senate should be amending any legislation that 
comes out of the House of Commons for the very simple reason that 
the Senate is not elected, it is not democratic and it is not 
accountable to anyone.  The Senate is an appointed body made up 
of cronies and friends of the Prime Minister of Canada. 
Therefore, I do not feel very comfortable supporting anything 
that the Senate has done, even if it is a good amendment to this 
bill.  I know, Mr. Speaker, that you feel the same way because 
you are a true Democrat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very unfortunate that we have in this country a 
legislative body that is not elected, a legislative body that is 
appointed and a legislative body that will spend $60 million in 
the next fiscal year and not be accountable to anyone in the 
country, in the House or anywhere as to how it will spend that 
money.  It was with those caveats and those reservations that I 
rose to support this amendment that is before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After seven years in office, the Liberal Party, which at one 
time was very critical of an unelected Senate, is now very silent 
on the Senate.  Every time the Senate wants an increase in its 
estimates, the Liberals just get up and support the estimates of 
the Senate.  I see the member for Saint Boniface who is a cabinet 
minister.  I am sure that at one time he would have stood up and 
complained about a legislative body in this country that is 
appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate is not an ordinary commission like the Canadian Wheat 
Board, the CRTC, the Canadian Transportation Commission or what 
have you.  It is a legislative body that can make legislative 
change without accountability.  It is a throw back to the last 
century, a throw back to the old British system, a system we 
should be getting rid of by abolishing the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think my good friend from Calgary West will probably rise in 
this debate a few minutes from now and say many similar things 
about the Senate and about it initiating amendments and 
legislation.  Maybe the member for Saskatoon-Humboldt will do the 
same thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to those speeches.  I see that they are getting 
edgy and agitated. They are ready to get to their feet to say a 
few words about the legislation before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, we support the amendment and we support the 
bill.  Electronic commerce is becoming a more important part of 
our country and the world.  We have evolved from an agricultural 
society into an industrial society. We are now in the so-called 
post-industrial society, or the technical age, the online age, 
the digital age, however one wants to put it, and it is growing 
by leaps and bounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently it is still only a very small part of our economy. 
Online commerce is estimated to result in the sale of goods and 
services of about $3 billion in the year 2000. That is less than 
1% of the $600 billion of goods and services that will be 
purchased by Canadian consumers in 2000. That is a small amount 
proportionately but that amount is going to grow very rapidly in 
the days, weeks and years ahead. It is very important to have 
legislation that deals with electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am sure you would be very interested in that the 
first province to pass legislation to deal with electronic 
commerce was Saskatchewan.  The justice minister, Chris Axworthy 
dealt with it.  When Mr. Axworthy was a member of the House of 
Commons he sat right behind the member from Burnaby and I.  He 
was very concerned about electronic commerce, about protecting 
privacy and providing security for people who used the Internet 
for the purchase of goods and services.  He has become the first 
minister to introduce legislation that passed a legislative body. 
Once again it is another first for the Government of 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When looking at electronic commerce one is reminded that the 
world is getting smaller.  Indeed we are living in a global 
society.  The time has come to not only deal with security and 
privacy issues around electronic commerce but also to deal with a 
new vision about the global society we are now living in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing which is obvious is that commerce has become 
globalized.  Big corporations and companies have globalized.  On 
the other side of the ledger a lot of the people's organizations 
have not globalized.  For example there are no international 
standards for the environment, labour issues or social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the world of tomorrow many of the things that used to be done 
by the nation-state are going to be done at the international 
level.  That is something which is very important.  I am sure the 
member for Calgary West would like to say a few words about that 
when he rises to speak in a few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the whole issue of the Tobin tax. This House 
made a step in the right direction a year ago March 23 when it 
endorsed by a vote of 164 to 83 the idea of a so-called Tobin 
tax.  This is a small tax on the speculation of currency in order 
to bring some order to currency rates and values around the 
world.  The proceeds would be used to build up a development fund 
to help the third world, to help clean up the environment, to 
help get rid of land mines and to do other useful things for 
human beings around the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was overwhelming support in that vote.  It was my private 
member's motion that the House voted on.  There was overwhelming 
support from the government, from all the NDP members present, 
from one of the Conservatives, from a couple of Reformers and 
about a dozen or so members of the Bloc Quebecois.  Even though 
the motion was opposed overwhelmingly by the Reformers and the 
Conservatives it still had supporters in the Reform Party and the 
Conservative Party.  It shows that it is a growing issue around 
the world, that we have to bring some order and some regulation 
to the international marketplace on behalf of the common good 
globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that parliament has expressed itself, it is important that 
the Minister of Finance, the Prime Minister and other ministers 
and members of parliament in international forums express and 
advocate the will of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure as true democrats even members of the Reform Party who 
talk about reflecting grassroots and reflecting the people of 
this country, when they talk internationally would advocate the 
will of parliament and advocate the Tobin tax. 
I look forward to hearing the member for Calgary West tell us how 
he has been advocating the Tobin tax or a small tax on the 
speculation of international currency, as he talks to people 
around the world.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the expression and the will of parliament.  This body 
spoke overwhelmingly by a margin of two to one that we needed a 
small tax on currency speculation.  Maybe it will be 0.1% or a $1 
per $1,000 to cool down the hot money around the world and to 
develop an international fund to help deal with some of the 
important development issues we are faced with around the globe 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the issues of the tomorrow.  These are the issues we 
are going to have to deal with.  These are the issues the 
churches around the world are concerned with.  These are the 
issues young people are concerned with.  These issues are going 
to have to be solved if we are going to have a globe where people 
live in harmony and peace. These are reasons the bill before the 
House is a positive one and one that is on the right foot and 
which is going in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the leadership on this issue came from the 
Saskatchewan government.  It was the first legislature in the 
country to pass a bill providing a legal framework for electronic 
commerce.  That will be followed very closely by the House of 
Commons passing a bill to protect the privacy and security of 
people who use electronic commerce. Let us use this debate to get 
into other international issues that are important for the 
development of humankind. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I could not help but notice that the hon. member made 
reference to the fact that the bill has been amended by the 
unelected and appointed Senate.  It is a Senate that the Prime 
Minister made references to in his 1990 leadership bid.  He said 
he would do what he could to change the Senate.  He said he 
wanted to see an elected Senate too.  He even said it in Calgary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Alberta will have a resignation of a Senate seat 
on March 31.  Bert Brown received more votes than any other 
federal politician in Canadian history and was duly elected by 
the people of Alberta in the second ever Senate election in the 
country.  I wonder if the hon. member figures that Bert Brown 
would like to receive his seat in the Senate pending this whole 
vote.  What exactly are the hon. member's thoughts on this whole 
idea of an unelected appointed chamber that is totally out of 
touch with what everyday Canadians want? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member and I have tried to draw representatives before 
the procedure and House affairs committee to hold the Senate 
accountable for its egregious increases which are well above and 
beyond the public service, the Government of Canada, the 
parliament and the House of Commons.  I would like his 
perspective on the egregious spending with regard to the Senate 
and its total lack of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with 
the member for Calgary West that there has been reckless spending 
in terms of the other house.  I do not have my estimates with me 
but my recollection is its estimates for the coming year will see 
the Senate budget go up by 21% or 25%.  That is much higher than 
any other government department or agency I am aware of.  It does 
this without being accountable to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year of so ago a few of us, including the member who just 
spoke, tried to get the chair of the Senate internal economy 
committee to come before the relevant House of Commons committee 
to justify its estimates.  After all, departments such as 
agriculture, industry, HRDC or whatever have to.  Of course, the 
senator refused.  He said they were not accountable to anybody in 
the House of Commons.  It is not right or proper that the Senate 
can get this increase in funding without being accountable.  I 
agree with the member on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the member and I disagree is that the member wants to 
reform and elect the Senate and I want to abolish the Senate. 
Public opinion today is split roughly 50:50 between those who 
want to abolish the Senate and those who want to reform it. 
That debate should continue. In the last few years public opinion 
has been shifting more and more toward the abolition side after 
having gone toward the reform side before.  It is a debate well 
worth pursuing.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing we do agree on is that the existing Senate should 
go.  All the polling I have seen shows that about 5% of the 
people in the country support the existing Senate.  Five per cent 
would be the senators, their families, a few friends, a few 
others and not many more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked me about Bert Brown.  I am sure Bert Brown 
would like to take a seat in the Senate.  Why would he not?  But 
that is the wrong way to go because I do not think the place 
should be reformed and elected.  It should be abolished. I am 
also concerned about the Alberta solution, about the provincial 
government having elections for the Senate under the present 
powers and composition of the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, New Brunswick has ten senators and Alberta and B.C. 
have only six each. If we started electing senators under the 
present structure and representation in the Senate, what would 
happen if Ontario and Quebec started to do the same thing?  They 
each have 24 senators.  All of a sudden we would be locked into a 
Senate that is legitimate because its members are elected and 
Ontario would have 24 senators and Alberta, Saskatchewan, B.C. 
and Manitoba would have only six each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have a very unfair Senate locked permanently into our 
structure.  That Senate would be elected. Therefore it would be 
more difficult to change and more difficult to get rid of it 
because it would have been legitimized by virtue that those 
people were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we followed the Alberta solution the existing Senate powers 
would also be legitimized.  Most people do not realize that the 
Senate has almost as many powers as the House of Commons under 
the constitution.  It does not use them because senators are 
appointed and are not legitimate. If we were to elect them under 
the present powers we would have two very strong Houses.  We 
would invite gridlock between the two Houses.  Also the Senate 
would be very unequal in terms of its representation in that New 
Brunswick with about 600,000 people gets ten senators and British 
Columbia with three million plus people gets only six senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect, that is the danger of what Mr. Klein is doing in 
Alberta in trying to elect senators under the present 
representation and the present powers.  That is almost anti 
Saskatchewan, anti Albertan in nature because of the population 
shifts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was interested in hearing the member opposite speak 
about Bill C-6 and its importance and the kind of information 
protection that is available as a result of the leadership shown 
by our government in this all important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to remind him in case he did not know, because I heard 
him go on at length, he and the member opposite from the party 
whose name I forget right now, I think it is the alliance and 
before that it was CCRAP and before that it was the Reform Party, 
were going on with respect to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
For the benefit of the member opposite, we are the Canadian 
Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is quite correct. The 
party is known as the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand that is so at 
this point in time.  I guess we will see what the courts say with 
respect to Mr. Kingsley's ruling as well as the higher court.  We 
will see where that goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event I wanted to point out on this very important bill 
that the Senate plays a very important role.  It has a 
recommendation where the health sector will be exempted somewhat 
for the next little while. Instead of kicking in on January 2001, 
because of the Senate's position, the health sector will comply a 
year later than that.  As chairman of the all-party health 
committee I can say this is very important.  It is most important 
that the Senate would play such a useful role in this very 
interesting debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found most interesting that the member for Calgary West in his 
comments talked about the Senate.  I remember not so long ago 
that the party opposite, whatever its name is, said it would 
bring a fresh start to parliament.  They are the people who 
during— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member continues to attempt to make points but the 
Speaker of the House has indicated that in this Chamber our party 
will be known as the Canadian Alliance.  I would expect that kind 
of respect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure the hon. member is trying 
to be respectful, but perhaps he is confused.  The hon. member 
for Waterloo—Wellington knows this is the Canadian Alliance and 
I know he will try to remember to use that name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same 
point of order.  Would it be in order for you to ask the member 
if in fact he does know that we are the Canadian Alliance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is not for the Speaker to ask 
questions.  I think the point has been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington to be brief 
because we have to give some time to the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle to reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can assure you and all 
Canadians that it is not I who is confused but those members 
opposite.  They do not seem to know quite where they are going on 
this important matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member opposite is still alleging that he does not 
know the name of our party and, as a result, says that he is 
confused.  I think that you need to straighten him out one more 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member has done that 
very nicely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, they are certainly 
thin-skinned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary West was part of the nonsense when 
Senator Thompson was in Mexico.  They marched with sombreros in 
these hallowed halls of parliament, with burrito juice and all 
manner of things running on to the floor of this great democracy. 
He was part of that.   He was part of denigrating this great 
Parliament of Canada.  This is from the people who were going to 
bring a fresh start, a new way of doing business to parliament. 
It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the leader from Calgary Southwest when we voted on 
Nisga'a and when we voted on the clarity bill?  He was on the 
beaches of Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I know the hon. 
member is trying to be helpful, but the comments and questions 
are to be directed to the speech of the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle, who was not part of that march.  The comments 
seem to be going around a bit.  Perhaps we could have a quick 
question and then a quick response from the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the hon. 
member of the NDP this.  He talked about the Senate.  Did he 
agree with the member for Calgary West, who, when Senator Keon 
from the heart institute found himself in a little trouble, 
demanded the resignation of Senator Keon?  I was at the heart 
institute not so long ago as the chair of the Standing Committee 
on Health.  Did the hon. member agree with that member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to ask him whether he agrees with me that those 
people opposite were strangely silent when their own member from 
Crowfoot found himself in some trouble.  Why is it that those 
people opposite would be silent on one— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the question has gone on long 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I could try to 
respond to the member across the way, I do not comment on 
individuals in the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member from 
Regina—Qu'Appelle has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I did not comment on 
Senator Keon.  He is a brilliant heart surgeon.  I do not attack 
individuals in terms of their personal performance in either 
place.  What I attack is the fact that we have an institution 
which is not elected, not democratic and not accountable to the 
people of this country, which is the institution of the Senate. 
I wish the hon. member would join us in that crusade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 95% of the people of the country do not support the 
existing Senate.  He should ask his constituents how they feel 
about it.  They would tell him in no uncertain terms that they do 
not support the unelected Senate down the hall.  It is not a 
democratic body.  If he was reflecting the views of the people of 
Welland he would say that in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge him to go out on the main street of Welland and ask 
the first 10 people he sees whether they support the existing 
unelected Senate.  I would be surprised if anybody said yes. 
They either want the Senate to be abolished or they want the 
Senate to be reformed.  They do not support the existing house. 
The member should know that if he is in touch with his own

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to discuss the amendments to Bill C-6, 
the electronic commerce legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is significant opportunity facing Canadians at this 
juncture as we look forward to a brave new century.  In my 
opinion we will see the greatest levels of opportunities 
available to Canadians in this bold new interconnected world that 
we have ever seen.  The changes occurring globally, in terms of 
technological advances relative to the Internet, will rival those 
of any technological developments in the history of mankind. 
They will make other technological developments, including the 
railway, the airplane and even the telephone, pale in comparison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the types of challenges and opportunities that we face 
as individuals in Canada, which is increasingly a very connected 
country.  It is a connected country largely based on the 
interests and innovation of individual Canadians and, in many 
ways, despite the continued malaise, inattention and efforts by 
the government to hinder and impede technological adaptation and 
opportunity for Canadians with new vehicles such as the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was appalled at the recent national Liberal convention, which 
I attended as an observer for my party.  I also was a commentator 
for CBC and CTV.  I was there for the weekend and I felt a bit 
like an undercover rabbi at a PLO conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an interesting experience, to say the least, but the fact 
is that what I learned disappointed me about the leadership of 
the Liberal Party at this time.  Frankly, I had expected that the 
Prime Minister would have had a better idea of where the world 
was going in terms of some of these new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday night the leader of the Liberal Party, the Prime 
Minister— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wonder if the hon. member could tell us the relevance of this 
matter to the bill before the House.  He is talking about a party 
convention that he, no doubt, was very pleased to attend, but 
what relevance does that have to the business which is before the 
House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member is 
quite correct.  When I took the chair I had to ask the Deputy 
Speaker what we were debating because none of the debate seemed 
to be relevant to the bill at hand.  Therefore, I would ask hon. 
members to concern themselves with the relevancy of their words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his typically erudite suggestion that I get to the point on 
this issue, and I shall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I was making was that on the Friday night of the 
convention the Prime Minister of Canada referred to this brave 
new economy in a way which disturbed me.  He referred to 
e-commerce as a problem.  He said that we have to deal with the 
problem of e-commerce; not as an opportunity, but as a problem; 
not in terms of how the Government of Canada can enable Canadians 
to access the levers of this brave new world and this brave new 
economy, but how we can deal with the problem of e-commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation, to a certain extent, indicates that the 
government is in fact more capable of dealing with regulations 
and their implementation than it is with the other part of 
e-commerce, and that is dealing with its opportunities and 
reducing the intrinsic impediments which hold back Canadian 
individuals and companies from full participation and success in 
an increasingly interconnected, digital highway globally.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is very slow to respond to some of the tax issues 
which continue to hold back Canadians in terms of our global 
competitiveness, but is quick to respond on the regulatory side. 
I think that speaks volumes about a government that is far too 
quick to regulate and far too slow to bring down the barriers to 
unimpeded commerce and greater levels of opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation addresses some important issues relative to 
personal privacy in Canada on the Internet.  The battle between 
privacy and protection is an ongoing battle with regard to 
e-commerce on the Internet.  These issues have partially been 
addressed by the government.  I believe that the amendments from 
the other place were appropriate and helpful.  Again the Senate 
has provided a level of constructive intervention and benefit to 
the legislation of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that time and time again we see this kind of 
constructive interaction between both houses.  We 
need to be reminded that there is a reason for the current 
structure and for the nature of the Senate.  Sometimes when I am 
discussing issues of this importance with members of the upper 
house I am reminded of the incredible level of knowledge and 
expertise that we have in that other place to deal with some of 
these increasingly complicated issues, whether we are dealing 
with e-commerce or more traditional issues, such as finance.  I 
believe that in many ways the Senate banking committee has a 
significantly greater level of expertise than the House of 
Commons finance committee.  I would argue that members of the 
Senate banking committee, by and large, have forgotten more about 
finance than members of the House of Commons finance committee 
know.  I speak as a member of that committee and it is just a 
reflection on the high quality of membership we have on some of 
the committees in the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The onus with this legislation is on the government to utilize 
laws and regulations to protect the rights and privileges of 
consumers.  We support this legislation and we support these 
amendments, but I see some concerns about the government's 
efforts on an ongoing basis to regulate but not to recognize the 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One Canadian success story of an e-commerce Internet company was 
Zero-Knowledge, which recently raised a significant amount of 
money and is pursuing an IPO opportunity in the U.S.  Its 
business is Internet privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at Internet privacy, if it can be provided 
increasingly by private sector entities like Zero-Knowledge, I 
would urge the government, the ministry of industry and the 
industry committee to study some of these private sector 
alternatives.  There does not always have to be a heavy level of 
regulatory burden to achieve some of these privacy or protection 
ends.  Sometimes companies like Zero-Knowledge, a Canadian 
success story, can help provide the tools to consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue regarding health information is particularly important 
as we see companies like Healthion and Dr. Koop.com involved, as 
we see the continued integration of e-health vehicles with 
hospitals and, as time goes by, the technologies that will 
provide effectively the ability for health professionals to 
diagnose and treat illness increasingly via media, including the 
Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of Nova Scotia there are start-up companies 
that are developing increasing levels of expertise in these 
areas, companies like Techknowledge and Caduceus. 
They are developing technologies that will enable health care 
professionals to provide a greater level of comprehensive service 
to patients, which ultimately will be more cost effective.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are dealing with health care information clearly privacy 
issues are very important.  Again I urge the government to 
investigate all private sector opportunities or vehicles to 
protect privacy as opposed to always going the government 
regulatory approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are dealing with the issues before us relative to 
e-commerce we have to keep in mind a few basic principles. First, 
e-commerce and the Internet are based at this juncture on private 
sector leadership.  There should be a minimalist government role 
and we should avoid unnecessary restrictions. Privacy is 
important.  We have acknowledged that some private sector 
entities provide products which can be used to establish privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of e-commerce and Internet in general we have some 
real Canadian success stories with bid.com and some of the 
enabling technologies.  There is a company now in Saint John, New 
Brunswick, called iMagicTV, which is developing technology to 
transmit television signals through traditional copper wires.  I 
believe the technology has already been rolled out in parts of 
New Brunswick and will be in Halifax shortly.  It will 
revolutionize and be a very commercializeable initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some activities are happening on our financial markets, for 
instance, with the automation of our financial markets, whether 
it is with E-TRADE Canada, a Canadian entity, or e-commerce 
friendly investment banking such as Yorkton Securities in Canada 
or Wit Capital in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen great strides made in terms of venture capital for 
e-commerce in Canada, whether it is Digital Harbour or EcomPark 
that are providing the type of seed money required by Internet 
entrepreneurs to achieve their next step and ultimately, 
hopefully, public offerings.  In that light we see a new CDNX, 
which I believe will emerge as Canada's NASDAQ north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these opportunities are existing now and are helping to 
spawn some of Canada's technology stars, whether it is Leitch 
Technology or Versus Technology.  Whether it is a more 
traditional or technological leader like Nortel and JDS Uniphase, 
all these great things are happening because we are an innovative 
people.  We have innovative individuals and innovative companies 
across Canada that are doing amazing, interesting and successful 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I am concerned that we are not being led by an 
innovative government.  Again, as I mentioned earlier, I was 
surprised to hear the Prime Minister refer to e-commerce as a 
problem in a way that did not seem to recognize from his 
perspective that in fact e-commerce represents more of an 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the degree to which the government is embracing 
some of the fundamentals of the new economy, particularly 
relative to tax issues, I think we can see that we are falling 
behind other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite may look at the recent budget and say that 
there has been some tax reduction. However, before the recent 
budget Canada had the highest personal income taxes in the G-7 
and the second highest corporate taxes in the OECD.  After the 
budget Canadians will still have the highest personal income 
taxes in the G-7.  After full implementation of these tax 
measures over a five year period, Canadians will have the fourth 
highest corporate taxes in the OECD.  This is assuming that none 
of the other 31 countries reduce their corporate taxes when in 
fact 27 of them already have stated plans to reduce their 
corporate tax levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite may say that we are heading in the right 
direction. 
However a tortoise heading in the right direction on the autobahn 
will still be road kill.  In the global environment and on the 
interconnected digital highway of the global environment we 
cannot afford to be a nanosecond behind.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that as other countries make these gigantic leaps 
we continue to take these baby steps in Canada.  This 
incrementalist, caretaker, day to day poll driven style of 
government is holding back Canada at a time when other 
governments are being increasingly innovative, governments like 
Ireland, for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ireland has enjoyed over the past 10 years a 92% increase in GDP 
per capita.  I believe the U.S. has enjoyed about a 20% increase 
in GDP per capita and I think the U.K. has been in the same 
ballpark.  Canada has had during that same period a 5% increase 
in GDP per capita. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1990s Canadians have seen their personal disposable 
incomes drop by about 8% during a time when Americans have seen a 
10% increase.  Again, wealth being a relative thing, as 
individuals in other countries get richer we get poorer in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These phenomena are reflected in the Canadian dollar.  Since 
1993 the Canadian dollar has lost almost 10 cents of value under 
this government.  Every time we see a drop in the Canadian dollar 
it is a reduction in the standard of living of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things point to a greater issue: the inability of the 
government to embrace the new economies and to embrace the 
opportunities, not just the challenges or the problems of the new 
economies, of the new economy and to actually present the types 
of policies that will reduce the impediments to Canadians for 
full participation and success in that economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are some difficulties in relating the Irish example 
to Canada as a whole, there are some significant opportunities in 
making a direct comparison of what is capable in Atlantic Canada 
with the Ireland example.  We could look at what we would do by 
reducing corporate taxes and even capital gains taxes, 
specifically in Atlantic Canada, and perhaps adjusting over a 
period of time our current system of equalization, which actually 
provides impediments and barriers and bootstraps individual 
provinces on the recipient end.  These are some of the things we 
need to be looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Internet and with e-commerce, borders are less relevant 
now.  This is a challenge.  It seems there is almost a decline in 
the role of governments in people's lives as the Internet and 
other vehicles connect people individually.  This is both 
positive and negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is positive from the perspective that as individual citizens 
are connected, even from a social perspective, there will be more 
difficulty for countries or for leadership in countries to wage 
war on each other.  It will be increasingly difficult to convince 
people based on ethnicity or language that they do not like other 
people if they are already communicating with them via the 
Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be increasingly difficult for the Milosevics of the 
world, the Karadzics and the Tudjman type leaders in the former 
Yugoslavia to wage war on each other as the citizenry is 
empowered and connected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not always talk of the Internet and e-commerce as 
problems.  Let us talk about the brave new world that is 
available.  Let us talk about the free market working most 
efficiently in the history of the free world with individuals, 
regardless of borders, having access to the same information, 
immediate price flexibility, and the ability to trade based on 
that information immediately.  It is a very exciting time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I recognize that the legislation is a step in the right 
direction on the regulatory side, I wish the government would be 
more responsive on the other side, the opportunity side of 
e-commerce, as opposed to always dealing with what it perceives 
to be the problem of e-commerce. 
If we actually get out of the way I expect Canada can participate 
and succeed globally in this exciting new world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with some interest to the member opposite. He 
had some interesting points to make, at least he thought in his 
own mind he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment briefly on the fact that it was our Prime 
Minister who in October 1998 first announced this very important 
initiative.  From there it was developed over the course of time, 
ultimately came to the House and then went to the Senate.  I was 
somewhat pleased the member indicated that the Senate had a role 
to play.  I think we all know that in fact is the case and 
rightfully so in terms of the recommendations it has made, 
especially on the health side.  As chairman of the all party 
Standing Committee on Health I was very pleased that it did so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in the member's comment that somehow the 
government was holding back Canada in this area.  I thought at 
the time that if anyone was holding back Canada today it was Mr. 
Clark.  Mr. Clark is the leader of the Conservative Party.  When 
it came to Bill C-20, the clarity bill, where was Mr. Clark?  Why 
was he not standing up for Canada?  He was nowhere to be seen. 
Why does he not stand up for Canada on this all important issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the whole issue of health care in Alberta and 
Mr. Klein's bill-11, where is Mr. Clark?  Mr. Clark is siding 
with Mr. Klein and talking about the importance of for profit 
private health care in Canada.  He should be ashamed.  It is not 
this side of the House that is holding back Canada.  It is that 
side and Mr. Clark in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member comment on some matters with respect to 
Bill C-6?  Could he comment on the role of the privacy 
commissioner and whether or not he thinks the provisions 
contained in Bill C-6 vis-à-vis the privacy commissioner is an 
appropriate check and balance for this all important privacy 
bill? Does he agree that the one time five year review is of 
importance and necessary based on the proceedings of the House 
and what Canadians wherever they live in this great country of 
ours expect, demand and otherwise want? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested in listening to the hon. member's comments 
on the one time review as well as the privacy commissioner's 
role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as always I appreciate the 
hon. member's non-partisan and constructive comments.  I would 
like to address his initial comments on my party's position on 
Bill C-20 and that of our leader, Mr. Clark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the Right Hon. Joe Clark does not need to take 
lessons on national unity issues from some young pup in the 
backbenches of the Liberal government.  The near toxic level of 
arrogance that emanates from that side of the House is 
encouraging to members on this side of the House because it 
indicates that great change is coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preceding great change and the decline of any entity, whether it 
is a society or in this case a government, there is always a near 
toxic level of arrogance: people are convinced that what they are 
doing is right because they are doing it.  I am pleased to see 
that developing and would suggest it is almost an overdeveloped 
arrogance gland on that side of the House which will precede 
great opportunities for this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mr. Charest was leader of our party and there was an 
opening in the provincial leadership of the Quebec Liberal Party, 
the federalist party in Quebec, not one member on that side of 
the House could muster up enough leadership ability to go into 
Quebec and lead the federalists. 
Where did they have to go?  They had to go to the Progressive 
Conservative Party because we had more abilities and credibility 
with Jean Charest to lead the Quebec Liberals than that party 
over there with its 160-odd members and I mean 160 odd members. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that, in my opinion the best federalist positions in 
Ottawa were the ones that helped Jean Charest become the next 
premier of Quebec.  That is the most important and commonsensical 
approach to this.  We need to ensure and work with the top 
federalist in Quebec and that is Jean Charest.  I believe Bill 
C-20 continues to emasculate the provincial leadership in the 
Quebec Liberal Party.  It continues to attack our federalist 
partners in Quebec and undermines the efforts of Jean Charest to 
succeed as the next premier of Quebec.  Instead of those people 
focusing on short term poll-driven pragmatism, they should be 
focused on leadership that keeps Canada together and not 
anti-Quebec rhetoric that divides Canadians and hurts Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point relates to the Klein government's initiative on 
health care.  The Klein initiative is being demonized by the 
Liberals opposite.  They are referring to it as two tier health 
care because either they do not understand or they are 
intentionally misleading Canadians about the intentions of the 
Alberta government's legislation on health care.  I hope the 
Liberals are not trying to intentionally mislead Canadians by 
demonizing what is being done there.  I hope they are not trying 
to throw some label on it as being anti-American. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are aware, patriotism is the last refuge of 
scoundrels.  When these individuals talk about an Americanized 
health care system as being negative, they should take a look at 
the Canadian health care system right now and what they have done 
to it over the past several years.  This government and this 
Prime Minister have been the Dr. Kevorkians of the Canadian 
health care system.  They have done everything they can to 
euthanize the Canadian health care system.  At the same time, 
these pompous, arrogant Liberal individuals, who are pounding 
their chests like Tarzan and walking and strutting around Ottawa 
like roosters so proud of what they have done with health care, 
have in fact decimated health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For them to try to operate some type of policy of brinkmanship 
and standing up to the provinces, whether it is Ralph Klein or 
the province of Quebec or any other province that is trying to 
innovatively approach some of these complex issues that their 
government has put in front of them, is absolutely ridiculous, 
rhetoric driven and dangerous for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the sooner we get these guys out and solid Progressive 
Conservatives in, the better for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to the member 
by saying shame on him and his party for referring to the Prime 
Minister and the government as being the Dr. Kevorkians.  Members 
of his party cannot even make up their mind how to vote on the 
clarity bill.  They flip-flop every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kevorkians are those Conservatives, those Brian Mulroneys, 
those Kim Campbells and those Jean Charests who could not even 
balance a budget in nine years.  They had that opportunity.  They 
left us a country that was sadly described as almost a third 
world banana republic.   Today, I can look at the member in the 
face and say that we are a country that stands above the rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Germany and the finance minister said “What a miracle, 
how you guys turned things around”.  That is what this 
government has done for this country.  It has brought in 
surpluses, balanced budgets, employment and dignity to the 
household.  Yes, we are trying to turn around and rebuild that 
health system that they initially began to destroy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his softball question.  I assume he was trying to help me and 
not hinder me with that kind of light and fluffy intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the previous Progressive Conservative 
government, the Mulroney government, reduced the deficit as a 
percentage of GDP from 9% in 1984 to about 5% when it left 
office. What the Mulroney government inherited was a huge 
problem, in that it was like that old country and western song 
“give me forty acres and I will turn this rig around”. 
It took nine years just to slow down the velocity that Canada was 
heading in and in the wrong direction.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that period not only did the government reduce the 
deficit as a percentage of GDP, but the government also 
implemented some of the most important and visionary structural 
changes to the Canadian economy in the last 50 years, including 
free trade, the GST and deregulation of financial services, 
transportation and energy.  These were policies that recognized 
where Canada needed to be in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I had an opportunity to ask the hon. member what his 
position was on free trade and on the GST.  I believe, and 
correct me if I am wrong, that the hon. member was, as were most 
of the Liberal members opposite, vociferously opposed to some of 
those initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask all members of the House, particularly those 
opposite, to recall their intransigence in opposition to some of 
those visionary changes.  Today <I>The Economist</I> magazine is 
saying that it was those structural changes by the previous 
government that were responsible for the elimination of the 
deficit in Canada. It was not the pontificating Liberals on the 
other side of the House, but those in— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry, time is 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we get to the next orator, I want to remind all members, 
because I am sure other members are just as confused as your 
Speaker at the moment, that we are really on Bill C-6 moved by 
the Minister of Industry, the personal information protection and 
electronic documents act.  I happen to have a copy of the Senate 
amendments that we are debating if anyone is even in the least 
interested. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I can assure you that I am very interested in this very important 
Bill C-6.  As chairman of the health committee I was very 
interested in the amendments that the Senate recommended with 
respect to this all important area as it relates to privacy and 
other matters in our very globalized and commercialized area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say however to the member for Kings—Hants, who made 
comments with respect to Dr. Kevorkian, euthanasia and other 
matters, that it is far better we talk about those kinds of 
issues than the slow death of the Mulroney era and who and what 
they represented in terms of the strangulation of our great 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out to him that I was very pleased to be 
called “a young pup” by him; far better a young pup than an old 
dog.  The Conservatives are nothing under Joe Clark than an old 
dog with no teeth.  I can assure the House that dog will not 
hunt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to point out that Bill C-6 is a very important bill. 
It was first announced by the Prime Minister in October 1998 and 
it underscores a commitment by the Government of Canada to bring 
forward legislation of importance to all Canadians wherever they 
live in our great country.   I want to point out by way of 
background information that approximately 80% of Canadians think 
that the government has a key and lead role in this all important 
area.  It is important to note that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I did not major in mathematics but I cannot count 
anywhere near 20 people let alone 20 Liberals listening to this 
wonderful speech.  I think it would be a good idea if this 
gentleman's colleagues were here to listen to what he has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Cariboo—Chilcotin has called quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Call in the members. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that took some time but I 
think it was worth waiting to hear my speech.  I appreciate the 
fact that you would call in a number of people who would be able 
to partake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying that Bill C-6 is important legislation that will 
apply to all federally regulated private sector areas in Canada. 
It will also apply to crown corporations.  It will cover federal 
entities which are not covered under existing federal privacy 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to note this very important point because it gets to 
the very essence, the very pith and substance of what the bill 
tries to do.  With respect to interprovincial trading of personal 
and private information and the international trading of 
information, it wants to control that and make sure there is a 
system in place where that kind of privacy is assured.  That is 
very important. I think Canadians wherever they are across Canada 
want to see us take a lead role in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I noted prior to the quorum call but I will emphasize 
and reassert the fact that in a recent poll, and I think the 
polling has been consistent with what Canadians have wanted, 80% 
of Canadians have indicated that they would like to see us have 
this kind of legislation. 
It is important in that sense that we act quickly and accordingly 
because it underscores the willingness and the urgency of the 
Government of Canada to move in this all important area in a way 
consistent with the values of Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When reading the legislation it seemed to me that it was 
consumer friendly and rightfully so.  It was something that 
ordinary Canadians wherever they are in Canada could listen to 
and deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reading the bill and taking a close hard and fast look at it, 
I found it was not something that was burdensome and cumbersome 
to industry, especially small and medium industry. Small and 
medium businesses are the engines for Canada. We do not want to 
put something in place that would be cumbersome and which would 
detract from their ability to do what they do best, which is to 
be entrepreneurs and to make profit.  Profit in entrepreneurship 
is what makes this country great. As a result of their good 
efforts and as a result of what entrepreneurs do in small and 
medium businesses, they create jobs which in turn helps the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's economy is going pretty much at full tilt these days as 
a result of the good management and sound fiscal and monetary 
policy of the government which has done the right things.  It is 
appropriate that we move in that sense accordingly.  It 
underscores the commitment of the government to work in a manner 
consistent with what Canadians not only want but quite frankly 
deserve.  This makes for better lives for them and their 
families.  That is part and parcel of what we on the government 
side want to provide for all Canadians wherever they live in this 
great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Northeast is heckling, caterwauling and 
bellowing, as members of the Reform Party often do.  I am sorry, 
I guess that party has gone through two name changes.  It went 
from the Reform Party to the CCRAP and now it is the alliance 
party.  Whatever those members call themselves, their party is 
really the same old thing recycled.  We understand that for who 
they are and for what they represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly I think Canadians reject their extremist views. 
They reject what they try to do repeatedly, which is they try 
tear at the very fabric of Canadian society, tear people apart, 
tear regions apart and tear populations and groups and all kinds 
of Canadians apart. Canada is not like that.  Canada is above 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened on Monday past when the member for Calgary Northeast 
got up on a tirade.  This was from the very people who said they 
were going to bring a fresh start to parliament, a new way of 
doing business, a new approach. The member accused me, among 
other things, of being unchristian and not following in the 
footsteps of Christ.  I reject that. Never mind I am a devout 
Christian, but I reject the kind of nonsense the member opposite 
would try to spew out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He or she who is without guilt will cast the first stone. Those 
people opposite who live in glass houses should be very careful 
in terms of what they do and how they do it. I think it is 
written somewhere very important, and the hon. member should 
listen accordingly and attentively for a change, that judge not 
lest ye be judged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should think hard and long about the kind of 
venom he is prepared to spew.  He should think hard and long 
about casting judgments on other people.  That is so typical of 
that holier than thou group that sits opposite, no matter what 
its name is.  That is so typical of who those members are and 
what they represent, extremists to the nth degree.  People of 
their ilk and those who associate with them understand fully that 
they will go nowhere fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fair-minded, compassionate, tolerant Canadians see through that 
party no matter what it calls itself.  They see through those 
members for who they are and for what they represent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get back to the issue at hand, Bill C-6, and how very 
important it is with respect to the agenda of the Government of 
Canada in terms of providing safety and security regarding the 
privacy issue for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been very intent on ensuring that the 
legislation deals with issues of concern to the Quebec 
government.  We have tried, and I think we have been very 
successful, to complement the Quebec legislation in this area 
with respect to covering international and interprovincial flows 
of personal data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to work consistently and 
hard when it comes to dealing with the government of Quebec 
because it has made some good notations in this area.  As a 
result of good, solid federal-provincial co-operation on this 
very important Bill C-6, we will be able to work constructively. 
After all that is what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk a great deal in this House of Commons.  We can talk 
at the federal level about what we should or should not do. We 
can talk about the great issues that confront Canada, but 
Canadians wherever they live in this great country of ours, in 
all the regions, expect governments at all levels to work 
together.  They expect their federal government to take a lead 
role often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witness health care for example.  Canadians expect the federal 
government to take a lead role in that, to work constructively 
with other provincial and territorial partners and all 
stakeholders.  Canadians expect this not only in health care, but 
in e-commerce and all areas of importance.  Canadians are 
typically people who like to see partnership and co-ordination 
instead of the politics of blame and finger pointing like Mr. 
Harris is doing right now on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine what Mr. Harris is doing.  It is outrageous when we see 
the kind of finger pointing that is taking place on health care. 
It really should not happen.  Canadians quite frankly expect more 
from their premiers.  What they should be doing as provincial and 
territorial partners is coming together and meeting 
constructively.  Instead of the politics of blame, they should be 
looking forward to the politics of hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The politics of hope underscore what Canadians want, which is 
for all people, Canadians of good faith wherever they are in this 
country, to work together.  They expect their government leaders 
to work together constructively to ensure that the right thing is 
done at the end of the day.  Why do they do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that this is an enormous country geographically 
and in many other ways, with huge physical and human resources. 
They know too that with a small population it is incumbent upon 
governments wherever they are in Canada to work together to 
ensure that the Canadian way is respected, that Canada's great 
values, symbols and institutions are ultimately respected in a 
way which is consistent with what Canadians expect from their 
leaders and their governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a moment to talk about the code in terms of Bill 
C-6, and the 10 principles that are inherent in that code. The 10 
principles are noted as follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number one relates to accountability.  Accountability is very 
important.  Canadians expect their governments in legislation on 
all matters to include accountability and transparency in a 
manner consistent with what we believe as a government. All 
Canadians expect it in legislation and rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number two is to identify purposes and make sure it is done in a 
manner consistent with the kind of information collected. Again 
Canadians expect that that be done in the very important area of 
privacy. 
I think it is important and expected that government include it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT21"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT21"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1230
<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number three in the code is consent.  Consent of the individual 
is required because people in Canada genuinely deserve privacy. 
They want it and they need it.  People expect that if there is to 
be a sharing of knowledge it will be done with consent.  I think 
that underscores exactly what the government is prepared to note 
and put in by way of the ten codes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number four is the limited collection code principle.  It will 
be limited to what is necessary for the purposes of identifying 
organizations or others for a lawful purpose.  That too is an 
important principle and one which underscores the commitment of 
the government to do the right thing in this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number five is the limited use, disclosure and retention 
principle.  It is used because it is important to note and it is 
important that Canadians have this, by way of principles, 
codified.  Personal information shall be retained only as long as 
necessary for the fulfilment of the purpose for which it was 
collected.  Again, I think that too is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number six is accuracy.  Canadians expect the information given 
to be accurate.  The mechanisms are built in whereby if there is 
misinformation it can be corrected.  I believe that Canadians 
expect that kind of accuracy to be part and parcel of this very 
important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number seven is the principle of safeguards.  The information 
will be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the 
information presented.  That too underscores the commitment of 
the Government of Canada to ensure that safeguards are in place 
and that those kinds of checks and balances are part and parcel 
of this very important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number eight is openness, which concerns itself with the readily 
available information to individuals of policies and practices 
relating to the management of personal information.  Again, this 
is part of transparency.  This is part of accountability.  This 
is part of openness.  This too underscores the government's wish 
to ensure that this is in place in a meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number nine is individual access.  Upon request, I should note 
because it is important, that an individual shall be informed of 
the existence, use and disclosure of his or her personal 
information and shall be given access to that information.  An 
individual shall be able to challenge the accuracy and 
completeness of the information and have it amended as 
appropriate.  That is important.  Again, Canadians want to see 
that as part of this law.  It is a principle which we are 
prepared to put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, number ten is the challenging compliance principle. 
Again, an individual shall be able to address a challenge 
concerning compliance with the above principles to the designated 
individual or individuals for the organization's compliance. 
That too is a good principle and is part of the approach of the 
Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taken in total, these ten principles are very important and they 
underscore the level to which the government is prepared to act. 
I believe it is ultimately in the best interests of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about the role of the privacy commissioner 
and the important role that he plays in this all important Bill 
C-6.  I think it is incumbent upon all members of parliament, 
from all across the country, to understand that the role of the 
privacy commissioner will be consistent with what Canadians 
expect and want and, quite frankly, the role which they have 
become used to.  I think it is important that we proceed in this 
very important area in a manner consistent with the values of 
Canadians.  I think it is important that we do so and that we do 
so as soon as we can because this is an important bill and we 
need to pass it expeditiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a five year review built into the bill. 
That too is important and again underscores the role of the 
government to do the right thing in this all important bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I urge all members of the House to get on with the 
business at hand, to support Bill C-6 and to recognize it for 
what it is; that is, a good piece of legislation which follows 
on what the Prime Minister said in October 1998 and follows in 
a way which I believe Canadians not only can identify with but 
also support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask all members of the House to move expeditiously to 
pass this bill as soon as possible, knowing that it is the right 
thing to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
use this opportunity to question my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the Ontario members are nervous.  A lot of things are 
happening in this country. This government has a very slim 
majority, after winning almost all the seats in Ontario.  I 
would be tempted to advise my colleague to control his disdain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech and in a question he addressed to one of my 
colleagues in this House a few minutes ago, I heard him mention 
our leader, say that our party was like a sick dog.  I think the 
hon. member should be very careful, because a number of 
governments have faced election upsets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has not been in the House long, I understand that, 
but I advise him to temper his disdain for the opposition 
parties.  He could be in for some big surprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this spirit, I would ask him what he plans to do after the 
next elections. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge the 
sensitivity which Conservatives feel when it comes to the 
leadership of Mr. Joe Clark, and sensitive they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the importance of Bill C-20, the clarity bill, on 
which we voted, literally, around the clock for a number of days. 
In my heart of hearts I felt proud; tired yes, but proud to be a 
part of this great period of history, following the lead of the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who 
led this country in a manner consistent with what Canadians want 
and expect.  I felt proud to a part of that great bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B>  Terrible.  It is the beginning of the 
end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  The member opposite can say what he will, 
but his leader was absolutely shameful in supporting and cozying 
up to the separatists.  That is what Mr. Mulroney did.  That was 
a shameful period of Canadian history when Mr. Mulroney cozied up 
to the separatists.  He tried to build an alliance, and look 
what happened to him.  He talks about where I will be after the 
next election.  I would challenge him as to where the 
Conservatives will be after the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw what happened when they played toe to toe and cheek to 
cheek with the separatists.  They were reduced to two seats. Why? 
Because Canadians ultimately reject that kind of nonsense. They 
reject it because it is not consistent with the party of Sir John 
A. Macdonald.  It is not consistent with the party of Cartier. 
It is not consistent with what Canadians want and believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will govern on the government side consistent with what 
the people expect, and the people expect a united and strong 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is Mr. Joe Clark and why is he not standing for Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a more specific 
question so that the member can at least address the bill and 
not go on the rant that we have just heard promoting his 
government and what he believes are strong credentials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to specifically address this bill as it 
pertains to the concerns the provinces have raised, especially on 
the jurisdictional issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Bloc have raised this issue, as well as a 
number of the provinces.  This bill may in fact encroach on 
provincial responsibilities in areas of the management of health 
documents and other forms of really important information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the industry minister received a letter from the 
Alberta government, criticizing the government on this bill.  It 
said that there was inadequate consultation on the bill to this 
day, that the federal-provincial-territorial working group of 
officials had not met in over a year, and that their officials 
have repeatedly requested that the group reconvene to discuss 
issues related to the bill and the regulations that would be 
required if it were passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to assure the House of what sort of 
commitment his government would have in dealing with the 
jurisdictional problems which may arise.  With all of the 
criticisms being relayed to the government from various 
provincial governments, will it commit to work, throughout the 
passage of this bill, to overcome the problems of jurisdiction, 
especially when it comes to privacy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, had the member been 
listening to my speech he would have heard me deal with the issue 
of Quebec and some of the concerns that were outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He did not talk about Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  The Bloc member opposite said that he did 
not talk about Quebec.  He actually raised it.  He said that the 
Bloc indicated that it had concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would point out, and not only as it concerns Alberta and 
Quebec, is that we on the government side have crossed our 
<I>t</I>s and dotted our <I>i</I>s in terms of whether this bill is 
constitutional and respects the jurisdiction of the provinces. 
In fact, it will not infringe on provincial jurisdiction.  We 
have made that very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not typical of the member opposite to stand in the House 
and talk about what the Bloc might want to ask?  Is that not 
typical of the party which not so long ago, at its convention in 
London, Ontario, organized as its keynote lead-off speaker Mr. 
Biron, who is nothing more than a separatist? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about that for a minute.  We have a western 
populist reform party, which now calls itself CRAP, which has all 
of a sudden metamorphosed into something called the Alliance 
Party, which had a separatist as the lead-off speaker at its 
convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are debating a particular bill.  The hon. member, to the huge 
gathering on the opposite side of the House, is seeking to 
exercise a predominant dose of arrogance, which is exactly what 
is going to kill that party.  The information I get is that this 
arrogance, as they attack my colleagues, is exactly the thing 
that has killed parties in the past— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I suspect that could 
have a little debate in it.  We will go to the next question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to put a question to the hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington. I will put it slowly because I think he 
has difficulty hearing or understanding, I do not know which. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Reform colleague talked about Alberta.  Alberta is not a city 
in the province of Quebec.  Alberta is not a city inhabited by 
separatists, who are born separatists and who die separatists. 
Alberta is a province in your beautiful great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Reform colleague's question concerned Alberta.  It is not 
separatist, it is not wicked and it will not kill the member in 
the night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second comment will be along the lines of the one made by my 
Reform colleague.  It concerns provincial jurisdiction.  I will 
remind—I dare to hope that I will remind him, or at least 
inform him—the member for Waterloo—Wellington that Quebec has 
had legislation entitled an act respecting personal information 
for the past five years.  This legislation is considered 
effective the world over.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, a province which I must admit does have some 
sovereignists, there is the Barreau du Québec.  This is not a 
group of separatists.  I simply want to explain this so that the 
member will understand.  The Barreau du Québec is an 
organization that is made up of lawyers, sovereignists or 
otherwise, and which administers the law.  It is opposed to Bill 
C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the Chambre des notaires.  It might have been 
infiltrated by a few nasty sovereignists but it is not a 
separatist group.  It is opposed to Bill C-6.  The CSN—there are a 
few more of them in that organization—, the National Assembly and 
other organizations are also opposed to Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear what the member for Waterloo—Wellington 
thinks about the unanimous opposition in Quebec and Alberta—which 
is not a city in Quebec, by the way—to Bill C-6. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really do not need a 
geography lesson from the member opposite, nor do I need a 
spelling lesson, nor do I need an elocution lesson for that 
matter in speaking slowly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would ask the hon. member to do, however, speaking of 
geography, is to take some time to travel our great country and 
find out exactly what it means to be a Canadian and learn what it 
means to be a Canadian and where the values of Canada are 
consistent and part and parcel of our great land.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have not managed to commit Montpetit-Marleau to memory, but if 
I am not mistaken, citation 416 of Beauchesne's states that a 
member's reply must address the topic being debated in the House 
and not wander all over the place, as the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington is doing. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite 
jumps the gun.  I was getting to the point where I was going to 
answer the question.  It is really interesting how the Bloc 
members are so thin-skinned.  They are really quite sensitive. We 
can only imagine that it must be because they do not know why 
they are here in this parliament any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In direct response to him, if he had been listening and paying 
attention to the minister he would know that the minister, in 
tabling Bill C-6, announced publicly that Quebec will be exempted 
from the application of Bill C-6 because it has similar 
legislation in place.  This will be done by an order in council 
once the bill becomes law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member claims to be protecting the interests of his 
constituents.  He claims to be protecting Quebecers wherever they 
live.  Why would he not do his homework and know that this was 
happening?  I find it shameful that he would do what he is doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite ironic that when we ask 
questions the hon. member opposite continues to say “If the 
opposition had only been listening”.  It is very difficult to 
listen to a rant continued by the hon. member.  Our eyes tend to 
gloss over and we tend to fall asleep over here because it is the 
same old rhetoric that we hear from this government and from this 
member.  Nothing, unfortunately, is new, nothing is insightful 
and nothing has vision, which most of us in the official 
opposition always like to challenge in the House.  Mr. Speaker, I 
know you know that and value that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to stand today in the House to speak to Bill C-6. I 
actually had the opportunity, prior to my colleague from Peace 
River who has now taken over the industry file, to work on this 
bill in committee when it was formerly known as Bill C-54. I 
enjoyed working on the bill, particularly because it dealt with 
bridging the gaps, as we often have in this country, between the 
jurisdictional issues and trying to actually deal with a bill 
that has issues on a global level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one deals with privacy as it relates to electronic commerce 
and privacy as it relates to any other form of important 
information, there is in today's electronic commerce an endless 
amount of information travelling everywhere through different 
channels, whether it is through the media, the Internet or other 
forms of communication. 
There is often sensitive information being transferred not only 
within a city, within a country and across provincial boundaries 
but also globally.  That is why this particular bill is of unique 
importance to Canadians.  We are actually showing some 
leadership.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I was working on the committee I commended the industry 
minister for bringing forward a bill that shows some leadership. 
Through my travels and talking with various people in industries 
that deal with electronic commerce and privacy, I found that many 
other countries were looking at Canada to produce something that 
could set an example for the rest of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we continuously criticize the government for 
is its refusal to deal with many of the concerns of not only the 
provinces but also the opposition.  When I was sitting at 
committee I put forward many amendments that would have 
strengthened the bill as it pertains to health care documents and 
the privacy of specific information on health care. 
Unfortunately, even though many of the members opposite would 
have paid lip service in supporting these amendments, they did 
not do so, which was quite disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this particular bill, as we know it and understand it, 
is well within the proper function of government to create a 
civil and criminal law framework and regulatory regime to allow 
electronic commerce to flourish in Canada.  Legislation governing 
the commercial use of private and sensitive information is 
important and necessary to create a healthy and stable business 
environment in Canada.  It is not the proper role of government 
to foster business through the creation of interventionist 
government programs that are costly to taxpayers and largely 
ineffective.  Engaging in electronic commerce and especially the 
growth that we have seen in this particular area, there is no 
doubt that the government has a role to play in putting together 
a framework to regulate sensitive information being transferred 
over those channels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we are supporting this bill in principle and trying 
to make it better during the course of debate here in the House 
and in committee, we in the official opposition did have some 
specific criticisms and ones that I would like to raise now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to see the bill separated into two parts.  As it now 
stands, the government has rolled the section on electronic 
commerce together with the one on privacy.  It would have been 
preferable to arrive at a consensus with the provinces to do this 
co-operatively rather than use the trade and commerce provisions 
in the constitution to unilaterally introduce legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When challenging the minister on this particular issue of 
provincial jurisdiction, he was sensitive enough to say that even 
though federal legislation would be put in place to govern 
privacy and electronic commerce on a national level, he would 
encourage provinces that would like to have strong privacy 
legislation because under the constitution privacy is a 
provincial responsibility and that jurisdiction is in the hands 
of the provinces.  Quebec currently has strong privacy 
legislation.  If other provinces wanted to follow suit and create 
privacy legislation that was stronger than this federal 
legislation, the minister's commitment was that this legislation 
would be complementary to that of the provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gave me a sense of satisfaction, especially after talking 
to some of my counterparts in Alberta.  I told them that there 
was a role for this particular bill to govern the rules 
surrounding privacy and electronic commerce on a national and 
global level.  However, I encouraged my colleagues, especially 
those in Alberta, if they saw flaws or weaknesses in this 
particular bill, to see if they could come up with stronger 
legislation and maybe even take examples from Quebec because it 
does have strong privacy legislation.  Alberta could then perhaps 
create something that would be more specific to the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My counterparts encouraged me at that time and said that they 
were planning on doing this in fall. 
Since then I know that there has been much work done in that 
particular area and in that particular jurisdiction. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have also been a lot of concerns and criticisms from the 
Alberta government, especially on the process of dealing with the 
government when it comes to coming to a consensus.  This, 
unfortunately, seems to be a common theme with the government. We 
have seen it in so many other forms of legislation in the House 
and in so many other ways when this particular government tries 
to put legislation through the House, often without proper 
democratic debate and without the proper consensus across the 
country. It just does not care about dealing with the provincial 
concerns. If it did, it would be so much easier to build 
consensus. However, in its arrogance, it is just not committed to 
that, as my colleague mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go back to some of those criticisms, the official opposition 
has supported the e-commerce part of this bill.  This section is 
needed to facilitate business resulting from the new technologies 
and the increasing growth in air freight.  It shortens the time 
for payment for suppliers because they can use electronic 
signatures.  That is an area that will be further developed in 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the areas in the first section of the bill that we wanted 
strengthened was area dealing with privacy, especially providing 
extra protection for health care records.  As I mentioned, when I 
sat on the committee I remember introducing a number of 
amendments that were supported by a number of organizations, 
especially in the health care field.  I remember the Canadian 
Dental Association, the Canadian Medical Association and a number 
of other groups that really wanted to see medical health records, 
especially the privacy surrounding those records, strengthened in 
this particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very disappointed, when I did introduce those particular 
amendments at the committee, that for some reason the committee 
did not want to make the commitment to health care.  We have seen 
that, obviously, in the way that health care is funded, because 
the cutbacks have been radical regarding transfers to the 
provinces when it comes to the funding of health care.  That is 
why we have the problems that we do today where provinces are 
trying to make up the difference in government cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have cost the government relatively nothing to 
strengthen the privacy of health care records in this particular 
bill but it refused to do so.  At least now, in debating the 
Senate amendments to this particular bill, I know that the Senate 
actually added a particular amendment to deal with personal 
health information.  It inserted a separate and detailed 
definition of personal health information as opposed to lumping 
it with all personal information.  This is at least a step in the 
right direction toward what we would like to see.  We hope that 
will be supported by the House because it does help to make this 
bill a little better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I also want to touch on is the criticisms by 
the provinces, which have been quite significant during this 
process.  I would like to quote, as I did when I asked the hon. 
member opposite to respond to some of the concerns that the 
Alberta government raised. I want to get to that and read some of 
the other quotes that they had identified as potential problems 
with this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address the other amendments put forward by the Senate before 
I get to the criticisms, one of the second amendments provides 
for a moratorium of one year before the legislation applies to 
organizations which deal with personal health information.  This 
is similar to a postponement of one year given to provincially 
regulated industries.  It is a step in the right direction but 
the Alberta government has raised some concerns about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sooner this legislation is up and running, in the Senate's 
view, the better.  The two moratoriums are somewhat regrettable 
as they create a temporary patchwork implementation regime for 
e-commerce and e-document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federally regulated enterprises and organizations will be 
subject to the legislation first, then provincially regulated and 
health related organizations one year later.  It is unfortunate 
that the government did not do its homework with respect to both 
the provincial governments and health privacy advocates before 
imposing time allocation to rush the third reading debate in the 
House of Commons.  Nevertheless, Reform is pleased to see that 
personal health information is better protected for a change, 
thanks to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get to some of the criticisms, especially as raised by 
some of the provincial jurisdictions, namely Alberta. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked briefly about this point earlier.  It seems to me that 
the government, especially when it comes to promoting democracy, 
consensus and using the House of Commons for a place of healthy 
debate, even if it means criticizing legislation to make it 
better, is so arrogant that it often refuses to allow debate to 
happen in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen time allocation moved on almost every bill since I 
have been here.  If we spent a little more time on some bills 
that I think could become very good legislation and if we had 
input in a fair and democratic way from all members of the 
opposition, we would see this piece of legislation and others 
like it actually become better.  The government would be better 
off to allow that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time allocation has been moved on third reading of the bill.  It 
has also been moved in many other circumstances.  We saw it moved 
on Bill C-20 in committee, which was disgusting.  The government 
does not allow the democratic process to work or further the 
democratic process with its lack of commitment to democracy at 
the root level in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a young person trying to make the country better, trying to 
make it more democratic, and trying to get the involvement of 
elected parliamentarians and Canadians, I ask how it can be 
justified to Canadians that their democracy is working and that 
their members of parliament are effective when the government 
refuses to even engage in the democratic process at this very 
fundamental level of representation in our country.  In any case 
we hope that it might learn and listen to some of the provincial 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Alberta is a strong proponent of privacy 
principles in electronic commerce.  It remains concerned about 
the flaws in the process pertaining to Bill C-6 and the extent of 
the consultation that occurred with regard to business readiness, 
issues of jurisdiction, the scope of coverage of the proposed 
legislation and the provisions relating to substantially similar 
provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister was true to his word when he talked about 
the commitment to make this legislation complementary to the 
provincial legislation.  This was obviously one of the concerns 
raised by the provincial Government of Alberta in its letter to 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the hon. member opposite in his response to a 
previous question said that everything in the bill was within the 
constitutional realm of the federal government and did not 
conflict with any form of constitutional rules pertaining to the 
provinces.  However, it is obvious that the Alberta government, 
my colleagues in the Bloc and the Quebec government have felt 
quite differently about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from a letter sent from the Alberta government. It 
was actually sent by two ministers, the minister of international 
and intergovernmental relations and the minister of municipal 
affairs.  It stated that there was a disturbing trend in this 
federal legislation toward the use of provisions similar to the 
substantially similar clause to extend federal legislation into 
areas of provincial jurisdiction.  It went so far as to say that 
if the bill were passed the Government of Alberta would be forced 
to consider a constitutional challenge to preserve its authority 
under the constitution.  It is obvious that the provinces have 
major concerns with the jurisdictional issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made a great effort when dealing with the bill to put 
forward our concerns and to have the government deal with them. 
The member opposite stands in his place and claims that there are 
no problems of jurisdiction in the bill, that the government has 
done its homework and that it is committed to dealing with the 
provinces.  This is absolutely false, especially when a number of 
provinces are saying that they would challenge the legislation 
unless improvements were made.  It is time the hon. member who 
always claims the opposition may not have done its homework to do 
his own.  The government refuses to do that and continues to 
throw out the rhetoric we continuously see in its place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another criticisms raised by the provincial government in the 
letter to the Minister of Industry was the fact that there was 
inadequacy of consultation on the bill which continues to this 
day.  The federal-provincial-territorial working group of 
officials has not met in over a year. 
Alberta government officials have repeatedly requested that the 
group reconvene to discuss issues related to the bill.  The 
related regulations that would be required if it were passed have 
come to no avail.  They indicated that there has been no 
willingness on the part of the ministry or the minister to enter 
into meaningful discussions with provincial counterparts on the 
very real issues that the bill raises but does not address. There 
is still no clarity whatsoever about how the ministry would 
propose to effectively address outstanding issues such as those 
related to personal health information.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This information was contained in a letter dated March 16, 2000, 
It is barely two to three weeks old and the Alberta government 
still has concerns in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of health care documents, we saw Senate amendments 
coming in to strengthen that.  At least on that level the Alberta 
government might be happy.  My colleague from Peace River and I 
will be discussing with our counterparts in Alberta their final 
thoughts on the bill.  At least it moves in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need some form of commitment from the government.  Quite 
frankly none of us in the opposition really believe the 
government when it talks about working with the provinces.  As I 
have said before, we have seen lip service on many issues such as 
the Kyoto deal, other forms of legislation and now Bill C-6.  It 
says it has a commitment to working with the provinces in dealing 
with provincial jurisdiction and taking it seriously.  However, 
even from what the Alberta government is saying, in over a year 
the working group has not even bothered to meet with the province 
of Alberta to discuss some of the concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could only imagine that, if in fact the group would have met 
with the province, the bill would have been able to take care of 
some of the problems the Alberta government has raised and 
perhaps we could have had a better piece of legislation.  What a 
shame it would be if not only from Quebec but from the province 
of Alberta we have a basic constitutional challenge to preserve 
the authority of the province under this legislation.  That would 
be a shame, especially when the bill could have done so much to 
deal with setting the stage internationally for a piece of 
legislation that could have led the world in electronic commerce 
and particularly in privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to raise these issues today.  We often 
forget how important it is in dealing with specific legislation 
that especially touches on areas of provincial jurisdiction but 
may well have a mandate federally.  In fact the government should 
become more focused when trying to build consensus in the 
country.  It is obvious for my colleagues from Quebec, many of 
whom have criticized the bill because of the jurisdiction, and it 
is obvious for my colleagues from Alberta who have the same 
criticisms, that the government has failed in its mandate to be 
able to successfully deal with the provinces in trying to build 
consensus on one of the most important pieces of legislation 
heading into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members in the House to take the time to look 
over these particular amendments by the Senate.  As I have 
outlined, they are moving in the right direction.  Obviously the 
bill is a good one, but let us see in this final stage if we can 
actually make it better.  Let us hope that the government opens 
its eyes to try to work with the country and try to unite the 
country rather than divide it as it continuously does all the 
time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate and compliment my 
colleague on his discussion of the Senate amendments to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned that the federal government in dealing with this 
issue had not been very co-operative in discussing it with the 
provinces that have the broad jurisdiction, in particular with 
issues of privacy.  However there are privacy issues that come 
under the federal government.  I am thinking of federal 
institutions such as banks and interprovincial communications, 
protection of personal property and lists that are transferred 
through lease, loan or sales agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague comment on the federal government's dealing 
with privacy issues relating to federal institutions?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his very pertinent question.  This is one of the reasons the 
official opposition in the House has actually supported the 
principles behind the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague pointed out, there are areas of 
jurisdiction concerning privacy that are within the federal 
realm, especially as they pertain to federal institutions and the 
exchange of information among those institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that when it comes to the particular area of 
privacy among federal institutions, not even mentioning the 
provincial areas that I made some criticism about, there has also 
been great criticism in the way the government tries to deal with 
building consensus.  It is the same thing over and over again, 
the arrogance and the lack of wanting to try to look beyond their 
own scope to improve conditions in the House and in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of some of the greatest criticisms concerning the bill or 
at least the fears.  Many banks and other companies dealing with 
Internet service, at least when it comes to dealing with private 
information and as we continue to deal with federal regulations 
that apply to those institutions, have been critical in that they 
feel the government refuses to try to hear them out, especially 
to see what they have done to ensure that privacy is respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surprisingly enough I remember when I sat on the committee that 
many of these organizations came before the committee to talk 
about how they had customers for whom they were responsible. Many 
of them have people to whom they provide services.  They deal 
within confidential information every day. In order to have the 
confidence of those consumers and those people, they need to 
ensure that privacy is respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In trying to craft the legislation they hoped the federal 
government would consult them to see what they have accomplished 
in building public confidence in privacy.  It was to no avail.  A 
lot of their suggestions and improvements for the bill fell on 
deaf ears on the other side.  That is why we are so skeptical 
about the government in dealing with many of the stakeholders in 
the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for a very good speech.  He is the first 
speaker I have heard today who actually spoke about Bill C-6, 
which was a nice change.  I have one concern about Bill C-6 and I 
would like to get the member's opinion on whether he feels that 
Bill C-6 satisfies my very legitimate concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this era of downsizing of public sector agencies and the 
wholesale privatization of many aspects of government, we have 
seen in many provinces that the data services aspect of 
government, the agencies that take care of health records, 
employment data or any of those things, are now being privatized 
through the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Manitoba it went to an agency which then further 
subcontracted to a company in Dallas, Texas, so that now all my 
personal medical records are being held by a company I do not 
even know the name of in Dallas, Texas, two or three steps 
removed from the original agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very grave concern because obviously there are people 
who would like to know who holds the personal private health 
records of Canadians.  Whether it is drug companies doing 
research or even if people are applying for a job, the employer 
might want to know if they have any serious medical problems that 
would make them a less likely employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anything in Bill C-6 that would safeguard Canadians 
from the trend toward taking public records and putting them into 
the private sector?  Is there anything to make sure that they do 
not go any further, to be misused or abused?  Is the member 
satisfied, if he is in favour of Bill C-6, that very real concern 
has been addressed by Bill C-6? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think that was an 
excellent question posed by my hon. colleague from the NDP.  I 
remember when we were dealing with the particular issue in 
committee that same question was raised by a number of people 
especially concerned about, as the hon. member mentioned, the 
transfer of public sensitive documents to the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He and I may disagree at least on some of the philosophy behind 
that sort of trend happening, but what I will try to address is 
his particular question on whether or not the bill extends to 
protect privacy, if this is continuing to happen, to whoever is 
managing the particular information.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my knowledge, when we dealt with this in committee that was 
the case.  The goal was to strengthen privacy particularly in 
areas where there was sensitive documentation, whether managed 
publicly or privately, and that the same rules would apply, 
especially in the transfer of that information.  Currently we 
have strong regulations in place in many cases for privacy in 
dealing with the sale of that information to other organizations, 
especially if it is treated as confidential.  On that level, I 
was satisfied with the direction of the bill. I think it does 
deal with the hon. member's concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I will reiterate, and I mentioned this to my hon. 
colleague before, is that we should not necessarily be afraid of 
some of these private companies that are dealing with sensitive 
information because they are bound by confidentiality.  They are 
providing a service and in order for them to continue to do 
business and to have the public confidence, they have to make 
sure that they are very strict about those regulations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Edmonton 
for his proposal, his outlook and the honest and frank way in 
which he not only presented his position but also answered the 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to note that he understands, contrary to the former 
speaker, that there are many ways in which we could improve the 
bill and that maybe we still need to improve it.  I do not take 
the attitude of the member for Waterloo—Wellington that the 
government dotted every <I>i</I> and crossed every <I>t</I>.  I 
believe that in a bill such as this one, if the federal 
government wants to build support across Canada, there is nothing 
wrong with sending the bill out and asking people for their 
reasons for not approving it and how it could be improved. To 
leave the people who are going to be most involved with it out of 
that very simple process is a lack of basic understanding in a 
country as wide as Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague agree in dealing with information like this, 
that the government should be in total contact with its 
counterparts across Canada?  Should it let them look at the bill 
and give them a period of time to come back with their solutions 
and propositions so that we could study it further in the House? 
Constitutionally or by any other means would there be anything 
wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there would be absolutely 
nothing wrong with that.  My hon. colleague has asked a perfectly 
legitimate question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned during the course of my speech, it seems that the 
government refuses to want to deal with its provincial 
counterparts in a sincere manner.  It gives lip service and 
continually talks about respecting provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised the example that was pointed out by the Alberta 
government.  A working group was set up to deal with the 
provincial jurisdictional issues and bridge the gap with the 
provinces on privacy legislation.  The government did not call 
that group which was mandated by the government for a whole year 
to try to build consensus and deal with the problems that the 
provinces were raising. That gives me no confidence that the 
government is sincerely trying to build consensus and trying to 
deal with the provincial jurisdictional issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still hope that the government has the wisdom, but 
unfortunately I do not think it has, to open its eyes and try to 
make the legislation better by getting the input from the people 
who will help make it better.

speak in the debate with a great deal of interest and excitement. 
Excitement may be too strong a word given the nature of the 
debate that has taken place this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment on a statement which was made in the questions 
and comments. The issue of how one deals with this information 
and the importance of this information in the growth and 
functioning of our economy over the next decade or so is vitally 
important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support some of the statements that were behind some of the 
questions and the response I just heard.  I applaud the members 
for actually discussing the bill.  When I sat in the House this 
morning I was quite disturbed that we were not talking about the 
bill.  We were using it to play the kinds of games that are 
played in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a critically important issue.  I have spent an enormous 
amount of time working on and thinking about this issue.  I want 
to walk through some of that.  I want to suggest to members 
including the member for Souris—Moose Mountain who in his intent 
in his questions is absolutely right, that this is an issue 
which, in all of its forms and this privacy bill slices through 
one small aspect of it, will come before the House many times 
over the next decade.  It is an issue that will, it is my belief, 
cause some fundamental restructuring in how democracy functions 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have argued as recently as a couple of weeks ago in a speech I 
gave here in Ottawa that unless government begins to get its 
policy mind around what is happening with its use of information 
technologies, we will simply continue to fail in the introduction 
of information technology to government.  I want to preface those 
remarks by saying one thing.  This is not to say that this 
government and this government alone will fail.  This issue 
affects democracies all around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spent 20 years working in this area, 13 years as part of 
a research group that studies these issues on an ongoing basis. 
One of the things we discovered back in the late 1980s was that 
despite the fact that government was introducing information 
technologies, was investing in computers and connectivity and the 
high speed networks and all of those things, government was not 
demonstrating any of the structural changes that we were 
witnessing in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that if we look at what has occurred in the 
private sector over the last couple of decades, we can certainly 
see the precursors of this in very large organizations.  Back in 
the 1960s they began to adopt mainframes and started to automate 
some aspects of their operations.  The real explosion began in 
the 1980s with the introduction of personal computers. Their low 
cost gave companies the ability to adopt the technology and 
spread it widely among their employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that is observed after some period of time 
with the technology is that the organization begins to change. 
It does not just change in terms of its cost structure or the way 
it delivers services; it begins to fundamentally reorganize 
physically.  It was an interesting phenomena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are interested in this have heard about how 
organizations become flatter, they de-layer, they push some 
decisions out to the point of contact with customers.  They take 
other information back to the centre. Senior management is 
involved in decisions that otherwise would have been delegated to 
middle managers and fewer managers are intermediating.  We see 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We turn to government and we have seen in the same period that 
government spent hundreds of millions of dollars on information 
technology.  However we have not witnessed any of these changes 
that are so common in private sector organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say government has not made use of technology. We 
can send out 10 million cheques with ease.  We can do very large 
transaction based operations.  The departments shuffle around a 
bit, but essentially the structure of departments is pretty much 
what it has been for the last 20 or 30 years.  The way this place 
operates is not that radically different from the way it has 
operated historically. But the outside world has changed 
enormously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill Gates in his latest book posits in the opening chapter that 
the 1980s was the decade of quality and the 1990s was the decade 
of restructuring and the decade we are currently in will be the 
decade of velocity. 
What he is really saying is that change is taking place so 
rapidly in the private sector that the challenge for any 
organization functioning in the economy is to deal with the issue 
of constant evolution and change.  We need to be able to manage 
that as part of our ongoing environment in order to be 
successful.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like his framework for that. We heard a lot about quality in 
the 1980s. Dr. Denning was all around the world and there was 
lots of work on quality movements in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental issue with quality movement was the ability to 
have low cost networks that were powerful enough to collect 
information and feed it back to the point of decision in real 
time.  If in a supply chain or a production chain defects were 
seen in the output, the process could be modified while operating 
in order to improve the quality.  We saw the rise of ISO-9000, 
9001 and 9002 as organizations became better at heading toward 
defect free operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also brought a lot of information back to the decision point. 
Information in and of itself has some unique characteristics 
worth thinking about. This takes us into the decade of 
restructuring.  The big difference was that in the mid to late 
1980s as they began to develop networks, they were not just 
bringing back the information from one production chain but from 
a whole lot.  All of a sudden the information could be 
accumulated if they had the strength, the power and the tools and 
they could see their organization differently. For the first time 
they could actually visualize their organization.  That allowed 
them to make changes and receive feedback and see what happened. 
In the same way we would change the production system in some 
ways we would be able to actually look at and change the 
structure of the organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very good study was done on this in a book published by MIT in 
1990.  It talked about the issue of networking and the building 
of tools that allowed us to see the organization in a way which 
allowed one to affect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in government?  What is the nature of the quality 
movement in government?  What is the system that looks at 
interaction with a client, be it a tax filer, an EI recipient or 
someone who has a complaint? What is the feedback on how that is 
processed?  What is done to improve the quality of that 
interaction so that the client gets better service? Some attempts 
have been made to do that but they have not been terribly 
successful to date and there is a body of thought on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already mentioned the lack of any appearance of physical 
restructuring.  Re-engineering in government tended to become 
privatization.  A number of members in the House were active on 
the transport committee which I chaired when we dealt with the 
privatization of the ports.  There were arguments that I 
supported at the time although I now have come to think about 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument was that we had to separate the port from the 
government because it needed to innovate more rapidly.  It needed 
to make changes in real time.  It needed to be more responsive to 
local conditions in order to deal with the issue of increasing 
demand for change.  It was the velocity issue coming at us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ended up taking the ports away from government.  We said we 
would privatize the airlines, the ports, anything that could be 
justifiably privatized.  If we turn that argument around, we 
really said that government was too slow and incapable of 
functioning in today's world.  We lose something by not 
challenging ourselves to look at how these information tools can 
assist us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we accumulate information, we have an ability to view the 
organization in more holistic ways.  I want to lay out one other 
argument before I try to pull them together.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a Canadian economist by the name of Harold Innis who 
wrote extensively during the thirties and forties.  He started by 
doing standard economic studies, but as he got into one area, the 
study of the forest industry, that led him into the study of one 
of the great consumers of forest products, newsprint, which led 
him to look at communications.  I think he is one of the most 
brilliant thinkers that Canada has ever produced.  The work which 
he produced actually underpinned the work which Marshall McLuhan 
did later.  Marshall became much more famous for it, but I think 
it was Mr. Innis who really pointed the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he noted was that throughout history the dominant groups 
and cultures have been able to monopolize the knowledge and the 
information.  They maintained their control by monopolizing that 
information until another group came along with a new technology 
which knocked them off the pedestal.  Historically those were 
fought through wars, conquests and all of those other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also noted that with the arrival of systems that started to 
break down those monopolies, the classic one being the printing 
press, all of a sudden, at a low cost, people could get 
information.  More people could have it, which would educate 
people.  It was no longer simply the priests handwriting books in 
a few back rooms.  All of a sudden books could be distributed to 
a lot of people.  A lot of people could become educated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting.  There are those, and I count myself among 
them, who draw a line between the availability of the information 
and the ability to educate ourselves and the rise of modern 
democracies as we see them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who go back as far as I do, they will recall that 
during the late sixties and early seventies there was a lot of 
talk about the problems with dictatorships in South America.  One 
fellow wrote a book, which I still have and quite like.  He said 
that if we want to solve the problem of dictators and oppressive 
regimes, we should not send the population guns, we should send 
them books.  If we educate them they will sort out all of the 
other problems.  When a lot of people have access to the 
information, and when a lot of people have a common base of 
understanding, they will take charge of their own lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about that for a second.  There is a modern example of 
that.  There is a man by the name of Peter O'Toole from the 
University of California who wrote an article about how the 
Berlin wall fell as a result of the existence of fax machines. 
The East German government could no longer control the flow of 
information, hence the people could organize and communicate in 
ways they never could before.  After a while a population which 
does that cannot be controlled.  They cannot be oppressed in the 
same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing is happening in China.  I have spent a lot of 
time in China in the last few years and I am always a bit 
bemused, which is a polite word, at how every now and again they 
shut down the Internet.  There is a huge struggle going on in 
China between those who would modernize and those who would keep 
the old system.  Just recently there was an article about how 
they want to build a fire wall on the Internet to prevent the 
Chinese people from getting access to disturbing information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a funny way, as I was reading that article, I had one of 
those enlightening moments.  In many ways we are not different. 
I want to be very careful and say that by “we” I mean modern 
democracies; Europe, the U.S. and Canada.  We tend to hold too 
much information about the operation of the government and the 
exercise of power in the country in one central little group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue strongly, and I believe strongly, that one of the 
reasons we have not been able to introduce information tools to 
government successfully is because we have not confronted one of 
the underlying issues, which is the democratizing effects they 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be prepared at another time to debate direct democracy 
because I think there is a huge argument there.  I am one who 
believes that it is inevitable in some form.  But even now I 
think that some of the resistance is no different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think about it historically, when the nobles took hold of 
King John and said he had to pay attention to them, they had a 
comfortable system for a few centuries until the landed began to 
get a little more knowledge, more education and better organized. 
They said they wanted in too, and the Commons came into 
existence.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As people in the middle class developed and became wealthy, 
women became educated.  All of a sudden they said “Wait a 
second.  What is this nonsense?” and the Suffragette movement 
arose.  The same thing happened with aboriginals, and it happened 
just recently with apartheid.  It is this issue of education and 
access which I think is a very, very powerful force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to suggest that what is happening in Canada or in 
the U.S. is akin to something as severe and grotesque as 
apartheid, but there are elements of the sense of trying to 
control everything and own everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue that is why we cannot introduce information technology 
to government, because it is too disturbing.  It will always be 
disturbing until we turn the paradigm around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House where the issue of privacy arose.  When we 
looked at the issue of how we could introduce this, we kept 
hearing that privacy was the reason we could not do it.  Privacy 
was the thing that would stop it.  I always thought that was 
simply security.  I have no fear of the hackers.  We can keep the 
information secure, in large part.  That to me is a false issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We organized a bunch of individuals from departments that were 
thoughtful about this and had big client service loads.  We 
brought in some of the experts, the privacy commissioner, Mr. 
Phillips, whom I think is an extremely important thinker on this 
subject, along with others from this Chamber and the other 
Chamber, and we workshopped this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What emerged from the privacy issue that I thought was so 
important was that it was not a concern about security.  People 
accept that we can do that.  It was a concern about rights.  It 
was a human rights argument.  It was:  “What are my rights 
relative to the government?  Until we satisfy that question I 
will not be a co-operator in this”.  Once more it has that 
democratizing effect.  “I will give you information, but I want 
information back”.  That is what poses the challenge to us, and 
I believe it is a challenge which the House will have to confront 
and which the government will have to confront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was recently invited by members of the Dutch government to 
speak to them on the subject, because they are having exactly the 
same problem in the European community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting about the bill is that it is not a public 
sector bill but the same issue arises.  When the Department of 
Industry started going down this road, I argued with the 
minister.  I said that we needed privacy legislation.  He said 
“We want the regulation to be light.  We want to do like the 
U.S.  We want to have a voluntary system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is all this pro-government, anti-government, government is 
a bad thing nonsense that goes on in some of the ideological 
debates that take place here, so the department was headed down 
the road of having no regulation, following the voluntary model, 
until the people who were at the front edge of the e-commerce 
world said that if we did not have a decent privacy regime people 
would not play.  It is a powerful force when it comes to 
government, but it is the same force in business.  “I will not 
go to your business unless I have some guarantees about how I 
will be treated”.  It was the community which came back and told 
us to forget about not having regulations.  We need regulations 
because it is a customer driven business and the customers want 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important piece of legislation.  It does not go all 
the way, but I think it is fundamentally important to getting 
Canada further down the road in terms of not just e-commerce, but 
understanding and using these very powerful information tools and 
understanding the relationship between individuals and large 
powerful organizations, because I think all of us in the House 
want the control to remain with the citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I think that is as far as I will go.  There might 
be a question or two and I am prepared to go down any of the 
roads I have opened.

more people could not listen to his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a pleasant relief today to hear a speech from an 
intellectual, someone who has dealt with this issue without 
throwing some of the things that have been thrown in the House 
this morning, and for that I want to thank him very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has studied this a great deal. 
It seems to me—and correct me if I am wrong—that we are going 
to have some problems as this evolves.  The hon. member used the 
term “educate”.  Will we not have to educate people about what 
we can do in this field to protect the personalities of people, 
their bank accounts and everything else?  We have to build some 
trust into the system and somehow apply the new technology so 
that it includes a touch of a personality at the same time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems like every time we move into these fields the rank and 
file people who are not sure complain that it is impersonal when 
they make a phone call to be told to press button one, button two 
and so on, or they get a message on the fax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member not agree that it is the responsibility of 
the government first to educate and second to put a a human touch 
to what we are doing as it relates to the people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the first thought to go 
through my mind was that it used to be when we phoned someone and 
we got their answering machine we said “I don't want to talk to 
a machine.  I am tired of this”.  Now when we phone someone, if 
they do not have voice mail, we say “Damn it, I can't leave a 
message”.  Again, our understanding is shifting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raises a really good question.  When the member 
was speaking about the buttons and the voice mail, I am not 
certain whether he was speaking about the specific aspect of 
service to citizens by government.  In that I agree completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always want to say this.  I have worked with a lot of 
technicians and the information policy folks in the Canadian 
government and I think they are trying as hard as they can to 
change the understanding of this.  The argument I make is that 
this is a much more fundamentally important issue than anyone 
realizes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is bedevilling to government.  If it were easy to 
do we would have done it or someone else would have done it 
already.  Having said that, I have a lot of sympathy for public 
servants because they are beset upon all the time by the vagaries 
of this place and the hot debate that takes place in any 
democracy.  Therefore, they tend to build systems that are rules 
based, in part to protect themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member and I would do the same thing if we were subject 
to the same pressures.  It is not a criticism.  When we put them 
into a very rigid system, a computer, we have a sort of doubling 
of the effect.  We have a rigid set of rules to begin with and a 
very rigid system.  All of a sudden we create service systems 
that do the exact opposite of what we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bet the hon. member's files are full of examples.  I know mine 
are.  I actually started writing columns on stupid government.  I 
hope that over the next few years we will see, as the 
understanding improves, a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's point about education was absolutely right. 
This is new turf for all of us.  We are all just feeling our way 
around on this.  We think it is simple because we see the boxes 
and we understand it, but the boxes are just the collectors.  The 
real power lies in the fundamental information and how it gets 
used.  It will tell us things about our government and our 
country that will surprise us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my Liberal 
colleague for his obvious dedication to this topic and his 
knowledge of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned our information commissioner, Mr. Phillips, as 
being one of the important thinkers on this subject, and I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when we were concerned, as Mr. Phillips said, 
about personal knowledge being carried back and forth across the 
continent.  There has been very little attempt that I know of to 
protect, as he has suggested, this right of a person to private 
knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technology grows in both directions.  It was not that long 
ago that I first heard about identity theft and had it explained 
to me.  Now identity theft is something I hear about fairly 
regularly.  I am wondering, in light of this, if the hon. member 
sees in this legislation any of the fundamental tools which are 
necessary to protect people from great damage to their personal 
lives and to their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is fairly specific and very important and I would 
like to hear the hon. member's comments about how this bill might 
help protect people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member raised an 
important concern and I want to treat it in two ways.  I suggest 
to him that reality does not support some of the stuff we read 
about the incredible power of the hackers, the widespread nature 
of all these fanciful problems and some of the scary images that 
are drawn.  That is not to say it is not a real issue.  The 
member touched on an incredibly important area.  It poses all 
sorts of challenges to how we communicate when we communicate 
electronically.  Like any new technology there is a star wars 
scariness which the media seem to like to latch on to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the legislation solve all those problems?  No, it does not. 
I have probably been as immersed in this issues as any person, 
certainly any person in the Chamber if not in this city, and I am 
still having these little connections as I walk down this road. 
It sets in place a framework.  It has the paradigm the right way 
around.  It says that citizens have the right to be informed.  We 
must not forget that this is largely voluntarily collected 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health area is an interesting one.  There has been a change 
by the Senate which I can support.  Is that information really 
voluntarily given?  We go to the doctor and he says that he needs 
to take a test.  Are we going to say no?  We have no choice but 
to give it.  Largely this is in the commercial system.  It is 
like not government information that is often collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has the paradigm right.  I have the right to be told why the 
information is wanted.  I have the right to prevent them from 
sharing it except under conditions that I have been informed of. 
It puts a lot of control in the hands of the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of identity theft is one that the world will have to 
deal with.  We can do some things.  I noticed a number of 
companies are now working with key infrastructures that allow 
them to know that when an item came in it actually came from the 
person.  There are ways to build secure mail systems which allow 
that to happen.  The post office is working on one and there are 
other private sector examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A classic problem, which the member for Huron—Bruce was 
concerned about, was child pornography on the web and how to 
prevent and control the proliferation of it.  It is very 
difficult.  How do we do it if the picture is taken in one 
country, sits on a server in another country, the payment is 
processed in a third country and goes to someone in a fourth 
country?  There are issues which I believe have to be taken to 
international forums if we are ever to solve them.

pleasure and an honour for me to have the opportunity to speak 
on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois on Bill C-6, formerly known as 
Bill C-54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 is an act to support and promote electronic commerce by 
protecting personal information that is collected, used or 
disclosed in certain circumstances, by providing for the use of 
electronic means to communicate or record information or 
transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the 
Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are addressing a fundamental question in a society 
claiming to be as civilized, as ours does.  At the same time, we 
are addressing something that is in a way the price of 
modernity, the price of progress.  The most sophisticated of 
technologies now enable us to access what are considered the 
private affairs of individuals, and we can do so in a very 
subtle, very insidious and, let us face it, a very dangerous 
way.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Addressing this type of issue requires a fairly lofty debate. 
We need to realize that we are drawing here on the Declaration 
of Human Rights, passed 50 years ago now by the United Nations 
and subscribed to by Canada, which says that everyone has the 
right to life, liberty and security of person and which states 
the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his 
privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his 
honour and reputation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are drawing at the same time on the Quebec charter of rights 
and freedoms, which provides that “Every person has a right to 
respect for his private life”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give an idea of the scope of the question and the extremely 
important issues here, I would like to quote a very important 
passage from a statement by the executive director of the 
Commission de la protection de la vie privée du Québec, Julien 
Delisle, of Quebec, summarizing the issues facing us today. 
These remarks were made in 1996 and are still current. He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy protection is nothing less than the idea that we cannot 
live in a democracy in a free society without protecting our 
intimacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years ago, it was easy to live incognito. 
At that time private enterprise and the government sector had 
access to a lot of personal information but in unrelated bits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telecommunications and the growing amount of information have 
totally upset this delicate balance by eliminating two natural 
mechanisms protecting privacy:  the volume of paper and the 
impossibility of cross checking information from various files 
or agencies. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have here before us a very important law, which has been 
debated in this House and which has been referred, as procedure 
would have it, to the other House, commonly known as the Senate. 
The other House also addressed the issue with witnesses, as did 
the Standing Committee on Industry. 
The result, the other House having shifted the debate to health 
and thus muddied the waters even further in the view of a very 
great many people, is greater confusion than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous experts were heard, including lawyers who waded into 
the issue.  Their views were so divided and conflicting—with all 
due respect for lawyers, of which there are many, maybe too 
many, within the ranks of the Bloc Quebecois—that the debate was 
more confused than ever, and opinions often ranged widely, when 
they did not contradict one another outright. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having gone through all that, we are back at square one. 
What this means to us is that there is a major flaw in the 
federal government's approach, in its shameless attempt to once 
again trample the Constitution of Canada, which is supposed to 
govern the actions of this government and of the provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not come from us.  It comes from no less than the 
Conseil du patronat, one of the many bodies I will list later 
that supported the Government of Quebec.  The Conseil du 
patronat does not have very much in common with the present 
Government of Quebec, as we know, but it supported it and Quebec 
received incidental, intelligent and qualified support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having given the matter some thought, the Conseil du patronat 
made the following statement when it appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Industry: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so far as there is no challenge to the constitutional 
jurisdiction conferred on the provinces with respect to the 
protection of personal information and privacy under section 
80.13 of the British North America Act, and in so far as 
Quebec's lawmakers have already passed their legislation in this 
regard, it is to be expected that numerous disputes over 
jurisdiction will ensue. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So said the Conseil du patronat, and there is every reason to 
think its prediction will come true.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another a very competent person, Jacques Frémont, a well-known 
constitutional expert from the Université de Montréal, appeared 
before the Standing Committee on Industry and said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, Bill C-54, now Bill C-6, violates the spirit and 
the letter of the division of powers as it should be understood 
in this country. It proposes an arrogant and intrusive approach 
to provincial jurisdictions. Privacy protection is essentially 
under provincial jurisdiction. In Quebec, for example, it is 
property and civil rights. It is the Civil Code. It is Quebec 
law that applies in addition to the Canadian and Quebec 
charters. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This allows us to say that on the very face of it there is a 
technical flaw in this bill which, to some extent, could be 
viewed as unconstitutional since it respects neither the letter 
nor the spirit of the constitution, more specifically section 
92.13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the bill takes a giant leap that is a very serious 
infringement on what has so far been done by the provinces in 
this area, as provided for under the constitution. That leap is 
found in clause 3 of the bill, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this Part is to establish, in an era in which 
technology increasingly facilitates the circulation and exchange 
of information, rules to govern the collection, use and 
disclosure of personal information in a manner that recognizes 
the right of privacy of individuals with respect to their 
personal information and the need of organizations— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And here is what is new: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to collect, use or disclose personal information for purposes 
that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the 
circumstances. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing in this clause is that far from recognizing 
the fundamental nature of the right to privacy, it now tries to 
balance this right with the right of companies to do business. 
That leap is a very serious infringement, almost a business-like 
move, which fits very well into the current neo-liberalism where 
citizens no longer count, where they are only of interest to the 
economic system as consumers, and where—

department. It called into question the quality of management at 
the department during the period when her predecessor, the 
current Minister for International Trade, was in charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Prime Minister, this was a minor problem involving a 
mere $251. Two months later, the grants given by Human Resources 
Canada are the object of numerous police investigations, 
including three in the Prime Minister's riding. We learned that a 
$150,000 grant intended for the riding of Rosemont ended up in 
Saint-Maurice, but we do not know how the money was used. The 
auditor general calls this situation of one of the most serious 
he has seen since taking up his duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet is the fact that the Prime Minister appointed Mel 
Cappe, the deputy minister responsible for this administrative 
mess, to the position of top public servant in the federal 
government. Enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are outraged, they want a major cleanup, and this is 
urgent.

today to pay tribute to a founding father of Richmond Hill, a 
gentleman and a country doctor, Dr. James Langstaff, who passed 
away at home last Sunday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He graduated from medical school at the University of Toronto in 
1935 and for a time set up a small hospital in his home.  Caring 
for patients 24 hours a day was too much to handle with such a 
busy practice, so he campaigned for the building of a new 
hospital, York Central Hospital in Richmond Hill.  He was the 
first chief of staff, a post he held for four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first Dr. Langstaff opened his practice in 1838 on Yonge 
Street in the same house where James was born, lived in and died. 
In fact, the only time that Dr. Langstaff changed addresses, he 
did not move, the house did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 162 years there has been a Dr. Langstaff in Richmond Hill. 
My condolences to his wife, his children and his many friends. We

the issue of illegal migration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eight months after 600 illegal migrants arrived by boat, only 5% 
have had their cases finalized.  Does the government send a 
strong message to illegal migrants that people smuggling will not 
be tolerated?  No, quite the opposite. It allows 80% of those who 
come to Canada illegally to stay, whether they have been accepted 
as refugees or not.  It seems that the government will make it 
easier for people smugglers by allowing certain groups from 
certain countries to stay no matter what. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While other countries carefully respect the UN's definition of a 
refugee, this government will greatly expand that definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As unbelievable as it might sound, the government will give full 
charter protection even to those who may seek to enter our 
country.

a challenge that was launched by a number of provincial and 
territorial governments, including my home province of Nova 
Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge was launched on the grounds that the registration 
provisions of the Firearms Act are an invasion of provincial 
jurisdiction over property and civil rights.

of taxpayers' money.  The legislation will not reduce crime in 
Canada.  Those intent on committing crimes are not going to 
register their firearms.  If anything, the gun registration

to explain why neither she nor her predecessor did anything to 
address the damning indictment of her department's ethics in the 
1998 audit.  Her response was “That was 18 months ago”, 
basically, “Who cares”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that she should care because it was her government 
that was in power for the five years leading up to that audit. 
It created the problem and then it ignored it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are ethics not of concern to this government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, ethics are of concern to this government. 
From my point of view, the actions that we have taken on this 
particular audit that I have received as minister are exactly the 
right things to do.  We got the information and we made it 
public.  We told the Canadian public that we will improve our 
operation and, from my point of view, that is exactly what should 
be undertaken. 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a little story tale here. 
She said that she wanted to make it public and she made it 
public.  In fact we had to wait beyond the imposed limit of law, 
a month beyond that, before we even got this audit.  She was not 
exactly parading it around as a success story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That audit was an internal warning that there were serious 
ethical problems in the department.  I will quote from it.  It 
says “Employees were not convinced that they could report 
suspected contraventions without fear of reprisal”.  This is 
nothing to brag about; they are talking about fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is forcing honest employees to keep quiet any benefit to the 
minister?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

that this report said.  For example, it says “Senior management 
has taken steps to clarify roles and responsibilities where 
weaknesses have been identified”.  We continue to build a strong 
public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting to me is that on that side of the House, 
they, day after day, attack us for taking action, for making an 
audit public and for implementing a new strategy of action that 
will change the relationship that we have with the Canadian 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which way would they have it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

honest public servants would be proud of the job they are doing 
without political interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit said that control was a four letter word.  The audit 
said “The old virtues of prudence, probity, economy, efficiency 
and effectiveness are not as deeply embedded in the HRDC culture 
as they could be”, or probably as they used to be. Things are 
much different there now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's response was that she would “find modern 
methods” of control.  What is the important modern method?  Is it 
incompetence?  Is it patronage?  Is it waste?  Or, is it this

information when I receive it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go through this one more time.  An internal audit was 
done by the employees of the Department of Human Resources 
Development Canada, itself a control mechanism, itself a 
reference to ethical behaviour.  Within the context of our 
department we made that information public and are acting on it.

made no bones about the fact that the department fell far short 
in prudence, honesty, economy, efficiency and effectiveness, yet 
the Liberals hid that damning audit and the Liberal minister has 
repeatedly denied that there was any serious problem.

about the fact that we did a successful job of designing and 
implementing Canada's education savings grants, or that we 
deliver services consistently even when making significant 
program and organizational changes, or that we are able to 
resolve problems once they are identified as having operational 
consequences?  Why did they not talk about the department doing a 
good job of implementing program review?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

prudence, honesty, economy, efficiency and effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bad part is that the Liberals did absolutely nothing to fix 
the problem.  Only months later, when threatened with public 
exposure, did they begin to admit that they had been derelict in 
their duty.  Nothing had changed from the time of the first audit 
to the time of public exposure just a few weeks ago.

We sit down, we look at the files, we look at the intended 
results and we make our decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of continuing to be in partnership with these

now there are 78.  The minister must stop clouding the issue. 
The loan was to Placeteco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister decided not to make use of section 10.2.  Instead, 
she decided to appoint Gilles Champagne, the Prime Minister's 
buddy, as trustee for Human Resources Development Canada. 
Gilles Champagne is the lawyer for Gauthier, the future 
purchaser of Placeteco, and another of the Prime Minister's 
buddies.  Champagne and Gauthier were also creditors in the 
bankruptcy.  It would be pretty hard to find a nicer set-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the minister chosen a plan brought forward by some of 
the Prime Minister's buddies rather than doing her duty and

Speaker, nowhere in the minister's six point plan is there 
mention of protection for HRDC employees who want to blow the 
whistle on unethical behaviour, but according to the audit seven 
out of ten employees in her department felt that they could not 
expose that type of behaviour without fear of reprisal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is so concerned about cleaning up the problems

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the hon. member that it was the department that 
identified shortcomings in the internal audit and we made it

will lose their jobs if they expose wrongdoing in her department. 
This is a department that handles tens of billions of dollars

altered the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, which was 
brought into force in 1992.  We had a review of it, which took 
many years.  We now have the revised act coming into effect, 
which will improve substantially on the previous regime of the 
last century.  I look forward to being able to deal with 
shipments such as this effectively under the new legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the finance minister expressed disappointment 
in the lack of questions in the last number of weeks concerning 
his budget, but he was not as disappointed as Canadians were in 
his budget.  The $2.5 billion dedicated to health care in this 
country will keep our system running an average of three days in 
each province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the best the government can do after seven years, keep 
our system running for a mere three days? 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the Deputy 
Prime Minister said, in last year's budget we devoted $11.5 
billion in transfers to the provinces.  In the last budget we 
devoted another $2.5 billion.  That is a 25% increase over two 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, we said that we wanted the provinces to sit 
down with us.  If we can work out a way to save the principles of 
medicare, then there will be more money on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want provincial and federal governments 
bickering.  They want quality health care for Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we all realize that we want quality health care for 
Canadians.  The health ministers and the premiers recognize that. 
But the government is escaping the responsibility that was given 
to it seven years ago.  It has taken government members seven 
years to realize that there is a problem and there is still 
finger pointing, name calling and blaming someone else other than 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the minister that his government has taken $30 billion 
out of the system.  They selectively remember what they want to 
remember.  The fact is, they have taken so much money out of the 
system that they have buried the health care system.  They killed 
it.  We want it fixed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would remind 
the hon. member that our transfers in the CHST to the provinces 
are now at the level of $31 billion, the highest ever.  In 
addition, we are transferring the highest amount of equalization 
ever, which is close to $10 billion.  That is over $40 billion. 
When we consider that the total amount spent by the provinces on 
health care is around $56 billion, it is not an unsubstantial 
amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, working in harmony and co-operation with the 
provinces we are prepared to do more.

emissions trading and testing the concept of credits for prompt

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion in relation to the 
amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-6, an act to support and 
promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information 
that is collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances, by 
providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or 
record information or transactions and by amending the Canada 
Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was 
saying, before Oral Question Period, there is a fairly 
significant leap in Bill C-3 from Bill C-54. Bill C-54 dealt only 
with the basic nature of the right to privacy be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-6, we are making a leap to the recognition of the 
need of organizations to gather information and to use or 
communicate personal information for purposes that a reasonable 
person would consider acceptable under the circumstances.  It is 
a good idea to repeat this because it transfers fairly 
significantly concern about and responsibility for what was in 
the past a matter of privacy and becomes a matter of information 
that may be useful to business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ties in with the fact that societies, and the individuals 
who are part of them, are increasingly losing power and respect 
in our life as a society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government and the Quebec society reject this bill. 
In that area as in many others, a consensus was achieved whereby 
the federal measure is being condemned by everyone, by all those 
who take an interest in that issue, in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say everyone, I do not mean just anybody. Here is a 
partial list of the stakeholders. There is the Barreau du Québec, 
which is not close, except in certain circumstances, to the 
Quebec government. The Chambre des notaires vigorously opposed 
this bill, and so did the Action Réseau Consommateur, the Quebec 
Interprofessional Council and the Commission d'accès à 
l'information. The Quebec government itself formally opposed this 
legislation, through two of its ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that particularly struck me in this coalition—we 
might call it the labour management coalition—was to see the 
Conseil du patronat which, except under particular circumstances, 
is not close to the Quebec government, and the Confédération des 
syndicats nationaux, the CSN, which tends to be close to 
government, get together to denounce this bill. That in itself is 
enough to make one wonder, provided one is acting in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is perhaps what we should question about the federal 
government in this matter as in others: its good faith. In light 
of the very reasonable criticisms made, and given that Quebec's 
legislation in that area has been in existence since 1994, has 
proven its usefulness over the past six years and is well known 
all over the world, Quebec's legislation should have served as a 
basis for the federal act, but it did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders why the federal government turns a deaf ear in such 
a context. It may have reasons to do so. I am sure that many in 
Quebec share that view. If we make the intellectual effort, we 
can only wonder where we are headed. Why does the federal 
government insist on introducing such a bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is part of an operation, a vision, a new way of doing things 
in this new Canada now taking shape, this underhanded Canadian 
nation building we are now seeing here.  This came up one or two 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By signing the social union agreement, the Canadian provinces 
gave the federal government permission to interfere in areas 
that, according to the Constitution, come under provincial 
jurisdiction.  The only open opposition to the plan came from 
Quebec, through its premier, Mr. Bouchard.  But the federal 
government forges ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It worries us.  There are signs that this is all part of 
implementing the social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As proof, I wish to cite the comments made by a representative 
of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association before the 
Senate: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario and in other provinces, legislation is now being 
drafted which would make it possible to obtain health 
information from all existing sources and create a medical e-file 
on every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, together with the provinces, plans to 
create a national health information system in which these 
medical e-files would be available, along with other information, 
under the watchful eye of whomever is chosen to run it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because Bill C-6 threatens to thwart this plan that stakeholders 
from the health sector have brought such strong pressure to bear 
on the Senate and the other place— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>i.e. the House of Commons.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone who undoubtedly has privileged information uses an 
expression like “national health information system”, it is 
based on something.  And while we are on the topic of 
vocabulary, the bill states that, if a province wants to pass 
privacy legislation, it will have to be legislation, and I 
quote, “essentially similar to the federal legislation”.  The 
federal government is taking on a role for which it has no 
mandate and which is not supported by the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be kept in mind that, under section 92.13, this is a 
clearly recognized provincial jurisdiction. The anglophone 
provinces allow the federal level to act freely in an area that 
belongs to them, and the federal government tells them they must 
enact legislation that is essentially similar to its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So here we are setting up a pattern to have everything in this 
country done, increasingly, slowly but surely, the way the 
federal government wants it.  In 5, 10 or 20 years from now, 
decisions are going to be made here in Ottawa and no longer in 
the provincial capitals.  The provinces will all be considered 
on an equal footing, Quebec included, and will become, slowly 
but surely, nothing more than great big regional county 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The choice that is clearly going to be offered to Quebecers will 
be to become either an authentic sovereign country, master of 
its own destiny and its own future, or a simple province like 
the others, one in which the Quebec people will have no 
recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads us to the conclusion that this is a cleverly and 
insidiously worded bill, clandestine, non-transparent, which the 
leaders of the present federal government do not have the 
courage to defend publicly.  We have seen the initiatives it 
takes, for instance, in the area of young offender legislation, 
where Quebec has an exemplary law of its own, which will be 
trampled under foot by Ottawa's initiatives and Ottawa's dogged 
insistence on interfering in the area of health research with 
its Health Research Institutes.  The Bloc Quebecois has put the 
government's will to the test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it can be agreed that the federal level does have some 
legitimate involvement in research, it constantly stresses 
matters pertaining to health instead. 
It insists on using the expression matters pertaining to health 
instead of limiting its intervention to health research, as the 
Bloc Quebecois would have preferred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is highly significant, and we clearly feel, despite the 
weakness or the underhandedness of the federal leaders, that they 
are increasingly getting involved, in an underhanded way, in 
nation building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see it with the millennium scholarships in education, which 
is well managed in Quebec with a system of loans and grants that 
is unique in Canada.  The federal government, trampling on 
Quebec's rights once again, treating it with contempt and passing 
over the Quebec model and structure, has taken upon itself to 
intervene in a field of jurisdiction that is not its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see this with assistance to transients, which goes 
directly to the public.  We see it in assistance for home care, 
which goes directly to the public, even though home care is a 
provincial prerogative. These sectors are sacred in Quebec and, 
furthermore, they are well managed by Quebecers.  The federal 
government is using its spending power to intrude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, therefore, is an insidious instance of nation building, 
something that is very current in the problem raised by Bill 
C-20, for example.  In order to better crush Quebec, the federal 
government passes legislation, but when it comes to recognizing 
distinct society, nothing happens, because never was there 
mention of a distinct society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not with the transients, not with the millennium scholarships, 
not with young offenders, not with the institutes did they say 
“Quebec has special status; it is a distinct society”, a 
distinct society that is the subject not of a bill, but of a 
motion.  To crush Quebec, they passed Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The distinct society exists on condition that it be nothing more 
than a hollow shell, because English Canada would not agree to a 
distinct society such as the Prime Minister liked to talk about 
following his commitments at Verdun, where he dropped Quebec like 
a hot potato, just like his predecessor Mr. Trudeau, at the time. 
We must remember that.  We must have some sense of history, 
because the stakes are too high.

now, what is responsible for this contempt toward the 
Constitution of Canada. The government despises the existence of 
the people of Quebec, it does not recognize it. This bill on 
personal information is yet another illustration of that 
contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope Quebecers will take note of this type of behaviour, which 
may appear insignificant but is actually very meaningful.

member for Trois-Rivières for his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at my notes on Bill C-6, I was wondering, and I put the 
question to my colleague, how parliament could pass legislation 
that has been condemned by the Conseil du patronat du Québec, the 
Confédération des syndicats nationaux, the Barreau du Québec, the 
Chambre des notaires du Québec, the Action réseau consommateur 
group, the Quebec Interprofessional Council, the Commission 
d'accès à l'information du Québec and the Quebec government 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is several years ahead in the area of personal 
information protection. Why did neither the House of Commons nor 
the other place, which reviewed the bill and paid particular 
attention to health related issues, tale into account all the 
representations made by Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not an insidious manifestation of the fact that the 
federal government clearly realized that the whole issue of 
personal information protection is tied to a society's culture? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this government wants is to cast a single culture, the 
Canadian culture. As part of the Canadian system, Quebecers would 
have no choice but to fit in and give in to this vision, in spite 
of the fact that we, in Quebec, have had legislation in effect 
for several years, legislation that is very effective in meeting 
its objectives, and does not have a purely commercial approach, 
but truly seeks to protect personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member for Trois-Rivières could comment on 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear colleague 
from Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think my colleague raises a very important problem, which 
should be at the heart of some later debate on the future of 
Quebec as a sovereign country in the context of the Canadian 
federation, because clearly—and I tried to get this across 
earlier in my remarks—the federal government is not quite so 
determinedly setting course for centralization, excessive and 
almost unconstitutional intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Constitution is clear and that section 92.13 
says so, the Conseil du patronat talks of it, the Quebec bar 
refers to it and the major stakeholders concerned with this sort 
of question criticize it.  The government refuses not only to 
withdraw its bill, but also to make an exception at least for 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might perhaps be time to speak of distinct society.  Why does 
it not?  That is what all Quebecers wonder.  I notice the 
Minister for International Trade—a good Quebecer—who should be 
distressed by the attitudes of his government, which denies 
Quebec's distinct character, despite the motion on the distinct 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is a hollow shell, because if the federal government 
were consistent in its action, it would waste no time in the 
matters of personal information, young offenders, the health 
research institutes, the transients and so on, as is its 
practice, in finding out whether the concept of distinct society 
it proposed applies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were a Canadian, I would be a federalist and a centralist. 
My federalism would be a Pierre Elliott Trudeau-style federalism, 
in order to have a strong central government, one capable of 
making decisions to enhance Canada's competitive position in the 
world.  That is logical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a virtual necessity for the other provinces, but this is 
what is so traumatic for Quebec and the Quebec people, to be 
caught up in the infernal workings of a system in which, minority 
that we are in terms of representation, we can never gain the 
upper hand and escape being crushed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not take control, then we must call a spade a spade: 
Quebec will become another Louisiana.  That situation did not 
come out of the blue, nor did this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a process going on, one that those in power do not want 
to talk about, and I am thinking of the Minister for 
International Trade. There is a process going on here in Ottawa, 
that has been entered into in order to centralize powers, to make 
Canada a unitary state, not at the expense of Alberta, Ontario or 
Nova Scotia, but at the expense of Quebec.  Quebec is not a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
to understand today's debate, one must understand why the Senate 
sent this bill back to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister introduced Bill C-6 and it was rammed through the 
House.  It was rushed through for all sorts of reasons, some of 
them undoubtedly having to do with the political agenda of the 
Liberal members opposite.  But the bill raised many questions in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people came right out and said that the bill was not only 
ineffective but ill-timed, given what was being done in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to repeat what my Bloc Quebecois colleagues said, 
but they have raised the important point of the bill's 
constitutionality.  If I can put it this way in the House, we all 
but pleaded the case. Had the senators wanted to do something 
useful, they perhaps should have spent a bit longer on the bill 
and tried to bring the Liberal members opposite around to their 
way of thinking, since they also hold a majority in the Senate. 
They could have woken the House up.  It is often the Senate that 
is asleep at the switch, but this time it is probably the 
government members across the way, or perhaps they know what they 
are doing and once again have it in for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witnesses who appeared before the committee raised an important 
constitutional point.  I will read a passage from the testimony 
of Jacques Frémont, a constitutional expert at the Université de 
Montréal.  This is what he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, Bill C-54 violates the spirit and the letter of the 
division of powers, as it must be understood in this country. It 
takes an arrogant and ill-timed approach to provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that this is fairly clear.  These are the words of an 
emeritus professor, a recognized constitutional expert, not 
something that came out of the mouth of a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois or a nasty sovereignist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy is basically a provincial jurisdiction in theory.  In 
Quebec, for instance, property and civil rights, the Civil Code, 
and Quebec law apply, in addition to the Canadian and Quebec 
charters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not from someone who is directly involved in the issue. 
This is a professor who studied the bill and who, based on his 
experience, came to that conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conseil du patronat du Québec told the committee more or 
less the same thing, albeit in different terms. It said: 
doc. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the constitutional power given to the provinces by 
section 92(13) of the British North America Act regarding the 
protection of personal information and privacy is not at issue, 
the Quebec lawmaker has already passed its own legislation in 
this area. It is to be expected that many jurisdictional 
conflicts will surface. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The representatives of the Conseil du patronat told the 
government opposite not to legislate in this area, because it is 
not one of its jurisdictions. However, the government did so, as 
it always does, sometimes for suspicious reasons. In this case, 
it is rather striking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would have thought that the senators would have examined 
this issue. If they did, it is not reflected in their amendments 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, as we mentioned several times, but it is worth 
repeating, we already have similar legislation, which has proven 
effective over the past five or six years, which is extremely 
effective and which protects all personal information relating to 
Quebecers within the province's territory. This legislation is 
recognized and used as a model all over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I checked with the National Assembly, I was told that 
several other assemblies and parliaments have asked for copies of 
the act. They have asked about the philosophy behind it and how 
it works. I think the legislation we have in Quebec is an 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the federal government done things the same way as Quebec, 
it would not have been so bad, but this bill is an intrusion and 
creates interpretation problems in this particular case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear. The federal act intrudes into areas under 
Quebec's jurisdiction. Let us take a concrete example. Which act 
is going to apply to a business in Quebec that has information 
pertaining to individuals? Will it be the federal act or the 
provincial act? Will both acts apply? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is more or less what witnesses came to say, that the way 
the two acts will be enforced makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give examples of duplication that may lead to serious 
conflicts. At the end of the day, it is the taxpayers who will 
end up footing the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example with regard to individual consent. 
Whereas the Quebec act says that such consent must be given 
obviously, freely, in an informed manner and for specific 
purposes—it is pretty well defined—Bill C-6 says that it 
can vary depending on the circumstances. The wording is quite 
different. It can vary from one situation to the next and it 
should be explicit when dealing with personal information that 
can be considered sensitive. There is a big difference just on 
this important part of the act regarding consent for the 
collection, use and disclosure of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a lengthy bill. I will not go through all of its clauses 
because we have had ample opportunity to discuss all that 
already. But how will the courts interpret it? This is always my 
main concern, especially as justice critic. I think it is not 
going to be clear.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate has examined this bill and returned it to us with 
amendments that, overall, change nothing, nothing at all. What is 
added on?  A year longer before it comes into effect, just as far 
as health is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like you to let me know if I do indeed have 
20 minutes, because I am being given the two-minute sign, when I 
thought I had 20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several amendments proposed by the Senate.  It is 
unanimous in its opposition to Bill C-6 in its present form, 
sometimes for reasons that are totally contradictory, and one 
might wonder why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also feels this bill is poorly drafted.  This is not 
surprising; we said so on numerous occasions.  It also finds that 
medical information, which it considers more sensitive than other 
information, is not being sufficiently protected.  This too we 
have said on numerous occasions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please.  The 
hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm is correct.  There is a 20 
minute slot.  The Chair made a mistake because I thought the time 
was being split with the hon. member for Trois-Rivières.  The 
Bloc then ended up with two slots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm has another 12 minutes to

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Thank you for the clarifications, Mr. 
Speaker.  I shall try to start where I left off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Senate amendments are a good example of the fact that what 
they do is often highly inefficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think they could have sent the government a far clearer 
message about this bill.  We MPs have received certain messages, 
and no doubt the senators have received the same ones.  They 
originated with all the people who will have to apply this bill, 
or have it applied to them, at some point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have said nothing about them.  The federalists in the other 
place could have dealt with flexibility, which is a catchword 
these days.  Nearly every bill makes some reference to 
flexibility, this one included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from several letters, which will show you the 
flexibility of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 19, 1999, the minister responsible for the Quebec 
personal information protection act, David Cliche, and Robert 
Perreault—because these two ministers supervised this 
legislation—wrote to the Minister of Industry, warning him that 
legislation already existed in Quebec and not to infringe on 
Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote the second paragraph of this letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, as ministers responsible for this matter, we have 
written on several occasions to express Quebec's position in 
this regard.  Without reiterating all of our arguments, we 
remind you that this bill would not complement the Quebec 
legislation.  It would duplicate it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the ministers sought an emergency meeting with the minister 
to examine the bill and make the necessary corrections or just 
to try to convince the minister he was off track.  This was on 
October 19, 1999. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 18, 1999, the minister wrote to David Cliche and 
Robert Perrault to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that we should meet, but in the short term it would be 
appropriate for our officials to work together to discuss the 
exemption that would apply to the organizations covered by the 
Quebec legislation and any technical issues relating to the 
bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was his acknowledgement of receipt.  On February 10, 2000, 
the Government of Quebec wrote Minister Manley to say “Listen, 
we have not met, and the bill has been passed.  We have a problem. 
You are telling us someone is looking into this issue at the 
federal level and the officials should be meeting soon to 
discuss exemptions and the Quebec organizations to which the law 
will not apply”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where we stand now. I heard a Liberal member mention 
earlier that, in Quebec, they will be exempt. Such is the 
flexibility of the act. Since we have our own legislation in 
Quebec, the federal legislation will not apply. This is false 
and I hope the member who said that did not say it knowingly. I 
dare hope he was misinformed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of now, the ministers concerned, both in Quebec and Ottawa, 
have not come to an agreement, they have not even met, because 
the arrogant minister across the way refused to meet the Quebec 
ministers to discuss the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, the federal legislation will apply in Quebec. Only 
by order in council will some Quebec organizations be able to 
obtain an exemption. 
We will have to negotiate on a piecemeal basis for every 
organization. The minister, the big cheese, will have total 
control. He will say yes or no to individual organizations, as 
he pleases. This is what this government calls flexibility. 
Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the industry department, this so-called but non-existent 
flexibility is not an isolated case. I see it in the department 
for which I am my party critic, namely the justice department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently we are reviewing a bill on youth criminal justice to 
replace the Young Offenders Act. Here again, the minister told 
us repeatedly in the House “The flexibility is there for Quebec 
to keep on doing what it has been doing for the past 30 years. 
The Quebec model is not in danger; there is flexibility”.  This 
is not true either.  It is not true when we examine bills, 
whether in the case of the Department of Industry, the 
Department of Justice, or other departments.  Flexibility is a 
word catchword, these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true that there is flexibility or, if there is, it is 
always one-sided.  Flexibility always works to the advantage of 
the federal government.  I think this needs to be noted and, had 
they wanted to do something useful, the senators could have set 
this government straight and told it that the flexibility it 
refers to does not exist.  But they let the opportunity pass. 
What is the point?  What sort of work are they doing in the other 
place?  The amendments they have submitted to us change 
absolutely nothing in the application of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that many people had spoken to us and I 
suppose they also spoke to the senators.  Their comments were 
very revealing, and very carefully thought through as well. They 
had taken the time to examine the bill in depth.  I have been 
here since 1993 and I have great admiration for those who testify 
before committees.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people are disturbed by the fact that we have been here 
since 1993, but we will be here for a few more years, that is 
until Quebecers say yes to sovereignty, particularly since we 
will have a clear mandate from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> You will need a lot of votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> As a member of parliament from Quebec 
who won with some 60% of the votes at the last federal election, 
I feel much more legitimate than the hon. member, who got elected 
by the skin of his teeth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I have a great deal of admiration for the witnesses who, 
after thoroughly examining an issue or a bill, come to tell us 
about the impact of that bill. In this case they told the 
government “You are headed the wrong way”. They all said it one 
after the other, but the federal government turned a deaf ear, 
did as it pleased and passed the bill without taking into 
consideration anything these witnesses said. Indeed, I have a 
great deal of admiration for them because they keep coming back 
in the hope that, this time, the government will listen to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec Interprofessional Council, which includes 43 
professional groups regulated by Quebec's Professional Code, came 
and told the government “We are opposed to this bill. Do not do 
that”. We also heard the Conseil du patronat. We had the Barreau 
du Québec, which said “You are headed the wrong way with such a 
bill”. We also heard the Chambre des notaires and various 
associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the government did as it pleased anyway. I find it very 
deplorable that this government is not listening to the public, 
and particularly that, once again, is trampling on Quebec's 
jurisdictions and the Quebec model. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like my colleague from Berthier—Montcalm to tell us whether this 
is the first time he has seen the federal government totally 
thumbing its nose at a Quebec consensus, in all his experience 
here since 1993? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a pretty easy 
question, because we encounter the same thing on a regular 
basis,  just about daily.  One has only to listen to oral 
question period to see clearly that the government over there is 
a very arrogant government, one that refuses to answer our 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Minister for International Trade laughing.  If I were 
him, I would not be too quick to laugh, considering everything 
that is going on at Human Resources Development Canada, since he 
is in large part responsible for it, even though he is now in 
hiding.  In your place, Mr. Minister, I would not be laughing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, yes, the government over there is indeed arrogant. 
It does pretty well as it pleases, despite a consensus against 
it, sometimes even across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example that very much involves Quebec: the Young 
Offenders Act.  I see two Quebec MPs and I am sure they are not 
going to contradict me. 
There is a very broad consensus on that bill.  I have not to 
date seen a single organization in Quebec calling for changes to 
the legislation on young offenders, yet the government over 
there is preparing to make some extremely significant changes in 
order to totally alter the nature of the Quebec approach and the 
Quebec model we have had for the past 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comments have come from defence lawyers or crown attorneys, the 
Institut Pinel, legal commissions, even judges—magistrates have 
abandoned their usual reserve to tell the government “Hands off 
the Young Offenders Act”.  But it carries on regardless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government which is not listening to the population, 
and I am really anxious for the next federal election.  At some 
point they are going to get what is coming to them, just like 
their predecessors did. 
Before there is an election, there will certainly be some 
changes at the top.  We know how much discussion is going on 
among the Liberals at present.  I am dying to see the Quebec MPs 
doing the rounds in their ridings to tell people how they have 
defended Quebec in certain matters, while they have hidden out 
when asked to intervene.  I am dying to see how they will defend 
their great record in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me to speak to this bill and to say that, in my 
opinion, members of the Bloc have made a great contribution to 
this very important debate. I congratulate them on that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think many of the fears the Bloc Quebecois have raised 
in terms of the sovereignty of Quebec in this particular issue 
are fears we have to worry about to a great degree.  Where their 
contribution has been best is in analysing the shortcomings of 
this bill as a bill that purports to protect personal 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Myself, I come to this bill at this stage with the point of view 
that it is an interim measure.  I do not think it has even begun 
to address the vast problems of privacy in a world where so many 
thousands of households are connected through the Internet to 
other sites that they have little knowledge of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to give you an example, Mr. Speaker, you can do this 
yourself on your own computer.  You can be surfing the net, Mr. 
Speaker, going to sites in Canada, the U.S. and abroad.  You can 
do whatever kind of net surfing you like.  I have a program on my 
computer at home that is not a Windows program.  It is a computer 
search program.  What I am able to do with the program is, after 
having surfed the net, I can go into the deep files of the 
computer and I can get a readout, to some degree, only a limited 
degree, of the so-called cookies that have been left behind 
wherever I have visited sites, and also something called 
preferences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a classic example of what happens.  I was using a search 
engine.  You know how you are just searching around for this, 
that and the other thing.  I saw a site that said redheads so I 
called up the site. It was just a picture of pretty women with 
red hair.  It was not a porn site, Mr. Speaker, I have to assure 
you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went back after and found that topics pertaining to redheads 
kept on coming up whenever I used the various search engines for 
some weeks following.  I used the search program and went into 
the data bank.  What I found was, it was not a cookie because 
cookies are something quite different, but it was still data that 
had been deposited in my computer that biased my computer for 
searching topics that had to do with redheads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I further analysed this particular data bank of information 
in my computer, I found that it had an extensive list of my 
tastes in terms of what I had been calling up on the Internet. In 
fact, I call up a lot of science subjects because I have a 
particular interest in certain fields of science.  These were 
reflected in the list of these so-called preferences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things.  If you go to a stock site, or to a porn 
site for heaven's sake, all these things are recorded on your 
machine.  They are recorded to tell your machine to bring certain 
types of data forward when you use a search engine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if these so-called preferences are recorded on your 
machine, they are recorded on other machines.  In fact, Mr. 
Speaker, I would suggest to you that when you use your search 
engines in your home computer, what in effect you are doing is 
you are creating an intimate profile of yourself that is 
available not just in Canada but internationally.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the problem with this legislation as I see it is it 
does not go deeply into this whole issue of how we put a filter 
on this type of information.  As far as I can see, the 
legislation does not actually deal with this problem of 
distributing personal information that goes abroad and is 
obviously used commercially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically, Mr. Speaker, the legislation as I see it does try to 
put controls when you take out a newspaper subscription for 
example or when you buy certain products like automobiles and so 
on and so forth.  This legislation provides for certain controls 
on the use of that kind of data, but it does nothing as far as I 
can see to address the larger problem of controlling personal 
information that is going out on the Internet worldwide. Mr. 
Speaker, I think this is a fundamental problem that I am not sure 
there is any solution to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we have legislation before us that I think was created with 
the very best of intentions.  I have studied it actually at some 
length. I felt that basically it spins out of the existing 
Privacy Act which pertains to the documents held by government 
agencies chiefly about government civil servants and anyone who 
has had anything to do with the government or worked for the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, that is a pity because that legislation desperately 
needs an overhaul. It does not reflect the changing world where 
we have the possibility of knowing a great deal about one 
another.  I would have been much happier if this legislation had 
directed itself toward putting controls on Internet service 
providers and those who stand at the various stages at which they 
can intercept personal information and sell it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, what it does instead is it basically uses a 
commercial standard, I believe it is called. Organizations which 
are handling commercial personal information are supposed to 
conform to these standards.  Basically the principal one is if 
they have collected the information, they are not to distribute 
the information without your consent.  But, Mr. Speaker, I still 
do not see how this is going to be addressed when it comes to 
international service providers collecting information every time 
you go outside the country or even within the country when you 
are using your computer at home or your laptop in the office.  It 
is very difficult to control these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, and this is why I do not agree with the 
opposition, particularly the Bloc Quebecois' opposition to this 
bill, it does do some very positive things.  It advances the 
desire for openness.  I know that sounds odd when we are talking 
about privacy legislation, but it advances the cause of openness 
in government agencies very significantly.  Mr. Speaker, it does 
this because for the first time it brings crown corporations 
under legislation that determines how they should use 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, crown agencies currently are exempt from the Access 
to Information Act.  You cannot find out what crown agencies are 
doing.  Canada Post, AECL, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 
and many other organizations are exempt under the current Access 
to Information Act.  You cannot find out the details of their 
budget.  You cannot find out what the salaries are.  You cannot 
find out whether they have a problem with nepotism, that they are 
bringing people in as a result of who is a friend of whom.  You 
cannot find out that kind of thing.  I think the Access to 
Information Act desperately needs to be reformed in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nice thing about Bill C-6 is what it does do is that for the 
first time it brings some of these crown corporations under 
privacy regulation. It includes Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the new port corporations 
that were created by the recent port authority bill, Maritime 
Atlantic and VIA Rail. The theme being is it is looking at 
broadcasting, financial and transportation industries that exist 
as parent corporations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, this is an incredibly positive step in the right 
direction.  We can no longer tolerate arm's length government 
agencies that use taxpayers' money and are not in any way 
accountable to the taxpayer.  You cannot find out information on 
these various organizations if you want to examine their books 
because their books are not available to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill puts them under certain requirements of the Privacy 
Act in terms of the type of personal information they may 
collect.  The irony there of course is because they are protected 
under the Access to Information Act, I am not quite sure whether 
we have the other side of the equation to make sure that they are 
actually implementing the Privacy Act, as explained in the notes 
we have before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, symbolically, it is a wonderful thing for the 
government to do but it does not go sufficiently far enough.  I 
suspect as I regard this entire bill, we should take it as the 
government's intent to try to find a way not only to open up 
government documents of all kinds, but to also build a proper 
regime of protecting personal information.  But we still have a 
long way to go and I think this is only a very first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should talk a little about the amendments that have come back 
from the Senate.  These amendments pertain to defining personal 
information.  There was concern expressed in the Senate that the 
definition of personal information was far too broad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The various representations before the Senate were seeking 
better clarification of what is meant by personal information in 
terms of health related information.  The problem is that in the 
existing act the definition of personal information is very 
broad, Mr. Speaker.  It does not specify anything more than your 
name and address.  It is not personal information, and just about 
anything else you disclose is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see you yawning, Mr. Speaker.  Do I need to pick up the pace a 
little?  I will do my very best.  I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, 
forgive me.  There must be a House rule against drawing the 
attention of the country to the Speaker.  I am going to get 
myself into terrible trouble.  I will get control of the debate 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The personal information clause that comes from the Senate was 
originally a very important clause in this bill.  I think the 
senators were right to challenge this particular clause and to 
demand that it be defined more clearly.  The definition that has 
come to us from the Senate is a definition that expands the idea 
of personal information in terms of health related information. 
When you go to a doctor and give information, that should be 
personal information and should be specifically protected in this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest, and I do not want the Senate to send the bill 
back after we send it up there, but I think it put its finger on 
something very important.  My problem with personal information 
is when you make it too broad.  The reality is that there is a 
lot of personal information that we divulge that we do not care 
about.  I come back to the whole idea of commercial information. 
When you purchase something at Radio Shack it asks us for our 
name and address. Obviously, it is going into a data bank that is 
building up a personal profile.  Most people are not bothered by 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is directed precisely toward that sort of thing 
and says that this should be regulated and that information 
should not be distributed without your prior consent.  I suggest 
to you, Mr. Speaker, that nobody cares about that kind of 
information. Nobody cares about what kind of automobile you buy 
because when you buy a brand new Buick or a Volvo or an Audi or a 
cheap Ford, if you will, you advertise your purchase every time 
you drive that car. 
It is no secret.  So why that data should be subject to this 
legislation I do not know.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, where the senators are correct, there is a 
type of personal information that we do guard.  One of the types 
of information that we do want to guard and protect is medical 
information.  Hence, I believe this amendment is apropos, but I 
would have pursued it further.  I would have suggested that 
another type of information that we would have like to have 
safeguarded and we should specify in legislation like this is 
financial information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that we are not very certain.  There is a huge 
difference between people knowing how much is in your bank 
account or how much is on your credit card or what your 
indebtedness is than what purchases you make.  I would have 
thought this bill would have been far stronger if it had 
specified that financial information is something that should be 
specifically protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I would have thought in terms of personal information 
what a religion is should be specified as something that should 
be protected.  It is no one's business knowing what religion, 
what denomination or whether you have a religion in terms of what 
is available in terms of personal information that can be bought 
and sold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will switch back to my suggestion about the Internet.  I see 
there are some members from the Reform Party who are watching 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  There are quite a few members and I am 
very pleased.  I know that they have a particular type of 
constituency, not 100% this type.  I do not want to characterize 
them too specifically, but there are a lot of people who support 
the Reform Party who are associated with Christian fundamentalist 
organizations.  They would be appalled to know that their 
religious association is easily identified by the way they use 
the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, as I was saying before, Mr. Speaker, where you go 
on the Internet leaves a trail that is recorded not only on your 
machine but on parent machines elsewhere.  It can be in the 
United States or anywhere else.  I have noticed, Mr. Speaker, 
that the religious denomination, be it Christian, Muslim, be it 
whatever, by the way you actually search the Internet becomes 
part of your profile.  Suddenly people in the United States, 
people anywhere in the world who are the masters of this 
information can profile you wherever you are because you have 
used your computer to go to various sites that are related to 
your particular religious interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can see, Mr. Speaker, that I have been doing a lot of work 
on the Internet.  Similarly you can do the same thing if you are 
an ethnic Canadian and you are interested in, say, India.  You go 
to various sites that are either in India or are related to 
people who are from India who have been in the country for some 
time, organizations that may exist in Canada or wherever.  You go 
to those sites, Mr. Speaker, and you build a profile so someone 
can tell who you are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing about this legislation, the fact that it does not aim 
at this type of personal information and it does not specifically 
protect this type of personal information I think is an 
inadequacy.  It does not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got interested in this in the second reading debate.  I have 
to say that the minister was very receptive to this type of 
criticism.  One of the things that happens in a debate in the 
House of Commons is that we do not all get our way because of 
course it takes time to make an amendment and you do not know the 
impact.  Sometimes, even if the minister likes an amendment or 
something is proposed from the opposition, you cannot implement 
it immediately simply because you do not know the full 
ramifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was able to persuade the minister to accept an amendment that 
I put forward.  That amendment was actually to the definition of 
commercial activity.  What it did was it expanded the definition 
of commercial activity to include non-profit organizations and 
political parties.  The reason I did that was because I am aware, 
as so many members are and other people, that many charitable 
organizations and even political parties collect fundraising 
lists. 
When you donate to them they collect that information and they 
give that information to central suppliers, central information 
moguls in the United States, who then send out direct mail 
advertising missives usually to senior citizens and the 
vulnerable.  A lot of people have lost a lot of money as a result 
of this program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister accepted an amendment that brings that type of 
activity under this legislation.  I think that is very positive, 
but it does not go anywhere in addressing the problem of people 
using the Internet and these information czars in who knows 
where, in some hyperland that may be hovering somewhere over 
southern California.  They collect that information and they 
know, Mr. Speaker, about you, about you, about you and about me. 
That is a very dangerous thing.  This legislation moves in the 
right direction, but we have a long way to go. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I caught only portions of the speech 
of the hon. member to whom I always enjoy listening.  I just want 
to correct him.  We have a new name.  It is the Canadian 
Alliance.  We are quite proud of it.  I might even make the same 
mistake too because we kind of get used to one thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate what the member has said.  I have been a consensus 
commissioner.  Members already know what a commissioner has to do 
for those who have failed to file their forms, saying that it was 
confidential information.  In some cases I agreed with them, but 
it was on the census form.  I have done other surveys too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member not agree that the government should 
always consider the information it seeks from an individual and 
apply it to the act, which will undoubtedly be passed, to make 
sure the information it is seeking is in total accord with the 
bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I mention that is that recently people in 
Saskatchewan are in hard times and they have filed AIDA forms. 
One of their fears was the bottom of the form where it is 
indicated that if they file the form incorrectly they are subject 
to the usual fines.  They went ahead and filed the forms and then 
by coincidence or otherwise they were at the same time or within 
a few months being audited by Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member see what I am getting at?  Did that one 
government form fall into the hands of Revenue Canada?  We will 
never know.  How do we guarantee that information is not shared 
when statistics about the number of cattle a farmer has on hand 
is collected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know these forms are valuable.  They are of help to Canada. 
They are of help to the government.  However, how do we guarantee 
to Canadians that when such forms are filled out they will not be 
shared with other departments and will be kept strictly in the 
department of statistics or whatever?  That is the key.  I am 
worried about that because I have not fully convinced myself that 
there is not cross-government sharing.  I would like the hon. 
member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as far as I am aware, 
Statistics Canada is covered by the Statistics Act.  That act 
provides for absolute confidentiality.  It is actually quite an 
interesting piece of legislation because that confidentiality is 
supposed to go indefinitely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is probably aware that there is quite a movement in 
Canada right now to try to open some of the very old census 
records.  Contemporary Statistics Canada data are absolutely 
protected.  He should certainly assure his constituents that they 
do not have to worry.  It is protected from other departments. 
Otherwise, I would have to say, if it is not protected when 
collected by Statistics Canada there would be a serious breach. I 
think we have to take it at face value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raises another issue that is related to that, and 
that is this whole question of when a farmer, say in the 
Saskatoon area, has to sign on to a government program, the 
disaster relief program or whatever other program.  He has to 
disclose by the very act of signing on to a program that he has 
financial difficulty.  This is the kind of financial information 
that I was talking about. 
It is very, very clear that when information is collected that 
reflects on the financial status of individuals it needs to be 
protected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure this kind of information is protected under Canada's 
Privacy Act as it pertains to this kind of program, but remember 
Bill C-6 actually goes beyond the government and goes into the 
general community.  It is really talking about corporations and 
private enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where we have the problem, or at least I have the 
problem.  I think that is where the member raises a very, very 
serious point, because you can be a small entrepreneur, a farmer 
or whatever else, and as a result of running on hard times you 
may be making purchases or not making purchases.  Not making 
purchases is a form of information.  Not buying seed grain in a 
particular year is an indication of what you are doing.  It is 
that kind of financial information that may be moving around 
there that would enable people commercially to create a profile. 
Then you know what happens, Mr. Speaker.  They cannot borrow. 
Then they are stuck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just think the member raised a really important issue.  Again 
I believe this bill is an interim bill.  I know the minister is 
listening.  I think this is a point that needs to be examined, 
because we all know the trouble that is happening out on the 
prairies and I think these people need the protection of a good 
privacy law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree that there is a 
need for the protection of privacy act laws with regard to 
agriculture and individual people, but the protection we need to 
a certain extent is protection from big government collecting 
ever more information on the activities of average Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many farmers in my riding have called me saying that they have 
received phone calls.  A strange person on the phone wanted to 
know how many cows and how many calves they had, whether they had 
grain in the bin and what they had for breakfast that morning.  A 
lot of people do not know who is calling them and resent that 
type of information gathering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear resentment in the west toward the government we 
find that one of the biggest most recent causes is somebody 
phoning from some unknown source in Canada, the United States or 
wherever, representing who knows whom.  Statistics Canada and the 
whole operation of the Liberal government have to be examined and 
seen for what they really are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also resent some of the activities of the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington.  He makes a point of trying to put the new 
Canadian Alliance into a pigeon hole on which to further base the 
deception that the Liberal government will continue with over the 
course of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does member support the government legislation with regard to 
same sex benefits?  Does he support the Liberal government that 
is continuing to promote and advance abortions in the country? Is 
he in fact saying anything on behalf of Canadian farmers with 
regard to rail transportation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  This has nothing to do with the piece of legislation we 
are discussing.  Where is this member coming from?  I think you 
should bring him to order, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington needed someone to be a defender, I 
certainly would have intervened.  Knowing the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington as I do and being assured that he can keep 
me awake at all times, I did not think that he needed anybody to 
defend him.  He is quite able to look after himself so we will 
let the hon. member for Selkirk—Interlake finish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my final point is that 
the statistics that are gathered enable the government to advance 
its social agenda, which to a lot of Canadians is extremist in 
nature, and I would like him to answer that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite 
complains about government collecting data before it agrees to 
award grants to organizations.  That is precisely the Canadian 
Alliance's complaint with respect to the HRDC file.  It is 
because the HRDC bureaucrats failed to do their homework in some 
instances, failed to get enough data about who was receiving 
money and failed to examine the credentials of those people 
receiving the money, that we have some problems in HRDC right 
now.  If the government is going to give money to anyone it has 
to find out who that person is and whether they are entitled to 
the money.  So it has to ask close, probing questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that we have passed through a terrible age of 
political correctness in which too many bureaucrats have failed 
to ask the questions they should have asked.  If people go to 
borrow money from a bank they darn well have to answer certain 
questions about how much acreage they have under cultivation and 
what are their basic assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Bill C-6 is all about is that the existing privacy act 
protects this kind of information when the government collects it 
but when private corporations collect it there has not been 
adequate protection.  The member is quite right. If the people in 
his community are answering phone calls from someone that they do 
not know, maybe someone from the United States, that is precisely 
the problem and that is precisely the problem that Bill C-6 
addresses, except, in my view, it does not address it quite 
specifically enough.  I think it has to be much harsher, much 
more direct and much more specific than what currently exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least this party on this side of the House does want the 
government to ask those probing questions of any organization or 
any person it is going to give money to because it is taxpayer 
money.  We are entitled to know how that money is being spent. If 
people want money from the government they darn well had better 
show some evidence as to why they deserve that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that, except in cases where a person's real 
personal financial information will adversely impact on the 
person's future, then of course it should be protected. I wish 
this legislation protected that kind of information more 
specifically.  Nevertheless, it is going in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the member's other remarks, they are a little off 
topic.  However, I have to say that I think Bill C-23 is an 
excellent piece of legislation, particularly because finally it 
defines marriage in law as a union of one man and one woman to 
the exclusion of all others.  I think that is a very fine thing 
that the government did. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am rising today to speak to Bill C-6. I would 
like to begin my remarks by reminding members of a terrible 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill found virtually no support in Quebec because Quebec 
already has legislation dealing with the protection of personal 
information. It came into force five years ago and it goes a lot 
further that the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I listened to the exchange between my two colleagues 
from the Canadian Alliance and from the Liberal Party. I could 
see all the difference there is between Quebec and the rest of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, having reached a consensus, passed legislation on the 
protection of personal information that strikes a balance 
between supporting trade and ensuring that individuals are 
protected with regard to personal information pertaining to 
them. That legislation is used as a model throughout the world. 
It is one of the first acts of this kind ever to come into force 
and it is the most balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, here, in the House, members of the Canadian 
Alliance say that it is government interference. Now we 
understand better why the bill proposed by the federal 
government is so bland. It proposed a bill that deals with the 
issue of electronic commerce without dealing directly with the 
protection of personal information. 
That is probably why the Conseil du patronat du Québec and the 
Confédération des syndicats nationaux or CSN—employers and 
unions, and that says a lot—all expressed their opposition to 
this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec bar and the Chambre des notaires du Québec, those who 
deal daily with information and contracts, whose job it is to 
advise employers, business people and industrialists on how to 
manage information are saying this is a bad bill, and we already 
have our own legislation in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why such duplication? A few years down the road, we will 
probably have two court cases to try to decide which one 
prevails, and to find out what to do in such or such a situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the federal government decided the Quebec legislation 
applied in Quebec, not the federal one, nothing would prevent an 
employer or an individual who felt unfairly treated by the act, 
to claim that the federal government's decision was not valid. It 
would be a terrible legal mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Action Réseau Consommateur is another opponent to the act. It 
got the picture right away. The federal act will protect people 
involved in e-commerce, but it does not protect them the same way 
the Quebec act protects every citizen. Today, people who look at 
consumer issues know the importance of telemarketing and the way 
the new technologies are being used, and abused, to reach people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the Conseil interprofessionnel du Québec and the Quebec 
access to information commission are opposed to the bill. The 
members of the commission are experts who, in the past, developed 
an interesting approach to dealing with personal information. 
They analyzed the situation and testified before the committee 
that, in their opinion, the bill was not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several years after the Quebec government acted responsibly and 
passed legislation which has been well received across Quebec, 
the federal government is stepping in. Quebec can see the legal 
and administrative complications that will stem from such 
duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not surprisingly, Bill C-6, which was formerly known as Bill-54, 
was hardly changed at all at that stage. Today, the bill is 
being amended by the Senate. This is why it has come back to the 
House of Commons. The Senate has proposed amendments to exempt 
for an additional year the health sector from the provisions of 
the bill dealing with the protection of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way, this is proof that the bill was hastily thought out 
and has not been fine-tuned. Even after C-54 and after C-6, we are 
now seeing amendments being tabled by the Senate to exempt the 
health sector when this problem was resolved a long time ago in 
the Quebec legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a bit surprised that the federal government did not use 
it as a model from the start. This was all covered in the Quebec 
act. If the federal government wanted appropriate legislation 
for the rest of Canada, this was the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec act applies to all sectors. It applies to the health 
sector. It is very clear on the matter of consent. Section 21 
states that, with the permission of the Commission d'accès à 
l'information, organizations may disclose without consent 
information from which personal information has been removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister had used the Quebec legislation as a model for 
his bill on the protection of personal information in the 
private sector, we would not be in the mess we are in right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will oppose the Senate's amendments, because 
they do not change the principle of the bill, which the Bloc 
vigorously opposed in order to protect Quebec's jurisdiction in 
the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments could result in one of three things: they may 
change nothing because there is no consensus and the boondoggle, 
as described to the senatorial committee, will continue; future 
amendments will be consistent with Quebec's legislation and will 
not cause any particular problems in Quebec; in the worst case 
scenario, the proposed amendments contradict Quebec's 
legislation, and once again the federal government will 
establish national standards in a strictly provincial area, 
which will create duplication and confusion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realized, when reading the proceedings of the Standing Senate 
Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology, that the 
most reputed experts give totally different interpretations of 
the legislation. This bill was drafted initially for consumers, 
to give them confidence in e-commerce, but reputed Canadian 
lawyers have diametrically opposite interpretations of the bill. 
How will consumers figure it out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the Senate's discussions raised a number of problem areas 
that had already been identified by the Bloc Quebecois: 
jurisdictional duplication, confusion, and contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Bloc Quebecois notes that the minister has agreed 
to bring forward, at the report stage, amendments to satisfy the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service and announced that he 
approved the amendments recommended by the Senate to deal with 
the concerns expressed by the health sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But he dismissed out of hand numerous requests from the Quebec 
government and the civil society, asking unanimously that Quebec 
be exempt from the application of the legislation in order to 
avoid constitutional problems and duplication of regulations. In 
so doing, the Minister of Industry, like his government, is 
taking a hard line against Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are faced with the evidence. This bill was put through by 
closure. The government made a decision. For Quebecers, this is 
a good example of the kind of country they live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A decision was made by the federal government to build the kind 
of Canada it wanted for all of Canada, to the detriment of any 
other form of development. While the Quebec society gives itself 
its own tools and is ahead in many areas of social policy, the 
federal government fails to take an approach flexible enough to 
give Quebec the breathing room it needs to reach its goals and 
put in place its policies, and Bill C-6 is an example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to a paper prepared by the hon. member for Mercier, 
entitled “Bill C-6 Promoting E-Commerce at the Expense of 
Privacy”. That is really the spirit that we found in the bill. 
It is best illustrated by the fact that it emanated from the 
Department of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite normal for that department to adopt a commercial 
approach, but nowhere do we see the balance found in Quebec's 
legislation, which has been in effect for several years and has 
made the protection of privacy one of the highlights of 
government action in Quebec.  It has allowed for proper 
decisions that have led to adequate jurisprudence and 
interesting results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 is another case of the federal government deciding to 
impose its perspective and to refuse to confirm in its 
legislation that Quebec's legislation will take precedence in 
Quebec. 
A clause of this bill deals with equivalent legislation, and 
there is probably one in Quebec which could be recognized as 
such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, during debate in the Senate, it was realized that even 
if Quebec's legislation is substantially similar to Bill C-6 and 
will probably be designated as such, since it is set out in a 
different scheme than Bill C-6, it would be helpful to know on 
what basis the decision was made, although, in the absence of 
any criteria set out in the legislation we are, in a sense, 
operating in a bit of a vacuum.  This is what Anita Finnberg, 
Counsel, Legal Services Branch, Ontario Ministry of Health, 
pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Murray added that this was a very good point, and wanted 
to know on what basis the department, or perhaps the minister 
himself, could indicate that Quebec's legislation met the 
criteria of the clause dealing with “substantially similar” 
provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the federal government were to say “It has been decided 
that the Quebec legislation was sufficiently similar and that it 
is to be considered the legislation that will apply within 
Quebec”, a lawyer might well defend the interests of his client 
by saying “There was even discussion in the Senate, when the 
bill was passed, to the effect that it was very difficult to 
identify whether a statute could be considered similar.  It 
appears to me that, in the present case, the federal government 
has erred and the Quebec legislation ought not to have been 
considered similar, and consequently I choose to take this to 
all levels of the court system”.  This would cost a considerable 
amount.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is probably the situation the Conseil du patronat had in 
mind when it expressed opposition to the bill, saying “If there 
is one thing we at the Conseil do not need, it is more 
duplication, more ways of doing things so that we cannot operate 
properly and are stuck dealing with an inadequate bureaucracy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the only thing involved had been facilitating e-commerce, we 
would, of course, all have been in favour. 
The other side of the coin, protection of privacy, would, 
however, have had to be well developed, would have had to be 
working properly, and we would have needed the assurance that 
the legislation will be well balanced and will offer sufficient 
protection, both to consumers and to business operators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we are dealing with a bill much debated in the 
House of Commons, first as Bill C-54 and now as Bill C-5.  Yet 
never have we had the impression that it was a bill that had 
been properly fine-tuned, one that would achieve the desired 
results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who spoke before me concluded by describing this 
as an interim bill—and this was a member of the Liberal majority. 
He called it an interim bill, and thus one that would need 
considerable improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that, at this stage, we should say to people in Quebec 
and in Canada that we have not completed our work, that we 
should look at this again and find a more balanced solution, 
instead of passing an interim bill that will have to be reviewed 
in two, three, four or five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation on electronic commerce must be flexible and, at 
the same time, it must send clear messages. The bill before us 
does the opposite. Here is an example where the federal 
government is intruding in an area where the provinces could 
easily have taken action, as Quebec did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is true that, elsewhere in Canada, people want the same 
legislation enforced across the country, why was it not 
mentioned in the bill that a province can, if it so wishes, be 
exempted from the application of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then all the organizations opposed to this bill—the Conseil du 
patronat du Québec, the Confédération des syndicats nationaux, 
the Barreau du Québec, the Chambre des notaires, Action réseau 
consommateur, the Interprofessional Council, the Commission 
d'accès à l'information or the Government of Quebec—would have 
supported it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can imagine how different things would have been if the 
federal government had just admitted in this bill that, because 
Quebec already had its own legislation and because this is a 
matter under its jurisdiction, its choice would be respected and 
that Quebec would be allowed to enforce its own legislation. 
It also could have taken from the Quebec legislation everything 
it found beneficial. We would have avoided debate on amendments 
by the other Chamber to exempt health, when Quebec has already 
provided in its legislation a practical way that has been in 
effect for several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Possibly in view of its disproportionate taxation capacity and 
bureaucracy compared to its mandate, the federal government 
feels obliged to draft this type of bills, when we do not really 
need them. In particular, it tries to ram them in the House, 
forgetting that the Canadian mosaic contains an important 
element, Quebec, which has its own personality, its own 
approach, its own Civil Code. 
Instead of taking this into account, it decided to impose 
federal legislation on Quebecers within an area of jurisdiction 
already well covered by Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all those reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will be voting against 
Bill C-6.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK193">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion in relation to the 
amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-6, an act to support and 
promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information 
that is collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances, 
by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or 
record information or transactions and by amending the Canada 
Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute 
Revision Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the 
hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton, Justice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply cannot 
pass this one up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill conflicts with legislation that already exists in 
Quebec and which received unanimous support. Not too long ago, 
another bill received unanimous support in Quebec, which the 
federal government tried to undermine by imposing its own view. 
I am referring to the young offenders bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of Quebec, all those involved with young offenders were 
unanimous in saying that the existing legislation in Quebec is 
working because it is well enforced and that it can usefully 
contribute to the rehabilitation of young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the federal government introduced in the House a bill 
designed to standardize the way young offenders are dealt with. 
They want to deal with them differently, based on some unproven 
philosophy. It would have been advisable to include in this bill 
a provision stating that Quebec may continue to implement its 
own legislation, which has proven to be effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we have another bill that is reminiscent of how Ottawa 
reacted to Quebec's young offenders legislation. Bill C-6 does 
not suit Quebec, because we already have legislation that 
protects our citizens well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have suggested that the federal government use Quebec's 
legislation as a model, that it draw what was good from it and 
apply it to other provinces willing to use it. Quebec would be 
able to use this act for its own benefit, without any 
discrimination, without prejudice to the other provinces. But 
things did not turn out that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question to the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. Why does he think 
the federal government always tries to force on Quebec 
legislation that is different from legislation that already 
exists in Quebec and which works well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
comment and his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good question, particularly if one thinks about what is 
now going on at the federal government level with respect to 
access to information.  The access to information commissioner 
testified before the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities that the 
federal government's management of information was in a state of 
crisis.  Those were his words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard the privacy commissioner.  I brought forward a 
motion that received unanimous approval in the House proposing 
that all crown corporations be subject to the Privacy Act.  This 
motion received unanimous approval here a few years ago.  Since 
then, the federal government has been dragging its feet and has 
done nothing about making crown corporations subject to the 
Privacy Act, despite the unanimous approval the motion received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation has to be looked at in the broader context. 
There is also the way in which the federal government handled 
the social insurance number issue.  Things had reached the point 
where there were more people over the age of one hundred in 
Canada than in China or in the United States, because of the 
very poor monitoring of social insurance numbers.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that it is not a very good idea for the 
federal government to be legislating in this sector where its 
own track record is not very good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Joliette was asking me what this situation tells 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that it tells us that we are dealing with a central 
government that wants to control how things are seen in Canada. 
There is only one way to see things and it is the one imposed by 
the concerns and wishes of the top federal bureaucrats, who have 
their own vision of Canada and of the way things should be done, 
and who definitely do not want to stop, because other people 
have already developed approaches as efficient as theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a perfect example of that attitude in this case. The 
Government of Quebec has a good legislation on personal 
information protection. It has been adapted, revised and it 
works. It is one of Quebec's finest piece of legislation. It is 
cited as an example world-wide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of representations made by all stakeholders in Quebec, 
organizations such as the Canadian Bar, the Conseil du patronat 
du Québec, labour unions, consumer advocacy organizations, the 
Quebec government and the Commission d'accès à l'information, 
which are familiar with the information protection sector, the 
federal government could not make a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those people came to tell us “We do not mind you passing a 
law for the rest of Canada, which will meet your expectations. 
If what you want is to provide greater protection for e-commerce 
than for consumers, that is your business, but leave our 
legislation be”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government would not, that is why the Bloc Quebecois 
will vote against the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague from Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques 
talked about duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those watching us, I would like to ask him 
this: Could such duplication place extra costs on taxpayers in 
Quebec, where there is already an act on personal information 
protection, now that the federal government has decided to 
interfere in its jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, two situations can occur: either it 
will be recognized as similar by the federal government or it 
will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases, it could happen that an individual or an 
entrepreneur, someone involved in electronic commerce for 
example, would go to court and say “The fact that the federal 
government has make its legislation similar to the Quebec 
legislation seems unacceptable to me. The criteria are not clear 
and well defined. Therefore, I do not accept this recognition by 
the federal government and want the federal legislation to apply 
in my case because the Quebec legislation is more restrictive 
for me”. We could see this kind of situation, and it would 
create duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the other situation where this bill will probably 
be passed. The Liberal majority seems intent on imposing it on 
us. 
Well, there will be a period where it will apply and where the 
Quebec legislation will not necessarily have been recognized as 
similar. During that period where both acts apply, we could have 
very serious legal complications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's society, most people do business through the 
Internet. We do not know what kind of situation will occur. 
Which legislation will apply to an electronic commerce 
transaction between a client from a Quebec-based business dealing 
with an Alberta-based business, or between a resident of New 
Brunswick and a Quebec-based business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not very clear, unless there is explicit recognition by 
the federal government, which should have been included in the 
bill. 
It would have been clear and would not have been open to 
interpretation. We are now left with a bill that is too vague 
and that will be open to interpretation and will lead to 
considerable legal costs and perhaps, ultimately, to people 
being hurt by an interpretation that does not guarantee adequate 
protection of personal information, like the legislation passed 
by the Quebec National Assembly, contrary to the one this 
parliament is about to pass.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak again today to this important legislation, Bill C-6. Once 
again, this bill shows that the federal government is not 
minding its own business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, when the Liberal government took power in this 
House, we have seen that they stepped up their invasion of 
provincial areas of jurisdiction. But before going any further, 
I would like to say how abused I feel once again today, in this 
parliament, how I figure there is less and less democracy, as 
yet another gag was imposed this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time allocation motions limit debate for all members of the 
House. We feel more and more that this government has a 
centralization agenda designed to invade practically all the 
powers of the provinces, since the Canadian Constitution is not 
enforced anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one looks at all series of bills that have been passed 
since 1993, one realizes that the situation is becoming 
dangerous. One wonders how far this government will go to attain 
its goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This project dates back to the time when Pierre Elliott Trudeau 
was elected, in 1968. The present Prime Minister was one of his 
loyal henchmen. They started a process to make this country a 
centralized one, a country taking over provincial powers. I will 
not recall the dark moments that marked democracy in Quebec. But 
the same thing is happening with Bill C-6. 
When the history of that party is being written, it will be said 
that it has constantly applied itself to invading areas of 
provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, if only Bloc Quebecois members were denouncing 
this situation in today's debate on Bill C-6, it could be said 
that this is because of our specific character, our specific 
nature as a party.  But no, I have here a list of all those who 
are opposed to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an increasing realization that there is a consensus in 
Quebec from all communities.  They are joining forces in 
opposition to this bill.  I will give a few examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the Conseil du patronat, the Confédération des 
syndicats nationaux, better known as the CSN, the Barreau du 
Québec, the Chambre des notaires du Québec, the Conseil 
interprovincial du Québec, the Commission de l'accès à 
l'information du Québec, and finally the Government of Quebec. 
It can be seen that employers, labour unions, professional 
associations and the Government of Quebec all oppose this bill, 
now known as Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, why create a precedent, when Quebec already has the 
necessary tools to do this?  Why create one more tool, when 
Quebec has what is necessary, and what is more it is more 
efficient than what is being proposed in this bill today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize the government never takes the time to consult its 
associates or its potential partners.  That too has been a 
trademark of this government since 1993.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only has to look at how the current Minister of Health is 
about to try to impose his national vision. There again, the 
provincial health ministers and premiers will have to get 
together and create a consensus to try to prevent this intrusion 
into the health sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes in the case of Bill C-6. Some might say that every 
time Bloc Quebecois members rise they raise such issues. I often 
think I should make copies of the Canadian constitution and 
distribute them to all the Liberal members opposite. They would 
learn that this constitution, their constitution, gives 
exclusive rights to the provinces. 
But these rights have been ignored and the federal government is 
increasingly trying to dismiss the constitution. This leads to 
friction and disputes with Quebec and with the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to discuss some of the amendments made to Bill C-6, 
formerly Bill C-54, which died on the order paper when the first 
session of this Parliament was prorogued. Members will remember 
that my colleague, the hon. member for Mercier, had worked very 
hard to prevent passage of that bill. Now, Bill C-6 is back with 
the amendments proposed by the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the Senate proposes the following amendments: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the health sector is unanimously opposed to Bill C-6 in 
its present form, sometimes for totally contradictory reasons; 
because it feels that, in its present form, the bill does not 
adequately protect medical information, which it deems more 
sensitive than other types of information, and because the 
notion of commercial activities in the context in which the bill 
applies is almost impossible to define in the health sector. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the senators in the Upper House were made aware 
of the fact that the bill does not at all respect the Canadian 
and Quebec reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a motion that he brought forward in the 
House on February 7, the Minister of Industry indicated that he 
would accept certain amendments from the Senate. We then thought 
that the minister would follow up on the concerns expressed by 
the various stakeholders who will have to live with the 
consequences of Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 is a fundamental piece of legislation. With the changes 
happening in the multimedia area, the issue of personal 
information is one that must be looked at. We do not have the 
necessary tools to protect privacy because information is being 
transmitted at such a high speed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around 20 years ago, the fax machine was introduced. Today we 
have digital radio. We can receive radio and TV programs 
anywhere in the world thanks to satellite dishes. Then there is 
the whole issue of Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure, people are increasingly concerned when they have to deal 
with these new media and these new ways of communicating such as 
Internet. They wonder whether all the information they have will 
be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, more and more people have been shunning traditional 
ways of doing business. They use the Internet. When they see a 
bill taking away things that are guaranteed by the current 
legislation in Quebec, there are worried.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its very difficult to understand the attitude of the Liberal 
government who, month after month, has been multiplying its 
efforts to centralize and just about take away the powers of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this government looking for? There is not one piece of 
legislation currently before the House that reflects the reality 
in Quebec or in Canada. Where do they get their ideas, all these 
ministers, their officials, their researchers, all those who 
gravitate around government circles, all those who gravitate 
around the Liberal government? Why do they not consult the 
provinces and the people concerned more often? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are always having to fight in this House to correct the 
injustices that are increasingly flagrant in this government. 
Recently, it again imposed a bill on us, Bill C-20.  The 
government also tried, in its effort to meddle in health matters 
with Bill C-13 and today with Bill C-6, to redo what Quebec has 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another law dear to my heart is the one on young offenders, the 
one that once again everyone in Quebec unanimously opposes. 
Basically, all the government is trying to do is substantially 
amend the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec truly gives effect to this law, and the Liberal 
government will try with these amendments to meddle and change 
the rules.  Basically Quebec and English Canada are very 
different, and this becomes clear with this legislation on young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is the same with Bill C-6.  Why penalize Quebec, 
which is out in the lead?  Why penalize the Government of 
Quebec, which always puts forward more realistic and appropriate 
laws that truly meet the needs of the people of the 21st 
century?  Why does the federal government insist on taking away 
the rights of the people of Quebec and the National Assembly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past two years in this House, whether with Bill C-54 or 
with the current Bill C-6, the members who have opposed it since 
it was introduced have not budged.  They have continued to 
oppose Bill C-6 openly, while across the way, they continue their 
bulldozing and their desire to have the bill passed quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that this government never takes time to consult. 
If there is a consultation, and I am again thinking of the 
famous consultations in which I participated, which were least 
two cross-Canada prebudget consultations—one realizes, when one 
listens to the Minister of Finance reading the budget, that the 
Minister of Finance himself has strongly advised those at the 
head of the Standing Committee on Finance to have a strong hand 
in writing the report, which then has nothing to do with what 
members heard or what the public, groups, citizens and 
organizations want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to becoming increasingly anti-democratic, this 
government is no longer listening to the public.  The gulf 
between Quebec and English Canada continues to widen, and 
passing a bill such as Bill C-6 is not going to close the gap 
between the needs of Quebec and those of the rest of English 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I urge the Minister of Industry, his cabinet 
colleagues and all federal Liberal members from Quebec, those 
who should normally understand what is going on in Quebec, but 
who do not, to think about what they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally, they should be on their feet in the House speaking out 
against the federal government's frequent intrusions in Quebec's 
jurisdictions.  But they are silent; there is not a peep out of 
them.  The only members rising in the House to defend the 
interests of Quebec are Bloc Quebecois members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming months, I think that Quebecers will realize that 
Bloc Quebecois members are the only ones capable of defending 
Quebec's interests. 
Since my election to this House, in June 1997, I can recall no 
event, no legislation nor any action which demonstrated that 
this government is listening to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one runs a country like Canada and is no longer responsive 
to the true needs of the population, this is a dangerous 
situation. It is dangerous for democracy. Besides being no 
longer responsive, this government has been resorting to closure 
increasingly to all kinds of procedural means in the House of 
Commons. It is trying to prevent people from expressing their 
views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the Quebec National Assembly is increasingly aware that 
there is not much to be expected from the House of Commons. This 
Liberal government continuously takes powers and jurisdictions 
away from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come back to Bill C-6, which is not different 
from other legislation introduced in this House. This bill will 
directly encroach on legislation which is normally  enforced by 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as information and privacy are concerned, given the 
constant evolution in computer technology, protection measures 
become necessary to prevent dramatic situations. The system 
could create information problems and leaks. Anyone and any 
organization using computer systems must be protected against 
all those nets, which are invading society more and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, since there are only a few hours left before the 
bill is passed, I ask the Liberal government to be, for once, 
responsive in its undertakings. 
I ask it to be responsive to Quebec but also to admit that it 
was wrong in introducing a legislation like Bill C-6. It would 
show courage if it withdrew this bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite our constant appeals to our colleagues across the way, 
we get no answers. The people of Quebec are increasingly aware 
that when they talk to the federal government, they get no 
answers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 14 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-205, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (deduction of 
expenses incurred by a mechanic for tools required in 
employment), be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-205 introduced by my 
colleague, the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my colleague introduced his bill last February, we were a 
few weeks away from the day the Minister of Finance was 
scheduled to bring down his budget. 
At that time my colleague was hoping the minister would respond 
to his concerns, but he did not make the commitment to amend the 
Income Tax Act to allow auto mechanics to deduct from their 
taxable income the cost of the tools they have to buy, update 
and maintain as a condition of their employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must emphasize the fact that auto mechanics are the victims of 
an unfair situation that has been going on for too long. In that 
context, on February 17 of this year, the Automotive Industries 
Association of Canada sent to the 301 members of this House a 
letter asking the government to correct this injustice done to 
Canadian mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the finance minister failed to deal with this issue in his 
last budget, I doubt very much whether he took the trouble to 
read this group's recommendations. For his information, I will 
read some very interesting quotes from their letter which I hope 
will enlighten the finance minister, and I quote:. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the automobile aftermarket industry is very concerned because we 
might not be able to meet our future labour needs. Indeed, the 
tax system is hampering our efforts to convince young people to 
consider the excellent job of automotive service technician. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying this; a Canadian association representing 
140,000 mechanics across Canada is saying this. 
According to the association, young people are shunning this 
trade because the job conditions are not attractive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed a basic set of tools costs at least $4,000, while an 
apprentice makes less than $25,000 a year. During their first 
four years at work technicians will invest around 15% of their 
net income, in tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the finance minister, but I believe it is asking 
too much of him, to put himself in their shoes. I believe he is 
above all that, but I appeal to his nobler sentiments, and I 
hope he will listen carefully to what I have to say. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1725

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An apprentice earns only $25,000 gross. Gross means before 
taxes, before paying for his rent, his food, his student loan if 
he has one. Once all this has been deducted, he has very little 
money left. And on top of that, he has to find $4,000 to pay for 
his tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can see how unjust and unacceptable it is for this 
category of workers. I believe it is a question of common sense, 
and I appeal to the common sense of all members. The minister 
should look at this issue with an open mind, especially since he 
has known about this injustice for several years. 
These people have been the victims of this injustice for a long 
time, and the finance minister, who has been in that portfolio 
for seven years, is familiar with the problem, but he has not 
done anything yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could anybody give me another profession where workers have 
similar problems? I would like to know. But there is none, of 
course. Chainsaw operators, musicians and artists may claim a 
deduction for the cost of their tools or instruments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote the same letter again: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Year in and year out, the demand for automotive technicians goes 
up, as consumers keep their cars longer because of increased 
durability and other factors. Modern vehicles are also more 
complex than ever, and their maintenance requires qualified 
technicians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should realize that these technicians do not need just a 
couple of screwdrivers. As I said earlier, those who want to 
specialize could spend between $4,000 and $30,000 on their 
tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the second hour of debate on this bill. I have been 
listening intently to the objections of members opposite. 
Objections have only been raised on the government side. There 
is a consensus on this bill on opposition benches. Four parties 
out of five support my hon. colleague's bill, a support that 
translates into a 60% support in the population, if we refer to 
the 1997 election results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our system, a party can win a majority of seats without 
getting the plurality of votes. 
The government should be sensitive to this, but when we look at 
how it rammed Bill C-20 through, its sense of democracy is all 
too apparent. The rules of the House were stretched to the limit 
to get this bill tabled in December. The work of the legislative 
committee studying the bill was abruptly curtailed and a gag was 
imposed to speed the bill through.  Democratic this government 
is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I am straying from today's topic.  I was saying that the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance had said that 
the bill could not be passed because allowing mechanics such a 
deduction would be unfair, since other workers would not receive 
the same treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of repeating myself, I wish to remind him that the 
situation of mechanics is completely different, given the huge 
amounts they must spend compared to what they earn. 
Furthermore, I find this argument completely unfounded because 
musicians, chain saw operators and some office workers are 
allowed certain tax deductions.  The government should realize 
that it is contradicting itself on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I know that one of the government's big fears is 
that mechanics will put some of their tools to personal use. 
This is naturally something that deserves our attention.  All 
the same, I would like to point out that even though musicians 
are entitled to deductions for the purchase of their musical 
instruments, I would be very surprised if they did not use them 
outside the work context, just like chain saw operators, or 
office workers who must do the odd bit of personal business on 
their laptop.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way to guarantee that mechanics will limit use of 
their tools to job-related work.  This is perfectly normal.  I 
still think that hiding behind this sort of argument to reject 
the bill is sticking one's head in the sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to mention that over 35,000 post cards 
have been sent to the Minister of Finance.  Since there are 
140,000 mechanics in Canada, I think the message is clear.  They 
want action.  I hope that the government will listen to reason 
on this issue and I really hope the government will support the 
bill introduced by the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Îles-d'Orléans.

<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am always pleased to have any opportunity to discuss tax 
relief.  It is a subject that is very important to me and tax 
relief for all Canadians is a cause that I care passionately 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation must not be considered in isolation 
since it will no doubt set a precedent for other groups that 
follow.  When we discuss tax relief, we must ensure that it is 
tax relief that is practical and that will benefit all Canadians, 
particularly low and middle income Canadians and those raising 
families.  To suggest anything else would be less effective and 
lack any sense of priority. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we now have balanced budgets or surpluses and a strong 
economy, our financial resources are not unlimited. This 
government is committed to ensuring a rational and conscientious 
use of these resources, in the interests of the greatest number 
of Canadians possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in last fall's fiscal and economic update the 
Minister of Finance set out clear and concrete principles that 
set the priorities for federal tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, tax reductions must be fair and give priority to those 
who need them most, middle and low income Canadians, especially 
families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, broad based tax relief should focus first on personal 
income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the business tax system must be internationally 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, broad based relief should not be funded with borrowed 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the type and size of any tax action we take must 
be managed so as to never endanger our continuing commitments to 
balanced budgets.  These are the principles that have governed 
our actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  With great respect to you, as a very knowledgeable 
Speaker, there is an old and ancient rule in the House of 
Commons, of which I am sure you are fully aware, that when an 
hon. member is speaking he or she is not supposed to read a 
speech but to only refer to notes from time to time.  I wonder if 
you could inform the hon. member of that ancient practice.  I 
know you have a lot of experience and can cite the particular 
rule. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marceau): </B>I thank the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle for what he said, but I believe the hon. member 
for Windsor—St. Clair is referring to his notes in a proper 
manner. I think he deserves to continue his speech, and I hope 
the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle will listen to him very 
attentively. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Limoges:</B>  These are principles that have governed 
our actions, highlighted by the multi-year tax cutting plan 
announced in the February budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, even before that, in the update itself, we announced 
steps that provide concrete benefits to every Canadian employee, 
not just a single group like mechanics.  We announced that for 
the sixth year in a row employment insurance premiums would be 
reduced from $2.55 to $2.40 for the year 2000.  This means that 
employees and employers will save an additional $1.2 billion this 
year, bringing total annual savings relative to the rate that 
prevailed in 1994 to $5.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then followed up with budget 2000 and its proposed five year 
tax reduction plan.  This is a plan to provide real and lasting 
tax relief for all Canadians, providing accumulative savings of 
at least $58 billion over the next five years with a particular 
emphasis on families with children.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan is based on two measures that break with the past to 
implement the two most important structural changes made to the 
tax system in more than 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the plan provides for full re-indexation of personal 
income tax, retroactive to January 1, 2000. This measure will 
benefit all Canadians, particularly low and middle income 
earners. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the plan will reduce the middle income tax rate to 23% 
from 26%, beginning with a two point drop to 24% on July 1, 2000. 
This will cut taxes for nine million Canadians.  I would expect 
that many mechanics would fall into this category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes anchor a range of other actions to help reduce 
working Canadians' tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal income taxes will be further reduced within five years 
by increasing to at least $8,000 the amount Canadians can earn 
tax free and by raising the income amounts at which the middle 
and upper tax rates begin to apply to at least $35,000 and 
$75,000 respectively, again, to the lasting benefits of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To assist families with children, the Canada child tax benefit, 
CCTB, will be enriched by $2.5 million a year by 2004 to more 
than $9 billion annually.  Maximum benefits will reach $2,400 for 
the first child and $2,200 for the second child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal tax cuts alone will not deliver new jobs and growing 
incomes over the long term.  A growing economy centred on 
innovation is an important part of the equation.  That is why 
budget 2000's five year tax plan takes additional measures to 
help Canadian businesses become more competitive internationally 
by making the tax system more conducive to investment and 
innovation.  This will help to ensure continued growth and job 
creation in a global economy that is increasingly knowledge 
based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end, the plan proposes to reduce the corporate tax rate 
to 21% from 28% within five years for the highest taxed 
businesses, such as high technology, with a one point drop to 27% 
effective January 1, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To assist small businesses the corporate tax rate will be 
reduced to 21% from 28% on small business income between $200,000 
and $300,000 effective January 1, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The net effect of these measures will be to create jobs and 
improve the lives of Canadians from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, the goal of the five year tax reduction plan 
is clear and concrete:  more money in the pockets of Canadians, 
stronger economic growth and enhanced job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes will be reduced by a cumulative amount of at least $58 
billion, with personal income taxes being reduced by an average 
of 15% by 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While all Canadians will benefit from the tax plan, it 
recognizes the needs of low and middle income Canadians who will 
see their personal income taxes reduced by an average of at least 
18%.  In particular, relief will be provided to families with 
children.  Including the enriched benefits under the CCTB, 
families with children will see their personal income taxes 
reduced by an average of 21%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the immediate tax relief under the plan will grow 
over time.  Consider, for example, that in 2001 a typical one 
earner family of four with about $32,000 in income will receive 
more benefits from government, thanks to the CCTB and the GST tax 
credit, than they will pay in personal income taxes.  What this 
really means is that this family will pay no net tax.  By 2004, 
that family could earn up to $35,000, or $3,000 more, and still 
pay no net tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are two more examples of the tax plan at work.  In the 
first full year of the plan, a typical one earner family of four 
with $40,000 in income will see its net federal income taxes 
reduced by at least 17%.  In 2004 their taxes will be cut by at 
least 48%, a savings of over $1,600 compared to what they would 
pay without the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A typical two earner family of four with an income of $60,000 
will see their taxes reduced by almost 9% in 2001, and by $1,546 
in 2004.  That is a 27% savings relative to what they would have 
paid had the plan never been established.

automatic and hidden tax increases that result from what is 
called bracket creep and to the erosion of tax benefits that has 
characterized Canada's tax system since the middle of the 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that salary increases that simply correspond to the 
inflation rate will no longer automatically put many taxpayers 
in a higher tax bracket. In other words, taxpayers will no 
longer see their taxes raise when their real buying power has 
not increased. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, benefits, such as the Canada child tax benefit and the 
GST credit, will automatically increase to offset inflation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The only difference in the Bloc bill from the bill that I 
presented in the last parliament is the price for individual 
tools that are purchased by the mechanic.  The amount has been 
increased from the $200 that I had recommended.  If the 
mechanic's tool is below $200 the full cost can be deducted.  If 
it is above $200 it will be depreciated and a capital cost 
allowance will be deducted for income taxes purposes.  That is 
the only change.  It is an excellent bill and I sincerely thank 
the Bloc member for bringing it forward again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased that this time the bill has been made 
votable. When I presented the same bill to the committee, it 
unfortunately did not allow the bill to be voted on in the House. 
I believe that every private member's bill that comes before the 
House should be votable, particularly a practical bill like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to allow mechanics to deduct the 
cost of their tools on the condition that the tools are a 
requirement of their employment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mechanic has to buy his own tools and then bring them to his 
place of employment.  If tools are lost or damaged, he has to 
replace them from his own pocketbook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time mechanics have an incredibly large cost, 
often $15,000 to $30,000 in tools, which they have to pay for 
with after tax dollars, and yet it is a requirement of employment 
that the mechanics have those tools to use them on the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that this issue be dealt with.  I would 
assume that this time it will have the full support of every 
party in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs I am talking about are the costs of maintaining the 
tools, renting the tools, in cases where the mechanic chooses to 
rent, and insurance costs, because of course with the high value 
involved the loss of the tools would be devastating.  It would 
be quite devastating to lose $30,000 worth of tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mechanic could also deduct the cost of the insurance.  The 
mechanic would be allowed to claim capital cost allowance on 
tools over $250 and, therefore, over time deduct the full cost of 
the tools for income tax purposes.  That is the purpose of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I introduced Bill C-366 I received over 7,000 letters from 
mechanics across the country.  On this bill, in spite of the fact 
that it is not my bill, I have received hundreds and hundreds 
more letters.  We have not even counted them yet, although I do 
appreciate the mechanics and the owners of the businesses for 
sending the letters to me.  I know that copies of the letters 
have been sent to the finance minister.  The finance minister has 
to understand how important it is that he deal with the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate on Bill C-366 members of all political parties 
supported the bill except the Liberals.  The parliamentary 
secretary to the minister of finance at that time came up with a 
whole list of excuses for not supporting the bill.  I would 
suggest that they were excuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go through what the parliamentary secretary said and I 
will respond to what I consider to be excuses in most cases. 
First, I want to say a little about what some MPs from all of the 
political parties said about this bill and what they are saying 
about the Bloc member's bill which is now before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Bloc MP said “I think this bill is good for the economy and 
for the creation of jobs.  The Bloc Quebecois and myself support 
the measures proposed in this bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of the NDP from Saskatchewan said “I want to 
congratulate the member for Lakeland for bringing this 
legislation forward and tell him and members of the House that 
the New Democratic Party fully supports this concept and we will 
be supporting this bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of the Progressive Conservative Party from Manitoba 
said “I would like to pass my thanks on to the member for 
Lakeland who has once again brought forward a private member's 
bill to deal with what I consider to be an injustice and an 
inequality that has been around for too long”.  I think it is a 
fair comment that this injustice has been around for too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform MPs fully supported the bill.  The member for 
Battlefords—Lloydminster and the member for Elk Island indicated 
that the bill was long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we come to the government side, the Liberals.  The 
parliamentary secretary came up with numerous 
excuses, and I want to go through some of the key ones.  He said 
“Mechanics are not the only occupation that incur substantial 
expenses as a requirement of employment”.  I agree with that. 
That statement is correct.  Farmers and other businessmen, as 
well as artists, musicians and chainsaw operators incur 
substantial expenses as a requirement of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers, of course, are business people and they are handled 
differently, but artists, musicians, chainsaw operators and 
others are employees in many cases who are allowed to deduct the 
cost of the tools of their trade.  I believe that is a bogus 
issue which the parliamentary secretary brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary also said “This private member's 
bill would also provide tax relief to all mechanics, irrespective 
of the size of their expenditures, instead of targeting relief to 
those incurring extraordinary expenses”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT83"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT83"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1750

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that, indeed, that is an odd statement.  Farmers 
and other business people, as well as the others I have 
mentioned, can claim their expenses no matter how large they are. 
That is not a criterion that is used to judge whether any of 
these other people can write something off for tax purposes. 
That was a very odd statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said “Provisions would need to be developed to ensure 
that tax relief was provided only for those items genuinely 
required as a condition of employment and not for those purchased 
for personal use”.  That is true.  That is a fair enough 
statement, but throughout all our tax system, for anyone 
claiming, the same is true.  In other words, the onus is on the 
person making the claim to ensure that he or she is only claiming 
expenses which are allowed under the act.  Taxpayers are trusted 
to do that.  We have routine audits and we have special audits to 
check to ensure that people are being honest.  Again, this was 
another bogus excuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary made several other, what I would 
consider to be, excuses and I do not believe that any one of them 
could not be dealt with by the government if it believed it was 
something that should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary at the time, and I hear the same 
thing again from across the floor, said that somehow, and for 
different reasons, the deduction of the cost of purchasing, 
owning and maintaining a line of tools could not be done for 
several reasons.  It is interesting that this government, which 
has raised taxes every year over the past seven years, since 
1993— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  It never raised them once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, maybe not this year. 
That is a close call.  But every year up until this year the 
government has raised taxes, and always it declares that the 
reason is tax fairness.  Often we hear the Liberals say “We are 
increasing taxes to this group of people by $1 billion because it 
makes it fair”.  Why is it that tax fairness cannot also lead to 
a lowering of taxes?  In this case, that is exactly what would be 
done.  We would lower taxes, allowing mechanics to deduct the 
cost of tools used for business in the name of tax fairness.  Why 
is it that the government cannot understand the concept that tax 
fairness can also mean lowering taxes to a particular group of 
people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the government to understand that that is 
exactly what would happen.  This is a fair measure.  In the 
information I have received under access to information as to why 
the finance department will not go along with this, it indicated 
that it would cost the department somewhere around $60 million a 
year.  In the name of tax fairness, why can we not have this 
reduction of $60 million a year?  It is money that really should 
be left in the pockets of mechanics.  This is long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across the floor may think it is funny, but with more 
than 7,000 letters from mechanics saying “We want tax 
fairness”, the government should listen.  I would encourage the 
government to support the bill, as it is a votable bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say a few words in support of Bill C-205. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say at the outset that I have put a very similar motion 
on the order paper which would allow mechanics who are working on 
their own to deduct their tools as a legitimate expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance 
across the way and I am sure he will be in agreement with the 
bill before the House because I see him nodding his head. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the present income tax law there is a fair amount of 
discrimination.  Mechanics, tradespeople, technicians, automotive 
technicians and carpenters who are in business for themselves can 
deduct their tools, but those same people who are working for 
someone else cannot deduct their tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a considerable expense to becoming a carpenter or a 
mechanic. Buying a whole set of tools is a very expensive 
proposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For almost any other business endeavour in the country one can 
deduct legitimate expenses.  Whether people are consultants in a 
small business or in a larger business, they can deduct the 
expenses which are incurred in running the business.  The 
mechanics and carpenters are saying that they should have the 
same right as anyone else.  They are buying tool kits and tools 
in order to be involved in a business, in order to be an employee 
at a garage, a carpenter or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of us do not realize how expensive it is for someone to 
get the basic tool kit.  One often has to pay a minimum of $5,000 
to $10,000.  They tell me it can even be as high as $50,000 or 
$60,000 for a complete tool kit in some of the occupations which 
many people are going into today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> did a survey of the costs of getting 
into business.  The reporter talked to Gene Myers, who is an 
Algonquin College student and an apprentice.  He was asked how 
much it would cost to get the basic start-up kit to be a 
mechanic.  He had spent $17,000 and he said that was the bare 
minimum for tools an apprentice would require when starting full 
time work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These prices are approximate, but I thought I should read some 
of them into the record to give members an idea of what some 
young people are required to pay in order to get into business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For wrenches, the cost was $2,020.  I notice, Mr. Speaker, that 
even you are startled by that number.  It is a shocking number 
and it is a very difficult expense for people getting into 
business.  The wrenches are categorized in this way.  Two 
standard size sets cost $405 each, amounting to $810.  Two metric 
size sets are $405 each, for a total cost of $810. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Who gave us the metric system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  The metric system came into being in 
this country because of pressure from some conservative-minded 
people who sat in the Trudeau cabinet a number of years ago. 
That is why we have the metric system response from the hon. 
member from the Canadian Alliance.  At least I think it is the 
Canadian Alliance and not the conservative alliance.  In any 
event, that is how the metric system arrived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two minimum specialized wrench sets cost $200 each, totalling 
$400.  Torque wrenches are $885.  A 3/8 inch wrench costs $295; a 
1/4 inch wrench, $295; and a 1/2 inch wrench, $295.  Sockets cost 
$2,000 in total.  He said there is a minimum of ten sets of 
different sized sockets at $200 each.  Socket extension sets cost 
$450; 3/8 inch sets, $150; 1/4 inch, $150; 1/2 inch, $150; wheel 
nut sockets, $420; five sizes of sockets at $60 each, another 
$300; four sizes at $30 each, $120; and six ratchets at $125 
each, totalling $750. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on and on with the list that he gave in terms of the 
start-up costs of getting a decent tool kit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an auto mechanic or a carpenter spends that kind of money 
to get into business we can make a fair argument for deducting 
the cost of these tools of trade from income tax. 
I think that is only fair treatment.  It is only just treatment. 
I hope members of the government would agree with this perfectly 
reasonable proposal that is before the House today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many mechanics and carpenters have lobbied me over the years on 
this kind of proposal.  About two years ago I circulated a 
petition among a number of the garages in and around the city of 
Regina.  I got many hundreds of signatures on petitions calling 
upon the federal government to make such a move in terms of 
amending the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time is long overdue for the House of Commons to listen to 
the people.  They are saying that this is only a fair move and a 
just move that we should be making as the House of Commons. I am 
glad to see that we have some solidarity here among all political 
parties that this is the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume the Progressive Conservative Party will also be 
supporting this.  We will be hearing from its distinguished House 
leader in a few minutes.  I am not 100% sure he will be doing 
that but I think he will.  His former hero, Brian Mulroney, did 
not do this when he was prime minister of the country, despite 
all kinds of lobbying that was done.  I hope the Progressive 
Conservative Party has now seen the light and will support this 
private member's bill before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for introducing the private member's bill. 
Let us get on with this.  Let us hear from the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  Let us make this a five party effort and 
change the law, which will make it a more fair and just system 
for a lot of people right across the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this very 
important private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the introduction by the illustrious member from the 
New Democratic Party.  He has been a long time member of the 
House and has been around for many, many years.  He is a very 
useful tool in reminding us of things that have taken place in 
the past. Certainly the sins of the father are sometimes 
revisited on the son. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important piece of legislation because it brings 
about a very positive change in an industry that is very much in 
need of attention at this time.  That is not unlike other 
industries and other Canadians generally who are suffering from 
the high cost of tax that is taken from their income. Mechanics 
are no exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, which has garnered a great deal of support, in a very 
non-partisan way I hasten to add, has also gathered a great deal 
of support around the country. I commend the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans for the 
work he has done, and the member for Lakeland who brought forward 
a similar private member's bill.  There is a sense that the 
government may in fact be listening but that remains to be seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is very much a common sense approach to a 
problem that has existed for a long time, namely that mechanics 
are faced with an incredible startup cost when it comes to 
beginning in their profession.  As has been alluded to, 
indications are that the average startup cost is anywhere from 
$15,000 to $40,000 to break into an industry that, like other 
industries, is moving toward a more technological and highly 
advanced profession.  The tools themselves, the power tools and 
the basic tools, are extremely costly and often the power tools 
are in need of a great deal of ongoing maintenance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is aimed at giving an industry in need tax relief that 
is brought about in a very straightforward way and, I would 
suggest, in a common sense fashion.  This is uncommon in this 
place when it comes to legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many ways my initial reaction when we started talking about 
amending the Income Tax Act was to be a little concerned that 
once again we would be making a more convoluted attempt than was 
necessary.  Short of the Revenue Canada Act or perhaps the new 
youth criminal justice act, the bill is aimed at streamlining as 
opposed to adding layers of legislation and layers of bureaucracy 
on top of one another, as is far too often the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government members who have spoken to the bill would lead 
Canadians to believe that significant tax relief has already been 
brought about by this administration.  We know that nothing could 
be further from the truth.  In fact the most recent budget is 
rear end loaded; that is to say, much of the benefits of the 
budget will not be felt for a number of years, in fact years that 
go far beyond the government's current mandate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is aimed at assisting mechanics in a very real and 
tangible fashion. There is a great deal of need in this area. 
There is a great deal of need when it comes to the tools 
themselves being considered very much a part of the profession, 
which they are.  They are an integral part of any mechanic's 
existence and profession. The proportionate investment that is 
made by mechanics and the reliance on their tools highlights that 
very fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost as I alluded to is extremely high.  Sometimes that 
cost, being as high as $40,000, may be more than the annual 
income of a mechanic who is starting up in that profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for standardization across the board. For 
example, chainsaw operators and musicians are permitted to deduct 
the cost of their chainsaws and musical instruments.  Why then 
should there not be a similar tax deductible mechanism in place 
for mechanics?  There has to be some uniformity and fairness with 
respect to industries and eligibility for tax deductions. Not 
unlike other industries such as fishing and farming, there is an 
intrinsic connection between the individual and the tools and 
machinery that are required to provide the service in the 
profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other important issue with respect to this bill is that 
there is a labour aspect, an element of employment, attached. 
Currently with such high initial costs, many young Canadians who 
have the possibility to get work after receiving training, be it 
at a community college or through a mentoring program, are faced 
with a monumental startup cost that they simply cannot afford. 
Therefore it continues this trend that we have seen in other 
professions which has become colloquially known as the brain 
drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanics are no exception. Indications are that many mechanics 
are facing the very gut wrenching decision of whether to stay in 
their hometown, their community, their country or to go to the 
United States or other countries where they are given greater tax 
relief and perhaps a better life by virtue of being able to keep 
what they earn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An element of this bill talks about maximizing job potential 
which we in the Progressive Conservative Party are very 
supportive of to say the least.  Studies have shown that the 
mechanics industry has experienced a serious decline with respect 
to enrolment in technical institutions.  I think this good faith 
initiative that has been brought forward addresses in some 
measure that exact problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Automobile Dealers Association and other national 
organizations have embraced this legislation as a good idea. They 
have lobbied not only opposition members but presumably 
government members.  They have reminded them that this is 
something that has been in the works, has been in the hopper, for 
some time. There is a great deal of support and demand that the 
government adopt such an initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again the government has demonstrated that it is 
quite devoid of new ideas and this is quite sad. It trundles 
along in mediocrity. We are seeing more and more that the real 
initiatives are coming from the opposition benches. Therefore, we 
are faced with the difficulty of it becoming a partisan effort 
which is unfortunate because this does not benefit Canadians.  I 
see that Mr. Speaker is nodding in agreement with that 
suggestion. The government is not listening to Canadians and is 
not responding with the initiatives and the legislative change 
that is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to tax deductibility for technicians, this idea was 
established in response to the industry itself and the growing 
concerns over the unfair treatment of automobile technicians. 
Working groups consisting of automobile industry associations 
from across the country have all banded together and spoken in 
support of this type of initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mechanics, like other Canadians, cannot be denied access to 
some form of tax relief.  This is a very straightforward and 
common sense approach.  Mechanics singularly are hardworking 
Canadians who want to take part in the new economy and be able to 
keep their hard earned working dollars.  There is no reason 
whatsoever that they should not be afforded access to the same 
types of tax breaks that are prevalent in other industries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition, increasing attention to detail, and the increasing 
bureaucracy that small businesses are faced with are other drags 
on the economy and on the mechanics industry itself. Insurance 
and the cost of maintenance when it comes to maintaining a garage 
and the tools of the trade are burdens for which mechanics, like 
others, are looking for some form of assistance. That could be 
brought about through the adoption of this type of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1998 the Canadian automobile industry appeared 
before the finance committee in various capacities and 
organizations and made specific recommendations very much akin to 
this legislation.  Since 1992 all of these groups representing 
mechanics and organizations across the country have been urging 
the government to move in this direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met personally with individuals like Brad Smith of 
Westville's Radco Enterprises and Dan McDonald of Scotia Diesel 
in Antigonish.  Both of them were very open and frank in their 
support for this type of legislation which would allow them to 
keep their hard earned tax dollars.  That we know will generate 
further growth through spinoffs in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing mechanics to write off their expenses in relation to 
the cost and maintenance of their tools and their workshops is 
something that the Progressive Conservative Party very much 
embraces and supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the hon. member who has moved this bill through the 
Commons.  We are hoping that the government members will try to 
break away from the tired and arrogant approach that we have 
become far too accustomed to, with no ideas coming forward, no 
innovation and no constructive moves.  We on the opposition side 
are urging the government to support this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I congratulate all previous speakers who have brought 
forward their support.  I encourage other members to do likewise.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
situation that exists throughout Quebec is of great concern to 
me. I hear about it particularly in my riding, because I often 
come across mechanics in restaurants or garages and they tell me 
about this injustice done to them. They are not allowed any 
deductions from their taxable income for the tools they are 
required to buy to practice their trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing that other tradesmen have access to such a deduction, we 
can see that the government encourages inequities and has 
tremendous difficulty taking action to contribute to the 
advancement of Quebec society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the report that was prepared following the December 1997 
prebudget consultations in which I took part, it was recognized 
that the need was there. The public was asking that legislation 
be passed quickly to allow mechanics to deduct the cost of the 
tools they are required to buy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is March 30, 2000, almost three years later, and yet 
nothing has been done. This goes to show once again that this 
government waits and then waits some more, and drags its feet on 
issues that penalize people. In this case, it is mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to support the bill introduced by my 
colleague, the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. I also thank all 
the members of the opposition who listened carefully to the 
demands of the Bloc Quebecois and who support this bill, which 
will hopefully find some support among federal Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the second time that I speak to this important bill. 
When we made similar demands in June 1999, there was talk about 
a government surplus of several billion dollars. That was what 
the Minister of Finance was hinting at.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the Minister of Finance has a budget surplus of tens of 
thousands of dollars, although it is still hard to find out the 
real figures, hard to be really informed about the Canadian 
economic reality, he ought to accede to what is being called for 
in Bill C-205. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill defends principles in which I believe strongly.  I 
will tell hon. members what the objectives and principles are 
that must be obtained in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, mechanics must be given fair treatment as far as 
taxation is concerned, on an equal footing with farmers, and in 
harmony with that already afforded to chain saw operators, 
artists and musicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, this bill is aimed at lessening the financial burden 
on mechanics imposed by the requirement to purchase their own 
tools, and very costly ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just think of the young mechanic, fresh out of school, and often 
with a student loan, having to purchase thousands of dollars 
worth of tools in order to get a job.  After working for a year, 
he is not even entitled to a tax deduction for the new tools he 
has acquired.  As far as I am concerned, this is social 
injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, moving on to another of the objectives I support.  This 
bill offers a remedy for the serious shortage of workers in 
automobile-related fields.  We know that it is getting harder and 
harder to recruit mechanics, electricians, plumbers, carpenters 
and the like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my region, in the RCM de l'Érable, the LDB is doing a lot of 
promotion to try to find 300 people who could immediately get 
work in business in Plessisville, Princeville and Lyster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also learned that the same situation prevails at the other end 
of my riding, namely in Laurier-Station and Saint-Apollinaire, 
where plants are also looking for people who are able to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not make the necessary efforts to prepare 
for the future, to help our young people, how can we ensure the 
viability of a region such as Lotbinière and that of all the 
regions of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem described in Bill C-205 is one of a number of 
factors which, year after year, significantly affect our 
regions. Unfortunately, people are constantly leaving the 
regions. 
Think of all the efforts made by our ancestors, by the pioneers, 
all their collective achievements, all their hard work. Because 
of actions such as those of the federal government, the 
foundations that helped build the Quebec society are being 
eroded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to wake up and take charge. Each of Quebec's region 
has its own wealth, its own beauty, its own features. In each of 
these regions, there are motorists, people who use their cars or 
their trucks. There is pride in having local mechanics in each 
municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to wax nostalgic, but 25 years ago, in rural 
villages, there were essential elements that promoted mutual 
support and supported the local economy. 
There was the general store, the local mechanic, a small 
restaurant, the caisse populaire, the elementary and secondary 
schools and the church.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we realize that most of the small garages in each of the 
towns have disappeared.  Why?  Because no measures or laws have 
been established to ensure some sort of continuity.  What does 
this situation lead to?  Gradually, people leave these villages 
to go and live in larger centres and must give up the heritage 
that is important to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time that the federal government, through its rural 
and regional development policies, paid attention to this ever 
more desperate situation throughout Quebec.  Today, it is the 
mechanics.  Tomorrow it will be the electricians. 
Unfortunately, unless something is done, we will see that the 
major centres in each region and riding will be only ones to 
have survived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all federal Liberals in Quebec and across Canada to 
join with my colleague, to be part of the support given us by 
the opposition parties—the Progressive Conservatives, the 
Canadian Alliance and the NDP—in recognizing that there is a 
desperate need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is urgent that the situation be resolved, in order to correct 
once and for all this injustice, which is befalling important 
people, the mechanics.  We are proud of them and must keep them. 
We must support their efforts to work and continue to build 
with us the rural and regional communities of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this short speech comes as a result of a question I posed several 
weeks ago to the Minister of Justice.  The question revolved 
around whether it was the intent of the 1997 child support 
guidelines to create a class of adult students who are supported, 
by court order, as children of the marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her response, the minister stated that such orders are not 
automatic.  I am certain that the parliamentary secretary, who is 
here this evening to speak for her, will echo the idea that it is 
all about judicial discretion and that under the 1997 guidelines 
an order is not automatic when one goes to the court seeking 
support for an adult.  Although the adult is called a child there 
is no right to this support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is correct then I am inviting the parliamentary 
secretary, the Department of Justice or anybody watching this 
show to produce or to offer just one example of a case where a 
judge exercised that discretion and said “No, you are applying 
for support for a child at university and I am not going to give 
it to you.  You are applying for tuition expenses and I am not 
going to give it to you”.  I am looking for one case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the members that there are some very basic and 
fundamental questions surrounding these orders and this law which 
concern a broad cross-section of Canadians.  First, when is a 
child no longer a child, or when does a child become an adult? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, generally in this country the age of majority is 19, 
and in some provinces 18, but it is in that range.  We know that 
a 19 year old can marry without a parent's permission.  We know 
that a 19 year old can enter into contracts and be bound by them. 
They can buy real estate and all sorts of things.  They are 
adults and anything an adult can do they can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, here we have, in a 1997 law passed in this place, the 
federal support guidelines which state that a child of divorce is 
entitled to support under circumstances which are widely applied 
to be post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years later what do we see?  First, we see that an order 
is automatic.  That is, if the custodial parent applies to the 
court and says that this child is in university, then the 
non-custodial parent must pay for those expenses. 
More importantly, we are seeing many recorded cases of so-called 
children who are 30 years of age whose non-custodial parent is in 
fact paying for their post-secondary education.  We have Ph.D. 
students and MA students, some approaching middle age, who are 
still children as declared by a judge exercising his so-called 
discretion.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask how this can be.  If we look at the law in this 
country we want it both ways.  We know that under the Young 
Offenders Act a 14 year old can be declared to be an adult for 
the purposes of the law.  We also know that for the purposes of 
the Divorce Act a 30 year old can be a child for the purposes of 
the law.  How can this possibly be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I want to talk about fairness and equality because that 
is a big topic around this place.  How can it be fair for a 
divorced parent to be compelled to pay but parents who are still 
married do not have to do anything?  Even if the parents are 
millionaires, as long as their marriage is intact when the child 
is 19 they can say that they are not paying, and parents do that. 
However, a divorced parent does not have this choice.  The court 
orders that parent to pay for the child up to age 30.  We are 
waiting to hear whether the age will up any further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one final point.  Is the Divorce Act a law that is 
applied to create a social policy?  That is exactly what is 
happening in this circumstance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, while there 
are a number of elements to the member's question, I think it is 
useful to review what the government has done, which started his 
question in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the government introduced child support guidelines to 
make the calculation of child support fair, predictable and 
consistent in the best interest of children.  The Divorce Act 
does not automatically require parents to continue to support a 
child who has reached the age of majority but rather enables the 
courts to make an order for support if it is reasonable, given 
the circumstances of that family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It needs to be said that this is not new policy.  The courts 
have been ordering support for children over the age of majority 
well before the child support reforms of 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department is monitoring the federal child support 
guidelines closely and research to date indicates the guidelines 
are meeting their objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will be reporting to parliament on the guidelines 
by May 2002, and perhaps that is the time to have a more fulsome 
review of this to see whether in fact some of the issues that the 
member has raised are continuing to be an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that most provinces and territories 
have legislation enabling the courts to make such orders where 
parents are separated.  In fact some allow it where the families 
are intact.

deemed adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
