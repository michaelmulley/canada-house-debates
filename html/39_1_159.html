These seniors believe that the unification of seniors with their families in Canada through immigration is a core aspect of forming strong, healthy and vibrant families and communities in Canada and that newcomer seniors currently suffer unfairly from the 10 year residency requirement under Canada's income security programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They say that Canada's old age security, guaranteed income supplement and social assistance programs are age, capacity, and needs based benefit programs, not income security plans based on individual contributions. Therefore, the petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to amend the Old Age Security Act regulations and policies to eliminate the 10 year residency requirement for the OAS and guaranteed income supplement.</div>

This is a very ambitious bill designed to replace the current Fisheries Act, which has undergone some changes but is more than 136 years old. There is general agreement that the current legislation is flawed and must be amended. However, there are problems associated with amending this sort of legislation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in the fishing industry will often say that they do not like the legislation as it stands, but that they can survive nonetheless. They have an industry and are getting by. If this legislation is replaced, it must be replaced with a better bill that will improve the fishery for families, fishers and coastal communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill contains several provisions to that end, but it also has some weaknesses. I am finding resistance and fear in the fishing communities in my riding and elsewhere. People are asking me to vote against this bill. I think this is unfortunate, because with a few amendments, the bill could be very good for the fishing industry and could bring stability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the government is refusing to make those amendments. We are being asked to adopt the bill at second reading in order to introduce the necessary amendments, but we know that they will not be in order. They would be now, but they will not be after second reading, in committee. I think this is unfortunate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the minister controls the wording of the bill. I believe he should hold consultations on the bill's wording in coastal communities, in fishing communities, with the groups concerned, and make amendments. They are not major amendments. The bill the minister is introducing does not have to be rejected. With minor changes, it would be an excellent bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister could do that. According to the motion introduced by the Liberal fisheries critic, the minister could make the amendments that have been introduced. I therefore encourage him to do so.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para659766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what we have here and what we are going to discuss is the bill in its current form. Again, I do not think this is a bad deal. I think it has some weaknesses. I participated, as many others did, in the Atlantic fisheries policy review, a wide-ranging session of consultations with the industry, communities and the provinces, and we came to the acceptance of a document. We accepted the proposals of the review and I see pretty well all of them within this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for where I have problems with the bill, I am going to talk about two areas. Other colleagues will talk about other areas. I am going to talk about two areas that are problematic. They are not easy to resolve. Now that he has the text of the act, I would encourage the minister to consult, based on the text he received from the communities, on the modifications that would improve that act and that he consider bringing them forward to Parliament, as the committee will not be able to do it at second reading.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One problem is the question of licence ownership. It has been stated by the courts in decisions that a licence is not a property. It is a permit. It is not property. That is understood. It has been understood in jurisprudence. However, in the evolution of our fisheries it has become an asset. It has value. It is often the pension plan of the family participating in that fishery. When the family leaves the fishery, it transfers the right to exercise that licence for a consideration of capital, of money, and that forms the pension plan for that family.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the proposed act states directly that the licence is not transferrable. The minister has said in the media, and he probably will say it again in the House, that his intent is that it continue as it was in the past and that people be permitted to transfer or sell their interest, to sell their right to apply for that annual permit. I believe he is sincere in that desire. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What worries me is what a judge will say in 5, 15 or 20 years when he is presented with a case wherein people are objecting to a transfer of a licence. He will be presented with a case and with an act which specifically states that the licence is not transferrable. If an organization, a petitioner to the court, wants a licence to cease existing on the retirement of a fisherman because it thinks cute little crabs should be swimming around the bottom of the ocean forever and should not be harvested, what then would a judge say in that instance? I believe there is some work to be done there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area that I want to discuss is the question of the tribunals. Currently in the act if there is an offence or allegations of an offence under the act, the choice of the department is to charge the fisherman or fisher person or company and take them to court. It is a long, arduous and expensive process that clogs Canadian courts. This proposed act wants to bring back the way it was a while back and which had been successfully challenged in court, that is, the administrative sanctions. It would bring them back in the form of a tribunal, so that rather than going to court, sanctions could be imposed by the department with agreement of the offender or after a trial before the tribunal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all good. I think that is excellent. What is lacking is a method of appeal. I hear concerns in fishing communities that the people on these tribunals are going to be named by the government of the day and are going to be political hacks. I do not have a problem with the government of the day naming the people on the tribunal. As a government is replaced, people will be named by the new government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am concerned about is that the people on the tribunal have the ability and ethical values to do their job properly, that is, that they are able to do it and that they do it properly. The only way we can ensure that is if their decisions can be appealed to a higher instance. If their decisions cannot be appealed, then they stand, whether the decisions are good or bad. Rather than properly exercising their judicial or quasi-judicial responsibilities, their master remains the person who appointed them, the minister. As long as they make the minister and the deputy minister happy, they will continue to be reappointed. I believe there should be an appeal process. It would ensure that their job is done with integrity and transparency.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to return to the licensing and give an example of a good principle poorly applied and its negative impact. I want to give an example of the ministerial order given by the minister a few weeks ago with respect to trust agreements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust agreements exist in my part of the world in two areas. They exist in the groundfish industry and the lobster industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has stated that it is his intention to legitimize the existing process and permit vertical integration within the groundfish industry. I applaud him for that. That is the direction I was suggesting. It is the direction in which we have been going. I think that is excellent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lobster industry there are 1,000 licences in Digby County, Yarmouth County, Shelburne County and in part of my colleague's riding across the way, South Shore, in St. Margaret's. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty or 30 years ago the cost of getting involved in that industry would have been $20,000 to $100,000. A young person who wanted to enter that fishery would use the old backing system. He would see a lobster broker or buyer and the lobster buyer would sign at the bank or lend the young person $15,000 or $20,000. The young person would have to find another $10,000 and then he would be in. By a gentleman's agreement the harvester would sell his product to that buyer. That buyer would have security of supply. The young person starting in the industry would have a reasonable source of capital. Over time, times were very good in that industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshall decision created the government buying lobster licences and other licences which quickly inflated the prices. All of a sudden, with the combination of the Marshall decision implementation and the economic benefits of that industry, licences hit $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000, $600,000 up to $800,000. The vessel and the gear would cost another $300,000 to $600,000.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman's agreement did not work any more. The person who was going to shell out or guarantee up to $1 million had to have some security. He needed two things. As a broker he needed security of supply; he needed lobster. He was not going to spend hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars marketing lobster if he could not be guaranteed supply. The other thing is he needed to be sure that if he lent $1 million to somebody that he would get it back.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyers worked behind the scenes and they found ways around the policy and they came to the trust agreement. DFO policy continues to state that the licence must be held by an individual. They did the beneficial use or trust agreements. They were able to integrate in that way. In the beginning it worked fine, but with time there was movement by a few companies toward accumulation of a disproportionate share of the licences. It put fear in the community that no longer would it be an independently held industry contributing its maximum to the economy, creating riches for a lot of people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another type of trust agreement. Of 1,000 licences my estimation would be that there are a couple of hundred in corporate trusts and probably 300 in individual and family trusts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lobster fisherman wants to turn over his assets to his son or daughter but it is $1 million and that is his pension plan. He is worried because he has to protect himself in case it does not work out, so he creates a trust and he turns the shares over bit by bit to the second generation and gets his pension. As people retire, a father or mother might want to buy licences in the market for two or three of their children. They will create trusts for those purposes. Those are not seen in the community as being dangerous. They are not seen as undermining the independence of the industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister, based on the good principle that the independence of the fishery has to be protected, said that only the banks would be able to mortgage and that within seven years all the other corporate trusts would have to be dissolved. The principle is good but what happened with the implementation of that is that the other 300 what I call reasonable trusts got caught in that trap. The average fisherman who was preparing to retire saw his licence value decrease from $600,000 to $300,000 overnight. About $600 million disappeared in capital value of fishing families, people preparing for retirement, in western Nova Scotia. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have written to the minister asking him to reconsider. I understand there is a question of extending the sellout period or the dissolving period of those trusts to 17 years. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020">(1020)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para659786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the minister to go further. I would ask him to look at the underlying causes that created those trusts. How do we change our policies in a way that would promote reasonable economic development of the fishery and maintain as much as possible the independent nature of the fishery? There are four points that I continually raise. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the elimination of the capital gains tax. I congratulate the government for having done that. The government went further with this year's budget than it did with last year's budget and it came to what was in our Liberal policy platform. That was the responsible action to take and I thank the government for doing that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is access to capital. For an independent fishery to exist, the individual has to be able to compete with anybody else who would be trying to integrate into that fishery. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that what scares me under the tribunal system is the tribunal could decide who could and could not be a fisherman. That is risky. A fisherman should be a person who can acquire a licence or be entrusted with a licence and leave the wharf. It should be decided like that. It should evolve naturally and normally as it always has. A fisherman needs access to capital. He needs to be able to compete for it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the brokerage sector. The brokerage sector, or the lobster buyers as we know them, need security of supply. They need to know they will be able to buy lobster in the future. They should have a reasonable way of competing with everybody else who is trying to do the same. That maximizes the value of lobster. It maximizes the revenue to the fisherman. It maximizes the return to the country and to the community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the licences be under a financial instrument. Because a licence is not property, it is difficult to call it a mortgage so I call it a financial instrument. We should let the banks enter into a financial instrument, or whatever the proper term would be, with the fisherman, so if he does not make repayment, the bank can get the licence, force its sale, and recover that way. The courts have found that to be okay and it is under appeal now. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that we go further and let lobster buyers and the marketing industry get into those types of instruments. Then they would not have to do a trust. It would also cost them a lot less money. They would have more financial security as long as the person whose name the licence is in could buy out of the obligation in a reasonable manner as a person would on a mortgage on any other business or real property. That would help a lot.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families or lobster fishermen should be permitted to create companies and put their licences under companies. Partnerships should be permitted. However, holding more than one lobster licence within a corporation or any individual or corporate entity having shares or interests in more than one of these corporations should not be permitted. Any one of those corporations or any fisherman should not be permitted to have licences in more than one lobster fishery area. We see that now in areas where they do very well. Fishermen use the capital to compete with larger vessels in other fisheries in their off season. That has a huge risk.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing trusts could be grandfathered. They should not be stale dated. If ever the fisherman sold his assets of the company holding the trusts, he could not sell those trusts with them. The fisherman could not sell one company to another. Any time those licences were moved, they would have to go under the new rules. I think that the market would level off. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People holding 20 or 30 licences in trust would have $20 million or $30 million tied up and they could not use that asset at the bank. They could not because of their trust agreements, their counter-policy with the department; with the signature on an order, the minister could dissolve the licence so it would have no value at the bank. The person could not use it to negotiate working capital in his corporation, but if the person sold the licences to the captains, if he got a financial instrument with the captains who owned the licences now, with an agreement that they sell their lobster to him at market value, they could buy out the person anytime, but the person would have a reasonable security of supply. The person could go to the bank freed up of the $20 million or $30 million obligation and as he negotiated his working capital, he could tell the bank what he expected in the amount of product he would be selling on the market in the next five years based on those things. Suddenly that business plan makes sense. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That broker has the ability to market Canadian product in the Japanese, oriental and European markets. The independence of the fishery is maintained and there is competition to buy that product from the fisherman maximizing in value.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those four points, and there can be variations, would take away the underlying circumstances that have forced these trusts. These trusts were not some diabolical plan of people to take over the lobster fishery. If we talked to the people who are the beneficial owners of these trust agreements, they would tell us that they are not efficient at harvesting. The captains would tell us that it is not the most efficient way. The most efficient way is for the captain to own and operate his vessel. He will take care of things. He will fish when the conditions are right. He will take decisions that are appropriate for the safety of his crew and he will bring in the product.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People get involved in these trusts to have that security of supply. Lobster brokers need one thing. They need lobster. That is what they do very well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young man growing up in Comeauville and fishing in the spring, I remember when there were two buyers who would come to Comeauville wharf. Essentially they were selling to two brokers in the U.S. The buyers would buy the lobster at the cheapest price possible. The price would be fixed in the spring and fixed in the fall and they would sell the lobster at a quarter a pound profit on the American market. The broker would make whatever money there was in marketing it on the American side and our fishermen lived in poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty or 30 years ago there started to be competition on the brokerage side. All of a sudden people were paying 15¢ to 20¢ more per pound. There were large fluctuations during the season. Fishermen themselves were brokering, developing lobster holding ponds and the lobster fishermen have done very well. They have very good family revenues. Their children are being well educated. They are contributing greatly to the economy. It is important that we protect that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the minister will give my reflections some consideration in protecting the retirement assets of these families as they approach the time to leave the fishery, as well as protecting the future of the fishery and the economy of western Nova Scotia.</div>

Loyola Hearn (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, CPC)</A>: </b>&nbsp;<span class="nextIntervention"><a class="nav_link" href="#Int-2105081"><img src="/common/images/arrow2_right.gif" border="0" alt="next intervention"></a></span></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for his remarks about the bill. I believe he and his colleagues are starting to learn that even though there may be certain things in the bill with which they do not agree or with which they have concerns, and I appreciate that because it has always been that way and that is why we developed the legislation, he has admitted that there is a lot of good in the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every fishing province, the ministers and the governments involved have said to get on with it, get this bill to committee so we can get into the nuts and bolts and make the changes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659804"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refer quickly to a couple of things the hon. member mentioned. He talked about his concerns about the tribunal and no recourse to tribunal decisions. There is recourse. If a decision is made that will negatively affect somebody, there is the Federal Court. The main reason the tribunal was put in place was to have an arm's length, independent group that would take the politics out of who gets the licence and who does not. I am sure the hon. member would agree with me that too often in the past we saw games played along those lines.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659805"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the word “transfer”, I fully appreciate his concern. However, there is no change at all from the old act, none whatsoever. Transfer is just a term of practice. We cancel a licence and reissue it to somebody else, because the person receiving the licence has to be somebody who qualifies. He has to be a core fisherman. We just cannot transfer a licence on a whim to somebody who is not connected. That is the problem in the fishery, where people are trying to get other people out of it so that those who remain can make a living. The wording in the new bill in clause 30(1) is the same as the fishing regulations in the old act. The word “practice”, to practice itself on change, but if there is wording that can give the member more security, absolutely. It is not crucial that it has to be written like that if it is not clear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659806"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other issues he talked about in relation to trust agreements and so on, we are aware of that. We have had discussions with groups. Some I have sympathy with, some I do not. As the member knows, people took advantage of that over the years for personal gain. People involved in the fishery want to benefit from it. They do not want people who are not necessarily connected raking in profits when they should be going to those on the ground. There are things that can be done, but these are done in regulations. They have nothing to do with the act, so--</div>

    </p><a name="Para659809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember growing up in Comeauville and it was the same at every wharf where the local fishermen would decide by intimidation who could integrate the fishery and who could not, and then we sort of opened that up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember a gentleman moving to western Nova Scotia from New Zealand. There was no way he would be encouraged to get in the fishery and no way that he would ever be defined as a core fisherman. Nobody would give him his first job but the guy had gumption. He bought the oldest boat he could find and got a licence before they were expensive. Bit by bit he learned to fish and within 15 or 20 years he was heading up the organization. He was representing those fishermen at that wharf.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fisherman becomes a fisherman by leaving the dock at the helm of a vessel, baiting a hook and catching a fish. That makes him a fisherman. It is not by some definition nor by a judgment of a tribunal or by decisions by another group as to who is a fisherman or that the person must be the grandson of a fisherman to be a fisherman. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things change and evolve but those types of directions and those types of claustrophobic things make me nervous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know a young man who started fishing this year, his first year as a captain in Comeauville, out of Meteghan, with his own rig. His father was not a fisherman nor was his grandfather, but he got the courage to try it. He got fishing under a trust agreement the first year, the first year that he was able to and the first year he could get out of the wharf. Now he is a fisherman. He has bought a rig and he is fishing. I hope he will do very well. I want to encourage young people to have that same opportunity. </div>

To make the fishermen 100% happy, it is a disaster environmentally, so it is tough. We need to find a balance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal process has some good elements in it. If we look on the environmental side of it or on the fisheries side, depending on the severity of the offence, there is a severity of the sanctions and we can choose to go to criminal areas.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are interim positions. One is that once members have the text of the bill, either before or after it has been presented in the House, we could consult based on that text. If the text were sent to the committee for study it could consult with the Canadian public and make recommendations to the minister for changes prior to the introduction of the bill.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a shame that there were no consultations on the text prior to the bill being introduced in the House. We know that at second reading the necessary substantive changes cannot be made to certain parts of the bill.</div>

The reality is that it is always good to talk about the fisheries policy of Canada. The unfortunate part is that we need to take a little history test before we go into the context of the bill, the future of the bill and what we believe the bill means for Canadian fishermen and their families across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill was tabled in the House of Commons for first reading on December 13, 2006. It was heralded as a bill that would modernize the fishery. It is 138 years old and it needs to be modernized. I agree with the department and I agree with the government that any bill that old needs to be looked at again and needs to be modernized. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are not fishermen. We are politicians. One would think that something this important to fishermen and their families across the country would have had their valuable input into the bill prior to its tabling.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government said, on many occasions, that this bill was brought to the House of Commons based on extensive consultations but that is simply not true.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the consultations were on were specific regions of the country and the policies of those regions, for example, the Atlantic policy review and the west coast Fraser River review. Areas of the country where there were certain specific problems were dealt with in a consultative form in terms of various policies. It was those policies from across the country that were brought to bureaucrats and, thus, they came up with the bill that was introduced on December 13, 2006.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind my Liberal colleagues that this is similar to a bill that was tried to be introduced in the mid-nineties but there was such pressure by the then Conservative Party, the Reformers at that time, that the bill was dropped, died on the order paper and did not see the light of day until last December.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the minister's own comments about consultation, I asked for a list of all the people who were consulted on the bill prior to its tabling on December 13, 2006. I am still waiting for the list.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I called fishermen, their organizations and provinces across the country and I asked them one simple question: “Were you consulted on the new fisheries act prior to its tabling on December 13 for your input?” I have spoken to aboriginal groups, to the provinces and to various fishing groups right across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last Maritime Fishermen's Union convention in Moncton, the<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78754,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78754&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Minister of Fisheries</A> stood and told everybody in the crowd that this bill was based on extensive consultation. I spoke after the minister and, with the minister in the audience, I asked the people in the audience to raise their hands if they were consulted on the new fisheries act prior to its tabling. Not one person in that room put up a hand.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are not going to consult with the fishermen on something that is that important in their lives then right away we have a problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government, of course, has said that we should get it to second reading and then we can have consultations after the fact. The danger of that, and why we support the Liberal hoist amendment, is that after second reading there are certain clauses and amendments that cannot be brought forward. They will be ruled out of order.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government talks about the fact that the Fisheries Act maintains the publicness of the fishery. However, I would remind the government of the 1997 Supreme Court decision in Comeau's Sea Foods Ltd. v. Canada where the Supreme Court unanimously stated that the fisheries was a common property resource going back to the Magna Carta days. The fish and the resources are owned by the Canadian people, not the government. There is no reference at all in the bill to the Supreme Court decision of 1997. In fact, the only thing the bill says is that Parliament is committed to maintaining the public character of the management of fish and fish habitat. Those are two different things. Any corporate lawyer can tell us that as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659839"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Chris Harvey, a QC lawyer from British Columbia, said that this bill was the greatest expropriation of a public resource in the history of Canada. I did not say that. That was said by a very well-qualified lawyer who understands the constitutional aspects of fish law in this country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also remind the Conservative Party of Canada that there is only one commercial fisherman who is a member of Parliament, and that is the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78407,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78407&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Delta—Richmond East</A>. Naturally one would assume that individual would have some knowledge of the commercial fishery.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This individual who cannot be named is a Conservative member, has been here since 1993, has been on the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans since 1993, and voiced his concerns about this report quite loudly. Because of his objections, the Conservative Party of Canada removed him from the committee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Conservatives are so proud of this act but say they understand there are problems with it that can be changed in committee, then why would they remove the only commercial fisherman in the House of Commons from the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans? Why would they do that? It is because they do not like the idea of dissent within the ranks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78407,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78407&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Delta—Richmond East</A>, who I have differences of opinion with obviously being that he is a Conservative and I am a New Democrat, is right in his objections to this bill. He was removed from the committee because of his objections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have travelled the country and spoken to many fishermen and their organizations. They have very serious objections to the method of this bill. I have also spoken to many environmental groups. I have held press conferences with environmental groups across the country. This bill does little to protect the integrity of fish and fish habitat. We see the direction the government is going in terms of what it is doing in the way of protection of fish habitat.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659845"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at Trout Pond in central Newfoundland, a lake that had five species of fish. What did the government allow the province to do under schedule 2 of the Mining Act? It allowed that healthy lake to become a tailings pond for a mining company. Instead of telling the mining company to keep its tailing pond separate from the water system, it allowed this lake to be destroyed, with the intention of course that it would restore something else so that there is no so-called net loss of fish and fish habitat. We have yet to see that in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659846"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the bill very carefully, it says the government must take into account certain aspects of habitat management. If we turn over a couple of pages it says the governor in council may do something completely different.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659847"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the bill. On page 22 clause 48 says very clearly, and I love this, “No person shall kill fish by any means other than fishing”. It seems fairly straightforward. If we turn over the page, we see that it says the governor in council may authorize “the killing of fish by means other than fishing”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the government trying to tell us? It says, “You can only kill fish by methods of fishing, but don't worry, the governor in council can override the department, the minister, the government, Parliament and committees and say you can kill fish by other means”, which means pollution and destroying fish habitat. For anyone in this country to say DFO has done a good job maintaining the habitat of our fish stocks is simply out to lunch.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind Parliament and those who may be listening, the Conservatives were in power in 1992 when the greatest collapse of a natural resource happened just off our east coast shores and that was the northern cod. Over $4 billion have been spent readjusting the east coast fishery and not one person at DFO or in government was ever held accountable. Even though the Hutchings and late Ransom Myers report said very clearly in the late 1990s that there was manipulation of their scientific reports within the department, not one person was ever held accountable for that act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cost $4 billion tax dollars. There was the readjustment of many people, who had to move away from the great province of Newfoundland and Labrador to central and western Canada. One would think somebody would have the honour to stand and say the government screwed up, but no one has. Now this same department and the same Conservatives are saying, “Trust us, we know what we are doing. Just get it to a committee after second reading and we will fix the problems that have been addressed”. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050">(1050)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para659851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reiterate one more time that there are certain amendments and certain clauses that cannot be passed after second reading. This is why we have offered the government the olive branch prior to Christmas and again in January. The olive branch was offered again with the hoist amendment to allow this bill to come to committee prior to the vote at second reading, so that we can have consultations with fishermen, the provinces and aboriginal groups and come up with an act that definitely works for the majority of fishermen and people across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been on the fisheries committee now since 1997. With the removal of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78407,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78407&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Delta—Richmond East</A>, I am now the longest serving member on that committee. I am very proud to be on that committee working with members of other parties. We tabled well over 27 reports I believe and almost 23 of them have been unanimous. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Conservatives, the Liberals, the Bloc and the NDP agree time and time again on various fishing reports throughout this country, that shows that the committee process works. It shows that the recommendations can be dealt with within committee and the committee can deal with proper evidence and analysis, so we can come up with the recommendations that will help government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to help the minister come up with a new act, but if this goes to committee after second reading, we simply will not be able to do it and thus will have no choice but to defeat the bill any way that we can. We would love to be able to work with the department and the government prior to that to put in the amendments that definitely work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We suspect that the intention of the government is what has been going on for a long time and that is the corporatization of the public resource. I remind the House that just recently in committee Larry Murray, the deputy minister of Fisheries and Oceans, rightfully said that the debate in this country is going to have to be about the future of the fishery. What he is basically saying is, do we retain it as a common property resource or do we go more to an ITQ system which means individual transferable quotas?</div>
    </p><a name="Para659856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two countries have recently moved toward that system: New Zealand and Iceland. Those are smaller countries with different fishing areas than we have, but they went from a common property resource to a more private managed resource. Both of them say they have had success with those systems although many people had to get out of the industry. It made other people very wealthy and there is still dissension within those countries on that type of system. I do not fear debate on an ITQ system. We need to have an open, honest debate and dialogue across the country, not slip it through the back door as we have been saying over the years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court said in 1997 that the fisheries is a common property resource owned by the people of Canada. If that is the case, why does the Jim Pattison Group control most of the wild salmon stocks on the west coast? Why does it control most of the herring stocks on the west coast? Why is it that the Barry Group controls most of the redfish stocks on the east coast? How is it that the Clearwater company managed to get just about all the scallop stocks on the east coast? </div>
    </p><a name="Para659858"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is that just the other day the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, along with the minister of fisheries in the province of Nova Scotia, allocated a 10 year allocation for clams on a particular beach in the Annapolis Valley? It is restricted now. Only this one company has access to those clams for a 10 year period. Everybody else, out the door. If it is a common property resource, how does the government consistently give a fisheries resource to private hands? </div>
    </p><a name="Para659859"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see that happening over and over again, and this bill will just entrench that. We will not be able to change the direction of that bill after second reading. The government knows it and we know it. We have had it on legal advice from the Library of Parliament, and from the lawyers who said very clearly that certain amendments cannot and will not be accepted after second reading. That is not the way to conduct open and transparent government, and open and transparent processes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659860"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have asked consistently that the bill be brought to fishermen and their families for active consultation. Let us bring in the amendments and we can make the bill actually work. As my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78938,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78938&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">West Nova</A> said, there are some good aspects in the bill. Just on a percentage basis, I would accept 40% of the bill right now having studied it very carefully.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055">(1055)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para659861"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have concerns with other aspects of the bill, namely, the relationship between the minister and the governor in council in terms of fish habitat, the fishery management orders and how allocations are done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659862"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is now talking about 15 year allocations. It is saying that a licence is a privilege and not a right. If that is the case, then how does someone take something that is a privilege to a bank to get a loan for something that may be a 15 year allocation? It is going to be very difficult to do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken with members of the Canadian Bankers Association and they have looked at this. They say that without sound collateral and something tangible in their hands, they simply will not loan the money that these fishermen need. That is a different topic related to fishery loan boards with the provinces and it is something that can be discussed at a later date.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the major problems with the bill. The thing is that we cannot say, as the minister or the government state, that a bill was brought to the House of Commons based on wide and active consultation when that simply is not true. That is simply unacceptable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the minister comes from Newfoundland. He has worked in the fishing areas for most of his younger life, as did the previous minister of fisheries. We respect them for what they did while working in those small communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78754,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78754&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</A> should know more than anybody else about the plight of fishermen in his own province. Over 50,000 people have had to leave the outports of Newfoundland and Labrador to find work elsewhere because of the collapse of a common property, the northern cod.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now see on the Northumberland Strait between Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Cape Breton Island that many lobster fishermen are having a difficult time meeting their catches this year, although catches are up in other areas. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know about the problem with trust agreements. I must give credit to the government that recently it came out with an agenda on how to deal with those trust agreements separate from the bill. I say to the minister right now that I am willing to work with him on that specific issue. The minister is correct that the last thing we need in this country are slipper skippers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bill were to pass the way it is now without putting in the strong Canadian content that we want it to have in terms of the public access and public right to the fishery, there would be nothing stopping John Risely of the Clearwater Group from selling his entire operation to foreign interests. What we would have down the road is what is now a common property resource owned and controlled by foreigners. That is what scares the hell out of fishermen and their families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at the plight of the great people of Canso, Nova Scotia. My hon. colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78918,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78918&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cape Breton—Canso</A> knows the area extremely well. Here is a community that has been fishing for over 400 years and had fish processed in the town of Canso. What happened this year? Nothing. What happened to the people of those areas? They are gone or they will leave. Hopefully, they will try to find something else. Hopefully, they will retire with some dignity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659871"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the plight of fishing communities in this country when the fish are turned over to the corporations that now are looking at China and other areas for processing of their fish. We know that pickerel from Lake Winnipeg is caught on the shores of Gimli, Manitoba. The corporations take that fish and freeze it, and send it to China, process it, freeze it again, send it back, and sell it in the Safeway stores in Winnipeg. That is apparently cheaper than processing it right there in Transcona. The package says “Product of Canada”, “Made in China”. The fish was caught in Lake Winnipeg and sold in Winnipeg. We are talking here about exporting our jobs and also the environmental aspect of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659872"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I want to say to the government that it has missed a terrific opportunity to work with the opposition, to work with the committee in order to ascertain a proper, brand new, modern fisheries act that would meet the needs of fishermen in the communities from coast to coast to coast and address the issues of our first nations people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we ask one more time for the government to delay the proceedings of this bill, bring it before the committee, so that we can have those true consultations that the fishermen and their families have asked for. We can then come up with a modern bill, reach an agreement in the House of Commons, and have something of which we can be very proud.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have many questions for him, but I probably only have time for a couple.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that the Supreme Court of Canada had indicated that fisheries resources were a common property resource in Canada. In fact, we agree completely with that fundamental principle. We think the wording in the bill and the public character of the management of the fishery supports this fundamental principle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether that language or any other language is in the bill, the law of the land is clear that it is a common property resource. Could the member point out for me anywhere in the bill where it contradicts that fundamental principle of it being a common property resource?</div>
    </p><a name="Para659878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is this. The member has crossed the country, holding poorly attended press conferences and talking to people here and there. In my opinion, he has been spreading misinformation from time to time about what is in the bill. He simply continues to complain about things, about the lack of consultation and so on, which I will address in a few moments. He talks about things that are not to his liking in terms of wording or things that are not in the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659879"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the member be more explicit on what changes he would like to make to the bill? He said that he had talked to fishermen. Could he tell us what they are saying in terms of specifics, what they would like to see in the bill and which of those things he knows for sure could not be amended at committee?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many sports fishermen on the west coast have expressed serious concerns about clauses 43 to 46. The parliamentary secretary knows clearly that Mr. Bill Otway and others have stated this.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would remove is the 15 year allocation comments. I would also remove the aspect of the governor in council authorizing the killing of fish by other means. These are things that we would remove.</div>

    </p><a name="Para659885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parliamentary secretary is so confident that it is a good bill, he should bring it to the committee now, before second reading, so we can put in those amendments and not have to worry about what may or may not be acceptable after second reading.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the examples that I have looked at has to do with the authority of the minister to delegate to DFO officials the granting or refusing of licences. This seems like a significant change of policy. It is a major step in the delegation of authority.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take, for example, the seismic testing off the west coast of Cape Breton. DFO's own scientists said that if the precautionary principle was used, then seismic testing should not be used on the west coast of Cape Breton Island because it could harm crab and larvae stocks. There was evidence that it may happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time the Liberal minister from Halifax West allowed the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board the right to make the final decision on whether that testing should go ahead. We argued the point that it was fish habitat and that it was the minister's sole authority to stop that activity from happening. The minister said no. We allowed that decision to be made somewhere else. The same thing could happen with fisheries licences. In some of these communities, nepotism is extremely rampant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also remind my hon. Conservative colleagues that Mr. Bagnall, the fisheries minister for Prince Edward Island, was one of the first people to support the bill prior to reading it. After he read it, he said that he would still support it but he had reservations. Look what happened to that government yesterday in the election.</div>

It basically states that the government would give all corporate polluters a really excellent deal. If these alternative measures are used, then the court must dismiss the charge laid against the alleged offender in respect of that offence. Also, a corporate polluter could admit guilt, but no admission, confession or statement accepting responsibility for a given act or omission made by an alleged offender as a condition of being dealt with by alternate measures would be admissible in evidence against them in any civil or criminal proceedings. Basically, corporate polluters can walk away. A company or an environmental group that wants to sue a corporate polluter is unable to do so and whatever admission it makes cannot be taken into court. </div>

I also remind the government that it talks about habitat protection and what the minister shall, must and might do. However, clause 63 says that the governor in council “may” make regulation for the conservation and protection of fish and fish habitat. The minister might think about it or get around to it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word “may” is extremely dangerous. No matter what the minister or the parliamentary secretary states, if the bill goes through the way it is, the governor in council can override that and do something completely different.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not believe that fish should get out of the way of other development. We believe that if there are going to be mining or other activities regarding fish habitat, the fish must be protected to the very best of our ability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now fish are stressed in lakes, rivers and oceans across the country. Report after report have stated very seriously the decline of our ocean aquatic species and our lake and river species. They are under threat consistently. What we need is an act that protects the integrity of fish and fish habitat so future generations can have a lively income.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if we ask if stakeholders were consulted on the principles, themes and common sense ideas contained in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>, I can only say yes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did interested parties, ranging from unions to aboriginal groups, know in advance the broad tenets of the proposed bill? Did they know it would highlight expanded roles for them in decision making? Did they know that a renewed Fisheries Act would more carefully take into account the conservation and protection of fish and fish habitat when fisheries management decisions were made? Did they know that it would provide for greater stability, transparency and predictability in fishery access and allocation?</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115">(1115)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para659921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course they did. It was the stakeholders themselves who put these items on the consultation table and implored us to act accordingly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veterans of this place should know that work on a new act has been ongoing for a number of years. Indeed, much of the initial consultative work was carried out under the watch of the previous government. We commend the previous government for that and for the incredibly valuable input from the standing committee over the years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> grew out of hundreds of fisheries renewal consultations and information sessions from coast to coast to coast, all designed to build a modern fisheries management regime that meets the challenges of the 21st century. These consultation efforts included: the Atlantic fisheries policy review, the Pacific new directions report, the Pearse-MacRae report on the future of the Pacific salmon fishery, the aboriginal fisheries strategy review, and the environmental process modernization plan, to name just a few.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to say that the minister had an extraordinarily strong basis for proposing changes to the act is really an understatement. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> reflects most of the significant findings and policy directions stemming from these and other consultation initiatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To talk a little about just two of these initiatives is quite illustrative of my point, so let me talk first of all about the Atlantic fisheries policy review. In fact, it was a huge consultation exercise that lasted over five years and much of it informed the provisions that we now find in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review was actually initiated in May 1999 to create a framework for managing east coast fisheries and to build consensus around a renewed vision for the fishery. It was a collaborative process with a broad citizen engagement approach through which advice and feedback were continuously sought from fish harvesters, processors and industry representatives, from the governments of the Atlantic provinces, Quebec and Nunavut, from aboriginal groups, community representatives and environmental groups, and from academics and other interested individuals. This is a very high level overview that I have given of a very comprehensive process that has lasted a long time. Therefore, in the interests of time, I would like to table a document listing in detail the consultations undertaken during the Atlantic fisheries policy review.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2001, DFO released a comprehensive discussion document that served as a springboard for public discussion and debate. The department subsequently sought advice and feedback based on the discussion document during in-depth public consultations in 19 communities across the region. Out of that exercise came the Atlantic fisheries policy framework and it reflects the many voices heard during consultations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June of the same year, the independent panel on access criteria was established to review and make recommendations on access criteria for providing new or additional access in increasing Atlantic commercial fisheries. The panel sought input from industry, the Atlantic provinces, Quebec, Nunavut and aboriginal organizations and released its report in April 2002.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister of the day responded to the IPAC report in November 2002 and adopted the new access framework to guide all decisions on new or additional access to Atlantic commercial fisheries that have undergone substantial increases in resource abundance or landed value.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DFO has begun implementation of some of the key strategies of the policy framework that I have mentioned. However, it is only through a modernized fisheries act, which we have here before us in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>, that we can provide the tools and authorities to both DFO and industry to make significant strides in our achieving of the vision in these two policy documents. Here is how.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objectives of the Atlantic fisheries policy framework address the major fisheries management challenges. They include: threats to conservation, excess participation and impediments to economic viability, ineffectiveness of top-down management, uncertainty in access and allocation, and closed decision making processes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislative proposals in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> directly address these fisheries management challenges through a number of specific proposals within the bill. They include provisions concerning conservation and sustainable use, self-reliance and collaboration, shared stewardship, and stable and transparent access and allocation.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120">(1120)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para659933"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, consultations have also taken place with environmental and conservation NGOs. In fact, the environmental conservation and habitat protection provisions found in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> were equally informed by the process with non-fishery stakeholders, as I have mentioned, so I think it would be useful to touch upon NGO engagement in what is known as the environmental process modernization plan, or EPMP. It is an engagement that actually connects the dots back to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building on the results of an earlier national habitat blueprint initiative, DFO launched the EPMP in early 2004. It was aimed at making the habitat management program more effective in the conservation and protection of fish and fish habitat, more efficient in the delivery of its services to Canadians, and more integrated with the interests and priorities of partners and stakeholders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after launching the EPMP, 13 national or regional conservation and environmental NGOs were invited to a consultation meeting held on June 15, 2004. All participants expressed support for the direction that DFO was taking on the EPMP and made a number of suggestions on how they could help. In September 2004 eight NGOs agreed to establish a steering committee to identify common areas of interest and priorities for fish habitat management and the development of an agreement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout 2005 and 2006 the steering committee held numerous meetings, prepared discussion papers, and organized and conducted a national workshop. The purpose was to confirm areas of common interest, to set short, medium and long term priorities, and to establish objectives to be addressed through an agreement expected to be signed in 2007.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 12, 2005 the department held a session with environmental NGOs on the EPMP and Fisheries Act renewal. The meeting took place in Ottawa and via webcast across the country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2006 DFO wrote to the Canadian Environmental Network and several prominent ENGOs proposing that a joint committee be established to organize a major national workshop on these and related matters. The joint committee was established and a workshop was held in October 2006 with 25 conservation and environmental NGO representatives from across Canada, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, an observer from the Assembly of First Nations, and staff from DFO's regional offices and national headquarters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other things, and I stress this, the workshop discussed renewal of the Fisheries Act. Following the workshop, an ENGO delegation met with staff from the minister's office and senior DFO officials. The workshop provided a sound base for establishing an important dialogue on habitat management with ENGOs and has resulted in the establishment of a national fish habitat management coordinating committee to pursue its recommendations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, throughout 2006, DFO regional and headquarters staff held sessions on the modernization plans and Fisheries Act renewal across Canada, with municipalities, industry associations, aboriginal groups, federal government departments, provincial agencies, consultants, associations of professionals, community and voluntary groups, and NGOs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that I have gone into what some members might consider tedious detail on such endeavours to outline just how significant and comprehensive the consultation process has been. It is equally clear that broader based consultations have been just as rigorous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I reiterated in the debate held on February 23 in this place, between August 2005 and December 2006, DFO officials met over 300 different Canadian stakeholder groups to discuss the modernization initiative. They represented a very substantial cross-section of first nations interests, recreational and commercial fishers and processors, natural resource industries, ENGOs and the public.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following meetings with provincial and territorial fisheries and aquaculture ministers in March and May 2006, it was evident that there was a strong desire from our provincial and territorial partners to push for changes to the Fisheries Act. As we have said many times already, it is 138 or 139 years old. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, at a meeting of the Canadian Council of Fisheries and Aquaculture Ministers in Yellowknife in October 2006, we were urged to introduce changes to the Fisheries Act that would foster enhanced federal, provincial and territorial collaboration and help promote a stable, transparent and predictable decision making environment. So much for the consultation myth.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125">(1125)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para659945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, it is not as if the consultation process ended with the introduction of the bill. Following the tabling of the bill, DFO sent thousands of letters to stakeholders and provided over 100 detailed information sessions to a vast number of groups to help them understand the parliamentary process, details of the bill and how they could provide input. The department has also met with almost all the provinces and territories to provide technical briefings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DFO headquarters, as well as regional offices, either held telephone conferences or met with about 125 key stakeholders within 48 hours of tabling. These stakeholders included the commercial fishing industry, the recreational fishing industry, ENGOs, resource industries, aboriginal groups, other federal government departments, as well as representatives from provincial and territorial governments. The department continues to hold follow-up information sessions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister himself sent out over 1,000 letters to stakeholders in mid-December, including about half to first nation and aboriginal groups, alerting them to the fact that the bill was tabled and where to find it. Canadians across the country are making their views known now by communicating with their MPs, their minister, myself, the media and so on, which is exactly how the democratic process should work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we took and are taking extraordinary steps to engage our stakeholders and seek their input into the policy directions on the new legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the process should be allowed to go forward, formal consultation on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> will take place through the parliamentary process. The standing committee may invite individuals and representatives of organizations who have an interest in the legislation to provide comments either in writing or by personal appearance. The public will also have an opportunity for input as the bill goes through a similar process in the Senate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the bill becomes law, stakeholders and anyone who has an interest in the issue will have a further opportunity to provide input and offer views of how the various sections of this legislation should be made operational, that is, through the regulations. This will be done through a transparent and open process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the renewed Fisheries Act, the commitment to encourage the participation of Canadians in the making of decisions that affect the management of the fisheries and the conservation or protection of fish or fish habitat will be a principle that the minister and every person engaged in the administration of the new act will take into account.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the ongoing engagement of stakeholders, this principle will be made a reality through general power for the minister to establish advisory panels for a wide variety of purposes. We find that in the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, stakeholders now have had more than four months to digest the information and few have indicated that there are elements of the bill that surprise them. They may disagree with some of the details on how certain sections are worded but there is no new policy change in the bill that has not been heard or seen before. Therefore, we strongly believe that it is now up to the parliamentary committee to consult on the wording of the bill after second reading.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we pretend that the bill is perfect? Of course not. However, we believe that it is as close to perfect that six years of consultation and compromise will allow.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this amendment goes through, resulting in the killing of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>, then the tens of thousands of hours of consultation with stakeholders that have taken place under our watch and under the watch of the previous government will have gone on for nothing. I cannot imagine anything more disrespectful to those stakeholders, not to mention the whole notion of parliamentary procedure, process and democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to move forward now. Fishery stakeholders cannot afford to wait any longer. The fishery has changed, the industry has changed and resource users have changed. The current act no longer gets the job done and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> would.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage all hon. members to not let this hoist amendment become a hijack amendment. What is on the line here are six years of intense consultations and the time and trust of stakeholders. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is ultimately at stake here? Nothing less than the lives and livelihoods of countless thousands of Canadians, as well as the critical measures in the bill that would help preserve and protect our precious rivers, streams and ocean waters. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we let Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> die on the order paper, who can predict when another version of the bill will see the light of day? It is time to move forward now. Fishery stakeholders cannot afford to wait any longer and we want to get the job done. </div>

    </p><a name="Para659961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If what the hon. member is saying is true, and I will take him at his word, then he should provide this House with a list of all the individuals and groups that were consulted on a new fisheries act prior to December 13, 2006. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not think Shawn A-in-chut Atleo, head of the B.C. First Nations people, lied to me when he said that he was not consulted. I do not think Phil Morlock, head of the Canadian Sportfishing Industry Association representing a $7 billion industry, lied to me when he said that he was not consulted. When I asked members of the Maritime Fishermen's Union, with the minister present, if they were consulted before the bill was tabled, I do not think they lied to me when they did not put up their hands.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere along the way someone is not telling the truth. If there were consultations on the bill prior to December 13, then I would ask the parliamentary secretary to table the list in this House right now so we can cross-check and double-check.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the member said, incorrectly, that the hoist amendment would kill the bill. That is simply not true.

    </p><a name="Para659965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one correct thing the member said is that we need a new fisheries act but it should not be done by bureaucrats from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, an organization that is definitely not trustworthy, although there are good people working there, because of its history on fish and fish management. The reality is that we in the committee would like to work with the government to get a new act that really meets the needs of fishermen and their families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the parliamentary secretary is really saying or not saying is that there is an opportunity, if the bill goes to committee after second reading, to have consultations across the country. However, what may happen is that the bill may die in committee if we do not get the amendments we like.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hoist amendment is based on parliamentary tradition in that we either had a hoist amendment for three months because we were nearing the end of a session or for six months because sessions only lasted about six months in those days. It was a way to get a piece of legislation out of the way but it is not a way to bring consultation, and that is very clear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the department would be glad to provide the member or anyone else who wants a list of those sessions that provided input for the bill. We have had this discussion before. If the member thinks that we have the right as parliamentarians or as a department of government to write a bill and then to take it and go around to every fishery stakeholder group or aboriginal group and ask them what they think of it, that is not how it works and he should know that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member from British Columbia should have no problem standing now and tabling the document in the House of Commons because there are many other aspects to this. We did not even get into the Larocque decision but that is a discussion for another day.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fundamentally disagree with the parliamentary secretary when he says that the hoist amendment would kill the bill. What would kill the bill is when it goes to committee where we have consultations with fishermen and then try to move amendments that are not accepted because of the laws of Parliament. That would be a terrific waste of our time, the fishermen's time and the resources of this Parliament.</div>

The people in the field educated him when he would not listen to us that it was not the intent at all. In fact, we said here in the House that we were more than willing to use the exact wording in the bill that the courts used.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultations have been held since a new bill was attempted to be introduced in the House by then Minister Crosbie at the time.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, he talked about the fact that we cannot make amendments as we moved forward. Of course we can.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoist motion would kill the bill. We cannot take the bill out around the country and the member has been here long enough to know the difference. Maybe my colleague would like to comment on that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding is Sydney--Victoria in Cape Breton. It is substantially a large riding and fisheries is a big industry in my riding. I have what I call two bookend harbours: Pleasant Bay at one end of my riding and at the other end of my riding is New Waterford. There are approximately 300 kilometres of coastline between those two communities and probably 30 communities that rely on the fishery. Those 30 communities along with the fishers are a substantial amount and probably close to 1,000 families rely directly on the fishery. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those communities we have fish plant workers, people selling supplies to the fishers, truckers, buyers, and even the tourist industry hinges on our fisheries industry in my riding and in Cape Breton. Many people come to Cape Breton Island to see the fishing communities. There are almost $100 million worth of products sold in Cape Breton. This is why the fishing industry is important and why we have to be careful with this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal Party is not against changes to the Fisheries Act. The act is over 138 years old. The previous minister of fisheries from the Liberal Party said he instigated some changes to the act. He made it very clear in 2005 that he wanted the committee to do a proper job with an assessment of the fishery. He also wanted to make sure that the fishers and all the stakeholders were properly consulted. Problems arise today as they did in the spring of 2007 because consultations were not done. We had no choice but to decide that we had to hoist the bill. That was hoisted, as many know, on February 23.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the home front, my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78918,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78918&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cape Breton—Canso</A> and I received many calls over the winter about the concerns that the fishers were having and what was going to happen. We hosted a town hall meeting in Sydney River which is pretty well in the middle of our two ridings. We had a great turnout for that winter meeting. April 12 is still winter on Cape Breton Island. We had over a hundred fishers and they were very concerned. They were also very upset. They were overwhelmingly against Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>. There was a lot of opposition to the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people were very concerned about the bill and wanted it shelved. Our constituents at that meeting were very satisfied with what we did in February by hoisting the bill. The people wanted more consultation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were told that fisheries and oceans did not include how the fishermen would be impacted with this new act. A new fisheries act would place too much power in the bureaucracy and many fishermen felt the act was already dysfunctional. They were not comfortable with this bill at all from their previous experience.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishermen pointed out that the wording in clauses dealing with the transfer of licences was too vague. Fishermen need some assurances that the act will not take away the value of their licence. Sometimes that is all they have at the end of the day is the value of their licence. Many fishermen had no trust in DFO. This is largely a result of this ill-conceived legislation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to get off the topic too much, but time and time again we see how this Conservative government puts bills forward in the House. When good bills are put forward and the committee does its work, the government squashes it. I have seen this with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169678,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169678&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-278</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not go into the problems we had with the previous government and dealing with bills. I want to stick to the facts, especially about the meeting we had in Cape Breton on April 12. Many of the people in that room also thought there needed to be changes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659995"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One very eloquent spokesperson for a lot of the fishers, especially the crab fishers, was Josephine Burke-Kennedy. She stated at the meeting that she worried about what the bill would say about transferring licences, as I previously mentioned. She said that in time she wanted her son to be able to take over his father's licence if he wanted to and not have interference. She also took issue with the proposed bill's lack of clarity with trust agreements and the right of the department to refuse a licence based on suspicion in the licence transfer. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659996"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very legitimate concern. She spoke on behalf of most of the people at that meeting. They wanted to make sure that fishers have a right to fish. They should also be allowed to sell their licence to whomever they want to. The fisheries minister has no right to take the quota away from anybody. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1145"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1145"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1145">(1145)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para659997"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new bill has impact. Fishers are concerned about their licences being taken up by large corporations. We can say that they should not fear that, but they do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para659998"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is not the time for consultation. As many of my colleagues from Atlantic Canada, and even those from the west coast realize, this time of the year many fishers get up at 4 o'clock in the morning and they are lucky to be done before 5 o'clock in the evening. They really have no time for consulting now. They are in a stressful situation and it is dangerous, but they have to make their money in a few months. Now is not the time of course. The time will be in the fall.</div>
    </p><a name="Para659999"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that the Fisheries Act needs to be changed because it is over 100 years old. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660000"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of things have changed in the fishery over the last 20 years. The fish population has changed dramatically, especially on the Atlantic coast where there used to be a lot of groundfish, but as a result of overfishing and the use of draggers that has changed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660001"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the diminishing cod stock, which is a predator to shellfish, there is a lot more shellfish in our region, which is good. We want to administer that and regulate it properly because it is the fishing industry's salvation. The window is short when a fisher is in the shellfish business because he probably has to make his money in two months. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of fishers go out west to work in the oil patch in between seasons in order to make ends meet. The business is not as good as people perceive it to be. It is a risky business; prices go up and down. One thing is for sure though and that is that the fishers have a licence. They believe they should keep their licence and it should retain value.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the act a bit because it is not all bad. The new act would give fishers a greater say in their quotas and a greater say in conservation. Conservation is one of the key points for fishers involved with maintaining and dealing with the habitat of the fish stocks. This is a good part of the act. We agree that all is not bad here. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal system has been mentioned here many times today, and that really makes fishers nervous. Who is really going to have a say in dealing with the fish stocks? Who is going to have a say with respect to their fish licence? Are they just going to bring in some person? Fishers have a really major concern with that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is not bad enough, provincial ministers are having a problem with the bill, and that really makes fishing communities nervous. This tribunal is probably one of the biggest concerns because fishers do not understand what the repercussions are going to be. There is too much uncertainty out there now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some good things in the bill, but there are some major problems with it. The Fisheries Act is over 100 years old. Let us stop and think about what we should be doing. Why do we not take another year? Why does the committee not bring this up in the fall, make it a priority? The committee could bring in stakeholders from all around and get to the bottom of it. The committee could talk to fishermen throughout winter. We could have a good piece of legislation for next spring. There is nothing wrong with that. Everybody is comfortable with that. People are still going to fish this year. People are still going to have the same livelihood. Communities will still prosper when the fishing is good. Why not wait a year? That is the whole point here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are concerned about the rush job that is happening here. We are concerned about the economy in Atlantic Canada. These communities drive our economy. Whether it is a car dealership or teachers who teach kids, everybody has a connection in our communities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that at the end of the day fishers and fish families want to be more in charge of their destiny. They want to have more say. They want to have a say in who is going to be on these tribunals. They want to have a say on how their stocks are going to be managed so they will continue to have a livelihood many years down the road. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fishers definitely want their licence because it is a main value to have. Many times when a fisher retires he still owes some money on his boat; he still owes some money on his gear. A fishers licence is value and it is a value he wants to pass on. It is very important. </div>

We had a meeting in Sydney River and the people spoke. The fishers spoke to us and they told us to get back here and shelve this thing until proper consultations were done, they have a say and are comfortable with it, because we hope this new act can last another 100 years and be an act for the future of our fishing industry.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister talks about all the provincial ministers, but the PEI people have chosen.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the minister had been in Sydney River on April 12 at the town hall meeting. Maybe sometimes the best thing for a minister and some of the bureaucracy is to go to town hall meetings and listen to the people, listen to their concerns and fears. They are the people. If the government does not listen to them, the people will speak again. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660030"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very simple. Bring it before the committee. Let the committee do its work. That would be the simple way to do it. The committees are here for that. The committee should talk to the fishermen over the winter and then next spring have some proper legislation with which everybody can agree. If the Conservatives drive it through now and people are not comfortable with it, they will not buy into it. Then we will have more problems on the wharf.</div>

    </p><a name="Para660037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a lot of town hall meetings, we saw two generations. It could be a guy who started in a little dory and built up a business. He might be 70 or 75 years old. His son and his grandson are there. They are all thinking, what about the next generations? Will there be something there? They are looking at us and telling us to stop for one minute and bring this back to the table.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660038"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is amazing how knowledgeable the fishers are about how the committee works. The fisheries committee came to their communities. They have a lot of faith in it. They want it to go back to committee and then they would like their representatives to make presentations and travel the country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never heard a fisher yet say to me “Let us get it done now. Push it through”. Fishers want to wait a year. They want to have proper consultation.

    </p><a name="Para660041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think people do not have a great deal of confidence in being told that someone is from the government and is there to help. That is what we want to do with this legislation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of the speakers referred to the work of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. My friend and colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78886,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78886&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</A>, is the longest serving member of that committee, and I guess I would be the second. Over the last seven years, I have been on and off that committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sat on about eight different committees in the House and I am very confident in saying that the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans would be the least partisan. All members work every day. At each meeting and on each issue we undertake, we work in the best interests of those in the fishery. Members from the west coast are just as interested and as knowledgeable about the issues that impact on the people of Atlantic Canada and the members from Atlantic Canada understand a lot of the challenges faced by those in the fishery on the west coast.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was mentioned in the House before that my colleague worked on 26 different studies done by the committee over his time and 22 of them were presented unanimously. All members on the committee supported those reports going forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just completed a fairly extensive study on the concerns around sealing. It was a unanimous report. We went to Newfoundland and were out on the ice in the southern gulf. We witnessed it and stood together, shoulder to shoulder. When we come and stand behind the minister now, that gives the minister's position even greater strength. Canada and the House speak with a unified voice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is an opportunity and a willingness to do that with this legislation. The principles are not out of whack, but there is so much concern. My colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78815,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78815&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sydney—Victoria</A> has mentioned some of the concerns we have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned myself. I know in the last Parliament the previous fisheries and oceans minister had corresponded with the standing committee and requested it undertake a full and complete study so when legislation was presented, there would be a body of information from which we could draw on in order to develop the legislation for a new fisheries act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steering committee of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans agreed to go forward with it, but the then opposition critic, the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78754,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78754&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</A>, changed his mind, and the study died.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was mentioned already in this debate that our colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78407,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78407&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Delta—Richmond East</A>, a commercial fisherman, probably one of the most knowledgeable members in the House on the commercial fishery, is no longer on the committee because he voiced his concern over aspects of the new fisheries act. He was removed from the committee. That is a great disservice not only to the government, but also to the people in the industry from coast to coast to coast.</div>

That is not what is going on. We approve of many of these things, and I will talk about some of them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, we approve so much of this in principle. A number of the ministers in the past government had tried to advance the new Fisheries Act and ran into some opposition, but in principle I think we can come out of this with a much better act should we bring this to committee prior to second reading.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of groups have approached us in opposition. Anybody opposed to government legislation were the first to be notified. As my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78815,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78815&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sydney—Victoria</A> mentioned, we hosted a round of meetings within the constituency. We met with a group in Sydney River not that long ago and the concerns were broad and deep.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke with a group of fishermen in Canso just last week, representatives of the Guysborough County Inshore Fishermen's Association. Although they supported it, there were still a number of reservations that they wanted to register with me. It is deep.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to read from correspondence from the Atlantic Salmon Federation, which has done incredible work for decades on the salmon fishery. I know the minister would like to put himself out as a great supporter of Atlantic salmon. With the release of the Atlantic salmon endowment fund, it now can go forward. When we were in government, we established a $30 million fund that would go toward a number of community initiatives to support Atlantic salmon.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660055"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is funny that when the $30 million were being peeled out and allocated to the endowment fund, the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78754,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78754&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</A> voted against that budget. In fact, he had not supported Atlantic salmon at all. I know when he was ready to receive requests for funding and made that announcement, he pretty much separated his shoulders, patting himself on the back for all the great work that he did on Atlantic salmon. We know that is not the truth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660056"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Atlantic Salmon Federation has registered its concerns about this legislation. I will read from the correspondence. It states, “The Atlantic Salmon Federation is requesting that Bill C-45 be withdrawn and that a meaningful consultation process be put in place that allows the public the time to study changes that are being proposed in the Fisheries Act and provide considered input to the act”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand the importance of Atlantic salmon in our recreational fisheries. We know the price per pound for salmon commercially, but recreationally it is over $300 per pound. When we talk about anglers going into a community, staying overnight or whatever, it is a very substantive component of our tourism industry. For them to voice their concern, the minister has to sit up and take notice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have received a great number of interventions by environmental groups. A couple of the members from the NDP had cited a few before. They are calling for us right away to withdraw Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>. These include the Alberta Wilderness Association, BC Federation of Fly Fishers, BC Nature, Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, Fisheries Recovery Action Committee and Georgia Strait Alliance. These are freshwater fisheries as well as east and west coast fisheries. Other groups are Watershed Watch Salmon Society, Yukon Conservation Society, the David Suzuki Foundation, Sierra Club and Ecology Action Centre. These groups say that the new act has no teeth to protect fish or fish habitat. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does get a resounding endorsement from the Canadian Mining Association. I think that if I were a fisher and the only endorsement I could really hold in the window was from the Canadian Mining Association that would offer me a little concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have been getting from the government throughout this is the following: “Leave it with us. Trust us. We're going to look after this. It's not a problem. Don't be scared. We're okay. We're cool with that because we're going to look after it. We're going to look after the best interests of the fishers of this country.”</div>
    </p><a name="Para660061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen what has happened when we leave that trust in the hands of this government. We know how well the government supported its promise on income trusts. As for the Atlantic accord, where the greatest fraud was “a promise not kept”, we know that promise was not kept with regard to the Atlantic accord. We know that deal was torn up and thrown away. We can ask the people of Newfoundland and Labrador and the people of Nova Scotia how much faith they have in this government keeping its word.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see it personally, too, from people in my riding, people such as Joyce Carter. She is a great lady, a beautiful lady, and the widow of a second world war vet, who was promised by the then leader of the opposition, our current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, that the veterans independence program was going to be instituted as soon as the Conservative government took power. We know where that promise went as well. It was just thrown away.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no trust in the fishing community that the government can deliver on what it said, which was that the fishing community should leave it with the government and it would look after them. There is no trust there. I think we saw that last night with the election results in Prince Edward Island.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just one final point on this, which is about the hilarity of last week and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105827,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105827&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</A>. The students of this country, the young people of this country, left their trust with the government and we saw how 80% of the student funding that was there last year no longer exists. We saw that millions were peeled out of the student summer job placement fund. We saw community groups that for decades have sponsored work opportunities for summer students in this country left stranded and out in the cold. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that minister stood here and said that everything was fine, everything was wonderful, and that we could look at the groups that got funding. He said there were five groups in my riding that got funding. If I had asked him seven more questions, and he gave me five groups, that would have covered the entire number of grants issued in my riding. But the minister said that everything was fine, everything was wonderful. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has to be the playbook of this government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Conservative candidate in my riding who said the other day said that this new round of funding for the students is just typical second-round funding. There was never any second-round funding, but if the truth does not fit, let us make up an answer. That seems to be the modus operandi for this government, but people are not buying it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the act, we have heard a number of great concerns. What we heard from the fishermen and what I have been hearing from the fishermen over the last while is with regard to the position on trust agreements. With DFO, under a past minister, we have just gone through a whole redevelopment of a crab plan in Cape Breton and the Eastern Shore. One of the rulings that came out was that some of the temporary access holders were forced by DFO, by the government of the time, to move toward trust agreements. In order to qualify for a licence, they were to band together and make a trust agreement. It was about two years ago that this provision came forward.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215">(1215)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para660069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are being told by the government that trust agreements are no more, that trust agreements will not be recognized and we have seven years to get out of them, but all trust agreements are not bad. There are people in the industry who would never have had an opportunity to get into the industry if it were not for trust agreements. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be some type of grandfathering. There is now so much uncertainty with regard to what is going on around the trust agreements. I know that we do not want big corporations holding the lion's share of quota allocations. That is not what we want for the industry. We believe in an independent industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All trust agreements are not bad. We need more consultation on the trust agreements. We have to find out what is right, what works, and what is best for the industry, and that is done through consultation. We must show the fishers some respect. Let us consult with the fishers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same for access to capital. My colleague from West Nova talked about that as well. I think that sort of spills right over to the trust agreements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On B class lobster licence holders, we do not know where they are going to land after the new act comes out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tribunals, my colleague from the city of Victoria registered some concerns about the tribunals, so this is where the discussion takes place because I do not think the tribunals are going to be a bad thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a concern that there is no appeal after a tribunal decision is made, but I think that if we give tribunals the power to address violations in the Fisheries Act, it would make it more expedient. We know that there are people out there who abuse their privileges. They are caught the first, the second and the third time. There are abuses within the fishery, but they are minor. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of fishers who abuse their privileges is minor, I would think, but there has to be some kind of recourse. I think these tribunals certainly would be well positioned. I think they would make it a little more expedient. They would cut down on the wait times. They would take some pressure off the courts. However, I believe there should still be some type of appeal process. I hope that we can address this through the committee and through interventions with the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660077"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister talked about the transfer of responsibility to the provinces. He listed a number of provinces that support this in principle. I really question where the provinces are coming from on this because I would be concerned. I know that the opposition members in those provinces are expressing concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this more downloading on the provinces, with increased responsibility? If the government is looking at an increased responsibility for provinces in habitat and in enforcement in these particular areas, we see no sign in the estimates of any transfer of money over to the provinces. Where are the provinces going to get the money to deliver on these additional responsibilities? I do not see that in the legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would think that a little bit of the spillover, as referenced earlier, is in the outcome in P.E.I. There is a fairly substantive fishing community around P.E.I., and I would think that a little bit of the spillover there lies in the lap of the fisheries minister and the federal government in trying to ram this down the throats of the fishers in this country and certainly the fishers in P.E.I. I am concerned about the transfer of those responsibilities to the provinces and the provinces' ability to execute on those responsibilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of science has not been mentioned here so far today. I do not think it has been addressed. I think the cost of science and where we are going with the science is going to be a substantive aspect of where the fishery is going in the future, coming out of the Larocque decision. What we are hearing from fishermen, the guys who go out and harvest the resource, is that they are pretty much fed up with it. They bought into this. They know that in order to have a successful and sustainable industry science has to be the basis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660081"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have only a minute left, I will try to wrap up with this. We have put so much on the backs of the fishermen. We have expected so much. They bought into it in that the allocations would go toward a portion of paying for the science, but it seems to be the slippery slope. More and more allocation is going toward science. We know now through the Larocque decision that this is not going to hold water any longer. Where are the moneys for that?</div>
    </p><a name="Para660082"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should be playing a greater role in helping our fishermen with the provision of science, but I think that has to be addressed through the committee and committee hearings. We would like to see the bill go to committee prior to second reading, so that when we go forward the principles could be maintained, but we could have a fisheries act that serves this industry in a much better way.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin, I wanted to bring to his attention clause 23 of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>, the new Fisheries Act, which states:</div>

      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill specifically mentions Parts 1 and 3. Part 2 of the act, as he will know when he refreshes his memory on this, is the part about habitat, pollution prevention, conservation and so on.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main question for the member is about something that is still not clear to me. It should be clear by now, because there have been a number of speakers from his party, but it is not. Where we are at this point is that we have had a second reading motion. We have begun debate at second reading on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>.

    </p><a name="Para660088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the amendment passes, the bill is dead.

We believe that if we support the hoist amendment and if then we were to engage the standing committee to go forward with its study we would have some real consultation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that the member has made reference throughout the debate to the fact that ample consultation has been done. That is not our sense at all. It is not the sense of several others who have spoken here today about the consultation myth. Sasquatch is a myth, the Loch Ness monster is a myth, and that is what this consultation is. The member talks about having had consultation, but nobody has really seen it. Last month we had a meeting of a hundred fishermen and two of them said they got some kind of a questionnaire. That was the extent of the consultation among a group of about a hundred.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member asks me what we can do. If we support this hoist amendment and then go and engage the committee and come forward with a solid package of information and something substantive that can go toward the legislation, that is our understanding of what can happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that probably this being committee business between the members here that we should have officials from the Table and the Clerk's office sit down with us. What concerns us is that when I look at things such as what we can do, even the minister himself today referred to the clean air act. We know that the clean air act went to committee before second reading. That was clarified by my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78886,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78886&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out that inland we use airplanes. For more than 30 years we had two airplanes involved in our operations. It is very expensive, a huge investment, without a lot of tenure or surety about our licences.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member talked about research and science. In the middle of Canada there is the Experimental Lakes Area.

    </p><a name="Para660108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard nothing about consultation. As the member talks about consultation, has there been any with inland fisheries, the people in the centre of Canada, or anywhere in Canada?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hope that if we could do one thing here today it would be to send a message to the government that fishers want in, Canadians want in, the good people in Kenora want in and the freshwater fishery wants in.

If we are to have another act that lasts 136 years, let us make it one that works for those people involved so that we can have a successful and sustainable industry. That is our hope with the discussion here today.</div>

I listened to the debate this morning and there obviously is some disagreement among the members with regard to the appropriate process which Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> should undertake. Let me address a couple of the points that have been raised in debate which deserve some comment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the issue of a bill going to committee prior to second reading has been the representation of a number of members with regard to this bill. It has to do with the fact that the bill has not been amended in some 36 years. It has to do with the fact that there are numerous stakeholders. Fisheries in Canada are extremely complex and there are many stakeholders as has been pointed out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the argument that the bill should be hoisted and go to committee for some consultations. The allegation is there have not been consultations and it would appear that representations made by various stakeholder groups would tend to support that allegation, that consultations should have taken place. I should note that even in the summary of the bill it is stated:</div>
    </p><a name="Para660114"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>This enactment repeals and replaces the Fisheries Act. It seeks to provide for the sustainable development of Canadian fisheries and fish habitat in collaboration with fishers, the provinces, aboriginal groups and other Canadians.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para660115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how some members define collaboration, but I would suspect that it does constitute to some extent, maybe a great extent, that there has been ample consultation with regard to a draft text or at least the principal issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question with regard to second reading has to do with once the House has passed a bill at second reading, Parliament has given the bill approval in principle. The bill then goes to committee where witnesses are called. There is an opportunity at committee stage to propose amendments from time to time. Sometimes there are an enormous number of amendments made and many of them are ruled out of order. The reason they would be ruled out of order is that they would be contradictory to the decision of Parliament that the bill had received approval in principle. Effectively committee stage amendments are meant only to correct errors or to make certain modifications which are compatible with the fundamental principles of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today in debate members have provided a number of examples of changes they would like to see to the bill as it is right now as we debate it at second reading, which in their view and I suspect in the view of the committee clerk, would be out of order because they are beyond the scope of the bill or amend the fundamental principle of the bill which has been approved by Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660118"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very important question. I wanted to comment on this because the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78754,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78754&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">fisheries minister</A> himself rose in the House in posing a question in which he dismissed referring the bill to committee prior to second reading. Subject to checking the record, if I could recall his statement, it was basically that it would be an opportunity for a whole bunch of people and virtually everybody would want to come before committee and hijack the process and we would be subjected to listening to all the input from various stakeholders who might be environmentalists, fisher persons, regulators, jurisdictional representatives from the provinces or whatever. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two points to make. The first point is that is consultation. That is listening. That is an important part of the process of making good laws and wise decisions. On my second point, I would refer to what the member who is now the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',81494,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=81494&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Deputy Speaker</A> said in the House, that delay is an essential part of the legislative process. It is part of democracy to filibuster, to debate fully, to raise as many questions as one may have. To some it may be viewed as disruptive to the flow of business, and apparently the minister views it that way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660120"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When members feel strongly enough about an issue related to a bill, they have tools they can use. They have the tools of debate. They have the tools to make motions. They have the tools to call witnesses. Under our Standing Orders, they have the tools to be very thorough and exhaustive in their attention to a piece of legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has made it clear on the record that he does not want to hear from all the stakeholders in any great detail. This bill was tabled in December 2006 and has been languishing around. I do not know why it did not come up sooner, because it is an important bill. There are a number of outstanding issues and it is very important that they be dealt with. The minister clearly did not want to hear from all of the stakeholders who would have all kinds of questions, ideas and concerns. That is what the legislative process is all about. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare say that many members in this place will not have had an opportunity to read Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> in its totality. It is over 100 pages long. This bill replaces the existing act fully. It repeals the old act. If we are going to do the job properly, we have to go through the bill clause by clause to determine what has changed and to determine whether or not there is an understanding of why it may have changed. It is very difficult. Even in the brief 20 minutes that each member is given to speak at second reading, a member would not get into very much in terms of the essence of some of the details. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first speaker raised some very important points. One had to do with transferring a licence on retirement. Another was the role of the tribunals. Another one that I thought was quite interesting was the delegation of the minister's responsibilities to DFO officials. This is a whole new regime. There was a suggestion that there have been cases in the past of abusing that authority to grant or to refuse licences. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we think about it, there is a lot on the table for parliamentarians. There is a hoist motion, which basically asks Parliament to cease this process at second reading and to send the bill to committee for consideration. Interesting enough, when the minister made his argument on why we should not do that because he did not want to hear from all the stakeholders, from the various groups, aboriginals or commercial fishermen or jurisdictional individuals, et cetera, he forgot about bills like Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A>.</div>

It is the environmental plan. It was leaked to environmental groups so that they could have an opportunity to respond. A week before the bill was even tabled in the House, they critiqued it in its totality and it was unanimous that Bill C-30 was a failure and it was never going to get anywhere. The bill was tabled in the House, but we did not have a debate on it. We have never had a debate on that bill because the government decided to send it to committee before second reading.</div>

    </p><a name="Para660127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bill was totally rewritten by the committee. It was based on expert testimony and the best work possible by the members who were selected by each of the parties to be on this special legislative committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If consulting with Canadians on the clean air act is appropriate before second reading because it is complicated, there are a lot of diverging views, there are areas in which it is not overtly clear to members why certain steps have been taken, sending it to committee is the place to do it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister makes his argument about it not going to committee before second reading because the Conservatives do not want to hear from these people and yet the government itself referred another bill to committee before second reading. In fact, that is not the only one. One cannot have it both ways. One either recognizes the circumstances a bill is in or one risks losing the bill and having to find another way to do it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot afford, quite frankly, to lose this new Fisheries Act because there are many changes that have taken place and many new areas that should be dealt with that are currently not in the existing legislation. One that I happened to notice and something that I have spent a fair bit of time on in my involvement with the International Joint Commission has to do with alien invasive species. In part 3 of this bill it actually refers to aquatic invasive species. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians may be familiar, for instance, with zebra mussels, which are an alien invasive species or what is called an aquatic invasive species. I understand there are some 30 of these species in the Great Lakes system and they destroy the fish habitat. In the work that is being done so far, for every one alien invasive species that is treated, dealt with and gotten rid of, another one appears. How does it appear? There is certainly speculation about how they come in but it has to do with ship ballast. They are brought in by ships that come from abroad.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted in this area that it is an offence to transport an aquatic invasive species. I wonder what would happen if a ship coming to Canada has a listed aquatic invasive species that it is not aware of but is discovered. I am going to be very interested in seeing the regulations on how to deal with it. I suppose it could even involve a court case in terms of whether the ship owners knew or ought to have known that in the normal practice of managing the ballast of a ship, they would have probably collected certain species that would be classified as an aquatic invasive species.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is certainly that area. The International Joint Commission is a group made up of representation from Canada and the United States which share common waterways. It is responsible for conducting studies and making observations to determine what the issues are and to suggest and discuss possible solutions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem with the IJC though is that it has no authority and no power because half of its members represent the U.S. government and the other half represent the Canadian government. It cannot unilaterally take charge of a situation and do something about it, so it takes a lot more work. I would be very interested to see how the responsibilities and the authorities that the minister has in the bill would be able to dovetail with the responsibilities of the IJC.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In part 3 clause 69.(1) states that: “No person shall export, import or transport any member of a prescribed aquatic invasive species”. When I read further, clause 70 states:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para660141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would think that this may be a problem because when the minister now has the authority to designate any other species to be an aquatic invasive species, we are probably making law through regulations and I am not sure that is going to get by the scrutiny of regulations committee but we will have to see on that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, even the small section which is only about four clauses in part 3 on aquatic invasive species, I could think of numerous questions that I would have of the IJC, that I would have of those who import and export and have ships using the waterways of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area that I want to comment on has to do with what was raised by one hon. member as an example of what can happen during second reading. As the member had indicated, we had Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A> which was a bill related to replacement workers. It was to be amended at committee. There were some amendments. Ultimately, it came back that in the opinion of the Speaker, in consultation with the clerks, that the amendments made at committee were beyond the scope of the bill. Even though they were certainly directly related but what they did was they touched upon another bill which was not mentioned in Bill C-257.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there are even good amendments which do not get incorporated into a bill on technical reasons. This is a very good example. In fact, right now a new bill on the same subject matter related to replacement workers, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2752698,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2752698&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-415</A>, has been ruled to be non-votable by a subcommittee of procedure and House affairs for the reasons that it is same or similar. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the argument that the vast majority of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2752698,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2752698&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-415</A> is identical to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-257</A> which was defeated by the House. Therefore, we could argue that the majority of that bill has already been defeated by the House and to put the question on those provisions again would be redundant and therefore the bill in the subcommittee's view is not votable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has now been appealed and it is still under review, but even something as simple as a reference to another piece of legislation may be enough to undermine the acceptability of changes at the committee stage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660147"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say in my experience of almost 14 years now that it is extremely difficult to get changes made at committee which are substantive. I think the members know that. I think the minister knows that. I think the minister also knows that should we have the kind of consultations that members have been asking for, that changes are going to be required here. He should also know that there is a great deal of support for the vast majority of the bill but there are some areas of weakness and members have raised those.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that in a minority situation, this is a prime example of where the parties should be collaborating on the areas in which the bill can be improved. With that, I will conclude my remarks.</div>

We think that significant changes can be made to those mechanisms. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree on the principle of the bill, that it has to do with providing for a sustainable fishery, but the member has been around a fairly long time, so I can ask him this question. As has been pointed out earlier in debate, there have been a couple of other major amendments to the Fisheries Act that were proposed in the mid-nineties, Bill C-62 and Bill C-115, neither of which made it very far. There are some similarities to those bills that were presented by a Liberal government, and to this one, although we have made some very significant and substantive changes, but there are some similarities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member recall the kind of consultation that the Liberals went through, both the government and perhaps the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, before they presented those two bills, the renewed Fisheries Act?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that there is a handful of areas that could be problematic to amend at committee but I believe they could be dealt with if the government is prepared to enter into a dialogue with the House leaders of the other parties to determine a mechanism by which we can have the necessary consultations, make the bill acceptable to all parties and then get it passed quickly.</div>

Following his lead, I too will be speaking against the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660172"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would amend an act that was first proclaimed in 1868. Many who work on the Hill will understand this comment when I say that I work in West Block, which is just a few years older than the act, and we know the terrible state that building is in after 139 years. We, therefore, agree that we need a new Fisheries Act but the devil truly is in the details.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I agree with the premise that the Fisheries Act needs amendment to create a modern act that is responsive to the needs of conservation, habitat enhancement, community control and that accommodates the treaty rights of aboriginal peoples in Canada, this bill does not provide those amendments, which is why the NDP cannot support it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660174"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Sackville—Eastern Shore has consulted groups from coast to coast to coast on this issue and the overwhelming response has been to oppose this bill. I have consulted with recreational and aboriginal fishers in British Columbia and I would like to share some of their responses with the House today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recreational fishing in British Columbia is the largest single fishery in the province. It includes: over 330,000 individuals who purchase saltwater fishing licences; 125 lodges catering to recreational anglers; 500 charter boat operators; and hundreds of businesses and industries that equip and cater to the sportfishing industry, including businesses like the St. Jean's Cannery &amp; Smokehouse in Nanaimo which has created a niche industry canning the salmon caught by recreational anglers.</div>

In fact, we actually have a number to quantify that. This means over $600 million in economic activity while catching less than 6% of the annual Pacific salmon harvest and less than 12% of the annual Pacific halibut harvest. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not think it is unexpected that such an important fishery would expect some consideration when a wholesale revision of the Fisheries Act is planned. However, sadly, that was not the case.</div>

Since that time there have been many findings by the various Canadian commissions and courts ranging all the way up through the Supreme Court of Canada. ...the majority ruling in Nikal, where Cory J, stated, “It is for the Federal Government to ensure that all users who are entiltled to partake of the salmon harvest have the opportunity to obtain an allotment pursuant to the scheme of priorities set out in Sparrow.” In Comeau's Seafoods, Major J., for the court, stated: “Canada's fisheries are a ‘common property resource’ belonging to all the people of Canada.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the NDP's aboriginal affairs critic, I have been coming up against the issue of consultation and how little consultation the government does with groups. In a media release in December 2006, DFO claimed that the new bill stemmed from extensive cross-country consultations and discussions. That is simply not true. Discussions and consultations did not take place across the country, specifically on the new ideas and the changes outlined in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important to make the distinction that fishermen, commercial fishing groups, aboriginal people and other stakeholders were not consulted directly on the changes proposed in this bill. It is also interesting to note that last fall the provincial and territorial fisheries ministers urged the federal government to table new legislation that recognizes their important role in fisheries management but they also were not consulted on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> prior to its release.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stakeholders, including aboriginal people and fishermen, should have had an opportunity to participate in an extensive consultation process to recommend appropriate changes to a new fisheries act.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members can see from this very thoughtful and lengthy list, consultation is not an ad hoc process.

    </p><a name="Para660203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultation also needs to be well thought out and a well communicated plan. As was indicated by the Nuu-chah-nulth council, many people were surprised when Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>, the amendments to the Fisheries Act, was brought forward because their understanding was there would be a process that included some of those key stakeholders. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the piece I read on matrimonial real property is specific to first nations, these considerations should also be in place for consultation with all Canadians on public resources, especially the idea that one cannot declare something was consultation when it happened in the past. </div>

The elders from the Cowichan people used to talk about the fact that the Cowichan River was so rich in salmon that people could walk across the backs of the salmon from one side of the river to the other.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We acknowledge the fact that it was a good thing that the river was designated as a heritage river, but the sad reality is it is simply in name only. There are no resources available to look at some of the very serious issues confronting the river. There are many users of the Cowichan River. The first nations people get fish for food and use it for ceremonial purposes. Agricultural lands abut the river. There are important recreational issues on that river. Yet we do not have a good plan in place to look at habitat protection and conservation for fish. I would argue that when we do not protect the river for fish, we do not protect it for any of the other users as well.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I digress slightly from the Koksilah River by Kelvin Creek, but Koksilah is also a fish-bearing stream. An industrial site abuts Kelvin Creek and the Koksilah River. This site allows contaminated soil, which needs an industrial standard, to be trucked from outside the riding and dumped in a gravel pit there.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone will quickly point out that this is a perfectly legal use. It meets the provincial ministry permits. The larger question is this. Is this a suitable site when potential leachate could end up in the Koksilah River and Kelvin Creek? This is a question that nobody has been able to answer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of my responsibility, as the member representing the riding, is to go and find out information and to work with the citizens in the riding who have raised a number of concerns about this site. This is just one example of the need for a stronger habitat protection for fish. I am sure this story is being repeated across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we started inquiring around who would take some responsibility for this very important salmon bearing stream, we found the proverbial finger pointing where everybody pointed to somebody else who should take responsibility for it. That was very distressing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we went to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, commonly referred to as DFO, it indicated that we needed to provide proof that habitat was being destroyed. It took the view that unless there was harm being done, it could not work proactively to protect that fish habitat.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have something that many of us like to call the precautionary principle. The precautionary principle says that we should think ahead and prove that no harm will be done before we undertake an action that could have some serious impacts and long term consequences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we took a look at this, DFO could not do anything until we could demonstrate that the fish habitat was being destroyed. DFO also shares the responsibility with Environment Canada. We got the proverbial very thin wedge that it could do a tiny bit, but somebody else would have to do something else about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this new act aims to streamline projects that may alter fish habitat by making a distinction between small projects and large scale projects, the aim of these changes is to allow the department to focus on activities with more potential to cause harm. Streamlining projects in a new act could open the door more easily for industries that may pose a risk to fish and fish habitat.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure that DFO streamlines projects for the enhancement of fish and fish habitat, not the other way around.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go back again to the situation at Koksilah River and Kelvin Creek. Part of the frustration with this has been there are so many different levels of government involved in this situation. We have regional-municipal, or CVRD. The Cowichan Valley Regional District has responsibility for land use. It does not have in place a soil dumping bylaw.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the provincial ministry that takes a look at granting logging permits. Some logging is going on next to this river, which could have an impact on fish habitat. The provincial government has responsibility for the transportation and the dumping of soils, which it says meets an industrial standard that is perfectly suitable, but people cannot live on this soil. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the federal government where Environment Canada is responsible for water quality and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is responsible for fish habitat.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of all those levels of government, there was not a coordinated response to the protection of fish habitat.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660230"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill now before the House does not provide that kind of assurance to Canadians and to the citizens of Nanaimo—Cowichan that fish habitat would be protected and conserved. I therefore I urge the members of the House to vote against the bill. The government should go back to the drawing board and do those meaningful consultations that will result in a Fisheries Act that protects the resource for future generations.</div>

    </p><a name="Para660232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with respect to her comments regarding consultation, I take issue. I would like further clarification from her on what she means by this concept of public right to fish. I know it is a common concept and it is related somehow to the common property resource issue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does she think it means that any Canadian anywhere can fish for anything at any time? I doubt if she means that because she also indicated that she was interested in the resource and its sustainability and so on, and that would seem obviously to fly in the face of that. What does it mean?</div>
    </p><a name="Para660234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The act and our tradition is that it cannot mean that. It is a constrained right. It is a regulated right. It has been since Confederation. What we say in the bill is that it is not that fishing is a privilege, but a licence is a privilege. That gives access to this common property resource under the principles that are laid down in the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further clarification on that would be appreciated.</div>

    </p><a name="Para660237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member raises a very good issue and this is an important example of why we need those appropriate consultations. I come from a part of the country where recreational and sports fishing is an extremely important part of what happens in British Columbia. It is an important addition to our economic well-being. It is an important part of what people would argue is their own culture. I know many fathers, mothers, daughters and sons have fished for generations in a recreational and sports way in British Columbia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we talk to the recreational and sports fishers, what we will hear from them is that they are absolutely conscious of the fact that when we talk about the right to fish, it does not mean unfettered access. It does not mean that somebody would go out at any time, in any season and fish. What they are asking, though, is that in the context of a responsible approach to the management of fisheries, they be included and acknowledged as having that right to fish. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that many of the sports and recreational fishers in British Columbia are actively involved in habitat protection and conservation. They are actively involved in ensuring that the very species remain healthy so they remain a resource for future generations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I again argue that if we had those kinds of meaningful consultation processes, we would not need to have this conversation in the House.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two questions for her today. The first one has been talked about somewhat, but I need to raise it from the position of someone who represents an inland fishery.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know stakeholders feel that they have not been heard or listened to. In my riding I have a thriving commercial fishery, both in bait fish and standard commercial fishing, and a sport fishery. No one has talked to either of those.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the north we have a huge area of about 2,500 square miles where there are only 21 first nations communities. At one time they had a thriving sturgeon fishery. Now they are working to regain that. No one has talked to them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier that we have one of the largest inland research centres in my riding, the Experimental Lakes Area, with more than a half century of data and research to ensure that the inland fishery will thrive. No one has talked to them </div>
    </p><a name="Para660246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is she or is she not hearing about the inland fishery because of the lack of consultation?</div>
    </p><a name="Para660247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question, and I know it is a concern for the NDP, is about the provisions that would allow DFO officials to grant or refuse licences. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier in the chamber that my family has held licences for more than a half century. It is important to understand that there is very little tenure and protection for commercial fishing licences. Any chance that we get, when we are rewriting an act that is over 100 years old, to protect the fishery, the people who work in the fishery and the people who invest in the fishery is an opportunity we should take to get it done right, and we need to listen to the people and the stakeholders involved.</div>

I was fortunate enough to live for a number of years in the Okanagan where there is a very important inland fishery. It is a sports and recreational fishery that draws people from all over the world. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two aspects to this, the sports and recreational fisheries aspect of it but certainly also the aboriginal treaty rights around inland fisheries. I laid out in detail the lack of consultation. The lack of consultation on the three coasts is reflective of the lack of consultation around inland fisheries and the impact it will have on communities if their voices are not heard. They are on the water and understand the issues that are facing them. We must have appropriate consultation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the whole issue of getting it right around licensing, I am from the west coast where we have seen over several years a number of communities facing severe difficulties as the fisheries have been in transition. We have seen families surrender their licences for a variety of reasons. We saw some consolidation happening with the fleet. Those communities have been impacted as a result of some of those decisions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure all Canadians would say that they want that vital resource protected and preserved and that we need to consider the impact on communities. That includes all communities involved in fishing, whether one is a fisher or somebody who benefits by providing the secondary and tertiary services. We absolutely need to get this right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want to see too much power and decision making concentrated with the minister. A number of concerns have been raised around how many times the bill refers to “the minister may”. We want to make sure that the decisions being made on behalf of this resource are being made in a manner that ensures the protection of that resource for future generations.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she gets to clause 25 of the bill, it lists those very important principles and I wonder if she agrees with them.

It says, “In exercising the powers under section 27 or 37”, which is basically the licensing or allocation sections of the act, “the Minister must take into account” and the third one is “the importance to fishers”, and fishers there refers to all three of those sectors, “of secure access to the fishery and of allocation stability”. That is a very important principle. </div>

Where the disagreement comes about is whether the preamble is strong enough in terms of protecting the public right to access the resource. Clearly, the recreational and sports fishers in this country do not feel that is the case. If it is the users who are saying this is not strong enough language and does not protect the right to fish, I suggest we need to take a second look at it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument often comes up in terms of a piece of legislation that may do some of what we think is important. The question then becomes whether we tinker with that piece of legislation at the margins to make it legislation that is going to do what we intended, which is to protect the resource, and there are all kinds of other things around enforcement and all of that, or do we go back to the drawing board and make sure we do the consultations to come up with the appropriate piece of legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I would argue in this particular case, because the government did not do its homework and conduct those consultations, that we need to go back to the drawing board.</div>

All the stakeholders and anyone who has taken an opportunity to review it has come to the determination that it is substantially flawed and would endanger a $4.3 billion annual enterprise to this country, an enterprise that sustains thousands of communities throughout Canada and well over 80,000 individuals and their families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660262"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key points that has to be raised on the floor is the decision that was taken by the minority Conservative government not to have the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans review the legislation prior to second reading to enable the all-party committee to review the legislation, to conduct hearings and hear from Canadians from coast to coast to coast on the impacts of the bill. That decision was taken because there was a reluctance, an absolute denial of any opportunity for change based on good advice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the minister has acted with some courage in bringing forth the legislation, I regret he did not complement his courage with wisdom. The bill is flawed for various reasons. I will not, however, throw out the baby with the bathwater. The sanctions process, the ticketing process, quite frankly, is very reasonable. In fact, it is long overdue. The establishment of allowing officers and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to deal with relatively minor infractions of the Fisheries Act instead of through a court proceeding, through a ticket violation or sanctions process is a welcome change. It is welcomed by all fishers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are other elements to this which have to be viewed from the point of view of the law of unintended consequences. Unintended consequences can arise from the minister's decision to remove what is called his absolute discretion. A cornerstone that the minister brought forward when he tabled this bill is that he lauded the point that the absolute discretion, as was prescribed in the original act, would now be rescinded.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister tabled the bill on December 12, 24 hours before the House recessed for Christmas and January, not allowing any review from Parliament whatsoever. He did indicate that he was moving forward with very significant changes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my own constituents' point of view, what the minister had said was that the bill would now allow for fishers, industry stakeholders, to have a greater say in their own industry when it comes to management decisions, scientific decisions on allocation and who gets into their fishery.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at it just at that broad brush, any reasonable person looking at that would say, “Imagine fishermen having a say in the management of their own fishery”. Who could argue with something like that on the surface? That is exactly what the minister and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans concluded, that there would be a statutory, obligatory requirement that existing stakeholders would actually have a legally guaranteed role to play in decision making related to the fisheries in which they are directly involved, fishermen managing their own fishery.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will present to the House a scenario of the law of unintended consequences, and I will use a very specific example. That principle equally applies to industrial stakeholder fishers: dentists from Nova Scotia who happen to own licences in the northern shrimp fishery; other corporations that really never set foot in a boat, that are called slipper skippers simply because they own the enterprise and the licence and basically reap the benefits of it directly with no onshore, no adjacent benefits accruing to communities or to individual fishermen.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335">(1335)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para660269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the northern shrimp fishery. In 1997 there was a decision taken by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to allow inshore interests to participate, to prosecute the northern shrimp fishery. That was the first time ever. Since the late 1970s until 1997 the entire offshore shrimp industry was dominated exclusively by offshore factory freezer trawlers. Seventeen licences were issued, all of which were owned by large corporations or stakeholders that had no relevance to the adjacent communities to the fishery, with the exception of the Labrador Fishermen's Union Shrimp Company Limited.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a case in point. Under this bill the minister and the department would now have a legally binding requirement on them to listen to the views of the stakeholders. That would have been the 17 factory freezer licence holders, up until 1997, and those 17 factory freezer licence holders could effectively bar access to every inshore fishermen in Newfoundland and Labrador to gain access into this fishery. Why? Because that is exactly what this bill prescribes. As the minister says in the press release, the minister and every person engaged in the administration of this act or regulations must take into account the stakeholder interests. There is a case in point of the law of unintended consequences taking hold.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of the law of unintended consequences that should have been reviewed by the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans to hear expert witness testimony would be the requirement that the minister must take into account the principles of sustainable development and to seek to apply an ecosystem approach in the management of fisheries in the conservation and protection of fish and fish habitat and must--not shall or may--must seek to apply a precautionary approach such that if there is both high scientific uncertainty and a risk of serious harm they will not be engaged in any management decisions that could impact on that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key word is “must”, not may, must. It is a complete removal of the absolute discretion of the minister that was applied under the previous act. That is a case in point of the law of unintended consequences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, for example, a particular group wanted to challenge the validity of the minister's decision to maintain the harp seal quota throughout Atlantic Canada and Quebec. If a group came forward with substantial evidence from its point of view, and brought it forward to a federal court in Toronto, that particular NGO could actually challenge the minister's decision to maintain a harp seal fishery and could actually seek recourse through a federal court to actually shut down a particular fishery or challenge the minister's decision relating to quota or any specific management items. That particular court in a place very far away from where the fishery is actually prosecuted, very far away from the adjacent communities, could actually decide how an east coast, west coast, central or Arctic fishery was actually managed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the law of unintended consequences that has to be understood by all members of the House before a formal vote is taken. That is why we asked that the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans review this legislation and hear expert testimony from stakeholders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point was brought forward that there were extensive consultations on the act before the bill was brought forward. First off, the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans put in a request to the minister and to the department to assist the department and the minister in crafting the bill before it was tabled so that we could bring forward as members key elements of the bill that we wanted to have included and key concerns. That request was denied. It was not acted upon.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 12, 2006, 24 hours before the close of the House, a bill was tabled. There were no further discussions for the next eight weeks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked who exactly was consulted and what was the actual consultation that occurred. In my own constituency I found that next to no one was consulted and the few organizations that were were simply sent a letter from an official within the department indicating that a new fisheries act would be tabled soon. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340">(1340)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para660278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no details about the act and no chance for input, with no relevance whatsoever to this act, and that is what has been put before us. It is an act that has been described as having endured extensive consultations when in fact no consultations whatsoever, no substantial consultations, have been conducted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660279"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third element of this that really gravely concerns me is the fisheries co-management process. Fishermen want to know exactly what that entails. They want to know if additional fees can be placed upon them as a result of a cooperative agreement or a trust arrangement being put in place between the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and an umbrella stakeholder group that states or claims it represents the interests of fishermen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first party would be the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the second party would be the fishermen themselves, and the third party would be the organization in question. The fishermen want to know if that third party interest can apply for or create levies of additional fees on the fishermen themselves. That is a very important point, but I wish we could have had an opportunity to review this act in committee so that we could have put these facts on the table. This is a very substantial concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the fact that the sanctions process, the ticketing process on relatively minor infractions, is a better process. It provides a substantial improvement to the current regime. However, there is the law of unintended consequences and possibilities. If there was nothing to fear from the concerns that I raised and that were raised by other members and industry stakeholders, this act should have been placed before committee for review before second reading. Witnesses and evidence should have been presented as to exactly where the act is going.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, I have grave concerns about the management process leading to extended terms. The minister will acknowledge that a recent agreement was just put in place with Ocean Choice of Newfoundland and Labrador and High Liner Foods, allowing for greater long term tenure to certain resources based on certain criteria. However, that is one example.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other examples that may not be beneficial to the people of Atlantic Canada and to fishermen and fishing communities generally across the board. We want to know exactly where that process is taking us. That is a major concern that has been expressed by my constituents. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key among this is information about specifically where it is that we are taking the legal and binding right of interest groups that now have a formal and legally binding say in the management of our fishery.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister himself will acknowledge that on the northeast coast of Newfoundland there was a decision that was taken in 2J3KL cod, a decision to allow a small commercial scale fishery to fishers there in a resource that, generally speaking, scientists had described as significantly depleted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as was the case when the minister made the decision, the point of view of very few scientists has changed. Their point of view was that the resource was depleted to the point where any commercial fishery could cause a serious and negative decline in the overall abundance and health of stocks. Biomass would not be allowed to increase and would not be allowed to recuperate. Therefore, science was against that particular decision, or some scientists were, I should say.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> had been in place at the time of this decision an interest group could have had the capacity or capability of bringing the minister's decision before a federal court for judicial review, because the law specifically states that the minister is no longer capable of making a unilateral decision. He no longer has absolute discretion. He now must adhere to a set of principles that must take into account sustainable development and the scientific information that is available at the time, the scientific information but not the stakeholder information, the information from fishermen themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister was proven correct. His decision was a valid one. However, I would remind every resident of the northeast coast of Newfoundland and southern Labrador and the northern peninsula area that I represent that if this act had been in place at the time of that decision, it could very well have been that an organization from outside of the province, outside of the country, could have put forward a judicial action to actually suspend the fishery. That is a very real possibility.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345">(1345)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para660289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am incorrect in what I state, if the minister does not believe it and the department does not believe it, what I can say is that we would have had an opportunity to bring this before a committee and hear expert testimony as to exactly what was happening here. This had to be done. The stakeholders were depending on it. The industry interests were depending on it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am concerned about the co-management agreement. I am concerned about the potential for additional fees to be imposed upon fishermen and their communities as a result of the legally binding cooperative agreements that could be put in place between DFO and the stakeholder groups.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about the loss of discretion by the minister to act appropriately in ways that he or she knows would be beneficial to the fishery. I use specifically the case of the northeast coast cod as an example that probably would not have happened. I use specifically the case of the seal fishery and all those advocacy groups, the interest groups that are out there that at chomping at the bit for a way to shut down our seal fishery. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This act may provide them with that very possibility or opportunity, in a federal court in a place very far away from this fishery, with evidence or testimony heard by a judge that could result in a decision that the minister did not act in accordance with the act he has tabled. That is a very real possibility.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have many concerns, but the last major one that I need to speak about in this House is the concern about the exclusion of legitimate fishermen from new fisheries as they emerge or expand.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on the co-management agreement that was reached in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on crab in area 12, would the existing full time fishermen in area 12 have allowed small boat permit fishermen to come into their fishery when the resource skyrocketed in abundance and the price went up? Would they have had an opportunity to boycott or basically veto through a court action the decision of the minister of the day back in the 1990s, not too many years ago, to allow small boat permit entrants into that fishery? </div>
    </p><a name="Para660295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the interests of the northern coalition, the large offshore factory freezer trawlers, have prohibited access to inshore fishermen for prosecuting the northern shrimp fishery? After literally decades of dominance by the offshore factory freezer trawlers, could that have been a possibility under this act? The evidence that I am receiving and the input in legal opinions and by industry stakeholders is yes, it definitely could have been. That is why this act should have been presented to committee before second reading before it went any further.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have asked throughout today's debate about the consultative process and who was consulted on this act before it was tabled. I find it very amusing and quite astonishing that this bill was tabled on December 13, 2006. This bill is over 200 pages long, with a lot of legalese in it, but on December 14 the B.C. mining industry put out a press release saying it welcomed the new act. I do not know how anyone could have given the act a thorough analysis, whether against it or for it, prior to actually reading it, but one day later the mining industry said that it supported the act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that the senior director of the Mining Association of British Columbia is a gentleman named Byng Giraud, who says, “We support the act”. Guess what? Byng Giraud also sits on the governing national council of the Conservative Party of Canada, representing British Columbia. It seems awfully close and very paternalistic that on December 14 the Mining Association of B.C. can say it supports the act without giving it a thorough analysis and the individual who says that is a member of the Conservative Party representing B.C.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that fishermen were not consulted on this act, so I ask my hon. colleague, does he have any other evidence of people of this nature across the country who are not fishermen and who support the government's intention of really destroying the future livelihood of fishermen and their families in this country?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell him what system I would prefer. When inshore fishers from the Gulf of St. Lawrence want access to a crab stock after being isolated from other fisheries, and when the crab stock in the Gulf of St. Lawrence skyrockets in biomass and abundance and the value of it increases, I would prefer a system whereby I would have a minister and an act that would enable a decision to be taken to allow temporary permitted access into that fishery.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will him what else I want. I want a minister and an act that allows the northeast coast cod fishery to be open on a commercial basis when fishermen and stakeholders agree that there is enough resource there to be able to do so. This act would prevent that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want an act that enables the minister to be able to allow new entrants into the northern shrimp fishery, as the minister did in 1997. This act could potentially bar that through a legal action.</div>

    </p><a name="Para660323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers and Canadians have much to be proud of. Canada has always been strongly committed to international peace and security, and has a proud history in United Nations peacekeeping from Cyprus to Bosnia and to the Golan Heights. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is no different. We currently have 129 Canadians serving with 9 United Nations missions, including 66 personnel with the UN stabilization mission in Haiti and 33 personnel in the UN mission in the Sudan.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadians owe a great deal of debt to all Canadians who have so proudly represented our country around the world.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I call upon all members of this House to take a moment to remember Major Hess-von Kruedener who died on July 25, 2006, while serving at the United Nations observation post in Lebanon. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is part of the security and prosperity partnership of North America and its subset, the council on competitiveness.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the following facts. In four and a half years we have lost 250,000 manufacturing jobs in Canada. Over the past 10 years we now have a trade deficit of $16 billion. Manufacturing accounts for 17% of the Canadian economy and is the highest value added sector, and trade agreements have decimated workers.

    </p><a name="Para660340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want to compete, but how can we when Canada has the most open market in the world, yet places no expectations on other countries who dump into our market, have tariff and non-tariff barriers, subsidize their products through poor labour and environmental policies, and we have a dollar and energy prices that compromise our competitiveness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660341"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Ghiz and his Liberals offered Islanders a platform that aligned with the values, hopes, aspirations and dreams of all Islanders. They ran a great positive campaign. I want to assure everyone in the House that he will make a great premier.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the Bloc Québécois' claims, the new Canada summer jobs program is providing generous funding this year to non-profit organizations throughout Quebec and Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Lévis yesterday to announce $37,000 in funding for Phars, an organization that provides care for people with disabilities. Thanks to that funding, 16 students, a record number, will be hired, thus giving them valuable work experience. This is in addition to the support given to Nouvel Essor in Lac-Etchemin, L'A-Droit de Chaudière-Appalaches in Lévis, the Société du Patrimoine de Sainte-Justine, Travail Jeunesse in Lévis, as well as jobs in Saint-Magloire and Sainte-Claire, to name only a few. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Bloc Québécois can only squawk on the opposition benches with no results, our government is taking action for our youth and our community organizations. We are keeping our word.</div>

    </p><a name="Para660399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the people in my region and in those of many of my colleagues, living in a rural area means continuing to play an active role in the decisions that contribute to our own development, as well as being supported by the government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not scorn urban areas, because we provide them with resources, but we simply want a fair share of the taxes we invest in collective development to be invested in our right to live in rural areas.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centralized programs, confined by their inflexible framework, frustrate our desire to be at the heart of the world, like anyone else. It is time for the Conservative government to stop playing the new kid on the block who knows only how to improvise. It is time for the government to discover, understand and respect the rural reality. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw the Liberal members of the environment committee try to suggest that the leader of the Liberal Party was somehow responsible for warmer weather back in 2005, leading to a reduction in greenhouse gases.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the big reasons why greenhouse gases did not go up as much as they previously had was because Mike Harris privatized the nuclear reactors and got more power online. However, instead of working with privatization czars, apparently Mike Harris, rather than working with his own ministers, was working with the leader of the Liberal Party on that.</div>

Unfortunately it has led to greater concern and more stress and frustration in fishing communities across my riding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am back in Skeena in the northwest of British Columbia talking to the fishing communities that I represent, both first nations and non-first nations, there is an inordinate amount of concern for the future of our communities and for the future of the industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Conservatives put together this package, true and sincere consultations with the groups that would be most affected by the act were not taken up. When I asked the fishing industry groups, the recreational fishers, the residential fishers, people who are connected to this public resource, what level of consultation they enjoyed, the reply was often “none”. They had no idea what was in the bill until it was presented. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People were stunned to see aspects that were absolutely contrary to the interests of fishing communities and families that depend upon those resources. They were mystified as to how a government could even pretend there were consultations. They realize that these things were done behind closed doors and with the input of very few people whose interest is to further privatize what has to be seen by all members of the House to be a national public resource, one that needs to be managed in the interests of the public good and not some corporate narrow interests of a few.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of significant things in this bill, a number of parts of the legislation that are contrary to the interests of wild fish stocks, in particular. In the brief time that I have this afternoon, I will go through some of the most significant issues for people in the northwest of British Columbia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To place into context the importance of the wild fishery to us, it is the absolute foundation, the bedrock of our culture. Communities have relied on a wild fishery for thousands of years. According to historical data, going back more than 12,000 years in the Pacific northwest, the original aboriginal communities in North America relied on a viable wild fishery. It led to some of the strongest and most brilliant examples of human organization. The fish were abundant and returned with some consistency. The proud nations of the Haida, the Haisla, the Taku River Tlingit, the Tsimshian, nations which across the river at the Museum of Civilization are represented to the world in their art, in their culture, in their history, have always relied upon the wild fishery resource to sustain themselves, to maintain their cultures and vivid communities. These communities have been in threat for a long time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year in and year out the mismanagement of this resource by the federal and provincial governments has gone unabated, with very few positive reforms. Unfortunately, that legacy has continued today but we are attempting to address that and to reform this deeply flawed bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support for this bill is scant. I have looked around the country for the validators, for those fishing groups and people who are most intimate with the issue and who know the history of the issue. Of the environmental groups that work on ocean issues, I cannot find a single one that is willing to support this bill publicly, that is willing to do anything other than condemn it to the highest heights. Among the industry groups that I work with on the west coast that are seeking consultation, that have sought input, I cannot find any that are able to support this bill either. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the essential tenets of the bill is to further privatize a resource that has gone through far too much privatization already. A resource such as salmon that moves across boundaries and across jurisdictions and is international in its scope needs to have oversight. Someone needs to be looking at the long term viability of what it is that our future generations will enjoy.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we have seen with the DFO that these so-called test fisheries, these quota systems that are meant to run for only a year and then be seen against the traditional use are not tests. This is an ideology that has been pushed forward and presented year in and year out to ensure that those who are catching the fish, those who rely on the fish for their resource are no longer able to even own their own vessels in many cases and certainly not the licences under which they operate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister should have taken the time to look at owner-operator principles. The person who owns the licence should actually operate the licence. The people who are on the water and who rely on this resource and who have a vested interest in ensuring its long term sustainability are those who are actually catching the fish. They should own the licences as opposed to the system that the current Conservative government and the previous Liberal government before it wants. The government seems hell-bent on expressing the idea that licences can be purchased like any stock on the stock market. They can be stacked up and then divvied out. When fishermen talk about delivering a pound of salmon at the dock and only receiving a dollar in actual pay, one starts to wonder about the long term viability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the Conservatives have very little interest in engaging in that conversation. They would rather engage in other conversations aside from those that affect the fishing communities, particularly in British Columbia, but all across this country. They seem interested in engaging in work of other interests in this country rather than the communities that have built our nation, rather than the outlying and port communities that absolutely depend on this resource for survival. The government seems to be infatuated with other interests and engaging in other conversations. It is symbolic that that is what is going on here today also.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When consultation is considered by government, one of the absolute essentials is that the conversation and the consultation actually affects the proposed law. I asked the fishing communities in my region how much input they had on the bill. I asked how supportive of it they could be and what changes they wanted. They were deeply frustrated with the flawed process that had allowed them no access in the first place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environmental groups that are considering the long term sustainability of this resource are deeply concerned about the viability of our oceans. I asked them how much input they had. They too expressed frustration and dismay that the government continues to act with belligerence when it comes to this issue, as if all the answers somehow exist within the thin benches of the Conservative caucus as opposed to the wider community, those who are engaged in the issue on a daily basis. One has to wonder why the government would not consult the people who are most interested, most aware and most concerned with the issue. Why would it only consult with a select few?</div>
    </p><a name="Para660614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It lowers the credibility of the legislation before it is even out the door. There is a tension that has to exist between conflicting views, between conflicting visions and opinions as to where our fishery will go. That tension is necessary in the creation of the law as opposed to a more narrow, one-sided approach.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at the efforts of the government to promote unsustainable fishing practices and use of our oceans to date, and it is well founded that Canadians lack trust in its ability to take care of the long term interests of our oceans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No trust can be found for a government that randomly and recklessly adopts the notion that there is no moratorium on tanker traffic on the west coast suddenly. By some sort of arbitrary decision made during a mild conversation the Conservatives must have had over coffee, they will reverse a 35 year tradition in the history of the federal government to oppose, through moratorium, the idea of tanker traffic moving into the central and northern west coasts. Is this some kind of benevolent dictatorship that can decide and not decide when a moratorium exists and when it does not?</div>
    </p><a name="Para660617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people of British Columbia are asked whether they seek to maintain this long held practice, they are in overwhelming support of it across political interests. The entire House, all of us, particularly those of us who come from British Columbia, represent people who are deeply disgusted with the notion that what happened in the case of the <i>Exxon Valdez</i>, what happened in the relatively recent B.C. Ferries tragedy could happen again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason the moratorium was put in place in the first instance was to avoid the imminent catastrophe that could happen when a tanker spills. The margin of error is so slight on our coastal communities that a major oil spill hitting our coastal waters would be economically and socially devastating. That is without a doubt. The evidence is clear on this.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is it enough for the Conservative government to willy-nilly deny a moratorium exists, but DFO documents support it. We have had briefings from up and down this department and others claiming that they arbitrarily change the rules as they see fit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78751,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78751&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Natural Resources</A> said in one of his very first statements upon being made minister that his top priority was to open up drilling in our coastal waters. What a magnificent statement from a minister who had consulted with nobody. I am sure he did not think of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78754,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78754&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</A>. He simply decided that coastal drilling in British Columbia, which 80% of British Columbians in consistent poll after poll oppose, is suddenly at the purview of the federal government to decide. All this is taking place in light of a government that has committed to planning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Canadians watching and trying to understand this issue, when we ask what the plan is, oftentimes when we are dealing with land based issues, particularly in British Columbia but in other provinces as well, there is a long tradition of planning the competing interests over those resources. They plan the interests of conservation versus mining, the interests of forestry versus community development. That happens on the land base all the time, and we have great success with that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason we do that is so government can weigh the options and give priorities to the various ideas being presented, while balancing the public interest and allowing the public to inform themselves and through the process communicate and change the course of government and change their immediate environment, their surroundings, their communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not do this in the oceans when it comes to ocean management and the planning. Whether the government is pushing for a pipeline, or coastal drilling, or more tanker traffic or open net fish farms, which it seems enthusiastically willing to support in regions such as mine, where the absolute and overwhelming opinion of bringing in open net fish farms into the northwest of British Columbia has decidedly been no, another issue that goes across partisan interests, it is not be for political reasons. It must not be for some reason such as the government's attempt to gain more votes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last number of elections in my riding, as the Conservative candidates pop up like gophers promoting unsustainable fishing practices, the public pounds them with a little hammer and asks them how can they be so thick? How can they be so obtuse as to continue to suggest things that the people do not want, when there are other things they do want such as sustainable energy and micro-lending for business enterprises? On the things that we want, the candidates remain so silent. It seems strange to me politically, but ideologically it might make sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember one of my first meetings here. It took place in the lobby. My esteemed colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78886,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78886&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</A> might remember it. It was a couple of years ago when the Liberals were in power. A minister had been named and we gathered around the table in the government's lobby to discuss issues with department officials. I remember this fondly because I was new to the House and very interested in how this all worked. The dismissiveness of the DFO officials toward elected members of the House was astounding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later a ministerial official quietly described to me, when I left the fisheries and oceans committee hearing, that when a new minister came in there was a certain amount of training required by the department. There is a certain amount of indoctrination, letting the minister know how the DFO works because a unique and strange culture exists. There is this fortified mentality that it is the DFO. If on the water fisheries officers are cut, the enforcement officers who are meant to enforce the few rules that we have on our fisheries management, and more positions are moved to Ottawa, that is somehow a good thing. This has been done by the current government and the previous one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not seen any fish counters on the Ottawa River lately. In terms of the productivity of a fishery, comparing the Ottawa River to the west coast, one of the few and most abundant fisheries left in the world, it seems to me that the balance of these positions and the balance of effort from the government should be where the fish are. They should not be where the bureaucrats have easy access to the politicians and to each other. If more of the decisions were being made on the ground in the communities that care about these issues, better decisions would be made.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1520"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520">(1520)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para660628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead we see the blinders being slapped on, the policies getting spit out and the communities being left high and dry with a fishery in continued decline and with more boats off the water and lower catch rates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can take the recent non-run of the eulachon fish in the northwest of British Columbia. For those not familiar with British Columbian history, there is a grease trail, a traditional trading trail, that runs all through British Columbia. One of the essential commodities traded was eulachon grease. It was absolutely precious and seen as one of the most advantageous things to access, either directly or through trade.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eulachon do not return any more. These fish represent the foundation for what is to come. They are the indicator species. They show us what is about to happen. There is a total disregard for the collapse of this fish stock because folks in downtown restaurants in Toronto and Vancouver do not eat it. This again shows the arrogance and the lack of insight as to what is really going on in the water, what is really going on with communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mifflin plan pops out and we lose 75% of our fleet in the northwest of British Columbia. One would think that a 75% decrease in an industry would be a red flag for governments. We would think governments of all stripes, of whatever inclinations and indications, would come forward. If 75% of the oil and gas industry shut down tomorrow, we can bet the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> would be there front and centre, wondering how to fix things. However, that is not the case in this instance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the motivations are shown to be different. We see it manifested in the bills that are presented to us. The corridor concept for pipelines, with no cumulative impact assessment at all, is being suggested as a viable option from the government. The notion of introducing open net fish farms into regions that do not want them is a viable option for the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding breaking and running moratoriums, it is almost like the government is running blockades and hoping nobody notices, with these little tests it keeps running. Another ship goes in with no consideration of a moratorium, which survived eight prime ministers. Progressive Conservatives, and that might be part of the problem, and Liberals alike defended the moratorium. They have said that this thing existed. It is in cabinet notes of all stripes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government kind of woke up one day in office and said that it would decide what the public policy would be, with no consultation, no consideration and with not a lot of public fanfare. Lord knows, usually when the government announces something, it tells us about it until it is blue in the face. It announces it seven times and re-announce it another seven, just to ensure we heard what little is getting done. However, when it comes to busting up a moratorium and allowing tanker traffic through to the coast, that is another consideration. Maybe that one is done a little quieter because of the interests at play. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about the stewardship, that is truly what this resource is about. It is about managing the resources for the foreseeable future and beyond. We must act as a generation of which the generations to come will be proud. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660636"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the most recent experience of the absolute collapse and devastation of the east coast fish stocks and the communities that relied upon them. We have that experience. It is salient. It is real. It is practical. There are members in the House who went through it and are living through it still.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that experience at hand, we have a government willing and interested in perpetuating a similar scenario and disaster on the west coast. For the life of me and the people of the northwest of British Columbia, we cannot understand it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding first nations consultation, we had the Haida and Tlingit court case a year ago. It demands in law, as a ruling by the courts, that in any major consideration, the government of a natural resource in which the first nations are implicated has a duty and obligation to consult. Was that done in this case? Were first nations consulted on this new fisheries act, which is incredibly important to the 30% of my region that are first nations? No, not at all. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems to me in contrivance to the law. It seems to me that the Supreme Court has told the government explicitly that it must reform its policies because it is based upon our Constitution. Yet the government, for some strange alchemy, has decided that it has to do it another way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government will not stand up against high seas bottom trawling at the international level, if it refuses to promote the types of practices that we need and consider a co-management model, which we are promoting in the northwest of British Columbia, then we demand, we beg, we plead that it adopt some humility, learn from the mistakes of others and allow other voices at the table.</div>

I am surprised what the member has said about this bill. Does he not realize that the act was one of the first passed by Parliament? The current Fisheries Act goes back to 1868, some 139 years ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked a lot about the north coast of British Columbia. Of course, British Columbia was not even part of Confederation when the act, which we are currently managing fisheries under, was passed by Parliament. The need for an updated fisheries act has been glaring for a long time. This bill is an attempt to correct it and make it possible to manage the fisheries, about which he says he is concerned, more effectively.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the member continue to persist with fearmongering that there has not been consultation? The member knows, as well as other members here, that consultation on how to fix this act has been going on, in a general sense, for at least seven years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also knows that it is not the normal parliamentary process to put a bill in circulation for broad consultations before it is presented in the House. It happens occasionally, but it is not the normal practice. In fact, I was involved in the health committee that took on an issue like that prior to a bill being tabled. It was presented in a draft form. That happens occasionally, but it is not the norm in this place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the member continue to fearmonger, as well as other members who are objecting to this, on the public's misunderstanding of the normal process? He knows full well that if the bill passes at second reading stage, it will go to committee and members of the fisheries committee will travel the country and hear from witnesses. They will come to Ottawa and we will go where they are. There will be extensive consultations with everybody who has something to say on this issue. Everyone will have a chance to state their views on the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old saying is that everybody is in favour of progress; it is change they do not like. Why do those members continue to play on people's fear of change when they know full well the parliamentary process will allow ample consultation in the months ahead?</div>

I have some respect for my colleague from Nanaimo—Alberni, who mentioned paying some attention to my comments. I will ask him to pay a little more to my next piece, because the fearmongering he speaks of presents a notion that there is some imminent doom to be presented to the fishing communities in my region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would suggest that he come to visit with me in the regions and communities of mine that have upwards of 85% and 90% unemployment and then talk to me about fearmongering. How dare he talk to me about fearmongering when I have community after community watching the steady and rapid decline of their fish stocks, in part due to the mismanagement not just of this government, but of those that have gone before? </div>
    </p><a name="Para660649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons that this mismanagement has been so consistent is that government comes to the point of changing law. Are we for an update? Are we for a revision of the Fisheries Act? Of course we are. Are we for this revision? Absolutely not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those communities have greater fear because they see the department act without intelligence, and I mean both the intelligence of the mind and the intelligence in terms of information as to what people are desperately seeking, which is some sense of influence and control over the resource that their livelihoods and communities depend upon.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suggest that it is fearmongering, when the communities that I represent are consistently shut out of those consultations, is ridiculous. To suggest that, when I implore the government to listen to the communities and then take that listening and that intelligence and place it into the bills, which the government simply has not done in this case, I am reminded deeply of this Conservative government's first and clumsy attempts at getting environmental legislation correct. The Conservatives went internally to their own advisers, with three lines in their party platform about the environment, and thought that they knew enough to actually construct a sound environmental policy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lo and behold, they marched it out into the lobby, to the media and the waiting public, and dropped a dud that paid little attention to absolutely no attention to the details required to make sound environmental policy. So from this corner we negotiated to take that bill to committee prior to second reading, prior to agreeing to it in principle, which is the essence of this conversation, the agreeing and chucking this off to committee. When that is done we accept the principle of the bill, but when a bill is so deeply flawed as this one that the principle is wrong, that is not responsible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660653"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not responsible for elected members who represent fishing communities to send a bill that they know is wrong in principle to a committee for some tweaking, some additions and some minor adjustments. It is not on. That is not salient. It is not responsible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660654"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course there have been talks about fisheries renewal. That talk has gone on for longer than seven years, I would contest, but when it comes to the action, to the delivery, it was 12 hours after the government actually released its first initial new fisheries act that our dear friend Byng Giraud proclaimed a welcome, under the British Columbia mining industry, to the new 200 page-plus act. He was ready to go in 12 hours. I suppose he read the whole thing.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked repeatedly for a list of the people with whom the government consulted on the act prior to its introduction on December 13. That list does not exist. I have asked a tremendous amount of fishing groups, many of them on the B.C. coast, if they were consulted on this proposed act prior to its introduction, and the answer was a resounding “no”. That includes environmental groups. If the government has that list, it should table it in this House of Commons.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My question is quite clear. Something that is as old as this act definitely needs modernization. In this corner, there is no argument on that.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For people in the House who might not know about Labrador, it has an area of 112,000 square kilometres, much of it coastline. I grew up in a community of about 45 to 50 people that was and is a fishing community, like so many others dotted along the coast of Labrador. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our family has fished and continues to fish both commercially and recreationally for food and sustenance, and for hundreds of years now, back to my Inuit ancestors. We know about the sea and how important it is, not only from a personal perspective, but from a cultural perspective as well. We know how important the sea is. We know how important the fishery is to our livelihoods.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over many hundreds of years, the Métis of Labrador, of which I am one, the Inuit of Labrador and the Innu of Labrador have taken care of the fisheries resources. We have been good stewards of the fisheries resource in our area because we knew it was for our livelihood. We knew it put food on our table. We knew it was there to sustain us day in and day out. That comes from our very strong value system in Labrador and our aboriginal people. That same value system, I would say, is shared by non-aboriginal people in Labrador as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a history around the fishery. We have a history around the sea. We know what it means to us in an integral way, not just in a political debate, not just to make hay over it, not just to score political points. We know how integral the fishery is to our communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we see the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78754,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78754&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</A> introducing such a substantive bill, an omnibus bill, which sort of deals with everything in the Fisheries Act at the one time after 138 years, we have to wonder why he is in such a rush to get it through. Some of us would say that he is just trying to make history, that he wants to be the minister who changed an act that is 138 years old. That is what it seems like to us. It seems like the minister just wants to get himself down in the history books without any care for the people who are going to be impacted, without any care for the people and the communities that are going to have to deal with the changes, and without any care, really, for the fisheries resource itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one reason that I can see for this sort of swift action on the part of the minister. He is trying to bring the bill into the House and jam it down the throats of politicians and subsequently try to jam it down the throats of fishers and all those stakeholders who depend on the fisheries resource.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister and the Conservative Party talk about transparency, accountability and openness. I can safely say that I have been on the wharves and I have talked to people in the fishing industry. I have talked to the fish plant owners and the fish plant workers, all of whom have a say in one way, shape or form. I also have talked to conservation groups, aboriginal groups, commercial fishers and recreational fishers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have talked to a whole range of people who are involved in the fishing industry and they knew basically nothing about what was coming down the pipe. They knew there were some policy reviews years ago. They knew that the minister was going around having chats with this group and that group. But they did not know that this bill was coming down with the substantive changes that are in it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That government over there talks one thing and walks something else. The government does not want to listen. That is evident not only around this particular Fisheries Act, the way it has implemented it, and the substantive changes it has brought before the House, but with other issues as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We only got a look a couple of weeks ago at the government's changes to student programs and all the new criteria that nobody knew anything about. The government had to change its mind on that and start approving people and organizations. The Conservatives have made mistakes time and time again. This is certainly one of the mistakes that they have made when it comes to accountability and openness. There has been no openness when it comes to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives talk about consultation. It is hard to find a group out there that will admit that they have been consulted on Bill C-45. My colleagues in the other party have said that they wanted a list. There has been a so-called stakeholders list provided by the government regarding consultations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look through the list, all it says is that a letter has been sent out, a phone call has been made, a letter has been sent, and the government calls that consultation. Sending out a letter and notifying people that the government is bringing in a bill with all of these changes is the government's idea of consultation. The people do not even know what the changes are and how the changes will affect them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unconscionable that the government would talk about consultation, provide some kind of list and all it does is make a phone call, leave a message and send out a letter. There is not even any indication that the people have received the letters, the messages and are responding in any type of substantive way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a Labrador perspective, and I would think that this is the same throughout the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and Atlantic Canada that there is hardly a group, a fishing enterprise, a processing company, a union representative, an aboriginal group, a coastal community or any other, that was consulted. They may have been talked to but that is not consultation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultation comes with obligations, time and information. There is a legal duty to consult aboriginal groups, as the minister rightfully knows. From the groups in Labrador, I have heard nothing that would indicate that there has been any effective consultation with the three aboriginal groups, the Labrador Métis Nation, the Labrador Inuit Association which is the Nunatsiavut government, or the Innu Nation, on the proposed changes to the Fisheries Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would seem that this whole issue around consultation that the government purports is a sham. It has not consulted and in fact one of the government members just in the last few minutes admitted as much. He said that we cannot talk to people before the tabling of a bill. Even Conservative members of the House are saying that there has been no consultation on this particular bill. That is what was admitted to by the member from the west coast.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the bill itself, it talks about downloading responsibility. The act seems to not firm up or strengthen environmental regulations but basically it would weaken them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we all believe in the principle and concept of conservation. We have to conserve our stocks in whatever form, whether they are in the ocean ecosystem or in inland waters to make sure they are healthy and there for all time to come.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen basically an example within Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> of the government's disregard for the voice and opinion of those in the fishing sector. Being from the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, we saw the row in the province when it came to the sale of FPI. No agreement could be reached. Communities on the island portion of the province were waiting, left out in the cold because the government could not respond regarding the sale of FPI and how the quotas were going to be handled.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill talks about cooperating with the province and of downloading some responsibility to the province and that type of thing, but the latest examples from the government show that it cannot even get along when people's livelihoods are at stake in communities like Burgeo, Marystown and the Burin Peninsula. The government talks one thing and does another.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government says that we could have effective consultation once the bill goes through second reading and ends up in committee, but knows itself that we cannot make substantive changes to the bill once it is in committee. We can basically only talk about what the government has already decided to do and the changes that it has already put into being in this particular bill. The government knows that. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it seems to me that the Conservatives want to use procedure now to not hear the voices of those in the fishing industry and to not hear the voices of those in our communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives want to basically use a strong-arm tactic to basically say to the people in our communities to take it or leave it, that what the government decides is good for them and that they must accept it. The government is saying the communities have to swallow it hook, line and sinker. I am speaking now for the people of Labrador.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have many quotes from the minister. There is one where the minister says “we don't want endless consultation”. Nobody is asking for endless consultation. We only want some type of consultation with people in our industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister says “people want concrete action and they want it now”. He talks about that in relation to changes to the Fisheries Act and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say to the minister that when people on the coast of Labrador and on the coast of Newfoundland who were stuck in ice during the seal fishery this past spring, who had their boats damaged, who could not get out and get a seal pelt to earn some money to put food on their tables, when all of that was happening and when there is still an ice crisis in the sense that even a fishery that was supposed to open cannot open because of the ice conditions, we called for action. We called for action in this House. We called for action in the committee. There have been calls for action on the open line shows by the union, by the fishers and by the industry itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the minister done? Nothing. He calls for action. He says, “We want action on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>”. I would say that fishers back home want action when it comes to some kind of help around ice compensation. People have been going without a cheque now for six and seven weeks. There is no money to pay the bills. There is no money to make the payments that need to be made. We called for action on something that is concrete and on something that means something to the people in our communities, and he has not moved an inch from what we can see.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister says he is going to do it. He says he is going to study it. He says he is going to gather information on it. That is what the minister says he is going to do and then he may take some action. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is better off using that type of rhetoric when it comes to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>. Go out and gather some information. He should listen to the people, consult with them, understand the implications that this bill is going to have, first of all, for our ecosystem, our fish resources, and then our fishers and those that depend on the resource.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am at it I should say to the parliamentary secretary that we would like to see some action on ice compensation. This is what the fishers have asked for and the minister has not done it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister is saying that he wants to see some concrete action on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>, yet he has gone about it all the wrong way. We cannot get action when we need it from this particular minister. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the same thing only a few months ago when my Liberal colleague from P.E.I. had to force the minister to put more money into small craft harbours. The minister was not taking any action on small craft harbours. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives felt so ashamed of themselves, so downtrodden, they felt that they needed to do something to make themselves look good so they put some more money in. It was only after my Liberal colleague from P.E.I. shamed them into putting more money into small craft harbours. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives seem to want action on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> above everything else. When we ask them to take action on something that is concrete and meaningful on specific issues, they only pause and sit there. They pause and sit there while people go hungry, while people are looking for some assistance from this particular minister and this particular government.</div>

    </p><a name="Para660707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only appropriate that I and my party support this hoist motion. It is only appropriate that we hear the voices of the fishers and those in our communities who are going to be affected by the changes in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>, allow them to have a say, to have some input, and to understand the consequences of this particular piece of legislation. Is that too much to ask? </div>
    </p><a name="Para660708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask the government, what is the huge urgency in this? What is the huge urgency? The bill has been with us for 138 years. If we are going to make changes, why do we not do it right? </div>
    </p><a name="Para660709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is urgency when it comes to ice compensation. There is urgency when it comes to small craft harbours. There is urgency when it comes to some kind of regulatory reform and vessel size, which I understand the minister has put some effort into. There is urgency to protect the fish and the ecosystem, but I do not believe there is any urgency to ram through Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> without due process, without proper process. We certainly do not want the bill to be rammed through with the flaws that we have observed in it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon the Conservative Party to do the right thing for a change. I say to the Conservatives that for once in the last 15 months of government they should listen to what the people have to say. Listen to what the people have to say because it concerns and affects them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incumbent upon the minister to do so. The minister is from a fishing province, but sometimes he is like a fish out of water when it comes to his own portfolio. He is in some sort of airy, up there type of strata and does not have his feet planted on the wharf. He is not listening to what people are telling him.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say to the Conservative Party that it should support the hoist motion. It should take the summer, early fall, have effective consultations and come back with a bill that makes sense, that all parties, the fishing industry and communities can support. The hoist motion just makes common sense. It is what the people want and it is time for the Conservative government to listen.</div>

    </p><a name="Para660714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be very clear on what he thinks is the way forward. Some have given the impression that we pass this hoist amendment, do some consultation, take the bill from whoever has it at the moment, make some changes, and when they are not looking maybe put it back in a changed form. That is not the way it works.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote from the parliamentary <i>Compendium</i>, which says:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like him to comment further on the specific steps forward. What does he think is the best way forward? If we pass the hoist amendment, what are the next steps after that?</div>
    </p><a name="Para660718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, for over 100 years the normal process was that we did our best with a bill. We brought it before Parliament, debated it at second reading, and sent it to committee where it is debated and has some changes made. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of the bill states:</div>

No one has spoken against changes to the Fisheries Act. No one has said that we do not need a new act or that we cannot make improvements on something that is 138 years old.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fundamental principle of consultation, of going on the wharves, of accompanying people on the boats, of listening to people in the fish plants, listening to processors, union representatives and aboriginal groups, that principle of listening and then developing a bill that accommodates their needs and aspirations, bearing in mind the principle that the parliamentary secretary just read out, in my opinion there is no disagreement with the principle as he has read it out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have a problem with is the fundamental process in the way that the government has gone about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have the hoist motion, and I am no expert on parliamentary procedure, but if it effectively kills the bill and we have a postponement period, then we take that postponement period to develop, implement and properly resource an effective consultation process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would seem to me that would be tantamount to abiding by the law that exists, particularly when it comes to the Haida decision and aboriginal groups. It would be respectful of all those who have a concern in the industry. Perhaps if we can all agree and we listen to people in the communities, we would not need to go through as long a committee process at the end of it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may in fact be shortening the process to some extent if we allow the hoist motion to go forward, put into effect a proper consultation process and then bring back a bill that is more reflective of the needs and aspirations of particularly those in the fishing industry and in the fishery resource itself. We could probably find more agreement among parliamentarians, get it though committee and then we would have something that is better for all of us, not only for today but for many generations to come.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we asked about consultation on the bill, we know there was none, as we have proven already in the House. We have asked the parliamentary secretary to table the documents in the House but so far the government has refused to do it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we do have indications here. I will take the province of British Columbia. There is a gentleman by the name Byng Giraud who is the senior director of the Mining Association of British Columbia. The new bill has 253 different clauses with 107 pages, a lot of it written in legalese. It takes someone of very high academic standing quite a long time to go through the bill and to understand it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was tabled on December 13, 2006 in the afternoon here in Ottawa. On December 14 the B.C. Mining Association issued a press release saying that it was pleased with the new act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can these six reputable organizations, the B.C. Business Council, the Chamber of Commerce, the forest industry, the Mining Association, the Association for Mineral Exploration and the B.C. Agricultural Council, say that the bill is great after only 12 hours from the introduction of the bill? How did they have that analysis?</div>
    </p><a name="Para660733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find out that in August 2006 they made recommendations to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans regarding the environmental aspects of the bill. Now we find that of the 16 recommendations they made, close to 14 of them are in the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also turns out that Byng Giraud just happens to be on the National Council of the Conservative Party for British Columbia. The government would not talk to fishermen in his riding. It would not talk to the fishermen in British Columbia or Nova Scotia. It would not talk to the families, the people who are involved in the fishing industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep reminding the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans that he is the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, not the minister of mining.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague is absolutely correct when his colleague from Gander brought in the hoist amendment.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would seem that the Conservative definition of consultation is to go to fellow Conservatives, listen to what they want, stick it in a bill and draft a press release for when it is tabled. Fishermen in my community would be appalled to know that is how the government operates. I will be sure to make them aware, having learned this particular fact, of how they get treated. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives do not listen to the fishermen or the plant workers. All they want to do is ram something down their throats at the behest of some interest group or some individual within the Conservative Party, and that is not appropriate. It is disrespectful to the people who really depend on the fishing industry, who have depended on it for generations and who have taken it upon themselves in many regards to protect the resource and to fight for the resource, sometimes without regulation and sometimes without an act being there at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember protest after protest in which I was involved in trying to protect the fisheries resources. I was arrested on a number of those occasions but I was never convicted, which may be why the Conservatives want to change the act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must say that it is appalling that the only people the Conservatives have so-called consulted with are people from the mining industry or, as some people would call them, the contaminating industries, although some people in the mining industry are good and there is no doubt about that, and that they only consult and ask Conservatives.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members know, my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78991,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78991&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver Island North</A> has a long history in the fishing industry and, in particular, in the salmon fishery. It has been an integral part of the culture of my riding for thousands of years and a way of life for many first nations for countless generations and, hopefully, will continue into the future, although we are not quite sure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> would have a negative impact on those fisheries in my riding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I was elected about a year and a half ago, I have talked to fishermen across the riding, from north to south. They have told me that changes are needed in the way that Canada, in particular on the west coast, manages its fishery. Issues of co-management, habitat and species protection and enforcement are front and centre in people's minds and yet most of these people felt that there were problems within DFO itself and did not require a whole new act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the act, I can now say that it would do very little to solve all these problems. It is just, plain and simple, bad legislation, just like the softwood lumber deal and the inadequate climate change program. The Conservative government has sold out ordinary Canadians and given to large multinational corporations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has angered many people in my communities has been the total lack of consultation with local stakeholders. Time and time again we hear that this House, this government wants to listen to ordinary Canadians but then it goes about and does the exact opposite.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its climate change plan, it talked to the oil and gas industry rather than consulting ordinary Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With electoral reform, a subject that is very close to my heart, we saw that the government relied on focus groups in very small pockets. It held one meeting in each province and called that consultation. It would rather do that than hold public meetings and let people know exactly what we are talking about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no different with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>. There was no consultation. The government may have had meetings around the country on different topics around fisheries. I know in my riding that many meetings were held but there was never any talk or discussion about changing an act and no one was requested for input on a fisheries act. To me, that is not consultation. That is just a meeting to talk about what is going on in the fishery. We have those all the time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would think that with such a proposed monumental change in the way Canada manages its fisheries, the government would have talked to fishery workers and gathered their experience and their views in creating this new act. It said it would. In a media release back in December 2006, DFO stated that the new act came from extensive cross-country consultations and discussions but it did not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no direct discussions, consultations or meetings about new ideas and changes within this act. As I said earlier, if one attended a meeting in the last couple of years that was called consultation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ordinary people in the industry know that they were left out. Recreational and sport fishers, local commercial fleets, aboriginal people, environmentalists and conservation groups were not asked about the creation of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>. In fact, practically every environmental organization on the coast have denounced this bill saying that they were not asked about it and that they saw many flaws within it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the government did listen to one group. It listened to its friends in large corporate fleets. As my colleague from Sackville—Eastern Shore pointed out, the government listened to the mining industry. We heard that it was quick off the mark in saying what a wonderful bill this is. After I think only 12 hours it managed to read this lengthy document and come up with a full report.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610">(1610)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para660758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if it had insider information on what was in the bill. Maybe it even had a hand in writing it, I do not know. However, the bill definitely reflects the concerns of those organizations. It is almost a wish list for the corporate interests over the public.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have talked to many ordinary fishermen in my riding. I have gone to the docks, processing plants and fish farms. There are not very many processing plants left on the coast and hatcheries are in a sad state of repair. They have been neglected for so long. I have met with many men and women who work in these places and have listened to their concerns. They are almost unanimous in their opposition to the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Fisheries Act has held up well for the past 139 years, adapting and changing with the times, as one would expect of something that is a very large piece of legislation. Most would agree that it is not perfect legislation. It has many strengths and also some weaknesses in the eyes of the front line workers, but it is far better than what is proposed here today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, if the government would have listened to average fisheries workers, to the men and women on the coast in my riding and on the eastern coast, it would know that the problem is not all with the act, there are also many problems with the DFO. Budget cuts and a centralized bureaucracy are what people tell me are the biggest problems facing fisheries management today. For example, while the DFO might say it would like to protect species and habitat, the fact is that it does not have the resources that it needs to do the job. At the current level on the west coast, it is ridiculous to think that these people can effectively protect the entire area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem is that the DFO is too centralized in Ottawa to understand local concerns and listen to the front line workers. Fishers in my riding feel as though their insights and their concerns are not listened to, especially when it comes to how to manage the fish stocks. A prime example is the collapse of the east coast cod fishery in the late eighties. Local scientists and fishery workers were raising alarm bells for years about the state of the cod fishery, but Ottawa did not listen until it was way too late. Those same alarm bells are ringing in my riding right now and the DFO still seems to be deaf to them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all know that buying a new house will not fix a bad marriage, but that is what the government is trying to accomplish. Rather than sitting down and really working on the issue of fisheries management with all the stakeholders, the Conservatives have gone out and bought a new Fisheries Act. However I, as well as those fisheries workers in my riding, know that the core problems still remain.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of consultations were not the only problem with the new act. If passed, the act would go a long way to remove the public nature of the Canadian fishery and place it in the hands of corporate fishing interests. Much of what is in the act, coupled with its weak and ambiguous language, allows for less public control over the fishery and gives more control to the DFO and big business.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> does not acknowledge the fishery as a common property resource. Nor does it recognize the public's right to fish as a key value. In a meeting with sport fishermen in my riding, and this was before the bill was proposed in the House, they said that if the government were ever to change the act, they wanted to ensure that it would entrench the principle of personal use access of ordinary Canadians to a share of the common property fisheries resource. For them, that was fundamental.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They talked very strongly about how we need to maintain the common property resource of the fishery. If these people were asked, they would have presented this to the government, but unfortunately, they were never asked. It is a very important principle. It is the key value of the fishery in Canada, especially on the west coast.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615">(1615)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para660767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of Canada has stated that fishing is a right, not a privilege, and that the fishery is a common property resource. The government claims that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> confirms this ruling saying, “Nothing in C-45 contradicts this. In fact, C-45 is based on this very premise”. However, the bill in itself says, “Parliament is committed to maintaining the public character of the management of fisheries and fish habitat”. This is an entirely different concept. The public character can mean many different things, whereas the public's right to fish is pretty definitive in its meaning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see the increasing corporate control over the fishery spelled out in the changes to the licensing programs. The government plans not only to change the length of the licence, but also who can give them out and whether fishermen can pass it along to their children or sell it to pay for their retirement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the fisheries workers who I have talked to believe that 15 year terms of licences are far too long. Longer allocation periods lead to greater corporate control. Large fishing enterprises can have access to the resource for longer periods of time, essentially shutting out other interested individuals, enterprise or community for a whole 15 years. I think it is more than a generation. This extension also does not take into affect the ecological reality of fish stocks and the natural fluctuations in the stock. Fifteen year licences do not make sense for the fish, but it does make sense for business.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While increasing the length of the licences, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> also threatens to eliminate the intergenerational transfer of licences and the financial and social security of many independent fishers, their families and their communities. Licences are financial security for many fishermen. It gives them something to hand off to their children or to sell off to provide them with money for their retirement. We all know that most fishermen do not have a pension plan. Not only does this mean that the government can refuse a sale or transfer of a licence, but it can then redistribute it to whomever it wants. Members should not think this will not happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other clauses in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> allows the minister to designate DFO officials to grant or refuse licences. This gives more control over the handing out and denial of licences to DFO bureaucrats and eliminates the opportunity for politicians to question licence decisions. Others worry that this downloading of power will create a system ripe for abuse, which will mean a relationship with the DFO and connections to the minister will become the preferred means to get a fish allocation instead of simply being a Canadian citizen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the changes seem to actively work against local and small fishermen in favour of large corporate fleets. Yet the small and local fisheries are the backbone of many communities across Canada. That is especially true in my riding where many small operators are trying to make a living and it is becoming increasingly difficult. By stacking the deck against them, we are not only putting the future of the fishery at risk, but the livelihood of countless small communities dotted along the coast, rivers and inlets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill fails to strengthen conservation and protection measures for fish and fish habitat. What we have here is a bill that is more focused on economics than on ecosystems. There are few guidelines in the legislation. What is there is weak and ambiguous, allowing for loopholes and grey areas. While there are parameters for co-management of the stocks, they are quite flawed and actually have the potential for more creeping corporatization of the resource.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> grants too much discretion to the minister by using the word “may” over “must”. I know about weasel words and that is a weasel word if I ever heard one. The use of this language opens up loopholes that would allow for multiple contradictions and vagaries.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620">(1620)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para660775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just spoke about habitat protection and measures for protecting fish habitat. In my riding we have a current issue with the Courtenay River. The Puntledge River Restoration Society is a small group that has been looking after and trying to help with habitat protection and management for more than 10 years. It has been fighting a seal problem in the river. The seal population has been allowed to grow and they are eating the salmon on the way out of the river in the spring and on the way back in the fall.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DFO was working with the Restoration Society. It said it would help with the seal population, that it would complex the river and take some measures to reduce the population. Ten years ago it did a cull of the seals, which was a sad thing, but in order to save the salmon that was something that happened at the time, and it caused quite a controversy in the community. However, the DFO never did follow through on what it said it would do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now 10 years later the seal population is back again. It is causing another problem. The minister says that this small group of volunteers should be looking after things. By this act, it would be these small organizations that would be relied upon to look after fish habitat. All these volunteers have said that they give up. They are tired of raising salmon for the seals when they want to be raising them for fishermen to go out and catch. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we do not have a problem feeding seals, it is sad to see all one's work go down into their bellies. The seals have no natural predators in this area. Again, the volunteers of these organizations across my riding, and this is just one example, are saying that they are not getting any help from the DFO, that there is a big problem there. If they are going to be left to be the managers of fish habitat without any assistance, they are not going to do it, plain and simple.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bill, if they are relying upon these organizations, they are not going to be there. That is a big problem and I cannot see who would take this on. I would hate to see the bill passed in that regard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to say, the bill would favour corporations over the small fishermen, corporations that only look out for their bottom line. We should not expect anything else from them. That is what they are good at, that is what they do and that is okay. However, we cannot privatize fish and fish habitat management to people who only care about making money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish and their habitat are part of an ecosystem that supports all kinds of life, commercially viable or not, and the bill is not one to increase environmental and fish protection. It is designed to download and outsource it. It has no standards or criteria. It is filled with loopholes and contradictions and ways not to protect fish, the ocean and the environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, if the bill were to pass, it will be a disaster for the fishery industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I end by reinforcing some of the comments that were made by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78886,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78886&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</A>, in saying that the bill should not be passed.

    </p><a name="Para660786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> How can that be?</div>
    </p><a name="Para660787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Randy Kamp:</b> That is almost the first time today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagreed particularly with respect to the notion of consultations. I know those members will never be satisfied on this. There is a long list of people and the consultations that have taken place. We have had this conversation with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78886,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78886&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</A>. If we did not say the right sentence or use the right verb in the sentence and in the right tense, then that was not considered consultation by him.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we heard in these consultations was that fishermen and other stakeholders wanted a fishery that was sustainable, stable and predictable, in which they had some shared decision making, and a sanctions regime that was actually effective in addressing the problems of those who would not keep the rules. In fact, that is what we tried to do with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>. I think we accomplished that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a bit confused, though, by the member's comments. I do not know if she is saying there is too much or too little ministerial discretion in this bill. The current act gives absolute discretion. In fact, those words are used in the act. I do not know if she wants to keep that or if she likes the way we have it in the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78991,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78991&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver Island North</A> uses the typical NDP buzzword of “corporatization”. In fact, if anything, the licensing principles are to address that. The minister, with cabinet, and then by going through a regulatory process, devises licensing principles and they are put into effect by licensing officers. If a person does not meet the criteria, if a person perhaps violates the owner-operator policy or whatever it might be, then the person does not get a licence. I do not see any other way to address this issue of creeping corporatization, as those members like to call it, unless there is something similar to what is in this proposed fisheries act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she said the notion of a public right to fish is a definitive concept. If it is so definitive, I would like her to define it for me.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need to explain a Supreme Court ruling to the member. I think he can read it for himself and see how definitive it is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to consultation, as I said earlier in my remarks, and as I have heard from other members in this House and from the member who asked the question, the government had consultations for six or seven years. I am not sure how many years it was, but it is interesting how no one knew that it was going on in those six or seven years. It behooves me to think about all these organizations, the fisheries groups, the environmental organizations, the sport fishers, the lodge owners and the commercial fishermen, and how they did not know about these consultations and were never consulted even if the consultations were going on for so long. Perhaps the member could provide us with a list of those he consulted with so we can see that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the fisheries being a right or a privilege, I want to read something for members. It says:</div>

          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The new Act considers fishing a “privilege” to be bestowed by the Minister rather than a right. It gives the Minister and his bureaucrats power and authority never contemplated by the current Fisheries Act. It unnecessarily strengthens the hand of the Minister and his bureaucrats and weakens that of fishermen who depend on the resource for their livelihood. It would extinguish the public right to fish which has existed in British constitutional law for over 800 years. It will be a sad day for fishermen if this Act ever receives royal assent.</small></td>

    </p><a name="Para660800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they both talked about the lack of consultation with the groups that fish, the fishing community, both sports and commercial fishermen, and first nations. I will not belabour that point because it has been adequately addressed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would like to ask the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78991,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78991&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver Island North</A> about the lack of habitat protection and species management in the bill. They are missing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660802"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live on the banks of the Fraser River. Only a very few years ago I could look out my front window and watch the salmon jumping in the river. That was less than 10 years ago. I could watch fishing boats come down the river. I could watch the oolachan fishery and the big celebration that was held every year in New Westminster for the oolichan fishery. There was a big market and people came from all over the Lower Mainland to buy oolichan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That no longer exists. There is no oolichan in that river. There are very few salmon swimming in that river now. It used to be one of the most abundant salmon rivers in the entire world, but no longer, so I would like to ask my friend about the lack of species management and conservation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660804"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talked about the numbers of volunteers in her community who work to restore habitat. That also happens in my communities on the Coquitlam River and the Burnette River. There is a wonderful group of volunteers who really have worked their hearts and souls out to improve the natural habitat for the fisheries, but they are working against immense odds, with the lack of government support, to ensure that we have viable fisheries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660805"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask my friend to address those issues.</div>

Other members of our caucus, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78991,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78991&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver Island North</A>, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78928,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78928&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</A> and the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79026,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79026&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</A>, have all participated in the debate because we are so concerned about what the impact of the bill will be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in particular, I think, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78886,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78886&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</A> has really brought to the public's attention what is taking place with the bill. We should put it right on the record that we are dealing with a bill in regard to an act that has been around for a very long time. The existing Fisheries Act has been around for about 139 years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to bring in a new bill and a new act is a very significant move. We would not disagree with that. However, the manner in which that is done, the manner in which consultations take place, is something that very much concerns us. Of course, the substance of the bill itself is something that concerns us as well, so we have two issues with the bill. One is the manner in which it was brought forward. The second is the actual substance of the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the process, we have heard from members, excepting from the government side, that there has been a lot of concern about the lack of consultation. There is no question that the history of fisheries and oceans in this nation has always generated enormous public debate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A>, for example, we have fishers who go back generations. We have women who have worked in the fish packing plants and the canning plants. We have families who have gone out on the boats generation after generation. They have seen this resource, which has been seen as a national value, common property, and a community resource, dwindle and be whittled away, mostly because of mismanagement by DFO. There is a lot of interest in what the bill is about. As for any change that takes place, I will tell members, we will have something to say about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no surprise to me to hear that over 29 groups across the country wrote a letter to the government in which they told it to take out the bill, saying that there was not adequate consultation. In fact, we know that the amendment we are debating today, called a hoist amendment, is to actually delay the bill for another six months so that adequate consultation can take place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that the NDP also has advocated that the bill be sent to a special committee so there could be a very fulsome consultation. That was not agreed to, so now we have the amendment, which we support, to actually hoist the bill and say that it should be put off for six months. We do that with legitimate concerns about what is going to happen to an act that has already been in existence for 139 years and is now to be dramatically changed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660820"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not to say that changes are not required. They are, and the NDP would be the first to say that, but we are very concerned about the process that was used. The stakeholders and the people who have invested a huge amount of time into monitoring, analyzing and advocating for fisheries in Canada feel that they have not had a proper consultation. I think that if we are hearing this from people we have a responsibility as parliamentarians to respond to it and to say that we do believe this kind of consultation should take place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660821"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do think it is ironic, though, that one of the groups that does support the bill, the Mining Association of British Columbia, has as its senior director of policy and communications Byng Giraud, who writes and says that he supports the bill, he welcomes it, et cetera, but he also happens to be on the national council of the Conservative Party of British Columbia. He is obviously very happy with the state of things, but if we stack that up against the other 29 groups across the country that say they have not been heard, then I think we know which side we are on with that question.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the concerns we have about the substance of the bill, and why we will be supporting the amendment, is that we really believe this bill does not adequately maintain the fishery as a public resource, a common property resource. To talk about maintaining a public character really does not go far enough for us. We feel that this will undermine the tradition that we have had in this country.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640">(1640)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para660823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are skeptical and suspicious of what the government actually has in mind for privatization, concentration and downloading. One looks at words in a bill very carefully and weighs up what they mean or may not mean. That is one concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second concern we have with the bill is that it does not adequately maintain and strengthen conservation and the protection of fish and fish habitat. This is a huge issue. Often we have public hearings. I know as an urban representative that we often have processes when massive development is coming in. We have had some protection in the past to ensure that fish habitat are protected and there has to be a proper environmental assessment and evaluation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660825"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very concerned that in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A> those provisions will be weakened. They will not be strong enough. When we get down to weighing it up and it becomes the environment and the sustaining of the fishery habitat versus the pressures of development, whether it is urban, mining or resource development, then we have to know that there is an open and transparent process. We have to know that the fishery habitat is going to be both conserved and protected. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660826"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see that as a deficiency in the bill that causes the alarm bells to go off for us. It causes us to not want to support it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also aware that the backdrop to this is cutbacks to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans over the next three years. We can see in the government's own estimates that there are funding cuts for science, conservation and protection programs. Again one has to question if the bill goes through and we marry it up with the cuts that are being planned, what kind of public oversight is there going to be? Who is going to be looking out for the fisheries habitat, conservation and protection? We know that the advocacy groups will be there, but the legislation should be providing those kinds of protections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further concern is the downloading that the bill will provide. This is an old story. Even in the 10 years that I have been here, we have seen what we call the devolvement, the downloading from the federal government to the provincial government. We have seen it with immigration, settlement programs, education, social programs and health care. I could go across the whole spectrum. It is Canadians who lose out because we lose the transparency about what is going on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we ask any group that is trying to track something, whether it is child care funding, immigrant settlement programs, money for post-secondary education or housing which is another big one, they will tell us that the downloading that takes place means that there is no accountability. This bill would further entrench that kind of process. We think it is alarming and should not be allowed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given some of the reasons that we cannot support this bill. It should be hoisted. It should be sent off for a much longer review. I think there are legitimate concerns. That is why we are standing in the House today to speak about our opposition to the bill, not because the Conservatives brought it in, but we looked at this bill on its merits. We made a decision on its merits and it does not stack up. The bill is not good. It will not be good for the fishery. It will not be good for conservation and protection. It will not be good for first nations. We are here to say no, do not let the bill go ahead.</div>

    </p><a name="Para660832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Petitcodiac Riverkeeper association in Moncton, New Brunswick was founded to protect the Petitcodiac River. Incidentally, the government has taken no action on its restoration. The association is very disturbed that if the proposed fisheries act is passed as is, the provisions that enabled the association to twice halt highly toxic discharges into our local river would be gone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member obviously has a great breadth of experience and knowledge of the bill and its application. Could she inform the House and the people of Canada as to what other aspects and natural treasures we have in this country that might be so deleteriously affected by the hasty passage of this bill?</div>

Groups will feel that they have nothing left to do but fight tooth and nail to make an intervention. We should not allow that to happen with any of our public resources. We should not allow that to happen as a matter of upholding public interests. That is really the underlying problem with the bill.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential point is that if we allow a downloading and if we allow these agreements to take place, they will not be transparent.

That is why the federal government needs to have a strong presence in these kinds of resources to make sure that there is accountability, transparency and public oversight.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A> pointed out, this act may be 139 years old, but it is the 139 years of mismanagement, of abuse of a precious resource that we are concerned with. It is imperative at this juncture in the history of our resources that we get it right, that we put things back on track. Never has our fish resource been at such a crisis point and when it is gone, it ain't never coming back. As we are reminded when species disappear, they disappear forever. It is shocking to learn that most of the great fish in our oceans are gone. Ninety per cent of the great fish in our oceans are gone. We are harvesting smaller and smaller species. Even they are being taxed beyond limits.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a carpenter, I built a house one time for a scientist who worked at the biological research centre in Nanaimo. He was a wonderful, interesting guy. He had a beautiful house which I built for him overlooking Departure Bay. As we were building his house, he was telling me about the work that he did. He had a Ph.D. in mathematics. When I asked him what they did, he said that they were trying to age groundfish so that they would know when to best harvest them and when they should be throwing them back to allow them to reproduce. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, “Wait a minute. This is 1980, and I am building a house for you and you are just starting to do the research on when we should or should not harvest groundfish? This is appalling”. We must have thought naively that that resource would always be there for us no matter what we did to it, no matter what pollutants we dumped into the streams. It is not. It is a finite resource.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell one more story about my days as a carpenter. I worked building houses in Kitsault, British Columbia, way up Alice Arm, north of Prince Rupert, up in some of the most magnificent country I have ever seen. We built a whole town there for a new molybdenum mine. We flew in and out to build the houses, a rec centre and the mine. The mine was started up and from the air we could see the plume of effluent working its way down Alice Arm into the inside passage between the Queen Charlotte Islands and Prince Rupert, chasing all of the life out of Alice Arm. That one molybdenum mine was shut down 18 months later. The mine was mothballed; the town was mothballed. We built that town and it sits there still as a ghost town. Alice Arm was sterilized from one year of irresponsible mining. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be irresponsible if I did not point out another disturbing motif or trend in the management of our fisheries that we have taken note of by the Conservative government. Not only is the Conservative government hellbent and determined to bring an end to the Canadian Wheat Board but it seems to have its eyes on the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have its eye on supply management, period, even though this is a disastrous ideologically driven point of view. There is no business case for abolishing the Canadian Wheat Board and there is no business case for abolishing the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand and speak today on behalf of all the fishers on Lake Winnipeg and communities like Gimli, Hnausa and Riverton, and the Icelandic people who came to Manitoba from Iceland, where the largest Icelandic population outside of Iceland lives in the heart of Manitoba, in Gimli. Their tradition and heritage was to make their living from the sea. They had subsistence farming from the land but really their resource was from Lake Winnipeg, what they call their great inland sea.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They chose to market their commodity through a supply management system that now seems to be under attack by this ideological crusade by the Conservative government. I rise to serve notice today that we will not tolerate it. We will not allow it to attack this great prairie institution. It will certainly not do it without a fight from our party.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made note of some of the comments made by my colleague from Vancouver Island North. She made compelling and compassionate arguments talking about our fishing resources as part of our common wealth. It is a notion we do not entertain often enough in this place, I do not think. We should remind ourselves from time to time that we are blessed as Canadians to enjoy the common wealth of this great country and the resources therein. The access to them is part of our common wealth but with that common wealth comes common responsibility. The buck stops here in terms of responsibility for managing our precious and finite resources.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not satisfied and my colleagues are not satisfied.

    </p><a name="Para660857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are ever going to bridge the poverty gap, the prosperity gap, that exists between the social conditions of first nations and aboriginal people and the mainstream population, we must address a fair interpretation of the treaties that includes a sharing of land and resources.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660858"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian Act is a statute that is almost as old as the Fisheries Act. People would be appalled to know that even though tradition, culture and heritage among first nations has it that the fishery and other land resources were a main part of their economy and their culture, there is not only no reference to access to an economic fishery in the Indian Act, it is kept out deliberately. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660859"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something a lot of people do not realize. The only thing that aboriginal people can use for economic development on their reserve or on their traditional territory is mud, gravel, sand and dirt. If one can make a living out of marketing mud, gravel, sand and dirt, then I suppose one could create a gravel pit. Anything else they have to ask specific permission from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79007,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79007&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development </A> to even cut down a single tree or catch a single fish above and beyond bear subsistence.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind my colleagues on the Conservative benches that there is a legal definition of consultation.

The member referred to the Wheat Board. I wonder if he could talk about just the process, not supply management, but whether the government that prides itself on being elected for integrity and accountability is honest and has integrity in the process of the Wheat Board. Should farmers who have said they fear reprisal should they have fear or is the government going through an honest process?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member has lived in Dawson City and he knows quite well the importance of the placer industry.

Does the hon. member think that placer miners would prefer the old act or the new act?</div>

    </p><a name="Para660866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am well aware of the rules if a person disrupts flowing water for the purposes of placer mining. There has to be a series of settling ponds wherein the water runs clear by the time it has finished the operation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of interrupting the fishery, consultation is the answer.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question my colleague asked was about the Wheat Board, a subject dear to my heart.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from the inner city of Winnipeg where the Wheat Board has its head office.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is shocking to me that the government, because of some ideological crusade that it is on, would contemplate wiping out the Canadian Wheat Board, wiping out this great prairie institution without allowing farmers their statutorily protected right to a vote, first of all. I used the term “fascist” earlier and I was chided for doing so, so I will not do so again.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that not like a fascist state, to deny somebody their statutorily protected right to vote?

    </p><a name="Para660894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this bill certainly has some elements that could prove interesting, we must take into account the current situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem to recall that not all that long ago, barely a few months ago, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</A> appeared before the Standing Committee on Official Languages to discuss Air Canada's situation and its obligation to provide services in both official languages. This includes Air Canada as well as its subsidiaries and affiliates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to my great surprise and to the surprise of my Liberal Party colleagues, many factors appeared to be overlooked by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</A> and therefore by the Conservative government, factors that are essential to ensuring that official languages policy is respected by Air Canada and its subsidiaries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were surprised to hear the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</A> tell us that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2154793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2154793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-29</A> would not be sent to the Standing Committee on Official Languages but to the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. The only thing not mentioned in the title of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2154793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2154793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-29</A> is official languages. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the connection between Air Canada and official languages is important. This is not a transportation issue, even though Air Canada is in the business of transportation. We must look at the overall situation. If Parliament is to ensure that Air Canada and its subsidiaries comply with the Official Languages Act, the Standing Committee on Official Languages must be able to hear witnesses, examine evidence, give recommendations and make the required changes and amendments in order for this bill to be acceptable and in order to continue to defend the official languages throughout Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government is doing the exact opposite. We need only look back a few weeks to when the former chair of the Standing Committee on Official Languages decided to cancel a committee meeting with just two minutes' notice. That was already an indication of what we would be facing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today it seems that the Standing Committee on Official Languages will not even be able to study the bill. It is a shame that the government is not giving this committee the opportunity to debate the bill and make the necessary amendments. It is true that the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities can do some work. I am convinced that the members of this committee can do a good job. However, this is not just about transportation, it is also about official languages. Matters pertaining to official languages must be dealt with by the Standing Committee on Official Languages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days we will see if the government backtracks and reinstates the committee. The government may be tired of losing face with regard to official languages and official language communities outside Quebec. That may be the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can hear people opposite who do not agree with me, but that is still the reality of the situation. The Conservative government has lost face on the official languages issue. Since I am still hearing them, I have to conclude that what I am saying does not suit them. Nevertheless, it is the truth. Official language communities are saying that the government should be ashamed of itself for not having replaced the chair of the committee so that we can continue our work. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying is important because the government is applying the same logic in trying to prevent the Standing Committee on Official Languages from studying Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2154793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2154793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-29</A>. That element should never be shunted aside.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be clear: the Conservative government says a lot of nice things. It talks a good game, but when the time comes to take action, it gets a failing grade. This government is good for nothing when it comes to official languages.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715">(1715)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para660905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the government can go ahead and laugh at what I have to say, but I can tell you that official language minority communities do not think this is funny. They do not think that the way they are being treated is funny. Official language minority communities have never been treated as badly as they are being treated now. Who is responsible for treating them so badly? The Conservative government, the government that is now in power. Thank goodness it is a minority government. If it were a majority government, one would have to wonder what would be left of official language minority community rights. Probably not all that much.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we say that Air Canada must offer services in both languages, we are not just saying that for fun. In the not-too-distant past, Air Canada belonged to the federal government. Then it was privatized and Air Canada became a private company. Even so, it was not exempted from its obligations and had to keep offering bilingual services to the Canadian public. Not just part of the Canadian public. Not just anglophones. This was to ensure that francophones would also receive adequate service. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Air Canada merged with Canadian International, I remember that, at the Standing Committee on Official Languages, some people from the company were rather unhappy, because of me. I even received some mail from people who were very upset about some of my comments. I will repeat them here today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Air Canada decided to merge with Canadian International, certain conditions had to be met. For instance, the new entity had to comply with the rules of the Official Languages Act and had to provide services to all Canadians in both official languages. People made up excuses, saying that they were in the process of restructuring, that they were nearly bankrupt, that they were having problems and that we should not be forcing them to provide services in both official languages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told them those were the rules of the game at that time and that they had not changed. It was a deal or no deal situation, as it were. Since the company decided to merge with Canadian International, it also had to accept the deal, which meant that the new entity had to provide services in both official languages. Yet it is still hard, even today, to get service in both languages. Many people have made comments about this, not just me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his 2006-07 report, the Commissioner of Official Languages said that most of the complaints received regarding service to the public had to do with Air Canada and its inability to provide services to its customers in both official languages. The Commissioner of Official Languages said this, but let us be clear. This refers only to those who filed a complaint, but there are many people across the country who are very discouraged by the service they receive. Ultimately, however, they wonder what good it does to file a complaint, because the service never gets any better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not just talking about person to person service, because sometimes flight attendants will provide service in French, but there are also machines on board that give instructions in French and English. And then there is the written word. The other day I was travelling with Air Canada and I saw things that should not even be possible in this day and age. Everyone would be frustrated to see some of the written language on airplanes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the situation, we see that some people are not happy about the fact that Air Canada employees are unable to offer bilingual service. Nonetheless, it is not up to the Conservative government to decide that Air Canada will not offer bilingual services. It is up to us, Parliament, to do so. We have said that Air Canada is required to provide bilingual services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we now see in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2399048,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2399048&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-29</A>? The government does not want to consider the present or the future. We cannot discharge Air Canada from its obligation—which also applies to its affiliates—to respect the official languages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not take action today, it will be too late in the future to try to repair the damage.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720">(1720)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para660915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government is trying to repair damage in several areas. For months, the only thing it has been able to do is repair the damage it has caused. It can blame others, but it should take a look at itself before criticizing members from other parties. It keeps repairing the damage that it has caused. It is not the Liberals who are to blame. It is the Liberals who are waking them up. It is the Liberals who are defending the public so that it is well served, whether in terms of official languages or in terms of student initiatives, etc. That is a fact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thanks to the work of the Liberals that the Conservatives can wake up. As I was saying earlier, it is a good thing this is not a majority government. Indeed, we would be able to wake them up, but they would be able to carry on their little dictatorship. We are here to ensure that the Canadian public has the services it deserves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is astounding that this government refuses to acknowledge that a company could purchase existing entities and not be subject to the Official Languages Act. Can you imagine Air Canada being snatched up by a foreign company? The Conservatives would celebrate because they love it when foreign companies buy Canadian companies. They love it when foreign companies take over Canadian businesses and lay off employees. It is just astounding. We can only imagine what it would be like if the official languages policy were also to disappear from Air Canada. The Conservative government does not even want to make the decisions needed to deal with these situations, even though they are so important that they cannot be disregarded.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are issues that the Conservatives should be examining. They should also look themselves in the mirror and tell themselves that, if they truly want to protect official languages, they should stand up in the House and say that there is nothing to worry about because Air Canada companies, present and future Air Canada subsidiaries, will be required to provide services in both official languages no matter their organizational structure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, try to find a travel agency in your neighbourhood. You used to be able to find one almost everywhere. You could easily find one, whether you lived in a city or village, and buy an Air Canada ticket. Today, their numbers are dwindling. There will be even fewer if this continues. We also have Air Canada Vacations and Aeroplan. Why is it that if you want to make reservations or obtain certain services, Air Canada Vacations is not required to provide service in both official languages? Why does Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2399048,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2399048&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-29</A> not address this? Why is Bill C-29 not moving in that direction? Why does the Conservative government not want to have the bill cover this? It is not magic, it is not complicated. If the Conservatives do not wish to include official language provisions in the bill, it is probably because they do not believe in official languages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aeroplan is a loyalty program. It enables clients to do more business with the company. In return, the company offers gifts or points exchangeable for more trips or gifts. This also affects online reservations. If we take Aeroplan as an example and if we want to exchange our points for a vacation service, but Aeroplan is not obligated to respect official languages, how will people be respected? How will official language communities be respected? This does not make sense. We cannot say that part of the company will do it and the rest will not. The entire company must do it, all of its current parts, and all of its future ones. Why is it so hard for Conservatives to understand that we are obligated to respect official languages? Why is it so difficult for Conservatives to ensure that official languages will be respected in the future?</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725">(1725)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para660921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want my children, and I hope, my grandchildren and descendants to have to fight like we have had to against the Conservatives in order to be respected with regard to official languages. This is a reality that the Conservatives want to hear nothing about. If the government allowed a free vote on the official languages bill, I would like to see the reaction of members from the other side of the House and to see how many Conservative members would vote against official languages, because many of them do not believe in them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party does not believe in the entire official languages issue and is not looking to ensure official languages are respected in communities outside Quebec. This is not something new; history is repeating itself. The current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> or the members of his party have made comments in the past. They should not think that because they are now prime minister or in government that history will be forgotten.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did they say? Whether they said it a month ago, a year ago or 10 years ago, if they said it, it is too bad, but it is because they believed it. If they believed it, they said it and it continues. They are just trying to win votes. It is really unfortunate. We can tell the Conservative members and the Conservative government that official language communities across the country no longer believe in the Conservative government and no longer believe what the Conservatives are saying.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy because sometimes reality reappears. The Conservatives helped francophones outside Quebec and all official language communities realize that the Conservatives were not able to keep their word and that they were not in a position to truly defend and respect official language minority communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, we must look towards the future. The future must be certain, not uncertain. A future that is certain would mean that the government must wake up and make the amendments deemed necessary. First of all, they should refer Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2399048,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2399048&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-29</A> to the Standing Committee on Official Languages. If they also want to present it to the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, that would not be a problem. However, they must at least show enough respect for official language minority communities to let the Standing Committee on Official Languages have the opportunity to examine the situation, and make the necessary recommendations and amendments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that the other members of my party are supporting me in this file, because this is the reality. We do not see any Conservative members applauding this matter, because the Conservatives do not believe in it. They absolutely do not believe in services in both official languages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sometimes interesting to see how things unfold. On February 21, 2002, members of the former Canadian Alliance, who were also members of the committee at that time, presented a minority report. They felt that the official languages issue should be removed from the Air Canada Public Participation Act. We are currently experiencing the first step. The Conservatives come along and limit the implication of official languages in the Air Canada Public Participation Act. I am convinced that they are dreaming of the day when the official languages obligation regarding Air Canada public participation will just disappear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes no sense when we look at a situation like this, but we must look at the reality. Some say that this makes no sense, but nothing has made any sense for the past 16 months, ever since we have been dealing with this Conservative government, which has no common sense when it comes to official languages.</div>

    </p><a name="Para660947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue was and remains the minister's complete refusal to acknowledge that an Algerian news story, which implied that the CWB had undersold grain into the Algerian market, was factually incorrect and that it perpetuated what in effect was a misleading and false story. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that is not unusual for the government opposite in its drive to the ideological agenda that it is on which is that its members take the position to not let the facts get in the way of a good story.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a government that has demonstrated a willingness to use tactics to undermine the CWB, which violates the very democratic principles that any government worthy of respect should adhere to. Not only has the government intentionally assaulted the character of the president and CEO, it has engaged in the use of intimidation, it has fired Wheat Board directors and it has tampered with voters' lists and directors' elections. It used marked ballots in the recent barley plebiscite and has absolutely refused to respect the will of Parliament, not once but twice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time, we now have regulations, which the government has brought forward to undermine the Canadian Wheat Board by removing barley from the board, which are of questionable legality. The Canadian Wheat Board, in its response to the minister's backdoor effort to undermine the Wheat Board, stated:</div>

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>

</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para660952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a government that has no interest in the harm it inflicts on western grain farmers or on farmers generally or in terms of the international reputation of the Canadian Wheat Board. When a Canadian marketing agency is respected to the extent that the Canadian Wheat Board is around the world and it violates its contracts as a result of government orders, that hurts the reputation of every Canadian institution and agency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government made this move by basically acting retroactively and injuring those contracts and that reputation. All of this is part of the same ideological thinking of the Conservative regime. It has demonstrated a complete contempt for western grain farmers by not allowing for a free, open and honest plebiscite based on questions drafted by farmers and farm organizations themselves. It has demonstrated a contempt for Parliament by ignoring the will of the majority of this House. </div>

It is all we hear from him. His rhetoric gets wilder and wilder. I guess we are getting more and more used to that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to respond to his question that he asked some months ago. The Canadian Wheat Board has provided the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79002,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79002&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and Minister for the Canadian Wheat Board</A> with the price of each of its durum wheat sales to Algeria for the last 10 years. While the Wheat Board says that this is commercially confidential information that cannot be released publicly, the minister stands by his comments that he is willing to release those numbers so that farmers can see what they really are. He has made that clear in the past and he is waiting for their permission and their cooperation to do that and we would look forward to that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his recent testimony before the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food the interim president and CEO of the Canadian Wheat Board said that farmers should just trust the Canadian Wheat Board when it says it has obtained fair value in relation to the values available to its international competitors, particularly in the Algerian market.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Wheat Board has told farmers for far too long that they should just trust the CWB. The minister's interpretation of the information provided to him by the Canadian Wheat Board on the price of each of its durum sales to Algeria for the last 10 years is vastly different from what the Canadian Wheat Board claims.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Canadian Wheat Board dismisses the allegation that the Wheat Board has been underselling the market for durum wheat in Algeria and says the allegation appears to have originated from material circulated by the U.S. Wheat Associates, the government finds it ironic that the Wheat Board has asked the minister not to publicly release the information provided to him.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the government is not convinced that Algeria is not getting a special deal from the Canadian Wheat Board because the news report came from an Algerian official who had publicly stated that Algeria saves tens of dollars per tonne purchasing durum from the Canadian Wheat Board. If it is three tens of dollars per tonne, that is a dollar a bushel that western Canadian farmers are not getting on their durum sales that they should be getting. It is only natural that western Canadian farmers are asking questions about what is going on with the pricing of this grain.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Wheat Board has tried to box the minister in on this issue by once again asking farmers and the public to just trust its interpretation of information which it is unwilling to share with the very farmers on whose behalf it says that it is maximizing returns. The government expects the Wheat Board to work hard to get the best value for Canadian farmers and feels that farmers have the right to see evidence if that is indeed happening. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind hon. members that this debate underscores the importance of the inclusion of the Canadian Wheat Board under the Access to Information Act which happened effective April 1, 2007. This was something that was long in coming and farmers had waited for for many years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By extending application of the Access to Information Act to the Canadian Wheat Board, the government is making the organization more open. It is making it more transparent. It is providing all Canadians and especially the wheat and barley farmers of western Canada who are forced to deal with it with broader access to information about and from this organization.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members can be assured that the government is committed to providing marketing choice to western Canadian farmers with the Wheat Board as one of those options in their choice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is moving forward with amendments to Canadian Wheat Board regulations to provide marketing choice, in particular, for the western Canadian barley producers, as of August 1, 2007. Our producers look forward with great expectation to the opportunities that will come from that.</div>

    </p><a name="Para660975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today was another heart-rending day. Members of the citizenship and immigration committee heard compelling stories of children of war brides and how their citizenship was unjustly taken away from them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had the case of a couple of sisters who were children of a war bride. They came to this country in 1946. One was a baby, just months old, and the other one was three years old. They recently have found out that they are not citizens. The question comes into play whether they are entitled to old age security, the guaranteed annual supplement and whatnot.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another tragic case is about a mother who came here to be with her daughter's family. Her daughter, who is a member of the Canadian armed forces, is slated to serve in Afghanistan, but she has found out she is not a Canadian. She does not have any proof of ID so she can get a driver's licence that she can use to help the four kids she will be looking after.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have continually heard stories like this where offspring of war brides and war brides themselves do not have their citizenship recognized. At the other end, they have children that serve in the armed forces. This is so very wrong. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> of the country has said that we should be honouring Canadian veterans, the people who have fought for our country, the people fighting for our country now in Afghanistan and the people who fought for our country in the second world war. It is incredibly shameful that we have not addressed this issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To its credit, the government came in with a limited proposal today, but this limited proposal would not apply to the people about whom I just talked. It would not apply to people who came here before 1947. Most of the war brides and their children came to Canada in 1946. This is really a shame.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another thing that is really a shame. When we look at the composition of the committee from the Conservative side, we really only have one person with any previous experience on the committee. The ministers do not have any experience, and this is the second minister the government has had in less than a year. Also, they come from ridings that do not have much of an immigrant population.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, if we believe that immigration has been the lifeblood of our country, that immigration is the lifeblood of our country and that immigration will continue to be the lifeblood of our country, clearly, we need a citizenship act that recognizes the modernity of our times and does not discriminate against people born out of wedlock.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the problem now is we have religious marriages that were performed in Mexico, and this relates to offspring of Mennonites who have derivative citizenship rights. If those people had religious marriages but failed to have civil marriages, then their offspring are considered to be born out of wedlock and have no rights. Now—</div>

If there is anything that we would not be proud of it is playing politics with a situation that is very personal to many individuals and to those who are affected with respect to their citizenship.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can say that this government is taking action to address this important issue. A number of cases have been raised before the committee and a number of cases have been resolved. In certain cases the minister has used her discretionary authority to grant citizenship. She has waived the application fees in almost all of the cases. She has considered the cases on a case by case basis and has used her discretion wherever possible to ensure that a solution was found. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has been practical and proactive. She has made this issue a priority. She and her department have dealt one by one with the cases that have come forward, giving them individual attention. I applaud the minister for those efforts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an ongoing basis, the clearest and most permanent way to address a situation such as this is through legislation, through regulation, and through the work of this House and the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister announced today that she intends to table legislation in the fall that will resolve the issue of citizenship for most of those people whose status is currently in question while still maintaining the opportunity to resolve others on a case by case basis through the use of a discretionary grant of citizenship.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has suggested that her proposed legislative approach will be based on four major elements. She has indicated that she will take input from the committee and is open to improvements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, nothing in the proposals will take away citizenship from anyone who is now a citizen of Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para660991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, anyone born in Canada on or after January 1, 1947, the date of the first Citizenship Act, will have their citizenship confirmed even if they lost it under a provision of the 1947 legislation. The only exceptions would be those born in Canada to an accredited foreign diplomat or who have personally renounced their citizenship as adults.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, anyone naturalized in Canada on or after January 1, 1947, will have their citizenship confirmed even if they lost it under a provision of the 1947 act. The only exceptions would be those, as above, who renounced their citizenship, or, as adults, whose citizenship was revoked by the government because it was obtained by fraud.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, anyone born to a Canadian citizen abroad, mother or father, in or out of wedlock, on or after January 1, 1947, is a Canadian citizen and will have their citizenship confirmed if they are the first generation born abroad. The legacy of Canadian citizenship should not continue or be passed on through endless generations living abroad, so there will be that qualifier.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This a practical approach. Our government did not create the problem, but we are addressing it. We are addressing it in a practical way for the benefit of all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660995"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only has the minister proceeded with the specific proposals that will be put forward, but she also has suggested that she is still open to further input, and she has indicated that she will use her discretion whenever it is necessary to ensure that individual cases that require attention and need a remedy will have that remedy.</div>

    </p><a name="Para660997"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had children of war brides in front of us who are now in their mid-sixties and they get no relief with this legislation. This is clearly wrong.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660998"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also is clearly wrong for the Conservative government to be discriminating against Mennonite marriages. For the sheer fact that they did not have civil weddings, their offspring are considered to be born out of wedlock. Clearly this is wrong.</div>
    </p><a name="Para660999"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous government had committed to change the Citizenship Act and had $20 million in the budget to do it. We had three reports from committee that we all agreed on, but this Conservative government came in and cancelled the money for a new Citizenship Act. It is time to correct that injustice. </div>

If they fall into those categories they would be treated similarly, not discriminated against.</div>
    </p><a name="Para661001"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly we also can say in regard to the member's reference to what the previous government may or may not have done that we know it had been in office for two terms, and it did not address this problem in any single particular way, although it had ample opportunity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para661002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government has allocated significant funds in many areas, including an overall increase in the budget for citizenship and immigration to deal with problems. Specifically, the minister has indicated that this problem will be addressed. It will be dealt with. There will be practical solutions that will resolve what has existed for a significant number of years without any attention whatsoever being paid to it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para661003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will get the job done. It will take some effort. We understand that. We will address all of the cases that fall into this anomalous situation and that require attention by this government.</div>
