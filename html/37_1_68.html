</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on Monday evening members of parliament and diplomats 
joined with the Armenian ambassador and members of the Armenian 
community to celebrate the 83rd anniversary of the independence 
of the Armenian first republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, Armenia is a proud and independent country controlling 
its own destiny on the world stage.  Following the genocide of 
the Armenians during the turmoil of the first world war and its 
aftermath, independence was gained from the Ottoman Empire on May 
28, 1918. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragically, freedom was short lived.  December 2, 1920 was the 
beginning of 70 years of tyranny at the hands of the communists. 
The 1918 independence, though brief, was the foundation of the 
modern Armenian state.  Armenia regained its independence on 
September 21, 1991, following the collapse of the U.S.S.R. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the survivors who immigrated to Canada and the 
contribution they and their children have made to our nation 
enrich our society in many diverse ways.  Canadians of Armenian 
descent continue to use their talents to build a better Canada 
through the arts and sciences as well as in business and in every 
walk of life.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-7, the new youth criminal justice act has finally 
left this place.  Unfortunately for Canadians it will, in the 
opinion of many, ultimately turn out to be worse than the much 
reviled Young Offenders Act that it is intended to replace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces who must administer the youth law have said that 
the federal government failed to properly consult and that no 
proper cost analysis was ever conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act is riddled with discretions and loopholes.  Its 
sheer complexity will lead to delays and soaring legal aid bills 
to the taxpayer.  Violent and repeat offenders will be eligible 
for extra judicial measures.  That is another term for avoiding 
court in favour of community programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maximum custodial youth sentences for serious violent offences 
will actually be reduced.  Murder, manslaughter, attempted murder 
and aggravated sexual assault will be presumed serious enough for 
adult sentences, maybe.  Sexual assault with a weapon, armed 
robbery and kidnapping will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken over seven years to produce legislation 
that is doomed to failure.  Unfortunately it is mainly our youth 
who will pay the price, and that is sad.

week I represented the Secretary of State responsible for 
Canada's economic development at the fifth anniversary of the Quebec 
Biotechnology Innovation Centre, which is located in Laval, 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just amazed at how worthwhile and successful the business 
incubator approach has been.  Inaugurated in 1996, the Quebec 
Biotechnology Innovation Centre in Laval has already been 
instrumental in the development and business success of eleven 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was able to make the announcement that this organization would 
be receiving $350,000 in financial assistance, and I can tell 
hon. members that this funding from the Government of Canada was 
greatly appreciated by chairman of the board, Jacques Gagné, CEO 
Normand de Montigny and all the team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations to the people of Laval and long live their

pleased to congratulate Athol and Brian Craswell of Crasdale 
Farms of South Rustico, Prince Edward Island upon receiving the 
master breeder award presented annually by Holstein breeders 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This honour to Crasdale Farms marks the fifth time ever that a 
Prince Edward Island farm has been a recipient of this 
prestigious award.  Crasdale Farms is the only recipient this 
year for all of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The award symbolizes one of the key components of the strengths 
of the Canadian dairy industry, that is exceptional breeding 
practices.  The award itself is based upon the accumulation of 
points earned by animals bred by a farmstead that remain in 
Canada.

glass plant on the occasion of the plant's 50th anniversary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Friday, May 25 kicked off the two day celebration with employees 
and members of the community coming together for an open house 
and barbeque.  Tours of the operation and product displays were 
another highlight offered to all who came. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased that Owens-Corning chose to reside in my 
riding.  Owens-Corning is a valued member of my community and it 
is also recognized internationally as a good corporate citizen 
and a global leader.  Not only does Owens-Corning maintain high 
environmental standards and encourage environmental performance 
goals within the company but it also gives back to our community 
in which it resides through its support of organizations such as 
Habitat for Humanity, the United Way and the Easter Seals 
Society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer my congratulations to Owens-Corning and I wish them 
every success in Guelph for the next 50 years and more.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we all know about the ongoing 
malignant environmental catastrophe at the Sydney tar ponds in 
Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions have been spent since the 1980s to determine the 
negative effects of the tar ponds and on the ineffective cleanup. 
A week ago the government announced yet another plan.  It will be 
testing, analyzing, carrying out risk assessments, holding 
meetings and creating more plans.  This removes no one from 
harm's way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no common sense priority for spending.  A 
month ago $560 million was given to the ministry of propaganda, 
oh, I mean the department of heritage, to spend on things like a 
virtual Internet museum when our museums already have Internet 
sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some $10 million was spent in my riding to relocate the families 
of the Ahaminaquus Indian Reserve away from pulp mill discharges. 
Does the government think that the people of Cape Breton are less 
worthy?

would like to take the opportunity to congratulate my municipal 
colleagues from coast to coast to coast on a very successful 
conference in Banff last weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the 64th annual conference of the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities which has been the national voice of municipal

quality of life in communities and promoting strong, effective 
and accountable municipal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representing Canada's largest cities through to the smallest 
rural and remote communities, our elected municipal leaders work 
tirelessly on behalf of their constituents to ensure their 
quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an impressive relationship in listening and 
working with municipal governments across the country:  the 
adoption of a national infrastructure program; the establishment 
of $125 million green enabling fund; the 20% club; the reduction 
of CO2 emissions over 10 years; the payments in lieu of taxes 
legislation; urban crime; community safety programs, and I could 
go on.

school was incorporated with Niagara College.

on the basis of what the military has asked for, and that is 
exactly what they will get.  The helicopters will be the very

have a question for the Prime Minister about helicopters.  The 
government is buying helicopters that cannot stay in the air long 
enough in bad weather.  His parliamentary secretary said he 
justifies that because times are changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that has not changed is an estimate by the Department 
of National Defence that says in bad weather helicopters might 
have to stay in the air at least three hours.  That is longer 
than these helicopters can stay in the air in order to perform 
rescues 100 miles offshore the Atlantic coast.  What is the 
policy of the government?   Is it just going to let—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

best possible price that can do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are different operations around the world by different 
countries and they do not all have only one type of helicopter. 
That means that many different types of helicopters can do the

not make a deal like they did seven years ago. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we had a helicopter like that and the government cancelled it. 
What it is now proposing to do is to buy a helicopter that cannot 
save Canadians at sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister knows that when the government opened bidding 
to replace the Labrador it asked KPMG and Justice Dubin to 
conduct a review of the competitive process.  In the case of the 
Sea King, the government has split the contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has there been either an internal or an external study of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have the equipment at the best price and the helicopter at

he is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A U.S. admiral who is involved in this says that the U.K. 
currently does not have a policy decision on missile defence. 
That is why it is not involved in the forum.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find very disturbing is that the official opposition

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

Health Canada has had for some time guidelines for mercury levels 
in fish that are among the most prudent in the world. In fact we 
are at half of the American permissible levels.  That has been in 
place for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition we have consumer advisories for those fish that are

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ)</B> moved:  That the second 
report of the Standing Joint Committee on 
Official Languages, presented in May 2001, be concurred in. 
<A NAME="LINK158">&nbsp;</A>

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, to convince parliamentarians of this 
House that it is urgent to adopt the report without delay, allow 
me to make a few remarks on some recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue studied in the report is essentially that of the 
broadcasting and availability of debates and proceedings of 
parliament in both official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its analysis, the committee found, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that broadcasting of the debates and proceedings of Parliament 
plays an essential role in the democratic process in Canada ... 
[and] that Canadians have a right to access to the debates and 
proceedings of their Parliament in their preferred official 
language. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth and seventh recommendations of the report are of 
particular interest to me. They relate to the closed captioning 
in French of Oral Question Period and the closed captioning in 
both official languages of Senate committee proceedings, when 
they are broadcast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in sign language as follows:</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Captioning is important. By now my interest for captioning and 
for people who are deaf or hearing impaired is known. I take this 
opportunity to tell them that they have my support and to salute 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this special Better Hearing Month, it is good to remind 
ourselves that 10% of the population is deaf or hearing impaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:</B> Mr. Speaker, for one minute, you did 
not understand anything. Imagine that for a whole life. 
Personally I find it harrowing. That is why my struggle for 
captioning remains so actual and crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying in LSQ, May is Better Hearing Month. I take this 
opportunity to remind the House that over three million Canadians 
live with a hearing problem, 750,000 of them in Quebec alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem now affects one in ten individuals. Deafness is the 
handicap that affects the largest number of people and, what is 
more, it is invisible. We cannot remain unconcerned about that 
alarming fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than ever we must become aware of this fact and take 
concrete actions we must not only express pious hopes but take concrete 
legislative actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind the House that television plays an essential role 
in the lives of a very large number of deaf and hearing impaired 
people, and for good reason: because some of them have no other 
means of communication not everyone can have a computer and 
access to Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deny them access to this source of information and 
entertainment could lead to isolation, not to mention all the 
various safety aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since these persons cannot hear the radio, television remains 
the only media of information in real time for them.  Just think 
about weather warnings or disasters.  Without captioning, these 
people will have no idea about what is going on.  To learn about 
the events through the newspapers the next day would be too late 
in many instances and that could have serious consequences on 
their safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the deaf or the hearing impaired remember quite well 
the ice storm because they had no access whatsoever to real time 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are but a few examples to illustrate the very complex 
difference between those who are fortunate enough to hear 
properly and those who are not. I remain optimistic however and 
my goal is to obtain 100% captioning for television programs. 
Overall, I find the report of the Standing Joint Committee on 
Official Languages to be a good start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to see that the motion on captioning that I 
tabled in 1999, and which received unanimous consent of the 
House, is finally echoed within parliamentary committees.  The 
analysis of the Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages 
and its recommendations for mandatory captioning of all debates 
in the House are a clear example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is only a start, only one tool among others to truly 
facilitate the integration of deaf or hearing impaired persons 
into our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also pleased to hear the last Speech from the Throne 
because the federal government promised to increase its support 
for the CBC/SRC in order to help that corporation better play its 
role as public broadcaster serving all Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the end of the good news because, despite this fine 
inclusive speech, I still wonder about the priority given to 
those three million people with a hearing disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned about the deaf and hearing impaired 
francophones who have access to a meagre 38% of the French 
network's programming of Radio-Canada, while the figure is 90% 
for the English network. These statistics are disturbing, to say 
the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally inconceivable that, in a country that brags about 
respecting the two official languages, French closed captioning 
lags so far behind closed captioned programming  provided in 
English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is only one way to solve this sensitive issue of 
access to communications for those three million people: 
legislation to require broadcasters to provide closed captioning 
for their video programming in both official languages and to 
give the same rights to hearing impaired people. The federal 
government has full leeway to legislate quickly on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that I introduced a bill, Bill C-306, which 
would amend the Broadcasting Act to require every broadcaster to 
provide closed captioning for its video programming. 
Unfortunately, my bill is still not on the House's priority list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is hearing and speech month, I challenge the 
government to show its true intentions regarding the priority it 
intends to give to deaf and hearing impaired people. To that end, 
I offer the government the opportunity to take over my bill so 
that members of parliament can debate it as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those very legitimate reasons, and I am sure members will 
agree, I ask unanimous consent of the House so that the second 
report of the Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages be 
concurred in now. In conclusion, I hope that the federal 
government will understand that closed captioning allows deaf and 
hearing impaired people to read what we hear.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL S-15 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Moments ago a bill was introduced, Bill S-15.  I take this 
occasion to indicate to the House that it is my belief that the 
bill cannot proceed to the next reading because it is out of 
order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-15, which was just introduced in the House, creates an 
independent foundation to provide funding for programs to prevent 
the use of tobacco products by young people. It is obviously a 
very laudable initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funds would come from a tax on tobacco products. The senator 
who introduced the bill expects that such a tax will bring in 
$360 million each year to fund the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, section 53 of the Constitution Act, 1867, 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bills for appropriating any Part of the Public Revenue, or for 
imposing any Tax or Impost, shall originate in the House of 
Commons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Ways and Means motion is a necessary preliminary to the 
imposition of a new tax, the continuation of an expiring tax, an 
increase in the rate of an existing tax, or an extension of the 
incidence of a tax so as to include persons not already payers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are talking about imposing a new tax, continuing an 
expiring tax, increasing a tax or extending the incidence of a 
tax, a ways and means motion is necessary. Beauchesne's also 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a Minister of the Crown can move a motion to impose a new 
tax.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-15 is essentially the same as a bill tabled in the first 
session of the 36th parliament, Bill S-13.  The principal 
differences between Bill S-13 and Bill S-15 are a detailed 
preamble and the addition of part III which sets out what are 
claimed to be the bill's benefits to the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the new bill is the same in purpose and operation as was 
Bill S-13.  The main purpose of Bill S-15 remains: to prevent the 
use of tobacco products by young people.  Its mechanics to 
implement that purpose are completely identical.  I therefore 
suggest that the same treatment be reserved for this bill as for 
the prior one.  The taxation powers of Bill S-15 of $360 million 
per year are increased fivefold over Bill S-13, which would have 
raised $70 million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, your predecessor, Speaker Parent, concluded that 
Bill S-13 constituted a tax bill and as such constitutionally and 
procedurally could be initiated only in the House of Commons and 
only after the House had concurred in a ways and means motion 
tabled by a minister of the crown.  The bill was therefore ruled 
not to be properly before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that the ruling on Bill S-13 applies to Bill S-15.  As 
I have indicated, the two bills are in essence the same in 
purpose and operation.  Like Bill S-13, Bill S-15 must be 
considered a taxation measure which should have been initiated 
and could only be initiated in the House and not the Senate after 
concurrence in a ways and means motion proposed by a minister of 
the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the House recently took action to address 
tobacco use, and in particular smoking by young Canadians, by 
passing Bill C-26, the tobacco tax amendment bill.  I will quote 
a speech made in the other place by Senator John Bryden who noted 
that Bill C-26 and Bill S-15 both claim to reduce tobacco 
consumption to meet national health objectives.  Senator Bryden 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have much difficulty making the difference between Bill S-15, 
which will charge $1.75 per carton, and the bill that was 
introduced from the other place today, which will charge $2 per 
carton.  One is called an excise tax; the other one is called a 
levy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 was introduced in the House after concurrence in a 
ways and means motion which was introduced by a minister of the 
crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to you, Mr.  Speaker, that although Bill S-15 has the 
laudable objective of reducing smoking by young Canadians, it is 
a taxation measure.  As such it should have been initiated and 
can only be initiated in the House of Commons after concurrence 
in a ways and means motion which furthermore can only be proposed 
by a minister of the crown.  The House did almost the same thing 
by introducing Bill C-26 which was preceded by a motion of ways 
and means that was concurred in prior to the bill's introduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore submit that the bill cannot be introduced in the 
House.  Now that the member has gone through the process of 
introducing it, it is not properly before the House, to use the 
language your predecessor used, Mr. Speaker.  Therefore I ask the 
Chair to rule that the bill is out of order and not properly 
before the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to ask for 
your indulgence.  As official opposition we did not have notice 
that the bill would be introduced and discussed today.  I would 
like some time to prepare an answer to what we have heard from 
the government House leader so that we may represent another 
point of view on the issue before you decide whether or not the 
bill is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will keep the member's comments in mind 
but there are other members who would like to make an 
intervention.  I am prepared to hear them at this time.

<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
just want to remind the Chair that, notwithstanding the ruling it 
will make concerning the admissibility of the bill, the tobacco 
industry is in favour of this bill, and so are the health groups 
fighting against smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our mind, this is not a tax. We went through the same thing 
with the video industry, where a levy was imposed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In common case law, a levy is a measure applying only to a 
specific industry and aiming at a very specific goal for the same 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The levy mentioned in the bill would be imposed on the tobacco 
industry. The industry wants this levy. Organizations trying to 
dissuade people from smoking agree with such a levy. Mr. Speaker, 
we respectfully submit that this is not a tax, but rather a 
voluntary levy. Therefore, the bill is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best thing we can do as parliamentarians is to refer the 
bill to committee and allow it to go through the various stages 
and then come back to the House so we can have a debate over the 
substance of the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I am not as knowledgeable as you are, Mr. Speaker, and I 
would like to ask you a question. At what point can the Chair 
decide that a bill is in order? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was introduced earlier during routine proceedings, 
nobody rose. We saw the very professional and credible look of 
the Speaker. He looked to see if the government House leader 
would rise then to debate the admissibility of the bill before 
its introduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader did not rise at that time. He was 
busy, and I understand that. He rose a few moments ago, as it is 
his prerogative to rise at any time on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my question for the Chair: since the bill has already 
been introduced, at what point can the Chair decide to refuse or 
accept a bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not as knowledgeable as you are with regard to procedural 
matters, but I would say that it should be before the 
introduction of the bill. It seems that the bill has gone through 
an important step and, with all due respect, I would like the 
Chair to rule on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, my colleague, the House leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party, the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, is very much interested in 
everything that goes on in the House with regard to procedure, 
just like you are. We agree with the House leader of the official 
opposition and would ask the following of the Chair. We would 
like to have a little more time to prepare our response to 
the point of order raised by the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important bill. My colleague from the Bloc Quebecois 
mentioned that there is practically unanimous support for Bill 
S-15. Yet, we are caught up in procedural wrangling between the 
two Houses. We would like to have time to react, knowing full 
well that the majority of members in this House have received 
dozens and hundreds of letters from people from their ridings 
asking them to support Bill S-15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A decision has to be made which, we believe, has a historical 
value with regard to parliamentary rules, that is, whether or not 
the bill is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, I am asking the Chair to give us a little 
more time, at least 24 hours, to come up with the arguments 
that could help it make an informed decision for both Houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I appreciate the comments made by the hon. member 
for Richmond—Arthabaska. I can tell the House that the 
admissibility of a bill is an issue that can always be addressed 
in the House. A member can challenge the admissibility of a bill 
at any time before third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government House leader is right to raise the issue 
at this time. I have already indicated to the official opposition 
House leader that I will hear more on this later on. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, based on your comments I would like to put on record 
some of our thoughts with respect to the point of order raised by 
the government House leader.  I am certainly prepared to provide 
serious input into the matter. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to participate in what I consider to be a very 
serious discussion on whether Bill S-15 is in order.  The 
government House leader has suggested that you, Mr. Speaker, 
should not allow Bill S-15 to proceed further because it is, in 
his view, and I assume the government's view, in all important 
aspects, a public tax measure.  As such, he has argued that it 
should not be allowed in the House because it originates in the 
Senate and is missing the required warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members who spoke before me have put forward some compelling 
arguments why first reading of Bill S-15 would be in order 
without a royal recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you will recall, and the government House leader 
referenced this in his remarks, that a similar debate arose in 
parliament on November 18, 1998, with respect to Bill S-13 which 
was the forerunner to Bill S-15.  At that time I suggested we 
were dealing with a grey area in terms of procedures and 
constitutional and legal issues around a bill of this nature 
coming from the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker Parent at that time ruled on the point of order on 
December 2, 1998 and stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that I must consider in relation to Bill S-13, that 
is whether or not the charge imposed by the bill is a tax, 
relates to the procedural rules and practices of this House as 
well as to the time honoured privilege of this House in respect 
of taxation measures. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker Parent went on to give a very lengthy elaboration of the 
issues involved and made a very definitive conclusion indicating 
that he believed the point of order was in line and would be 
accepted.  He said very clearly that he felt the bill included a 
tax measure that, because of its origins in the Senate and 
without royal recommendation, was not allowed for debate in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker Parent went on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am forced to conclude that the charge imposed by Bill S-13 is 
directed not toward any benefit to the tobacco industry but to a 
matter of public policy, that is, the health of young Canadians, 
a laudable purpose without doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, any bill imposing a tax must originate in the House 
of Commons and must be preceded by a ways and means motion. Since 
Bill S-13 proposes a tax, did not originate in the House of 
Commons and thus was not preceded by a ways and means motion, I 
therefore find that it is not properly before the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say this afternoon that since Speaker Parent's ruling 
and since the time that we discussed Bill S-13, or at least 
discussed whether or not it should be permitted for debate in the 
Chamber, the bill has been significantly redrafted.  There are 
some very significant changes to Bill S-13 as now outlined in 
Bill S-15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first change is that a detailed preamble has been added to 
the bill that sets out the facts that define the problem of youth 
smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second change is that an entirely new part has been added to 
the bill which lists the number of benefits to the tobacco 
industry.  The sponsor of the bill has indicated that one of the 
most important benefits is that the tobacco industry would be 
seen to be involved in an initiative dealing with the problem of 
smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would argue before you today that given those 
changes we are back to dealing with a grey area in our House 
procedures and that you are now faced with a very new challenge 
in ruling on this point of order. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to make the case that Bill S-15 ought to be pursued 
in the Chamber and that the House of Commons needs to debate the 
merits of this legislative initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I base this argumentation on several factors.  First, I believe 
that Bill S-15 is a serious attempt to address a critical problem 
in our society today, that being the high incidence of smoking, 
particularly among young people.  The sponsors of the bill have 
been vigilant in their pursuit of changes in this regard and in 
their attempts to provide a reasoned public policy response 
dealing with a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if your rulings were based simply on dogged 
determination then you would have no problem ruling on this one 
in a flash, but obviously such argumentation does not factor in. 
What is relevant though is whether Bill S-15 is in the public 
interest, whether or not it is a public bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-15, as has been said, seeks to create a public agency and 
proposes collecting dollars from rich tobacco companies to spend 
it on community measures which are supported by a host of public 
agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence of the bill being in the public interest has been 
brought forward to all of us in the House by the number of 
letters, faxes and phone calls that we have received from 
individuals and organizations in our own constituencies and from 
across Canada.  I have personally received dozens of letters and 
faxes from constituents and other Canadians in support of this 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that from a procedural point of view this 
initiative is necessarily a public bill.  If one were debating 
the merits of the bill, which obviously we are not doing today 
and not able to do according to the rules of the House, we would 
expect to hear concerns from members in my caucus about the 
perception that the bill caters to the needs of the tobacco 
industry.  We would also point to evidence that the bill is in 
the industry's interest based upon the amount of money and energy 
being spent by tobacco companies to support the legislation.  We 
would also talk about the campaigns against youth smoking being 
run by tobacco companies in the United States and Europe which 
are very similar to those that Bill S-15 proposes to fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of saying this is not to debate the merits of the bill 
but to highlight a question that you, Mr. Speaker, must address, 
and that is whether this is an industry bill that benefits the 
public or whether it is a public bill that benefits the industry 
itself.  Whether or not we like the changes in the bill, the fact 
is that you are left with the fundamental question about the 
nature of the bill.  As it has been changed from Bill S-13 to 
Bill S-15, it can now be argued that the financial implications 
of the bill constitute a levy and not a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that your task is to look at the 
very fundamental question of whether the bill is in the public 
interest.  Your task is to look at whether the bill is a public 
bill benefiting not only the industry but other broader 
objectives in our society today or whether it is an industry bill 
benefiting the citizens of the country and being done in the 
interest of good public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker Parent's ruling in December 1998 clearly stated that 
Bill S-13, at that time, was dealing with a public policy matter 
and that the money being generated through the provisions offered 
in the bill constituted a tax.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has now been fundamentally changed.  It is a bill that 
is much more clear about benefits to the tobacco industry.  We 
are talking more specifically about a levy as opposed to a tax. I 
think that is something you, Mr. Speaker, must seriously 
consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party certainly has major concerns about any attempt to 
cater to the tobacco industry and to support it in its efforts to 
win public support.  However, the real question at hand is 
whether or not this initiative should be debated in the House and 
on what basis should a bill from the Senate be allowed into this 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not point out in my argumentation 
that the government seems to want it both ways when it comes to 
using the Senate in terms of the whole legislative process.  As I 
said in November 1998, and I am now more firm in my beliefs than 
ever in this regard, it is curious that the government, in rising 
on this point of order, actually expressed concerns about the 
democratic right of the elected House of Commons versus the 
rights of the unelected Senate.  Certainly it is causing us some 
concern because we know that this is a government that has 
resurrected the undemocratic practice of routinely introducing 
government bills in the Senate before doing so in the House, 
something which the New Democratic Party has vigorously 
protested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are dealing with a new bill that has changed 
substantially from Bill S-13, the ruling by former Speaker Parent 
may no longer apply to the situation at hand and therefore you, 
Mr. Speaker, must revisit this situation and look for precedence 
in order to make a determination based on these new factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that we are again in a very grey area in terms 
of whether the bill is eligible for debate in the House.  On that 
basis and without quoting, I would refer you to some of the 
references I made in the House in November 1998.  I cited 
references in Erskine May, 21st edition, at page 716 and 
Beauchesne's at page 97, citation 324.  Further, I made reference 
to Bourinot's two principles outlined on page 491 and other 
citations which can be found in my speech at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be in the interest of the House and of all Canadians 
that we have a debate on the ideas being proposed in Bill S-15. 
We are all concerned about smoking and how our young people are 
being addicted to cigarettes at an early age.  We want to do 
everything in our power to correct that situation.  We need to 
look at the circumstances surrounding Bill S-15 and the history 
of tobacco legislation. We must consider the public interest and 
the health of children in these deliberations.  Mr. Speaker, I 
recommend this position to you.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to comment on Bill S-15, which is a redraft of Bill 
S-13 that was ruled out of order by your predecessor. Bill S-13 
was followed by Bill S-20, which was quite similar to Bill S-15 
but died on the order paper before the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-15 would incorporate a foundation that will be working 
at arm's length from the government, one that will be funded by 
money that will not come from the government and not go into the 
consolidated fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the face of it and under its terms, the bill is in the 
interest of the industry that is making the commitment to ensure 
that people who take up smoking are of legal age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third goal of this bill is to provide the foundation with 
$360 million to carry out its activities.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it a tax or is it a levy?  A tax bill originates only in the 
House of Commons and is preceded by a ways and means motion. Only 
a minister can move such a motion.  We agree with the House 
leader on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Levies, being much rarer, are recognized by the U.K., by 
Australia and by ourselves.  In Canada the levy must satisfy two 
conditions:  it must be imposed on the industry involved and it 
must serve a beneficial industry purpose.  In the British 
practice there is one additional condition, that is, the levy 
must not form part of the government revenue.  Bill S-15 not only 
meets the two Canadian conditions, that a levy is imposed on the 
industry and that it serves a beneficial purpose to the industry, 
but it even meets the third criteria, a U.K. one, that the 
revenues will not form part of the consolidated revenues of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many previous bills in our own history that have been 
adopted without a ways and means motion.  In the copyright 
amendment act of 1997, which your predecessor, Mr. Speaker, 
referred to in his judgment and which was a levy on blank tapes 
in favour of performers and recording artists, there was no ways 
and means motion and it was seen as a levy.  Again, in the Canada 
Shipping Act of 1987 there was no ways and means motion.  It was 
a levy against shipowners to deal with oil spills caused by 
tankers and other ships.  As well, in regard to the Canada 
Petroleum Resources Act in 1985 there was no ways and means 
motion.  There, owners would pay into an environmental studies 
research fund.  In the British house, Erskine May cites 13 
precedents of levies for industry purposes between 1917 and 1994 
that did not require ways and means resolutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous ruling said it could not be a levy for an industry 
purpose because it would reduce industries' future markets.  I 
refer to the House leader who said Bill S-15 is exactly the same 
as Bill S-13 except that a preamble has been added in part III. 
Surely that is a significant addition.  The preamble in part III 
is not that same as that in Bill S-13.  The preamble quite 
clearly sets out the facts defining the problem of youth smoking 
and the publicly stated objective of the tobacco industry to stop 
youth smoking because it is not in its favour to promote illegal 
smoking by people not entitled to do it.  There is an entirely 
new part added to Bill S-15, which lists the benefits to the 
tobacco industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a procedural question which we must decide.  We must 
decide whether the bill on its face it is a tax or a levy for 
industry purposes.  The bill expressly provides that the 
foundation is established for the industry and that the purpose 
of the bill is to meet the industry's objective.  Inquiring 
beyond the face of the bill and questioning its express 
provisions goes well beyond the realm of procedure and enters 
into the area of law.  I respectfully suggest that the Speaker is 
exceeding his proper jurisdiction if he addresses legal questions 
in the substance of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The coincidental fact that youth smoking reduction also happens 
to be a public policy objective in no way interferes with the 
procedural acceptability of the bill.  There is nothing in the 
precedents, Canadian or U.K., that prevents the basic industry 
purpose from coinciding with a public policy objective.  As a 
procedural matter, the Speaker's responsibility is limited to 
determining whether or not the bill meets the two criteria set in 
Canada for a levy as outlined by authorities such as Erskine May. 
I suggest that in arriving at this determination we should not go 
beyond the express provisions of the bill, leaving the substance 
of the bill for the House itself to decide.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all of the tobacco industry is in favour of the bill, but 
80% of it is, and the bill meets the criteria of a levy.  In the 
case of the copyright law where blank tapes were instituted 
through a levy that went to artists and recording artists, it was 
also opposed by a lot of the recording media associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minimum requirement in the criteria is that the levy must 
provide a benefit to an industry.  There are no provisions or 
precedents that beneficiaries must be one specified group or 
another.  The fund is not used to finance activities except 
activities that are strictly within the purview of the bill 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before now, there were flaws.  There was an objection as to 
where the funds would go if tomorrow the foundation ceased to 
exist.  Would they have to go back to the consolidated revenue 
fund?  So another clause, subclause 33(3), has been added, which 
states clearly that in the case of the foundation ceasing to 
exist the funds will be returned to the council for the tobacco 
industry, therefore the tobacco industry itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has also been the argument that if we produce the bill in 
the House of Commons then it would open the floodgates to such 
bills.  I would point out that since 1917 British practice has 
produced only 13 such bills involving levies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting when, in the first instance of Bill S-13, 
when Bill S-20 was crafted, Senator Kenny, who was the sponsor of 
the bill, asked me to consult with the authorities of the House. 
I went to see the clerk of the House, then Mr. Marleau.  Mr. 
Marleau referred me to the senior legal officer, Mr. Walsh.  Mr. 
Walsh commissioned through the funds of the House of Commons a 
legal opinion from Mr. Michael Clegg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal opinion from Mr. Michael Clegg is clear.  He says that 
in his opinion it is not a tax but a levy.  He also says that on 
the face of the bill and its express conditions we have to give 
the benefit of the doubt to the bill being a levy.  This opinion 
was confirmed by several experts:  Mr. David Gussow, a long 
serving procedural adviser to the House of Commons itself; Mr. 
Mark Siegel, a tax specialist counsel at Gowling in Ottawa; Mr. 
Joseph Magnet, a constitutional expert from the faculty of law of 
the University of Ottawa; and Mr. Raymond Du Plessis, Q.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to hear what Mr. Michael Clegg said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one of the basic canons of the construction of statutes 
that where there are clear and direct words in a statute, they 
should be interpreted literally unless they result in absurdity, 
illegality or impossibility. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the case here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where there are two possible approaches to the interpretation of 
a bill, it should be given the meaning that follows its literal 
and specific provisions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I submit that the argument here should not be the objective 
or part of the process or to surmise as to the moral or ethical 
reasons for the tobacco industry to set this up, but really it 
should be whether or not the bill institutes through its wording 
a levy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should explain my own position.  I am not a defender of the 
tobacco industry, very far from it.  My first act as environment 
minister of Quebec was to produce a bill for the protection of 
non-smokers.  It was the first such bill in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what I think we need here is the decision of a right to 
debate this bill here and not use some sort of obtuse procedural 
excuse not to debate it here.  Is a foundation created by an 
industry under suspicion because it carries out objectives that 
are completely different from those of the industry itself?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give the examples of the Rockefeller Foundation, which 
was built on big oil, or the Ford Foundation, which was built on 
car revenues.  These foundations create all kinds of programs 
that are beneficial to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen, for instance, if a big TV empire like Sony 
created a foundation separate from itself through levies, whereby 
it would provide education for banning TV addiction in young 
people?  Would that be illegal or unfounded?  It is perfectly 
acceptable that it would be so, that an industry could create a 
foundation that would serve a purpose which on the face of it 
might seem contradictory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done a lot of research on this issue.  Our research and 
the five or six legal opinions by leading experts show clearly 
that the bill represents a levy and not a tax, based on the 
wording of it.  This is what we must be seized with rather than 
the substance of it or the moral or ethical considerations of why 
the foundation is being created.  On the face of it we must 
accept this bill as debatable, as imposing a levy, and therefore 
not meeting the criteria for a ways and means motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put a lot of research into this.  I would like to offer 
this book to you, Mr. Speaker, if you wish to accept it, so that 
you can find out what our case is built upon.  I believe that 
upon reading it you will come to the conclusion that we are 
imposing a levy for an industry purpose and that the bill does 
not need a ways and means motion.  It should be debatable in the 
House.  I hope we can proceed to second reading stage and a 
debate in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, very 
briefly I will attempt to submit for your consideration a few 
thoughts in support of the admissibility of Bill S-15 and which 
would in essence answer two questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question is this:  is the bill a tax?  I submit to 
you, Mr. Speaker, that Bill S-15 does not require royal 
recommendation because it does not appropriate public money. Bill 
S-15 does not appropriate public funds, there is no authorization 
of any kind for the expenditure of money from the consolidated 
revenue fund, and all moneys are spent by the proposed 
foundation.  Moneys are raised through a levy imposed on the 
tobacco industry and, I understand, through gifts and grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the moneys are collected by the proposed foundation and 
placed in its own account and distributed by the foundation 
alone.  There is no government involvement in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, specific clauses of the bill expressly state that the 
foundation is not an agent of the government and that its funds 
are not public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, on dissolution any surplus of funds is returned to the 
tobacco industry as identified in subclause 33(3), as was 
indicated earlier by my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, even the annual audits of the foundation's accounts by 
the Auditor General of Canada must be paid for by the foundation 
itself.  The money does not come from the consolidated revenue 
funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question that arises in this debate is whether the 
bill is the same as Bill S-20.  As other colleagues have already 
identified, the answer is in the negative.  First, there is a 
comprehensive preamble that has been added to this bill.  Second, 
there is a refinement to the purpose clause, namely clause 3. 
Finally, there is the addition of part III, namely clause 34, 
which spells out the industry benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it is worth quoting the opinion expressed by Professor 
Magnet of the Law Faculty of the University of Ottawa, which has 
already been mentioned very briefly.  I will quote from his 
letter to Mark Audcent, the law clerk in the other chamber.  In a 
16 page long overview, he concluded: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the levy in the Draft Bill is not a tax in the 
constitutional sense; it is a regulatory charge adhesive to a 
regulatory scheme that provides benefits to the industry by 
ameliorating a problem that the industry caused, for which it is 
blamed by the public and which it wishes to address.  Because the 
levy, in my opinion, is a “regulatory charge” and not a “tax” 
in the constitutional sense, it is not subject to the discipline 
of sections 53 and 54 of the Constitution Act, 1867, as 
interpreted by the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the result, in my opinion, there is no constitutional 
impediment to the introduction of the Draft Bill to Parliament 
first in the Senate Chamber. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit these observations, Mr. Speaker, for your 
consideration, and I thank you for your attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We seem to be getting a bit repetitious in 
the arguments on this point, so I am prepared to hear a bit more. 
However, I urge hon. members who want to make interventions to 
deal with some new point that we have not heard raised in the 
submissions by others.  The Chair does not need to hear umpteen 
submissions on the same point. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I take good note of your comments to the effect that we 
should not repeat arguments that have already been presented in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am greatly comforted by the remarks of the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis and I fully support what he proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will simply touch very briefly on two issues. First, is this a 
tax or a levy? Dictionaries clearly define the word “tax” as “a 
contribution to the revenues of the government that is compulsory 
for taxpayers, goods or businesses”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The levy mentioned in Bill S-15 does not in any way contribute 
to government revenues. It comes from the tobacco industry and it 
is paid to the foundation without ever being part of the 
treasury, even if the foundation were to be disbanded. At that 
point, the balance would be transferred to the Canadian Tobacco 
Manufacturers Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point is whether or not this is a matter of law. Such 
issues usually come under the jurisdiction of the House of 
Commons. As we know, according to our tradition and rules, the 
Speaker of the House does not rule on constitutional or legal 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we listen to the debates on the point of order raised by the 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, we begin to see 
that this may be a legal issue. Therefore, I urge the Chair to 
simply look at the Canadian precedents on the issue of levies, at 
the two conditions that are proposed and see if this bill does 
meet these two criteria. If so, I call on the Chair to deem the 
bill in order, thus allowing the debate to continue in the House.

government House leader earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that he is looking for ways or mechanisms to weasel his 
way around routine proceedings.  He seems rather fond of that. He 
is looking to procedurally disable his own caucus members and 
their bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from the members for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine,

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that this was done without notice.  It is 
something that our opposition House leader mentioned and I think 
therefore merits 24 hours of notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I would like to add that the government House leader 
seems to enjoy following the rules when it is convenient for him. 
Yesterday he asked for unanimous consent and I denied it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  This is a procedural argument that we are 
hearing, not one on personalities or arguments about the conduct 
of members or the reasons why they raised the points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member has some point to make in respect of the 
admissibility of this bill, I would like to hear it.  In fact I 
will not hear questions regarding the conduct of other members 
from him on the point of order we are now discussing.  I want to 
hear about the admissibility of the bill.  If he has a point on 
that I will hear him.  Otherwise we will move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will just wrap up by 
saying that I think some of the government House leader's actions 
with regard to procedures over the last few days have called into 
question not only my judgment of his pronouncements on these 
things but also the judgment of his own fellow caucus members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have indicated that I will hear 
submissions from two other hon. members on this point tomorrow, 
that is, the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and 
the House leader of the official opposition.  That should 
conclude the submissions on the point.  The Chair will take the 
matter under advisement and get back to the House in due course.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and Secretary 
of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions 
of Quebec, Lib.)):</B> The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, 
formerly the Department of National Revenue, does not record the 
income tax data related to the Canada child tax benefits in ways 
that would provide the information requested. Presently, the 
agency does not have an automated system or mechanism that will 
track the number of changes made or their dollar value for 
specific adjustments such as the recognition of spousal income. 
This is only one of several reasons for an adjustment. Other 
reasons include the addition of a newborn child or custody change 
and advice that a child has left home. In order to identify the 
implications of any specific reason for change, it would be 
necessary to manually review the details for any change in the 
three million monthly payments to families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 38—<B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the agreement reached during the Uruguay round 
of international trade negotiations for a single tariff rate 
quota of 20,412 tonnes of cheese imports into Canada, tariff 
heading 0406, what are the reasons the government has allowed, 
through supplemental import licences since 1995, imports of dairy 
product, such as breaded cheese sticks and cheese waste, over and 
above the limits previously agreed upon? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Cheese sticks are produced by coating cheddar and/or 
mozzarella cheeses with either batter or bread crumbs. The 
overall finished product contains less than 50% dairy product and 
is primarily used in the food service industry served as 
appetizers or finger foods. For over 20 years Canada and the U.S. 
have had bilateral trade in this product. After the 1995 
implementation of the WTO agreement, Canada customs ruled that 
battered cheese sticks should be classified under the same tariff 
item as cheese and would therefore have been captured by the 
cheese tariff rate quota (TRQ). As these products had not 
previously been subject to the cheese quota, and as the U.S. 
continued to allow imports from Canada, Canada continued imports 
through the issuance of supplemental permits. Supplemental 
permits for imports of cheese sticks containing less than 50% 
cheese are issued on request. Without these permits a duty of 245% 
would apply. In October 1999, the U.S. customs service notified 
a Canadian exporter of breaded cheese sticks that the product was 
being reclassified and would be subject to the U.S. cheese quota. 
We have been pressing the United States to restore access for 
Canadian exports, given the longstanding reciprocal treatment for 
imports of this product. We have made it clear to the U.S. that 
its action has necessitated Canada reviewing its current policy 
of issuing supplemental permits for cheese sticks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Waste cheese is used in animal feed, mink feed. Cheese waste is 
an important ingredient as it is high in protein, which is 
required to produce top quality mink pelt. The product is low 
valued and not regularly available from domestic sources. All 
customs documentation for this product is labelled “Cheese scrap 
and mink feed” and not fit for human consumption. Sources of 
Canadian waste cheese for use in mink feed have not been located. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issuance of supplementary import permits for breaded cheese 
sticks and waste cheese does not undermine the control and 
enforcement of Canada's tariff rate quota for cheese imports. 
These supplementary imports represent approximately 0.5% of the 
cheese production in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise to debate Bill 
C-11 at the report stage.  Let me begin by complimenting the 
members of the committee for doing a great job during the public 
hearings.  We heard from over 150 witnesses.  We travelled from 
Vancouver to Montreal and received excellent presentations from a 
very broad spectrum of witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came back to the House and the committee met, we spent 
three long days going over the amendments.  I must say that it 
was an atmosphere of co-operation on all sides of the House. 
Government members as well as opposition members worked on 
this bill.  That is about the amount of positive input that I 
will make today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the good work of the committee through the hearing 
process is not reflected in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so unfortunate that House committees spend so much time 
and effort on the road at the expense of taxpayers and then find 
that other than a few cosmetic changes to the bill, the bill has 
basically remained intact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say at this point that these are the kinds of public 
responses that we received from the 150 plus witnesses who 
represented various organizations throughout the country. 
Witnesses stated that they felt the language of the bill placed 
undue emphasis on enforcement and criminality, as opposed to 
language that highlights the waffly nature of Canada's 
immigration and refugee program.  That is very true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony is in the amendment put forth in this first group of 
amendments.  The minister wants to amend clause 3 by replacing 
lines 1 to 7 with: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) to promote international justice and security by fostering 
respect for human rights and by denying access to Canadian 
territory to persons who are criminals or security risks; and

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly agree with that.  In fact we know that is what 
needs to be done.  The minister could do the same thing without 
the legislation.  She could do it by putting more people in the 
field and putting in a good front end screening vehicle so that 
we keep out criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister always talks about closing the back door.  Maybe 
the government needs to close the front door a little so that we 
let in people who we think will become positive contributors to 
the country.  The irony is that the system creates its own 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good time to reflect on the Sklarzyk case that 
happened during the past couple of weeks.  The Sklarzyk family 
had its visitor visa extended three times.  That makes absolutely 
no sense.  If Canada did not want the family here in the first 
place back in 1994, it makes sense that the family should have 
been told to leave and go home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government extend the visa?  At that time two of the 
children had been born in Poland.  By extending the visitor visa 
three times the government was extending a sign of welcome.  It 
makes absolutely no sense.  The government creates a lot of these 
problems.  After the family had two children here and had been 
here from 1994 to 2001, close to seven years, the government 
asked the family to leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the public hearings we have heard many witnesses say 
they were stateless.  In other words, they had no status.  Some 
have been in Canada upwards of 10 to 15 years.  They came here as 
refugees.  They have had children here.  Their children are in 
school and they still have no status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the points raised continuously throughout the hearings 
was the whole issue of permanent residence.  People who have 
permanent resident status are referred to in the bill as foreign 
nationals. Many witnesses who came before the committee were 
offended by that approach.  It is unwelcoming and un-Canadian. We 
should not be doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House what the changes were to the definition 
section.  Under interpretation a foreign national will be changed 
to mean: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a person who is not a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident, 
and includes a stateless person. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony is that throughout the bill permanent resident and 
foreign national are printed side by side.  This is worse than 
leaving it the way it was.  I cannot understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One amendment that members of the opposition all agreed with was 
that changes needed to be made and in a positive manner.  They 
should be made in a manner that deals with different classes.  A 
member on the government bench indicated that if a person lands 
in Canada we should perhaps give him or her landed status as in 
the old days.  However that has not happened in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern raised was the whole issue that this was 
framework legislation.  As framework legislation much of the 
authority to carry out immigration and refugee objectives would 
be found in the regulations.  The regulations would therefore be 
substantial and would contain much of the detail regarding 
implementation of the act.  Many witnesses supported the idea of 
all new regulations being reviewed by the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even government members agreed.  They agreed that the 
regulations should come before the standing committee and be 
reviewed.  I compliment the chairman of the committee for the 
good work he did throughout the hearing process. 
He stated that the committee should be scrutinizing the 
regulations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we see in the new bill?  We see nothing, absolutely 
nothing in terms of the amendments.  I think many members of the 
opposition were led down the garden path with the clause by 
clause exercise we went through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten minutes does not give anyone a lot of time to deal with the 
complexity of the bill.  I will close by again noting that a 
number of witnesses suggested creating and including in the bill 
a mechanism whereby members of the general public could submit 
complaints about any aspect of the new legislation.  Several 
witnesses suggested creating an ombudsman to organize and 
centralize submissions and report regularly to CIC and to 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did that very task.  The Canadian Alliance put together an 
amendment to allow the minister to create an ombudsman vehicle 
for people with complaints.  We need oversight for the department 
and I look forward to speaking to the second group of amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise at report stage of Bill C-11.  I will 
begin by complimenting all members of the committee who undertook 
some very hard work in a very short period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time Canada had a good look at the Immigration Act was 
in 1978.  The committee acted in a very co-operative manner, as 
critics from the Alliance and all the other parties have 
suggested.  As we travelled we were impressed by the commitment 
of Canadians to immigration.  They spoke in glowing terms about 
the value of immigration to the country in terms of its history 
and how it has contributed to our social, economic and cultural 
well-being.  They spoke about how Canada had been built by 
immigration from all parts of the world and how much that 
immigration had been appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 and its predecessor Bill C-31 would build upon our 
great tradition of inviting people from all over the world and 
continue our great historical tradition of being one of four 
countries in the world that recognizes its responsibility to 
protect refugees, people who are persecuted or displaced, people 
who find difficulties where they live and resort to all kinds of 
unusual methods to leave their homelands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this great country has been home to thousands of 
refugees is a tribute to the generosity of all Canadians in each 
and every region of the country.  When we travelled that is 
exactly what we heard from witnesses.  They told us how we could 
improve Bill C-11.  They told us that our present Immigration Act 
was a great foundation but that we needed to move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 would do that.  It would open the front doors even 
wider.  It would make it possible for families to be reunified 
because it would expand the definition of family class to 
mothers, fathers, parents and grandparents who would be able to 
be sponsored.  It even talks about working with our partners, not 
only the provinces but stakeholders, municipalities, all the 
communities that have a part to play in welcoming immigrants and 
helping them resettle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout our trip from Vancouver through to Montreal, and 
speaking also to the people in Atlantic Canada, I heard one 
constant message:  We need more immigration.  We need to make 
sure the front doors are opened wider in terms of the family 
reunification independent class to attract the best skilled 
people and professionals from around the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a great need for people who can help build our economy, 
meet the needs of our businesses and meet our labour 
requirements. Most people indicated that we need more 
immigration, not less, and that we ought to do more in terms of 
the compassionate part of the bill, which is refugee protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments introduced by the opposition and the government 
at the committee level have improved Bill C-11.  We can recognize 
the great worth of immigration and make sure permanent residents 
who want to be Canadian citizens are further protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all heard a term that was rather un-Canadian.  Everyone who 
was not a citizen would be referred to as a foreign national.  We 
heard loud and clear that this was not how we wanted to define 
ourselves.  We have amended the bill to recognize the status of 
landed immigrants and permanent residents who we hope will want 
to be citizens.  Everyone else who comes to our country on a 
temporary basis, be they visitors or students, would be referred 
to as foreign nationals because it is a term that is recognized 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also give landed class opportunities to students 
or temporary workers who come to Canada and decide to stay.  The 
process must be improved so we can process the paperwork better, 
more efficiently and more fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope the committee will talk about resettlement and resources 
that we give to our foreign posts.  The committee heard loud and 
clear from people across the country that they want to be 
involved and they want the committee and parliament to be 
involved in the regulatory aspects of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 from the minister says that one of the bill's goals 
and objectives is to acknowledge that people, when they come to 
Canada with great professional attributes, be they doctors, 
nurses or skilled workers, should have their accreditations 
quickly recognized.  Even though accreditation is a provincial 
jurisdiction, we must work closely with provincial governments, 
stakeholders, organizations, regulatory bodies and associations 
to make sure that people who come to our country can achieve 
their full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to work with our partners to make sure we do a better 
job.  Motion No. 1 would ensure that people's professions and 
careers are recognized and that they will be able to work in 
their professions in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 from the member for Laval Centre and Motion No. 3 
in terms of regulations were well received.  For the first time 
our committee will be very involved in the making of regulations. 
We will be able to hold public hearings before regulations are 
put in place because we understand that the regulations will 
determine how we implement the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is framework legislation.  It talks about values and 
principles but the regulatory framework is perhaps the most 
difficult and challenging.  We must be very vigilant in 
reassuring the hundreds of witnesses, who talked to us about the 
regulations, that the regulations will be set up in a fair, 
equitable and compassionate manner.  The committee will be 
involved in the fall with the make-up of those regulations.  It 
will invite members of the public to again look at the 
regulations and it will put in place a process to ensure the 
regulations are fair and equitable to all people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, in its final form as we debate it today, with the 
amendments the government and members of the opposition have put 
forward, has been greatly improved.  We wanted to make sure that 
people who, for one reason or another, were denied a refugee 
claim but whose circumstances had changed or who could not 
disclose the true reason they were being persecuted, could 
receive a second hearing.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have built into the bill another layer where a second hearing 
could take place to ensure that a person who was perhaps denied 
protection or had been denied a refugee claim but could not put 
forward all the reasons could essentially come back for a review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would provide greater assurances in terms of permanent 
resident status.  As we know, the old act says that if people 
leave the country for 180 days they could lose their permanent 
resident status.  The bill now says that permanent residents do 
not have to worry if their jobs or families take them out of the 
country or that they have to be in Canada two years out of five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand the global economy and that people have to travel. 
Sometimes people have to leave Canada but at the same time they 
have not given up on Canada.  Their families and businesses are 
here.  We must understand that in a global economy people have to 
be mobile.  That is why we would protect permanent residents by 
assuring them that if they are outside Canada they do not have to 
worry about losing their permanent resident status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has put forward a number of positive amendments 
in the bill.  I look forward to debate on the other amendments 
members will put forward, but there is a good reason we cannot 
support them.  In fact we believe we have taken them into 
consideration under Bill C-11.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
for the benefit of television viewers and perhaps of members in 
the House, I would just like to briefly recap how the minister 
introduced Bill C-11 in February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister said at that time was that Bill C-11 was a 
bill that could be described as tough. Its purpose was, of 
course, to open the door wide to the hundreds of thousands of 
people who want to come here and whom we need if Canada and 
Quebec are to continue to make progress. However, the government 
also wanted that door to be tightly closed to people unacceptable 
to our societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I can say is that the great majority of the witnesses we 
heard were in agreement with the minister.  The bill is extremely 
tough.  In fact they are concerned.  People are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee, we considered the bill clause by clause.  There 
were hundreds of amendments presented by the opposition parties 
or by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must agree with my colleague for London North Centre that 
there have been improvements.  I acknowledge that.  They are not 
enough, however.  They are very much insufficient, and this bill 
continues to be an object of concern.  It is perhaps the fashion, 
however, in this Liberal government, to take a hard line.  Last 
night, for instance, the bill we voted on in third reading, Bill 
C-7, was another fine example of this hard line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first group there are four amendments, two presented by 
the government, which I can assume will be passed with great 
unanimity. Two others are presented by the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment by the party in power, which I shall read 
for the benefit of our audience, is really within the framework 
of what this bill is about.  The amendment proposed by the 
minister at clause 3(1)(<I>i</I>) is to promote international justice, 
and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and security by fostering respect for human rights and by 
denying access to Canadian territory to persons who are criminals 
or security risks; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Understandably, no one can be opposed to such an addition, and 
this focuses on the importance Canada attaches to human rights. 
We can only hope that the proof of this will be forthcoming in 
future years, and that there will not be any slip-ups as far as 
the respect of human rights is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the second part of the Liberal amendment is really about is 
replacing the word néoquébécois, which is not anywhere in the 
bill, with the term permanent resident. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1635

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment, this one brought forward by the Bloc, is 
much more important. My colleague from London North Centre 
mentioned that under this bill the minister will have to table 
the regulation in the House and refer it to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the witnesses we heard were concerned about the fact that 
much of the enforcement measures will be dealt with in the 
regulation. The legislation itself is rather vague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the bill as amended in committee, under clause 5 
that stipulates that the regulation will be laid before the House 
and then referred to the appropriate committee, we have noticed 
that a small provision, clause 5(4), was tacked on, which reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>5.(4) The Governor in Council may make the regulation at any 
time after the proposed regulation has been laid before each 
House of Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the governor in council would be able to make the 
regulation as soon as it is tabled. In some ways, this provision 
undermines that amendment agreed upon in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want is for clause 5(4) to be completely deleted. Since 
the previous speaker referred to this amendment, I do hope that 
the government will understand that clause 5(4) needs to be 
deleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third amendment is also from the Bloc Quebecois. I may still 
be naive and somehow that makes me proud, but I truly believe 
that we will have the unanimous consent of the House on this one, 
because all it does is add the words a protected person. 
Clause 19, which this amendment deals with, refers to the right 
to enter and remain in Canada. The current provision only 
mentions the right of entry of permanent residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are proposing is that the officer allow a permanent 
resident or a protected person to enter Canada, a protected 
person being someone who has refugee status, if satisfied 
following an examination on their entry that they have that 
status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be noted that in committee the minister clearly 
indicated that obtaining refugee status could indeed be 
considered as a travel document. Therefore we think this 
amendment must be passed by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the last amendment in this first group is from the 
government. It is rather interesting, because it is of a cosmetic 
nature. We have before us a most important bill that affects 
people and families, that will have an impact of the future of 
tens of thousands of people, and the government is bringing 
forward a cosmetic amendment. It is replacing the word travail by 
the word emploi in the French version. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that I have gone over the four amendments, I will continue 
to speak about this bill, which is aimed at dispelling certain 
theories that we hear out there, particularly in western Canada. 
What we hear is that Canada has really become a haven for people 
who have something to fear from the justice system, very often 
for good reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perfectly understandable that a country such as Canada 
would not want to have such a reputation. However, this has 
nothing to do with reality. Recently, we had the Amodeo case. 
Clearly, he should never have entered the country, but he did.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, does a single case become a majority?  No, there are a 
few cases, as there are everywhere.  We have to realize that 
people in organized crime and professional terrorists are highly 
intelligent and very capable and that the best organized law will 
probably never keep them out entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dangerous part in this bill arises from our desire for an 
impenetrable border, which means we risk rejecting honest people 
who want to contribute to Canada's economic and social growth. In 
this regard, for Canada to do without this essential support, 
which is a bit like oxygen, is a very poor choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, at the moment hundreds of thousands of 
people are awaiting approval.  Will they or will they not be able 
to come to Canada?  Four hundred thousand people is a lot. We 
know the minister puts the figure at 300,000 a year.  We never 
reach it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of the bill is to perhaps improve the record management 
process, and we support this goal, because everyone here, especially 
members from large cities, knows that we have an incredible 
number of people waiting months and years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  It is my duty pursuant 
to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester, Health; the hon. member 
for St. John's West, Finance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on report 
stage of Bill C-11 and to put on record our continuing deep 
concerns with the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before proceeding I want to indicate how positive the process 
was at the committee level.  It is not often that we have reason 
to make positive comments about the standing committee process in 
the House of Commons.  However, in the case of the Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, the chair, the member 
for London North Centre, provided very good leadership.  The 
participation of all members from all parties on the committee 
was productive and respectful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put on record our thanks for all the work done by the 
staff tied to the committee and for the help we received from the 
research staff of the Library of Parliament and from the drafters 
in the legislative counsel office who provided us with remarkable 
turnaround on our proposed amendments.  I also want to put on 
record my thanks to two individuals in the legislative office of 
the House who did an incredible job of writing and drafting some 
80 amendments in a very short period of time for myself and my 
colleagues in the New Democratic Party.  Those two individuals 
are Amadou John and Susan Manion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were operating close to the wire.  We were under considerable 
pressure to move quickly after the public hearings.  We had very 
little time to craft our amendments and to have them drafted 
properly.  Again I thank the two individuals I have mentioned and 
many others.  We were able to ensure that thorough consideration 
of the bill was executed and that many amendments were proposed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a pleasure working with colleagues from other political 
parties such as the chair, the member for London Centre and the 
member from Mississauga.  I also want to mention the member for 
Dauphin—Swan River, the member for Laval Centre and the member 
for Fundy—Royal.  We worked hard and covered a lot of material 
in a short period of time.  One of our greatest regrets was that 
the bill was pushed rapidly through the process, and we did not 
have adequate time to deal with the significant topics at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too want to thank the 150 or more witnesses who gave serious 
and thoughtful testimony before the committee regarding the bill. 
We had a remarkable committee process covering many parts of the 
country.  It was an enlightening experience for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, given these niceties and having congratulated and 
thanked members for a productive process, we failed in making a 
bad bill into a good law.  We all say that we failed in improving 
a piece of legislation that was seriously flawed and was far from 
visionary.  It is far from the kind of bill we thought was 
necessary after the 25 year period since the bill was first 
introduced and passed in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried hard to convince the government to improve the bill. It 
was not for lack of trying.  In the case of the New Democratic 
Party, we proposed over 80 amendments.  However most of them were 
defeated by the Liberals at committee.  I am grateful for the few 
that were accepted.  However the amendments which were approved 
at committee were relatively minor in nature.  Our concerns about 
the bill remain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put on the record the concerns of Canadians.  In 
reviewing the evidence presented to us at committee and the 
testimony of the 150 or more individuals and organizations, there 
was very little support for the bill.  Canadians who spoke out on 
Bill C-11 were very upset, disturbed and angry that the 
government failed to use this golden opportunity to put forward a 
bill on immigration and refugee policy that was visionary, 
progressive, inclusive and clearly a benefit to Canadians who 
wanted and believed in maintaining our traditions for an open 
immigration policy and always operating on the basis of 
humanitarian, compassionate grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has always been the vision of members of my caucus that we 
maintain as much as possible an open immigration policy, that we 
be respectful and responsive to the needs of refugees and 
displaced persons around the world, that we always, at all costs, 
ensure due process and that human rights are respected and 
adhered to.  On all those grounds we failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not meet the task at hand.  The amendments before 
us today go a little further toward improving the bill.  We will 
support them, but we have not dealt with the fundamental flaws of 
the legislation.  We hoped Bill C-11 would dramatically improve 
our immigration and refugee policy and programs, which are under 
serious scrutiny and evoke great concern on the part of 
Canadians. 
This has placed us in some disrepute internationally because of 
our failure to abide, in full force, by the international 
conventions to which Canada is a signatory.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We analyzed the bill from the point of view of several 
perspectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, was it true to Canada's traditions and set of values 
around openness to immigrants and refugees from around the world? 
Did it fulfil our commitment to celebrating, respecting and 
enhancing the multicultural diversity of this land?  That was the 
first criteria we brought to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second was the issue that was raised by my other colleagues 
this afternoon already and that was:  Did the bill, the new law, 
which we would have for many years to come, ensure that the 
authority rested in this place and that true democratic process 
was followed and adhered to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third criteria we brought to the bill was the belief that no 
bill could be entrenched into law that maintained any kind of 
bias, whether we were talking about gender, race or undue 
emphasis on wealth and economic position in society.  If so, that 
bill would have to be changed to reflect those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to end on the three points I raised as priorities, which 
were: progressive immigration policy, along with of course an 
open humanitarian approach to refugees; legislative authority in 
this place with democratic process and adherence to human rights 
and civil liberties; and the eradication of any bias within the 
law itself.  Those were our objectives and we failed miserably. 
The government failed Canadians by not ensuring that we went 
forward with a bill that had addressed all those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to continuing the debate and trying to improve 
the bill with the time remaining. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to have the opportunity, especially at this point in 
time, to speak to Bill C-11 at report stage. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have concerns with respect to the legislation which we are 
discussing at report stage.  The Liberal Party of Canada has had 
a very strong reputation with respect to new Canadians throughout 
its history.  After all, this is the party of Wilfrid Laurier, 
Mike Pearson and indeed Pierre Trudeau.  From what we saw at 
committee for the most part, the irony was the Liberal Party of 
Canada was most reticent to support the rights of permanent 
residents and immigrants and moreover, the human responsibility 
with respect to refugee protection.  As we go through report 
stage we will flesh out a couple of those issues on which clearly 
we should have spent more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to compliment the hon. member for London North Centre. He 
was very welcoming and collaborated in putting our debate 
together.  The two immigration critics for the Canadian Alliance, 
who represent ridings in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, provided 
first class representation.  I saw that across the board with the 
Bloc and very much with the NDP.  We had an opportunity to have a 
very pioneering piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is this the bill falls short of that particular 
mark.  These days the government of this multicultural, 
multilingual land built on immigration sounds disappointingly 
less welcoming than it should. 
The minister of immigration's proposed reform of the 25 year 
immigration act, Bill C-11, falls far short of the standards 
which Canada should use in treating immigrants and refugees to 
this country.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Progressive Conservative opposition critic on the immigration 
committee, I sat and listened to the testimony of over 150 
witnesses and groups.  They almost all repeated the very same 
serious concerns.  They were concerned that parts of the bill 
were draconian and even un-Canadian.  Even Liberal members on 
occasion referred to the bill as being un-Liberal.  That was the 
result of the testimony which we heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a myriad of caring Canadians, who embraced human 
diversity and human rights, say that this bill missed the mark to 
protect refugees to the degree that we should.  I would like to 
add quite clearly and succinctly that refugee rights are in 
fact human rights.  Our inability to protect refugees in need, 
and by perhaps not having the appropriate checks of due process 
in place, can result in the torture, injury and even death of 
individuals.  That is why due process is a fundamental aspect of 
our judicial system.  That is why due process is something we 
believe this particular piece of legislation is short on.  I will 
have more to say as we proceed toward the next days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to the particular motions in play that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first motion, Motion No. 1, by the government is somewhat 
technical and replaces lines 1 to 7 on page 3 of the bill.  The 
original legislation stated “to promote international justice, 
respect for human rights and security”.  The government is 
advocating a reversal of that.  It is saying that we would, in 
co-operation with the provinces and territories, and of course we 
would agree with that part of it, secure better recognition of 
foreign credentials of new Canadians to make their integration 
more accessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the first motion, by reversing the language, speaks 
to the potential security risks as opposed to the well-being and 
the good fortune the country has with respect to immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second motion, proposed by the Bloc, refers to lines 1 to 4 
on page 5, clause 5.  The motion calls for the Government of 
Canada, parliamentarians and particularly the immigration 
committee to have far more input and a much larger opportunity to 
participate with respect to reviewing the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may be aware that this piece of legislation is framework 
legislation.  This means that it is not necessarily what is in 
the act that governs the bill, it is the regulations themselves. 
If these issues were done order in council and not scrutinized by 
the committee, the role of parliament would be usurped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the chair, and the immigration minister who is doing 
something that is quite uncommon.  She is willing to provide the 
regulations to the committee for scrutiny before they are 
implemented and published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>.  That is 
not very common.  I must give proper credit to her for what I 
consider a very progressive, yet conservative initiative. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to Motion No. 3 which is also a Bloc 
motion.  It is an amendment to clause 19 on page 11, at line 11, 
which is the right of entry of permanent residents.  This 
initiative actually dovetails with an amendment passed at 
committee which was introduced by the Progressive Conservative 
Party.  I want to thank all members of the committee who 
supported that initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially it would provide a status document to all permanent 
residents.  Once they obtain that particular position it would 
ensure that they could travel, work and make a valuable 
contribution, and their children could go to school in certain 
circumstances.  As we know, there are a number of individuals who 
are sometimes caught in limbo and do not have the capacity to 
work or to educate their children and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc motion refers to the right of entry for refugees in 
addition to permanent residents so that they would have a status 
card, a travel card so that they could actually have the capacity 
to re-enter Canada.  This recognizes that in this global world 
people do travel.  Those people are protected.  Those refugees 
clearly need to be able to get on with their lives after they 
have escaped persecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth motion is quite simple.  It is a technical amendment 
on an issue related to translation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording must be consistent in both official languages, which 
is why the Progressive Conservative Party is in favour of this 
amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House for the opportunity to participate in debate 
on Group No. 1.  There are two more groups to go.  We look 
forward to the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for the opportunity to put my comments on the record at 
this stage, as other members have done.  I think I am the longest 
serving member of the citizenship and immigration committee and I 
must say that I have seen quite a change in the function of that 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is another issue that causes such ranges of 
emotion and passion to come out, not only from Canadians who come 
before the committee but from members of parliament on all sides. 
I say that not having sat on the justice committee, which might 
be equally interesting and entertaining at times, or on the 
health committee in regard to certain issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigration is such a passionate issue for all of us because at 
the end of the day we are all immigrants or sons and daughters of 
immigrants or, at the very least, grandsons and granddaughters of 
immigrants.  That is what this nation is built upon.  The very 
foundation of this country is that over the years, regardless of 
who is in office, we try to develop policies that will allow for 
resettlement of people from other parts of the world.  Whether it 
is the people who came here in the fifties, who could be called 
economic refugees in some instances, or the people who are coming 
here now from places in Africa or China who are modern day 
refugees, they are coming here looking for new opportunities and 
new hope.  In my view, hope is probably the number one issue in 
citizenship and immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because I have seen such a change in the committee 
from the first year I was on that committee four years ago.  It 
was incredibly partisan.  We could not have a debate on any issue 
without shouting, frankly, even in committee.  Often it happens 
in here and we know this is a little mini theatre from time to 
time, but it should not and often does not happen at the 
committee level.  That is where MPs roll up their sleeves and get 
to work trying to work out the best solution for all Canadians. 
In my view the committee was dysfunctional at best in the first 
year.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to be unfair or unkind, but I have seen a terrific 
change that I think is due partly to some changes in 
personalities and getting away from the clashes.  Also, we have 
grown together as a committee to understand the importance of 
immigration to Canadians and to understand that partisanship, in 
the case of immigration, should be put on the back burner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I extend congratulations.  I tremendously enjoyed working with 
members opposite.  The member for Fundy—Royal was great fun to 
work with and insightful.  He put forward suggestions, a couple 
we might have adopted and many we did not, but he understands the 
process.  The member for Winnipeg—North Centre, representing the 
New Democrats, did a tremendous job in representing her caucus 
and in putting forward arguments that of course many of us did 
not agree with, but that is the democratic way and the process. 
We had an opportunity to debate back and forth as to why we did 
not agree.  Those members, with the member for Laval Centre, the 
member for Dauphin—Swan River and the member for Blackstrap, who 
was at most of the meetings I was at, all made contributions that 
are extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those contributions are particularly important today because we 
are functioning in a political atmosphere that is in danger of 
becoming dysfunctional.  What do we read in the newspaper every 
day?  It is either something an MP said on this side of the House 
about someone, or a battle with internal caucus fights on the 
other side of the House, or something that someone did wrong.  It 
is just not stuff, frankly, that should be of consequence or 
important to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what is important to Canadians:  amending the 
immigration bill and changing the system.  I know that members 
opposite get tired of hearing the catchphrase about closing the 
back door to open the front door, but that truly is what the 
minister wants to do.  It truly is what we on this side of the 
House want to do, and I believe members opposite want to 
accomplish the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we get there?  We will arrive at this through a process. 
I unfortunately was unable to travel with the committee as there 
was a death in my family and I had to attend a funeral in 
England, but I did read the briefs.  I certainly listened to many 
people who appeared before us here in Ottawa.  As a person who 
has been on the committee for four years, I like to think I have 
some familiarity with the issues of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the committee travelled in good faith across the land 
and met with people, but it did not have the luxury—and this is 
perhaps one of the downfalls of committee travel—of taking with 
it senior citizenship and immigration staff, the deputies and the 
lawyers, to respond to the issues put forward, whether they were 
from the Law Society or an immigration consultants association or 
just a Canadian concerned about immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all seemed like a great idea at the time.  It sounded fair 
and reasonable, but when we finally got into the clause by clause 
back here in Ottawa, in which I had the pleasure of 
participating, we got the answers to the questions that were put 
forward and realized that while it might have seemed like a good 
idea it posed some problems and difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that we did not listen to Canadians at all.  The 
member for Winnipeg North Centre says we have failed.  I 
appreciate her perspective as a member of the opposition, but I 
strongly disagree with that statement.  In fact I think we have 
succeeded beyond what I thought we might be able to accomplish in 
terms of making changes and amendments to an incredibly important 
act that affects every one of us and every one of our 
constituents.  At the same time, we built some goodwill among 
members of all parties, even with me on the committee, so there 
is something to be said for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address a couple of issues on which we spent an almost 
inordinate amount of time.  One of them was the issue of foreign 
nationals. 
People from across the country who came before us in Ottawa said 
they did not like to be referred to as foreign nationals but as 
landed immigrants.  If were to go to the ceremony at Pier 21 in 
Halifax or to Pearson airport in my community of Mississauga, we 
would meet people who have applied, who have sweated, who have 
gone through the proper process.  They have not come in the back 
door.  They have applied to become landed immigrants.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look across the floor right now and I suspect there are people 
sitting there, including you, Madam Speaker, who took that step 
of becoming a landed immigrant before applying for Canadian 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People said they or their parents or grandparents were landed 
immigrants, not foreign nationals.  It was almost an affront; 
people were offended to be referred to as foreign nationals and 
the government agreed with that.  I certainly agreed with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about in terms of definition might seem 
inconsequential and a small point, but philosophically it says to 
people who live in this country as permanent residents, which is 
exactly the same thing as a landed immigrant, that we recognize 
that landed immigrants are permanent residents.  It is such an 
important thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign nationals are referred to in the bill.  If we are 
talking about refugees or illegal migrants who we are dealing 
with through a detention system or something of that nature, then 
we have to use that terminology because it is used 
internationally when dealing with other people around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I have run out of time, but I just want to close on this 
section by saying that one of the major differences in themes in 
this bill, which we dealt with and disagreed with, is in regard 
to dealing with people who are permanent residents, who have been 
convicted of a crime punishable by 10 years and who actually 
served 2 years in jail, the 10 and 2 rule.  We dealt with whether 
or not we should have the authority to deport those people 
without giving them a myriad of opportunities to appeal all the 
way up to the supreme court.  It is a reputation that Canada has 
to change.  This bill would change it.  If a person lives in this 
country as a permanent resident and commits a crime serious 
enough that the person goes to jail for two years, then the 
government would have the opportunity to deport that person 
without that person abusing the legal system.  It is one of the 
key issues in this section of the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central 
to participate in the report stage debate on Bill C-11, an act 
respecting immigration to Canada and the granting of refugee 
protection to persons who are displaced, persecuted or in danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin I would like to thank the 150 witnesses, a broad 
spectrum, who appeared before the committee.  They have given us 
insights into the practical life of dealing with immigrants and 
into the various angles or perspectives from which they looked at 
the immigration process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to extend my thanks to the members, the staff 
and the researchers of the committee.  Appreciation is also due 
to the chair of the committee, who has been very fair so far.  I 
guess he would have been more fair if he had accepted all 30 
amendments put forward by the official opposition, but I 
appreciate the work done by all the members as well as the 
co-operation that existed.  The process was very productive and 
positive and really it was fun to work with the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am really disappointed that the output is not 
proportional to the input in the committee.  Everyone worked 
hard, but the outcome could have been much better.  I am a little 
disappointed with the efficiency ratio of output versus input in 
the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are on thanks, I would also like to thank the chief 
critic for the official opposition of Canada, the hon. member for 
Dauphin—Swan River, who really worked very hard on the 
committee.  He put forward over 30 amendments.  All those 
amendments were to the point.  They were very serious and 
non-partisan amendments and I regret that most of them were not 
accepted by this weak Liberal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill has much needed changes with respect to 
immigration to Canada, which I acknowledge, it also has serious 
flaws.  I will be talking about those flaws at third reading of 
the bill if I get the opportunity.  For the time being I will say 
that while the legislation may be well intended its outcome may 
not serve its stated purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigration to Canada should be simple.  It is a matter of 
common sense.  Either the criteria to enter met or are not. 
When legislators are working hard on the bill they need to use 
common sense and put various aspects of the bill in perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of clarity, prudence and real enforcement behind the 
legislation will ultimately cause more trouble than the 
legislation it purports to replace.  Bill C-11 will not deliver 
what it intends to deliver without proper accountability and 
management in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has been talking about front door and back door 
scenarios.  Let me remind the House, although I am sure members 
who have been here for a long time will remember, that when I was 
first elected in 1997 I gave an analogy in my first speech on 
immigration that the immigration system in Canada was just like a 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a person knocks on the door or rings the doorbell the owner 
of the house has the opportunity to open the door and invite or 
welcome the person into the home.  Sometimes the person is 
offered tea or coffee, a conversation may take place, and he or 
she becomes a guest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, it is surprising if the homeowner wakes up one 
morning and finds a stranger sitting on the couch in the living 
room having a cup of coffee.  Perhaps the stranger discovered 
that the back door was opened, entered the house while the owner 
was asleep and sat on the couch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that with respect to our immigration process 
we have to open our front door so that legitimate immigrants 
similar to the ones who built the country can enter Canada 
through the front door and be productive.  We should welcome 
them.  We should also welcome legitimate refugees who come to 
Canada through the front door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we must close the back door because we do not 
know who is entering through it.  It could be a criminal, a bogus 
refugee, or anyone who is not wanted in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my speech in 1997 I urged the then immigration minister to 
open the front door and monitor them but to close the back door 
and plug the loopholes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister borrowed my analogy and repeatedly made references 
to the front door and the back door.  However she installed a 
revolving door between the front and back doors and prospective 
immigrants are caught in it for a long time because the system is 
plugged.  The plumbing system in the immigration system is 
comparatively clogged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many instances of appeal after appeal, just like 
someone peeling an onion one layer at a time.  Sometimes people 
are caught in the system for eight, nine or ten years.  I have 
given a list of 40 of my constituents to the minister who have 
been caught in that revolving door for 10 years or so.  I am a 
little disappointed.  To use my analogy, the minister should 
eliminate the revolving door, close the back door and open the 
front door.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four motions in this grouping.  I will deal with 
Motion No. 4 first.  It is an amendment to the French version. It 
is technical in nature.  It is a housekeeping type of amendment. 
I do not have any problem supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 in the name of the hon. member for Laval Centre 
deals with the right of entry of a permanent resident and reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-11, in clause 19, be amended by replacing line 11 on 
page 11 with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“resident or a protected person to enter Canada if satisfied 
following” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her amendment the words protected person and resident are 
added.  Those who are under Canadian protection are refugees. 
They should be afforded the full extent of our protection.  It 
should not be limited to those with status only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When talking about refugees, Bill C-11 is a direct attack on 
legitimate refugees.  We support and reaffirm our policy of 
taking in our share of genuine refugees but subclause 3(2)(d) 
states that Canada is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to offer safe haven to persons with a well-founded fear of 
persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political 
opinion or membership in a particular social group, as well as 
those at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or 
punishment; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This translates into meaning that every criminal or otherwise 
undesirable person entering Canada who claims to be a refugee 
would be under Canadian protection from extradition to another 
country if there is reason to believe they would be under a 
threat of harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 would improve the effectiveness of the bill.  Our 
party will support the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of refugee in the bill needs further 
clarification.  Most Canadians know what a true refugee is. We 
will do our part to help those who are truly in need.  Keeping 
them clogged in the system is not helping them, especially when 
they are found not to be genuine refugees and are deported. Their 
lives are ruined after so many months and years.  The bill also 
gives refugees, as well as refugee applicants, full charter 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2, also in the name of the hon. member for Laval 
Centre, takes away the regulation making authority by order in 
council. Regulations should be made in committee.  I was the 
co-chair of the standing committee on scrutiny of regulations.  I 
can say that the government is in the habit of governing through 
the back door and not by debating regulations in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, thank you for allowing me to take part in debate on Bill 
C-11, even if my time will be quite limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 deals with immigration to Canada and the granting of 
refugee protection to persons who are displaced, persecuted or in 
danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very glad to have this opportunity to speak to this bill. I 
remind the House that when I was the critic for my party a couple 
of years ago, I had the opportunity to debate this bill, which 
was called Bill C-31 at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-31 was to amend Canada's immigration law, 
which dated back to 1976. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree that the time has come to review the legislation. 
Why? Because, as my colleague from Laval Centre pointed out 
earlier, those who live in an urban riding, especially in Quebec 
and in the greater Montreal area, realize that many citizens and 
families must face incredible tragedies and go through hardship 
because of the inconsistencies in the current immigration 
legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the Immigration and Refugee Board, the minister 
tells us that from now on it will take 72 hours for a refugee 
claim to be filed with the IRB, which will have to bring down its 
decision within six to nine months. Why do we support an 
improvement in the process? Because the present system is much 
too slow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>IRB figures from December 1999 indicate that the average time to 
process a claim is about ten months. Right now, there are 7,000 
asylum seekers waiting for a decision from the Immigration and 
Refugee Board, and this is in Montreal alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can imagine that while a person is waiting for a decision 
from the IRB a certain degree of integration into the Canadian 
and Quebec society inevitably occurs, and we must not be 
indifferent to that. We agree that it is important to reduce the 
processing time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2, brought forward by my colleague from Laval Centre, 
is an attempt to prevent the government from making regulations 
outside the legislative process. We would like the government to 
include these regulations in the future federal immigration act. 
Why? So that the legislation will be understandable and 
consistent with needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was my party's citizenship and immigration critic, I 
remember meeting privately with organizations such as the 
Canadian Council for Refugees, which is located in my riding.  I 
took the trouble to meet with them in my office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started off by asking them “What do you think of the bill to 
amend the Immigration Act?”  Representatives of these 
organizations replied “This is not an easy question to answer, 
because the bill is difficult to evaluate. The government wants 
to pass a series of regulations, rather than include important 
measures within the bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the member for Laval Centre's Motion No. 2 is 
important.  As parliamentarians, we must not be cut out of the 
loop. We must ensure that the bill is as complete as possible 
and not leave a large number of measures outside the process, 
outside the bill, in draft regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important aspect of this bill has to do with automatic 
detention.  It will be recalled that when the minister announced 
her bill a few weeks before the last election was called, her 
intention was clear.  She was introducing a tough bill.  Why? 
Because she naturally wanted to respond to the repeated demands 
from certain provinces west of Quebec seeking a tougher law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is consistent with other legislation, such as Bill C-7, 
which aims for tougher treatment of children. 
When I asked the government in committee to exclude minors from 
the detention process, I was told that this would be included in 
future regulations.  What I wanted was for this to be a provision 
in the act.  This would be a clear sign of the government's 
willingness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of international conventions are mentioned in the bill. 
I am thinking of the convention on the rights of the child—

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK205">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 4 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-209, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (Public 
Transportation Costs), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McCallum (Markham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, as I said a 
few weeks ago, I agree in many respects with the objectives of 
this bill, which would allow individuals to deduct a portion of 
their public transportation costs for environmental reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this legislation is definitely in line with the 
objectives of the government. Measures dealing with public 
transportation provide greater hopes than before, particularly 
since the President of the United States has rejected, at least 
for the time being, the Kyoto agreement. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle it is definitely on the right wavelength and 
certainly on the same wavelength as the initiatives of the 
government.  The measures the government has put in place are 
arguably superior to the proposed bill in terms of achieving the 
desired consequences for the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will outline briefly a number of the government's measures.  I 
am not suggesting they are in and of themselves fully adequate so 
I will comment on possible future directions in which the 
proposals in the private member's bill could play a part. However 
it would be premature to adopt the bill before considering all 
the alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, the government has committed $1.2 billion over five 
years to environmental projects of one kind or another.  I will 
mention just a few of these.  The government has committed $100 
million to the sustainable development technology fund, 
principally to reduce greenhouse gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also committed $25 million and $100 million 
respectively to the green municipal enabling fund and the green 
municipal investment fund which are both administered by the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities.  These funds help the 
municipalities to determine the feasibility of and best 
approaches to renewable energy, building retrofits, water 
conservation and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The green municipal investment fund also supports projects in 
areas such as energy and water savings, urban transit, which is 
related to the proposed private member's bill, and waste 
divergence to strengthen the sustainability of communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other measures announced in the budget tried to achieve similar 
ends.  The budget provided $210 million over three years for the 
renewal of the climate change action fund and other federal 
energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the budget expanded the existing federal green energy 
procurement pilot initiatives.  These measures were supplemented 
in the fall economic statement and update with the announcement 
of a $500 million federal contribution toward the national 
implementation strategy on climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we put all those measures together they will contribute in 
a substantial way to reducing gas emissions in the 
transportation, electricity, oil and gas, buildings and 
agriculture sectors.  They will also support Canadian projects in 
other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also announced a $2 billion infrastructure Canada 
program to support municipal infrastructure development.   Most 
urban transit investments are eligible for assistance under this 
program.  Eligible projects include fixed transit assets, such as 
bus lanes and rail lines, as well as transit vehicles which use 
alternative fuel.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these measures show that the environment is a high priority 
for the Government of Canada.  They are the result of extensive 
consultations with various stakeholders and we in the government 
think they are likely to achieve a greater impact at lower costs 
than the proposal in the private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to give the impression that everything is done and 
that no more initiatives are needed.  Because of the difficulties 
in the Kyoto area, initiatives involving public transit as a 
means of attacking air emission problems should receive a high 
priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member suggested is one alternative.  The National 
Round Table on the Environment and the Economy is studying a 
large number of alternative tax measures under the general rubric 
of green taxes.  There is also the possibility that initiatives 
in the area of public transit will come out of the task force on 
urban relations as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, while the objectives of this bill are laudable, 
more studies conducted with the tools I mentioned are required 
to develop a program that will have a broader scope before we 
can decide whether or not we accept this proposal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it gives my great pleasure to speak to a motion put forward by my 
colleague from Jonquière, whose great concern for the environment 
has endeared her to everyone in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that everyone knows what we are talking about today, let me 
remind especially the heritage minister that we are dealing 
with Bill C-209, which would provide tax benefits to those who 
use public transit. I am told that the heritage minister likes to 
use public transit, that she takes the subway or the bus every 
time she can and that this brings her closer to her constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Jonquière has introduced a private member's 
bill that would allow Canadians to deduct certain public 
transportation costs from the amount of tax payable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important piece of legislation that comes at a time 
when environmental issues are of great concern to society. As 
parliamentarians, we have to wonder how we can, individually and 
collectively, promote public transit. To promote public transit 
is to take any measure possible to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. In essence, the bill introduced by the member for 
Jonquière deals with pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell you something. I am 39 and I have never owned a car. 
Early in life, I decided that I would use public transit. I never 
really had a car. 
I went to write the test and I had three months to practice. I 
have to admit that I was not a very good driver. It is out of 
courtesy for the community that I do not own a car. Beyond the 
wisdom of such decision, however, is concern for the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course when you live in Montreal, it is easier to organize 
your life around public transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to digress for a moment, Madam Speaker. Every 
Sunday, from three to five o'clock, whenever I have a chance, I 
visit your constituency, because I train at the Claude Robillard 
Centre. I know that you share my loyalty to that institution, 
which provides Montrealers with access to equipment of great 
value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now go back to my main point. If, as parliamentarians, we were 
to adopt the bill put forward by the member for Jonquière, that 
would give us an opportunity to show our solidarity towards 
public transportation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to cite one statistic that will particularly enlighten 
this debate: 80% of workers have access to subsidized parking. 
The fringe benefits package offered by employers includes the 
possibility of a parking spot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can imagine the kind of competition public transportation is 
against. This is why the member for Jonquière says that if 
nothing is done to correct the situation, there will be an 
increase in the use of cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Jonquière was telling us about the following 
experience: in Quebec, all the cars that are driven 
to work would, bumper to bumper, represent a line going from Montreal to 
the Gaspé peninsula. People are used to driving to work. The 
member for Jonquière is quite right to wish that as 
parliamentarians we could provide benefits that would be a 
little competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that all members in this House will want to immediately 
give a good hand of applause to the member for Jonquière, who 
has been forward looking and who is proposing through her bill 
that public transportation be competitive. I also ask the 
President of the Treasury Board to share our enthusiasm, because 
she is also from Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have my own card here. A transportation card, that we call a 
CAM in Montreal, costs $48.50. I buy it at the beginning of 
every month. I always use public transportation. According to 
studies, public transportation users pay about $1,000 a year, 
while car users pay $8,000. Can members see how it could be socially 
beneficial to reinforce public transportation and to have tax 
deduction measures accordingly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most interesting thing, when we compare pollution 
generated by cars, as is the case for all those people who are 
driving to work is that public transportation is 
responsible for 32% of greenhouse gas emissions. I know people 
living in the suburbs cannot always do otherwise. It is 
different for them than for people living in Montreal, in Quebec 
City or all those living in urban centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these statistics, I noticed that a single bus can carry as 
many passengers as 40 or 50 cars. In addition, its toxic gas 
emissions per passenger kilometre are a mere one-quarter of those 
produced by the cars. When efforts are made to use public 
transit, it means as many as 40 or 50 fewer cars on the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public transit is interesting not only from the point of view of 
savings, but also from an environmental point of view, since 
greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to one-quarter. I think this 
is the most valuable aspect of the bill introduced by the hon. 
member for Jonquière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a link we should establish with Canada's international 
obligations. I think the hon. member for Jonquière was our 
environment critic when Canada signed the Kyoto protocol. If my 
information is correct, when the Kyoto agreement was ratified, 
Canada undertook to reduce by 6% domestic greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2010. If we compare the 1990s to the 2010 decade, 
we, as Canadians and Quebecers, should reduce our greenhouse gas 
by 6% under that international agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the hon. member for Jonquière told us that if the 
present situation remains unchanged and nothing is done for 
public transit, Canada will not only be unable to keep its 
commitment, but emissions will actually increase by 35%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean? It means that, in the end, we do not have 
much choice but to encourage more people to use public transit. 
Among the solutions available to us to meet the targets agreed to 
in Kyoto is the need to increase the use of public transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to note that the United States, a country 
to which we like to compare ourselves with regard to certain 
social measures, has measures similar to what the member for 
Jonquière is proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to tell members that in the United States non- 
taxable bus passes have led to a 25% increase in the number of 
people who use the public transit system. That experience was 
conducted in a society similar to ours, with large cities and 
extremely busy roads.  That initiative was successful in 
discouraging people from using their cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time has expired, I will conclude by saying that I am 
hopeful that all members of the House will support Bill C-209 and 
that a few years from now when we assess the success of 
environmental measures, we will be able to say that we as 
parliamentarians helped to reduce pollution. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased 
to enter the debate on Bill C-209.  I congratulate the member for 
Jonquière for bringing this very important issue to the floor of 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live not too far from Toronto and have occasion to go there 
from time to time.  One thing we have in that area, which I am sure 
Montreal and other urban centres in Canada have, is traffic 
gridlock.  There is an inability to travel down the roads in any 
kind of meaningful timeframe.  More important, as other members 
have mentioned, is the impact on greenhouse gases and the fact 
that the family automobile is contributing to our environmental 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that the average automobile will inject the amount of 
C02 emissions into the atmosphere equal to four times the weight 
of the vehicle every year.  We can see that this is a detriment 
to our health and also to our road safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many different ways to deal with the whole issue of 
greenhouse gases.  An area I am involved in is what we call 
ecological tax reform.  That is the ability to shift taxes toward 
polluters and away from people who are undertaking 
environmentally friendly practices.  It is in that vein that I 
look at this legislation and enjoy the ability to engage in the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the advantage of being on public transit systems all 
over the world.  When I was in Moscow I was amazed that its 
subway moved about a million people a day.  This is really a 
tremendous feat.  It shows what could be accomplished if we could 
get more people onto the public transit system.  It is a very 
useful piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we have when we deal with these kinds of issues is 
the question of the choice.  In this case it is the choice of 
different types of policies to achieve the objective of lowering 
greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started to study this legislation and some of the other 
studies which have been around.  For instance, recent studies 
showed that on average a tax subsidy of this nature would only 
increase ridership by 15%.  This was in view of the fact that 
ridership was at a very low level in the first place, with only 
19% of available people using public transit.  People who have 
studied this issue have said that this kind of incentive would 
have a very low effect on increasing ridership. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT47"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT47"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1750

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at it in that vein, because if it only increases 
ridership by 15%, it means that the other people who are already 
taking public transit are the ones who will get the lion's share 
of the benefit.  We really have not influenced public policy or 
the culture of people to be more sensitive to the environment and 
use public transit as opposed to vehicles.  It is that issue 
which is essential to the whole issue of greenhouse gases.  We 
need to change our culture toward how we handle ourselves in the 
environment and how we use our automobiles and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the legislation, it is unclear to me whether it 
will have that impact on changing people's choices about how they 
carry on in the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take it one step further.  This is an overview of the 
environmental concerns.  When I started to read the legislation I 
got a little confused because it talked about providing receipts 
for transportation costs.  For instance, from time to time I take 
OC Transpo.  I buy some tickets at the store.  I give the bus 
driver the tickets when I get on the bus but I do not get a 
receipt.  That is the normal course of business on most public 
transit systems.  The reality is, in a majority of cases people do 
not have receipts.  However the legislation requires people to 
provide receipts for this tax deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It talks about reasonable amounts paid by the individual in the 
year for the use of public transit.  I do not know what 
reasonable means.  However it is clear to me that the income tax 
system is designed to find people's taxable income, and taxable 
income is usually considered to be earnings from employment.  We 
do give some a blanket deduction for employment expenses.  The 
bottom line is that we pay tax on the balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would change that to some significant degree in 
the sense that it would allow people to claim expenses which 
would be personal in nature.  For instance, if somebody went to a 
hockey game in Montreal, presumably they would use the public 
transit and this would be allowed as a tax deduction.  This seems 
a very strange way to reward people.  I presume we are saying 
that if somebody else walked or whatever they would not receive a 
benefit from this.  For that reason, these kinds of changes to 
the Income Tax Act would help one group of people and would be a 
detriment to another group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue we are talking about is that of people who live in urban 
areas where there is public transit available.  My riding is 
fairly large and has about 125,000 people.  However we have very 
little public transit.  The only public transit we really have is 
when Toronto's GO system sends a bus to our area from time to 
time.  In other words, it is basically a rural or semi-rural 
area.  These people have no choice but to use their cars to go to 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the legislation says is that people who live and work in 
urban centres will be given a benefit and those who live or work 
in rural areas will not.  For that reason it is a terribly unfair 
piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that we need more people using rapid 
transit.  The question is, how do we do it?  It may be effective 
for rapid transit systems to use more alternative fuels like 
ethanol as opposed to gasoline driven engines.  This might have a 
more positive effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a whole gamut of different policy tools that 
governments could look at in the fuel cell technology.  The 
government has been very supportive of Ballard Power and 
developing that kind of technology.  There are all kinds of other 
different technologies out there that desperately want our 
support.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government to me has always been about choices.  We obviously 
cannot accomplish all the wonderful things we would like to do to 
reduce greenhouse gases.  It is clear that we must start doing 
more than we are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has not mentioned it, but I suspect we are talking 
about millions of tax dollars going into a project of transit 
passes, only to attain an increased ridership of no more than 
15%.  We may well ask if we could take the same money and use it 
more effectively in new types of technology to reduce greenhouse 
gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vancouver is debating municipal legislation that would require a 
special driver's licence to drive in the city.  That would 
represent a quota system in which only so many licences would be 
issued and a person could not drive in downtown Vancouver without 
one.  It is a way of pushing traffic out of the downtown core. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to put more emphasis on public transit.  One of the 
things I am trying to do in my riding is get the VIA Rail train 
to be a commuter train.  That would be a positive way to get 
people off the roads and onto the rail system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, giving an incentive for transit passes would not achieve 
a great deal.  Second, it would give benefits to people who 
already use public transit.  Third, it seems unfair because a lot 
of communities in Canada do not have the advantages of public 
transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am opposed to the legislation although I thank 
the member for Jonquière for bringing the issue to the floor of 
the House of Commons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise to participate in the second hour of debate 
on Bill C-209.  The purpose of the bill is to allow tax 
reductions for users of public transportation services in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin my remarks in support of the bill by congratulating my 
colleague, the hon. member for Jonquière, on her hard work in 
bringing the matter before the House.  It is a notable effort to 
protect our environment.  People where I come from highly 
appreciate the opportunity to weigh in on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very simple bill.  It proposes to enable Canadians when 
filling out their income tax returns to subtract a percentage of 
the money they pay for public transport from the amount they owe 
in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 the House of Commons, by a vote of 240 to 25, adopted a 
motion asking the weak Liberal government to review the issue of 
tax exemptions for users of public transportation.  However the 
Liberals have done absolutely nothing about it since passing the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the lower mainland of British Columbia where I come from, 
transportation is a very serious problem.  The city of Surrey is 
one of the fastest growing cities in Canada and traffic 
congestion is a very real concern for the people there. 
Transportation is a very serious issue for all the population of 
British Columbia's lower mainland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Greater Vancouver Regional District is planning to extend 
the TransLink service deeper into our lower mainland to connect 
commuters to downtown Vancouver.  In fact, construction is going 
on. However there is no federal government support to encourage 
this type of extension which would take traffic off our already 
congested highways and streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To assist in paying for the infrastructure extension, the 
Greater Vancouver Regional District was planning to levy a 
vehicle tax on users.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can imagine how annoying it was.  It was a very 
irritating idea.  People were very upset about a levy on their 
vehicles.  There was a huge public outcry for even suggesting 
that another tax must be paid by transit link commuters.  I am 
surprised that this public outrage has not made any impact on the 
Liberal government in Ottawa.  From its point of view, all the 
money it collects from gasoline taxes goes to general revenues. 
The government does not have the courtesy to put money where its 
mouth is, where there is a high demand, a high need, in our 
infrastructure development and public transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last November during the election the finance minister flew in a 
helicopter over the city of Surrey.  He wanted to get a tour of 
the city.  Probably he saw there was not enough support for him 
and his party in that area, so he chose to tour the city by 
helicopter.  He admitted to the media that he was not aware of 
the transportation needs of this area.  Talk about alienation.  I 
do not want to elaborate on that, but he is a federal cabinet 
minister and claims he was not aware of the transportation 
concerns of British Columbians living on the lower mainland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the finance minister on what he saw at that time. He 
is aware of the needs of transportation in that region.  What has 
he done so far or what is he planning to do in due course?  I am 
asking today:  what is he prepared to do about the problems he 
saw during his trip? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we compare the tax on gasoline with the tax in the United 
States of America, we see that 95% of the revenue in the United 
States is spent on roads, on highways and, most important, on 
public transportation.  In contrast, in Canada something like 
only 3.5% of the revenue from gasoline taxes is invested in 
roads, highways or public transportation.  On one side, south of 
the border, it is 95% and here at home in Canada it is just 3.5%. 
There is a big divergence or gap in the way that revenue is 
invested in transportation and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very good motion.  At least it encourages commuters to 
use public transportation.  Again, though, it is the 
responsibility of all levels of government to make sure that 
infrastructure development is there and that the public 
transportation system is there when the public needs it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many benefits of adopting this motion, particularly in 
terms of pollution control, health and the environment.  I will 
give some statistics on what is happening in Canada with respect 
to these three things I mentioned.  Seventy-five per cent of 
Canadians consider that air pollution affects their health and 
16,000 Canadians die prematurely every year because of the poor 
air quality.  Between 1980 and 1990 the number of children 
hospitalized because of asthma increased by 23%.  Health costs 
resulting from automobile use in Canada reportedly total over $1 
billion a year.  Motor vehicles are the principal source of 
greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 32% of the total amount. 
A single bus can carry as many passengers as 40 or 50 cars.  It 
is equivalent to that.  Its emission percentages per kilometre 
are only one-quarter of those of cars and other vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is an ideal tool for meeting our Kyoto commitments. We 
promised that by the year 2010 our emissions would be 6% lower 
than 1990 levels, but if the current situation continues Canada 
will actually exceed those levels by 35%.  Rather than a decrease 
of 6%, experts estimate an increase of 35%.  That is very 
alarming.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain economic benefits.  Some 80% of people who 
travel to work are entitled to a subsidized parking space, while 
very few workers receive any benefit for using public 
transportation.  When workers do receive such benefits they are 
required to pay taxes on them whereas most people who are 
entitled to a subsidized parking space pay no taxes on that 
benefit.  This situation greatly discourages the use of public 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public transportation provides access to urban centres, thus 
promoting the development and economic growth of those centres 
and communities.  The bill would increase the use of public 
transportation services.  In the United States, for example, tax 
free bus passes led to a 25% increase in the number of public 
transportation users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the U.S. there is a $500 billion initiative to develop the 
transportation infrastructure during the next five years.  I ask 
this weak Liberal government what its plan is.  How much money 
does it want to put into this big investment area?  Canada is the 
only G-8 country that does not have a national transportation 
infrastructure program.  The Liberals have no plans to implement 
one.  Bill C-209 offers one solution.  I urge the Liberal 
government to stop resting on its laurels and do something to 
provide incentives to promote the use of public transportation in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also very quickly highlight the fact that I had a meeting 
with the disgruntled B.C. public transportation employees who are 
on strike.  Of the three levels of organizational structure, they 
did not know who their bosses were.  There is no responsibility 
at any level of public transportation organizational structure. I 
urge the federal government to show leadership and address the 
issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in today's debate on 
second reading of Bill C-209, an act to amend the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not every day that we have a private member's bill with 
such an objective. Why would the Income Tax Act be changed? To 
provide tax credits to people who use public transit to go work 
or for occupations other than work. We know that there are now a 
lot of volunteers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going into this bill in more detail, I would like to 
take this opportunity to recognize the work done by my colleague 
from Jonquière. The hon. member for Jonquière was an extremely 
dynamic and active critic when she was involved with 
environmental issues. Everyone in the House surely remembers the 
determination and the passion with which she pursued the 
government on the issue of MOX. Our colleague is someone who 
believes that the environment is everybody's business, that it is 
the responsibility of each and every one of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is an individual responsibility, can you imagine what an 
essential responsibility it is for governments? There was a 
predecessor to the bill introduced today, which was proposed in 
1999 by the hon. member of the NDP, Nelson Riis, who was a 
colleague of ours, as far as I am concerned, from 1993 to 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, the motion introduced by Mr. Riis called on the 
government to examine the issue of a tax credit for the use of 
public transit. That motion was very clearly passed: 246 yeas, 25 
nays. It was quite a surprise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even more surprising is that since 1999, after 
recognizing the need for such a study, the government that was 
re-elected for a third term with a huge majority has forgotten 
everything about it. They do not talk about it any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that governments are like citizens. Sometimes they need 
incentives. The bill introduced by the member for Jonquière acts 
as an incentive. Will the government agree to consider and 
implement this bill?  I wish I could count on it, because it 
would send a clear message to everyone in Canada and in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that the environment in increasingly deteriorating, 
especially in overindustrialized countries, like Canada and 
Quebec that are in the shadow of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent decision by President Bush to ignore the commitments 
make in Kyoto is very worrisome, just like the lack of a strong 
response from Canada to that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vehicles are accountable for 32% of all greenhouse gas 
emissions. Thirty-two per cent is a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been living in Laval since 1967. In the last 30 to 35 
years, I must say that the number of cars has increased. Of 
course, with the development of the suburbs traffic towards 
downtown Montreal has increased significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1976, I could leave Laval at 7 a.m. and get downtown in 20 
minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now when I come to Ottawa, and I do it at least once a week, I must be 
in my car by 6 a.m., and I can assure hon. members that I am not 
speeding; I cannot drive fast. It takes me between 40 and 50 
minutes to leave the island of Montreal at 6 in the morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that ten years from now people will have to get 
up at 5 a.m. if they want to avoid spending two hours to cover 
20 kilometres? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is asking that there be a tax credit. The hon. 
member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve referred to subsidized parking 
spaces. Of course, here, as members of parliament, we have a 
parking space that is in addition to our salary. It is the same 
at General Motors. My point is that there are many places where 
this is provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alternative is to get a bus pass. However, if I live in 
Laval and work in Montreal, I must spend twice as much money on 
that pass, because I must go from Laval to Montreal. Worse still, 
if I live in Laval and work on the south shore, I must get three 
different passes. These costs add up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not recognize that a tax credit should be given to those who 
are lucid enough to decide to leave their car in the driveway and 
do their bit to help reduce pollution? Why not do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Minister of Finance has tremendous 
responsibilities.  I know that tax abatements are very difficult 
to implement, but I also know that certain large corporations 
already enjoy sizeable ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not average citizens?  Why do people who earn their 
living and must travel not get a break?  Perhaps this would have 
some effect on the thousands of motorists who jam the 
Jacques-Cartier, Champlain, highway 15 and highway 13 bridges 
every morning.  Perhaps this would motivate them to do their bit 
too.

bill.  We are about to head off for the summer and it would 
perhaps be a nice thing we could all do for ourselves to pass 
this bill and be able to look forward to a cleaner environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that asthma and allergies are on the increase.  This 
would eliminate these problems for our young people.  Our 
seniors, for whom air pollution is a big concern, particularly 
for those suffering from pulmonary or cardiopulmonary problems, 
as many do, might perhaps be able to enjoy a quiet walk through 
the parks in metropolitan Montreal.  They could say “My God, the 
air is a bit better”.

Laval, it takes an hour and a half to cross the Champlain bridge. 
Members can imagine how much greenhouse gas a body takes in 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before a tax credit is given, a proper public transportation 
system is needed. The member for Jonquière wants a tax credit, 
but I think we need light, rapid and pollution free, meaning 
electric, public transit to eliminate the greenhouse gases we get 
daily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a light train project that starts at autoroute 30 and 
goes downtown; it will eliminate the greenhouse gases the buses 
emit.  We have Mr. Chevrette's bill to restructure public 
transit.  The member for Jonquière must have heard Mr. Chevrette 
say light trains were needed throughout Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Monorails, light, quiet and pollution free trains, exist 
throughout the world.  We in Quebec are 20 years behind in public 
transit.  It is therefore time to do something.  It is time for 
new projects that will eliminate greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before tax credits are given, we must set up modern public 
transit, which the public will want to use, as is the case around 
the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Deux-Montagnes trains were put on the rail again, the 
number of cars had to be doubled.  Imagine, twice as many cars 
had to be put on the commuter trains to Montreal.  Let us not 
forget that there is still the problem of greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if tomorrow we could have a public, electric, light rail 
transit system which could move about Quebec without noise and 
without pollution, like the one that is going to be put in using 
the Champlain bridge structure to carry commuters downtown. There 
ought to be another one, which would go east-west under boulevard 
Métropolitain, taking in Pie-IX, Henri-Bourassa, Avenue du Parc, 
joining Mirabel and Dorval, Dorval and downtown.  Can we imagine 
what the Quebec of the future would be like? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, before we start thinking about tax credits it is 
very important to invest in public transit in Quebec.  In this 
connection, Mr. Chevrette has undertaken a magnificent initiative 
for improving mass transit, and I congratulate him on it.  He did 
not increase the number of buses and cars by putting in more 
bridges.  The commission looking into public transit said no to 
the construction of new bridges, and thus yes to modern noise 
and pollution free, mass transit, electric transportation with no 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill such as the one we have before us today ought to focus 
more on a mass transit system that would be free of greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the hon. member for Surrey Centre say earlier that the 
Liberals had no project. I regret to inform him that had he 
looked at our red book, if he had read it, he would know that it 
contains a paragraph referring to the need to encourage public 
transportation and those who are interested in creating modern 
noise free and pollution free transportation so that greenhouse gas 
emissions may be eliminated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak today to Bill C-209.  I congratulate the hon. 
member for Jonquière for her consistent and strong commitment to 
environmental policy in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Liberal member opposite boast of his government's 
commitment to public transit.  The party that he represents 
actually committed a paragraph of verbiage to the public transit 
issue.  I am certain that paragraph committed by the Liberals to 
the public transit system of Canada probably has not had the 
extraordinary level of impact on encouraging Canadians to take 
public transit that he may have expected.  It is not the first 
time members opposite have been delusional about their party's 
red book commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend our party's critic, the hon. member for Fundy—Royal, 
who has been so effective and instrumental in the development of 
our party's policies on environmental issues.  In the last 
election our platform was highly rated by groups, including the 
Sierra Club, for its commitment to environmental policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the specific issue at hand, that of incentivizing public 
transit through the tax system, my first gut reaction from the 
perspective purely of a tax system is that I do not like to see a 
tax code complicated through this type of Pavlovian tax policy 
where we encourage one kind of behaviour with one sort of tax 
policy and discourage another with a different sort of tax 
policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That being the case and given the overwhelming evidence that 
public transit is far less deleterious to the environment than 
individual automobile transit, the member's proposal is quite 
innovative and should be seriously considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also see the potential for a tax break.  Whether or not it 
complicates the tax code, we should always try to look for any 
tax break we might eke out of the Liberals.  They are not 
biologically predisposed to lowering taxes by and large, so we 
should be supportive if they are embracing a tax reduction in any 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did hear the Liberal member opposite speak a few minutes ago 
of the emissions from public transit vehicles.  He was disputing 
the information we heard earlier today relative to the 
overwhelming positive impact of public transit versus individual 
automobiles.  He should remember that the emissions produced by a 
bus for the number of people in that bus on a comparative level 
have about 40 to 50 times less impact on the environment 
than individual automobile traffic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it addresses a very important environmental issue in urban 
centres, we also need a greater commitment to public transit in 
terms of a national infrastructure.  It is a great notion to 
create incentives to encourage public transit, but we need a 
greater commitment on a national level to our public transit 
infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is becoming an increasingly important issue in smaller or 
growing cities and municipalities such as the greater Halifax 
area in Nova Scotia.  From a fiscal perspective, if we look at 
the degree to which the federal government has cut back in recent 
years from transfers to the provinces, we see that the provinces 
have been forced into a position of cutting back transfers to 
cities.  We as a country must take a serious look at a federal 
and provincial strategy to improve public transit infrastructure 
not just in the large urban centres but in cities such as St. 
John's and Halifax to serve a wider cross-section of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings into play the whole issue of how the federal 
government will deal with the growth or the emergence of city 
states in Canada, the consolidation of municipalities and the 
commensurate increases in responsibilities.  Some would say that 
due to the commensurate increase in responsibilities there needs 
to be an increase in the level of power of some of the 
consolidated cities that have emerged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That debate is fraught with all kinds of constitutional 
landmines.  We should not allow the fear of constitutional 
difficulties to prevent us from looking at real solutions.  We 
should work with our provinces, not ram solutions down their 
throats, to develop joint strategies to address infrastructure 
issues, in this case public transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us who have experienced increased traffic levels and 
environmental damage by growth in our cities realize that the 
hon. member's initiative could go a long way to improve the 
situation in terms of attracting more people to public transit. 
However we must make sure that we do not ignore the greater issue 
of ensuring through federal and provincial co-operation that the 
moneys are there for better public transit infrastructure across 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the question we are to debate this evening is one I asked of the 
Minister of Finance about the equalization process, especially as 
it affects the Atlantic provinces and in my particular my 
province of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I raised the question it was shortly after the Minister of 
Finance had met with the provincial ministers of finance in 
Halifax.  The indication given by the press was that he had said 
he would not look at the equalization process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister in responding said that was not the case, that he 
was always ready and willing to keep looking at the equalization 
process and that there was more money going into equalization 
today than ever before.  To that I say whoop-de-do because as our 
budgets increase undoubtedly more money will go into the various 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister failed to mention the $10 billion capped 
equalization fund.  This past year the cap has been taken off and 
hopefully taken off for good.  It is like a baseball cap in the 
wind: throw it away and let it blow away and go from there.  It 
will give the provinces at least some extra funding at a time 
when funding was reduced significantly percentage-wise in 
relation to their total budget over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main part of the question I was asking in relation to 
equalization was that the clawback provisions be disregarded 
completely for provinces that were developing new resources.  The 
provinces could hold on to the new royalties from these resources 
to build up infrastructure so that they could get on their feet 
economically and start being contributing partners in 
Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens right now in places like Newfoundland and Nova 
Scotia where they are developing the rich oilfields off their 
coasts?  From every dollar they make Ottawa takes back 75 cents 
or 80 cents.  In some cases as they develop new, rich mineral 
finds Ottawa claws back up to 90%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person works and makes $100 and on the way home someone 
takes $90 away, it will be difficult for the person to step up in 
society, to be a contributing partner.  We see examples of that 
with people who receive social assistance from governments.  They 
try to find employment and when they do they make a few dollars, 
only to find that whatever they make on the one hand is taken off 
their cheque on the other.  They are no further ahead and they 
give up in despair.  That does not help them financially, 
socially, emotionally or in any other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same way with the provinces.  Our poor provinces will 
always be poor unless Ottawa plays a part in letting them use 
their own money and not Ottawa money to get on their feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said to the minister that a precedent had already been set. 
When Alberta came under the equalization program for a period of 
approximately eight years it received equalization as well as 
held on to its full royalties.  The minister said that Alberta 
was subjected to the clawback and that I was wrong.  I was not 
wrong.  For a period of eight years Alberta received equalization 
payments while holding on to its royalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically the point the minister did not address was how we were 
to make the country better.  We could make it a better country by 
making all provinces contributing partners.  We could do that if 
the government changed the financial arrangements under which we now 
operate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, we have to get the facts 
straight.  Alberta received equalization for a short period of 
time prior to 1962 when resource revenues were not included in 
the calculation of equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1962, when resources were brought into the formula, Alberta's 
equalization entitlements were clawed back.  Accordingly, after 
1964-65 Alberta no longer received equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1967 equalization became a comprehensive program and 
virtually all revenue sources were included in the calculation of 
equalization entitlements. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland and Nova Scotia want to be less dependent on 
transfers. It is a laudable goal, but these two provinces also 
want to keep all their revenues from natural resources, as do 
Alberta and other provinces. That is the situation at the present 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland and Nova Scotia want equalization payments to be 
maintained at the same level despite the fact that they are 
getting richer. That is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization formula is applied in a fair and equitable 
manner to all the provinces. As fiscal capacity varies from 
province to province, so do equalization payments. These 
variations reflect each province's capacity to raise revenues. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia resource revenues 
already receive special treatment:  equalization payments are not 
reduced dollar for dollar but only by 70 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, to provide more generous treatment to 
Newfoundland and Nova Scotia would be patently unfair to other 
equalization receiving provinces which do not have the benefit of 
rich natural resource sectors.
