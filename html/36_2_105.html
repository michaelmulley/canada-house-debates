</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
the honour to present in both official languages the third report 
of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the 
Status of Persons with Disabilities.  This report is entitled 
“Seeking a Balance: Final Report on Human Resources Development 
Canada Grants and Contributions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report is the result of four months of very public hearings. 
The committee heard from witnesses from all over the country, 
from within government and outside of government.  These 
witnesses were selected by members of all five parties 
represented on our committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the members of the committee, the witnesses and 
the staff of the committee who assisted us in producing what I 
hope will be a very valuable piece of work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to this report, the 
official opposition members of the committee are strongly of the 
opinion that the Liberal majority on the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development and the Status of Persons with 
Disabilities failed to fully report and constructively criticize 
the department's mismanagement and abuse of grants and 
contributions programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the committee is in dereliction of its 
responsibility therefore to hold the government accountable on 
behalf of Canadian workers, employers and taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal majority report does not impute any responsibility 
to anyone in the mismanagement of the department and blames other 
factors.  Because the Liberal majority report denies the nature 
and scope of the problems at HRDC, the recommendations it makes 
fails to address the root cause of these problems and our 
dissenting report and 14 recommendations from the official 
opposition are appended.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would seek the permission of the House to 
explain the dissenting opinion of the Bloc Quebecois on this 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I regret to inform the hon. member that that 
requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous 
consent for the hon. member to explain his party's position on 
this report? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a very important report. 
It contains, among other things, a recommendation by the Bloc 
Quebecois, which I myself proposed, that the department be 
dismantled because of the crisis we have witnessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We submitted a dissenting report because, if the government 
simply dismantled the department without getting to the bottom 
of things in this situation through an independent public 
inquiry, we would not have honoured the wishes of the citizens 
of Quebec and Canada in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think government action 
must go a lot further, otherwise this will be seen as nothing 
more than camouflaging.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I move that the first report of the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, presented 
Tuesday, February 22, be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today to finish up a bit of unfinished business and 
ongoing business dealing with the farm income issue across 
Canada, in particular in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask if I could have the agreement of the House to share 
my time with the member for Battlefords—Lloydminster so that we 
would each have 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there the unanimous consent of the 
House to permit the hon. member to share his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not have 
concurrence to share my time.  We should have a positive attitude 
in parliament and we should work together to address agricultural 
issues.  I am very disappointed that my colleagues in the House 
feel that this spirit of co-operation is not necessary in 
addressing agricultural problems in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority report which was put forward by the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food on March 13, in which I 
concurred, was inadequate and did not adequately address the 
issues, nor did it adequately examine the problems. I will 
address that as we go along.  Primarily the problem was that the 
hearings were confined to three provinces, when I know very 
clearly from geography books and the history of the country that 
we have 10 provinces as well as the territories which have 
agricultural issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since October 21, 1999, the House of Commons Standing Committee 
on Agriculture and Agri-Food has examined issues surrounding the 
farm income crisis facing farmers.  I would like to point out 
that it was the Canadian Alliance and my motion which in fact got 
the hearings going on the farm income issue.  As far as I know, 
had we not done that, the government would have continued on with 
the statements of the minister, saying “Relax, NISA and crop 
insurance are sufficient to address this crisis”, when it soon 
became very apparent that the basic farm safety net programs 
would not do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that 
if the member for Selkirk—Interlake had simply stated that he 
was splitting his time, that indeed would be allowable in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I request that he simply make that statement at this time, 
that he would indeed be splitting his time with another alliance 
member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Yes, that has certainly been the 
practice.  The hon. member asked for consent and sat down, so I 
asked for consent and it was refused.  I only asked for it 
because he asked me to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he wants to split his time, that is his business.  Normally 
we do accept that a member can stand at the beginning of his or 
her remarks and say that he or she will be splitting his or her 
time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
share my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1999 the Canadian Alliance started a series of 
meetings across Canada to address this issue, which the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture Agri-Food and the Liberal government 
were unwilling to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1999 the action for struggling agriculture producers 
committee was struck by the Canadian Alliance in response to the 
income crisis.  The hearings were necessary because the ongoing 
farm income crisis had not abated.  In fact, as of this day it 
has not abated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan farm incomes have improved somewhat, but only 
because of farm subsidy programs.  What we have not seen is an 
improvement due to the government addressing the root causes and 
the problems of farm incomes in Canada, including western Canada 
and southwest Ontario, which rely on export markets for many of 
their cash crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many root problems, but I will just mention two or 
three that are major and should be addressed right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the government has to get out of the way of the value 
added processing of raw agriculture, such as grains and meats, on 
the prairies and across the country.  The Canadian Wheat Board at 
the present time is putting roadblocks in the way of pasta 
producers, who, in trying to do value added processing, find that 
they have to sell their grain through the wheat board and then 
buy it back, which makes it uneconomical.  The organic farmers 
will also find that the wheat board is a tough customer to deal 
with as their organic products start to increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the problem of marketing, which I have mentioned. 
Farmers must have the ability to decide how best to market the 
products from their farms.  In this regard the government has to 
move to make the Canadian Wheat Board a voluntary organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later today we will be dealing with the transport reforms.  I 
mention them here as part of the ASAP report, because farmers 
certainly said that they need to have transport reform.  The 
transport reform needs to be toward the side of a commercial 
contract based system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out the current situation on the prairies. 
I would like to refer to people in Saskatchewan who have 
addressed this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the general statistic that arrears on farm debt in 
Saskatchewan increased between February and March from $6.3 
million to $8.2 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John Eberl, the administrator of the Rural Municipality of 
Antler, said that out of 15 farmers in his immediate area, three 
have gone bankrupt.  After 30 years, Don Kincaid believes he is 
finished with farming.  Don Kincaid lives about 60 kilometres 
southwest of Regina.  He said the reason is that he could not 
risk losing more money.  That is a sign of desperation.  Farmers 
do not see any improvement in the immediate future.  That is a 
big problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of input is also paramount to the health of 
agriculture in western Canada.  Between 1994 and 1998 farm cash 
receipts increased 7.5%.  Meanwhile, operating expenses like 
fuels, chemicals and labour rose 9.4% and depreciation increased 
15.8%  As a result, realized net income fell by 11.5% during the 
five year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until these root causes of the problems for farm income are 
addressed, including high taxation by the government, farmers 
will not be able to have a real optimistic outlook.  The 
government is perhaps hoping that there will be natural disasters 
around the world that will drive up grain prices, but that is not 
the way to do it.  The way to do it is to start addressing the 
root causes in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask for the concurrence of the House to table, in both 
official languages, the report of the action for struggling 
agriculture producers committee, which I have compiled along with 
my colleagues in the Canadian Alliance.  In particular, I would 
like to mention the outstanding work done by the hon. member for 
Battlefords—Lloydminster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have the 
unanimous consent of the House to table the document to which he 
has referred? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his presentation 
today and for bringing us up to date on the progress of the ASAP 
report.  I know that he and the hon. member for 
Battlefords—Lloydminster have worked very hard on this, as have 
many of us.  It is unfortunate that we did not get consent from 
the House to table that report, because it reflects the views of 
some 3,500 farmers with whom we met.  It would be very wise of 
the government to listen and to have a look at what these people 
had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that copies of the ASAP report were sent to the Prime 
Minister and to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.  Could 
the hon. member comment on the response he has received from 
them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, whilst I have not 
received a response, I certainly hope to receive it in the near 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food 
voted down motion after motion which I brought forward to hold 
hearings across the country on safety nets.  They refused to go 
to southwestern Ontario, which is the single biggest agriculture 
producing province in Canada.  I can only conclude from that that 
the minister from Toronto and other ministers from the area 
thought that if they could keep the Canadian Alliance away from 
the people of Ontario it would be an out of sight/out of mind 
situation.  Looking back, that seemed to be the whole objective 
of denying the standing committee the opportunity to travel to 
southwestern Ontario to talk directly with farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That shows the crassness of the political objectives of this 
government.  The farmers' interests come second, third or fourth. 
The government's political objectives are to get re-elected and 
to keep politicians from other parties out of southwestern 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that the Canadian Alliance went to southern 
Ontario.  We held six meetings.  A lot of people who came to the 
meetings, who were of all political persuasions, questioned the 
representation they were getting from their members of 
parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened very diligently to my colleague across 
the way this morning and to his response to the last question.  I 
am a member from southwestern Ontario.  I welcome his great 
initiative to travel in my area.  He obviously recognizes where 
the quality of land in agriculture is very vital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a member of the agriculture committee, as is he.  Yes, 
indeed, the motion was put that we travel west and to 
southwestern Ontario.  Does he remember, in that particular 
instance, that yes, I voted against it, but the motion was to 
travel to Ontario and the eastern provinces?  Was there a 
political motive in that he only wanted to visit southwestern 
Ontario? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many meetings did the hon. member attend out west?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in answer to the 
question, we had great representation by the Canadian Alliance at 
every one of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food 
meetings.  The meetings we held on the ASAP report were attended 
by provincial politicians from all parties.  I did not see any 
federal Liberal members there who could have come out to listen 
directly to it.  They seemed to rely on the minister from Regina 
to be the one to speak for them, telling the sheep in the 
background as to what the heck they should be voting on and 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food had many 
opportunities and still does have the opportunity to consult 
farmers on the safety net programs.  Agriculture is not out of 
the woods and the member's question indicates to me that the 
government does not intend to do anything more to address the 
root causes of the agricultural crisis in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to be debating reforms to the grain transportation 
system that fall far short of the ideal and of the requests of 
the major farm organizations in western Canada.  Who are those 
major farm organizations in western Canada with regard to the 
grain transportation issue? They are the five grain companies, 
three of which are owned and administered by farmers.  Those 
people want to see a much greater commercialization of grain 
transportation than what we see today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to the 
ongoing agricultural crisis in the country.  As we see from the 
co-operation we are getting from the government side of the 
House, agriculture's biggest problem is that it is 90% politics 
and 10% production.  Of course that goes to the root cause of 
what is happening out there now.  There is a sad lack of cashflow 
due to government inattention and government cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government will not seem to co-operate and allow us to 
table this report, I will spend my 10 minutes on the 13 policy 
suggestions from farmers.  These are primary producers. Some 
3,500 to 4,000 primary producers came out to our town hall 
meetings and told us what they thought.  We went straight to the 
horse's mouth, if you will, Mr. Speaker, rather than the other 
end that we see here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy suggestion number one:  Farmers demand that promised 
disaster assistance be delivered on time.  Of course that has not 
happened.  The agricultural income disaster assistance program, 
AIDA, did not accomplish this goal.  Less than 30% of the money 
allocated for 1998 got off the cabinet table out to the kitchen 
tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Emergency compensation programs must be structured in such a way 
as to target assistance to all farmers who need help. Again AIDA 
failed miserably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy suggestion number two:  National farm safety net programs 
must not only be maintained, they must be improved.  Any long 
term safety net program must include an income disaster program, 
a crop insurance program and an income stabilization program such 
as NISA.  The problem we had earlier on was that the agriculture 
minister, backed up by his colleagues, insisted that crop 
insurance and NISA were more than adequate to handle the problem. 
We knew otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An effective farm safety net would ensure long term stable 
protection for farmers and would eliminate the need for ad hoc 
programs such as AIDA in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy suggestion number three:  The majority of farmers are 
calling on the federal government to become more aggressive in 
trade negotiations.  They want better access to world markets. 
Farmers have stated that the Canadian government has lowered its 
agricultural support much faster than other nations and much 
faster than we agreed to in the trade negotiations in the Uruguay 
round. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are demanding that the government not lower agricultural 
support any faster than our trade competitors and no faster than 
agreed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy suggestion number four:  Governments must clearly define 
the future direction for agriculture policy in Canada.  Is it 
sustainable?  Do we need a good safe secure food supply?  Of 
course we do.  As part of this, government must define who falls 
into the category of farmer.  This would help to decrease 
uncertainty in who qualifies for farm safety net programs and 
would reduce conflicts with farm income tax provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also saw this flaw clearly in the evidence in the election 
for the wheat board.  Folks who were landlords from the United 
States got ballots.  An immigrant lady who had been in Toronto 
for one week received a ballot.  There were a lot of things like 
that.  If we had a clear definition of who was actually farming, 
it would certainly go a long way to help the government define 
farmer.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy suggestion number five:  Farmers suggest that the federal 
government lower user fees charged by the Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business just completed a 
study.  The findings indicate that farmers are another casualty 
of the government's cost recovery policies.  It says that the 
government is adding to producers' problems with huge user fees, 
rising input costs, government debt and deficit reduction, which 
of course has hit the agriculture sector harder than anybody 
else, government regulations and the paper burden. Sixty-eight 
percent of those that replied to the survey say that one of the 
most heinous jobs they have is the paperwork that is required in 
sending all of this stuff to Ottawa when it does not seem to do 
any good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy suggestion number six:  Farmers suggest that the federal 
government immediately lower farmers' costs by enabling a 
competitive commercially accountable grain handling and 
transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will go to the heart of what we are going to hear later 
today when the transport minister introduces Bill C-34 redoing 
the grain transportation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy suggestion number seven:  Farmers are calling on the 
federal government to immediately allow producers to improve 
their income by moving up the processing chain.  This would 
require the government to remove the regulations slowing direct 
farmer involvement in value added processing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prairie pasture producers wanting to create 100-plus jobs in 
southern Saskatchewan, wanting to upgrade the value of durum here 
at home rather than shipping it to the United States or other 
places to be processed, are the types of incentives we need to 
see.  That is rural development.  That is the type of thing the 
Secretary of State for Rural Development should be talking about 
in this House.  It goes to the root cause of why farmers are not 
making any money.  They are not allowed to handle and market 
their own product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy suggestion number eight:  The majority of farmers believe 
that western Canadian farmers should have the freedom to market 
their grain independently of the Canadian Wheat Board.  Most 
farmers do not want the wheat board to disappear but believe it 
should be one of their marketing options that also includes but 
is not limited to marketing directly to farmer owned new 
generation co-operatives or any other access they find. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we have with the wheat board is it is a monopoly. 
It is a closed shop.  It is also spreading its tentacles into 
areas such as organic farming which is just starting to come on 
big in the west.  That goes to the government's bill on 
pesticides and that type of thing.  Organic farming is definitely 
part of the answer. The wheat board does not really want to 
handle the product because it is a niche market and it is too 
small for it. Yet it still wants to control the pricing and have 
the buyback provisions. It is absolutely ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see a farmer from southern Manitoba in shackles and 
chains because he marketed his own product across the line, it is 
absolutely abhorrent that type of thing can happen in a democracy 
such as Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy suggestion number nine:  Most farmers believe that 
overall farm income would increase if interprovincial trade 
barriers were removed.  They are calling on the federal and 
provincial governments to actively pursue free trade within 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is great to have trading negotiations going on with all the 
countries in the world, but we have huge trade distortions within 
our own country from province to province.  Numbers put that 
disparity at about $6 billion a year.  It is a horrendous amount 
of money that should be in producers' pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy suggestion number ten:  Most farmers maintain that any 
endangered species legislation must respect the property rights 
of landowners. That is a big item.  There has to be adequate 
compensation and respect for the property owner.  And it must 
include compensation for land if the habitat must be taken out of 
production.  We have not seen that in any of the legislation that 
has been brought forward.  It has to be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of producers believe that the government could 
achieve more through co-operation with farmers and ranchers than 
through threats of punishment. We know how well that is working 
with the gun registration bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy suggestion number eleven:  The majority of farmers demand 
that any legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases must not 
reduce farmers' income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we see, farming and agriculture in Canada is the only 
industry I know of that buys retail and sells wholesale. Any 
costs that are incurred by any one of the suppliers and so on are 
passed on to the farm gate.  They cannot be added to the product 
price and shipped back out again, as we see in every other 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environmental taxes that are now being collected not only 
hit the farmer himself but they also hit the machine dealer and 
the fertilizer dealer.  Everyone else passes them on in increased 
costs to the farmer who must eat the increased cost and cannot 
pass it back in any way, shape or form.  It is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy suggestion number twelve:  Most farmers support giving 
Canadians the ability to choose and not to consume food that 
contains genetically modified organisms.  Most farmers 
acknowledge that this will require some form of labelling on food 
containing those GMOs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that it cannot be a mandatory type of system.  It 
just will not work.  Voluntary should work quite well as it has 
in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy suggestion number thirteen:  Farmers are asking for all 
levels of government to ensure that adequate counselling, support 
programs and such are available for farm families suffering 
through this farm crisis.  That seems to be something government 
can intervene in and also be there to backstop farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been talk of an escape clause for people who want to 
get out.  In my home province of Saskatchewan the average age of 
farmers is approaching 60 years. These farmers are working away 
at their equity, shortening their retirement values and so on. 
It is just not right and it is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty percent of the AIDA funds for 1998 are all that escaped 
from Ottawa and got out there to do any good.  We are now seeing 
headlines that the 1999 program may not have enough cash in it. 
It is absolutely ludicrous. When family farms are not receiving 
the cash, where is the money going? Administration costs cannot 
be that high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Huge rallies have been held in western Canada with farmers going 
out in their tractors, trucks or whatever to become part of a 
convoy.  The very first one was held out west in my riding of 
Battlefords—Lloydminster in which 400 units took part just to 
show some support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also finding a lot of intervention from past the farm 
gate suppliers.  These fellows are carrying huge debt loads and 
farmers cannot afford to pay their bills.  Bank credit has dried 
up.  Farmers are asking for some long term, low interest loans as 
farm credit's mandate originally was.  It has now become a 
quasi-judicial board separate from the government which those 
folks like to do to hide responsibility.  We are not seeing the 
type of financial package the agriculture industry will need to 
sustain itself in the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers out there are in trouble.  They are looking for some 
sort of leadership from the federal government and from their 
provincial governments.  They are not seeing a whole lot. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron—Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened with a great deal of interest to what has been said 
this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the member for Selkirk—Interlake commented about 
southwestern Ontario.  As a primary producer in southwestern 
Ontario I find it offensive that some would suggest that we do 
not care about the farmers of southwestern Ontario. We care about 
farmers clear across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it rather an oxymoron that a party that believes in 
cutbacks in all sectors would dare to say that the government has 
not spent enough or that the money is not reaching the farmers 
for whom it was intended.  That party does not support supply 
management which has supported and served our farmers well across 
the country in both the feather industry and the dairy industry, 
an industry that has not come to the government trough looking 
for help.  Yet that party says “We do not support supply 
management”.  That party does not support the Canadian Wheat 
Board because it believes it is a monopoly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If farmers in western Canada were allowed the option of going 
five years outside of the wheat board, and took responsibility 
for the crop produced in that five year period, would they be 
prepared to take responsibility for the crop and stay out of the 
system for five years even though they were not able to sell 
their crop?  Who would they go to then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, both of the member's 
questions are very pertinent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to supply management he is not reading our policy 
statement properly.  We have never said to destroy supply 
management.  This government has moved from a quota to a tariff 
base that is designed to come down over the next little while 
that will destroy supply management. That is exactly true.  That 
is the government's policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our policy is let us get the rest of agriculture up to that 
level.  There has to be some return on the investment. We are not 
seeing that in any other agricultural sector.  Good for supply 
management.  They figured out the formula and they are trying to 
make it work.  Good for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have never said to do away with the Canadian Wheat Board.  We 
have said to make it optional.  If it is good it will continue to 
function.  It is saying it will fall apart if it does not have a 
monopoly.  No monopoly anywhere lasts forever.  People will rear 
up and say they have had enough and will not go to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see far less acreage dedicated to the Canadian Wheat Board 
now than we ever have before.  We only have to look at its annual 
report which just came out.  It shows that sales are way down and 
administration costs have gone through the roof.  The wheat board 
does not have the anticipated acreage coming from producers that 
it had before.  People are voting with their feet and growing 
different crops. 
We are seeing all sorts of things being developed to try to 
obtain cashflow.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also seeing organic grains being held back by the wheat 
board because it wants to control them but does not want the 
responsibility of marketing.  There are many niche crops from 
which the wheat board could back off and allow these folks to 
fulfil, such as the pearling markets, the specialized feed wheats 
and all those types of things that could be grown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know they can do that.  I do not know a producer who would 
not sign a contract to be taken out of the wheat board for five 
years.  Producers will sink or swim on their own.  They are doing 
that now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a very brief comment to make.  We are now seeing 
from the Canadian Alliance something to which 
western farmers had better pay attention.  It wants to get rid of 
the Canadian Wheat Board.  It is also saying that it wants it 
opened up to competition to allow the Cargills of the world to 
get involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of time before the wheat board disappears.  The 
wheat board only succeeds if it is single desk marketing agency 
for Canadian grain.  That is the way farmers in western feel. 
There is very strong support for the Canadian Wheat Board as a 
single desk marketing agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party of Canada wants to destroy that agency for the 
farmers of western Canada.  Western Canadian farmers had better 
realize that we have a throwback to the age of the dinosaurs and 
Neanderthals.  They are coming out of their cage and they want to 
end the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers fought for that year in and year out.  They 
fought for it in the 1930s and 1940s.  They fought to defend it 
against the forces of the extreme right.  Those forces are now 
coming to the fore again.  As a matter a fact there was a 
plebiscite on barley some time ago and over two-thirds of farmers 
wanted to market barley through the Canadian Wheat Board.  What 
did the reform party do?  It criticized farmers for supporting 
the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, talk about the Jurassic era. 
We just heard from it.  The member talked about the thirties and 
forties.  Agriculture has grown and changed since that time. 
People are marketing on their own now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the member heard of crops like lentils, peas, canola, 
mustard, canary, spices and everything else?  Those are not wheat 
board crops but they are doing very well.  They are not having 
any problem marketing their products.  They are not having any 
problem getting those products to port and not being charged 
demurrage on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is definitely a need for a wheat board.  We never said to 
destroy the board.  We are saying make it open and accountable to 
the people it serves.  There will be elections again this coming 
fall.  We will see more open market people elected to that board.

<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-34, an act to amend the Canada Transportation 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, in my view today is a landmark day for 
the entire grain transportation industry and for the producers of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a couple of days ago we introduced Bill C-34, an act to 
amend the Canada Transportation Act.  It will put in place 
competitive measures which will assist all stakeholders to move 
to a better and more efficient way of moving grain in western 
Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleagues on this side of the House, in particular 
my seatmate, the member for Wascana, the minister responsible for 
the Canadian Wheat Board, and the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food.  We have worked on this file for nearly three years. 
It has been very difficult.  Sometimes the debate has been 
arduous, but the end result is a balanced approach to a very 
complex issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank members of all parties on the other side of the 
House who the emotional dimensions of this debate which go back a 
long time in Canadian history and reflect varying points of view 
which are at times quite extreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In life we do not always get our own way.  Everyone in the 
system, all the stakeholders and political actors, have put water 
in their wine, so to speak.  They have come forward with measures 
that will bring us forward in the new century to a more 
competitive grain handling system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A central theme of our transportation policy for the last number 
of years has been to modernize the transportation system by 
commercializing some institutions, providing more local control, 
reducing subsidies and updating legislation.  Bill C-34 is no 
exception because it presents the legislative portion of a larger 
initiative that modernizes the graining handling and 
transportation system for the benefit of prairie farmers and the 
transportation system as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It represents three years of work.  After two years of 
consultative studies and a lot of effort by my colleagues, we 
have a plan for change that will make a real difference in the 
lives of prairie farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about the co-operation I received from both of my 
colleagues, the minister of agriculture and the minister for the 
wheat board.  As the lead minister on this file, I will be 
engaged in the debate today.  The other two ministers will not 
speak, but the minister for the wheat board will be present for 
the rest of the day.  He will certainly reply to questions this 
afternoon and engage in some debate if necessary.  I believe the 
minister of agriculture will also attend at some point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank both former Justice Willard Estey and Mr. Arthur Kroeger 
for their dedication and hard work on this very important issue. 
In my view their work is seminal.  It has given us a thorough 
understanding of the issues and diverse opinions associated with 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill the government is initiating changes to an 
industry that exports $6 billion worth of grain each year to 
markets all around the world.  Unfortunately the system that 
moves the products from country elevators to ports suffers from 
periodic breakdowns, bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and quite 
frankly a lack of accountability and some may say a lack of 
credibility.  That was demonstrated in the winter of 1996-97 when 
the system completely broke down in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our system is to be world class, if Canada is to be taken 
seriously on the world stage, we must have a means to transport 
grain that gives farmers the ability to take advantage of 
opportunities provided by the global marketplace.  As a result we 
must be able to move grain from gate to port cheaply and 
efficiently.  When things go wrong, lines of accountability need 
to be clear so that problems can be resolved. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the system at the moment lacks clear lines of 
accountability, with the result that those involved point the 
finger of blame at each other rather than work together to 
resolve problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the system breaks down, this lack of accountability obliges 
grain growers to bear the brunt of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our grain handling and transportation system cannot utilize the 
latest techniques of logistics, such as just-in-time delivery. 
Grain takes too long to move from farm to port, and ships all 
too often have to wait for the grain. 
Worse yet, grain sits in storage facilities monopolizing them 
until it can be sold.  All of these problems have cast doubt in 
the minds of some of Canada's clients on its reliability as a 
supplier of grain.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of this bill is to improve the system of grain 
transportation in western Canada, but not just there, because we 
are very interested in the transportation of this commodity in 
Ontario and Quebec as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before telling the House where we are going, it is important to 
know where we have been.  In 1997 when I was appointed to this 
position it was quite obvious that we had a massive problem as a 
result of the breakdown in the transportation system I described 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to Winnipeg with my colleagues and we met with all the 
stakeholders.  That was an interesting meeting because the grain 
companies, the producers, the railways, the ports and other 
interested parties were represented.   All stakeholders were 
represented.  Everyone came to the same conclusion:  that the 
system was broken, that we had to fix it, and that any delay or 
lack of action would be disastrous to everyone involved in the 
transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also said that we needed a reference point.  We needed some 
individual whose reputation was such that he or she could effect 
an impartial analysis and come forward with recommendations. This 
is important because there is a lot of hostility, a lot of 
division, which goes back 100 years or more in western Canada 
among the various stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been around this place off and on for quite a long time. 
I had the honour to sit as vice-chairman of the transport 
committee between 1974 and 1978.  I listened to the debates in 
that committee with people like Don Mazankowski, Jack Horner and 
Les Benjamin from three different parties.  Jack Horner crossed 
the floor to the Liberals.  At the time he was a Tory but then he 
saw the light and came to us, and he paid for his sin.  They were 
giants on the stage in the House.  They understood western 
Canada.  They understood the enmities.  They understood the 
disparities.  They understood the need for accommodation on the 
part of everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned a bit as a guy from Toronto about this issue, the 
divisions, and how sensitive one must be to finding an equitable 
solution.  That is why we appointed former Justice Willard Estey. 
No one disagreed with that appointment.  He is someone of 
incredible reputation, born and bred in Saskatchewan.  He 
understood the needs of producers, practised corporate law, and 
had been on the bench.  He came forward with a report, the basic 
thrust of which we endorsed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a report that was well based on consultation.  He met 
with a thousand or more stakeholders.  He convened 147 meetings. 
He listened to people.  He applied his intellectual and physical 
energies basically full time to this issue.  He submitted 15 
recommendations on commercializing the grain handling and 
transportation system, and the government endorsed his vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not enough.  It is one thing to have the conceptual 
framework.  It is another thing to have the practical steps to 
implement a concept.  Therefore I asked Arthur Kroeger, former 
deputy minister, again like Justice Estey a recipient of the 
Order of Canada and someone of high repute, to take the concepts 
and the recommendations of Justice Estey, flesh them out and try 
to put them in a manageable form so that we could implement the 
concepts.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Kroeger was well suited to this.  Not only was he a former 
deputy minister of transport, but he was from a small town in 
Alberta near the Saskatchewan border and grew up with this issue. 
We had two individuals who knew the west, knew the history and 
had the intellect to deal with a very complex problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Kroeger was able to reach a consensus on a number of issues, 
which was quite an achievement given the difference of opinions 
expressed by participants.  However no agreement could be found 
on the starting level for the annual cap on railway revenues, on 
the transportation role of the wheat board and on ways to achieve 
enhanced railway competition.  In the end, Mr. Kroeger completed 
his terms of reference last September by providing his own 
recommendations for the three unresolved issues. I do thank him 
for that degree of initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we announced on May 10 was the government's response to the 
broad range of advice over the entire consultation period.  As I 
said earlier, I realize that this has dragged on and that the 
introduction of legislation took longer than some people wanted. 
I truly regret, from the point of view especially of the members 
of the opposition, that the timetable is so short that full 
debate in the House will not be possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had wanted this issue to be more fully aired but by agreeing 
today to have one speaking time per party, the opposition has 
shown that it wants to get this into committee quickly.  I am 
prepared to go to committee next Monday to answer questions and 
deal with this bill in detail if the House chooses to agree to 
give it second reading today.  I believe that is where the real 
discussions should take place.  In regretting the fact that we do 
not have enough time to give the members the say they would like 
in the House, I would hope that we could somehow obviate that in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that when a policy is required in 
complex matters more consultation is the best option and an open 
dialogue is important.  That is why we did not rush decisions. We 
worked diligently on the details until we found the right 
balance, one that will benefit all system participants.  There 
was a range of views on this side of the House, it is no secret, 
as there is a range of views on the other side of the House.  I 
personally met with many stakeholders a number of times over the 
last two years.  Everyone really has been consulted and whatever 
one's position is on the bill and the proposals that we have 
announced, no one can fault us for at least consulting those 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the voices of the farmers, the grain companies, 
the wheat board and the railways.  I know that this proposal and 
the bill does not please everyone but we have to start somewhere. 
We had to break the logjam and that is what we have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we announced the policy framework on May 10, we focused on 
six main issues that would improve the system.  I will outline 
these issues because they are very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that dealing with cost is one of the 
important steps to reach a worldclass grain logistics system.  It 
is an area where Canada needs to improve.  Currently the 
producers are facing escalating freight costs and not enough 
sharing by the railways and grain companies of productivity 
gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the government is repealing the maximum rate scale 
in section 147 of the Canada Transportation Act and replacing it 
with a cap on annual grain revenues earned by Canadian National 
and Canadian Pacific.  A revenue cap in our view will promote 
price flexibility while safeguarding producers from rate 
increases.  The change will see an estimated reduction of $178 
million from the estimated effective rate 2000-01.  That is a lot 
of money and that is money that will find its way into the 
pockets of the people who need it, the grain farmers in western 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have argued that this reduction is only $124 million 
because of the 4.5% inflationary adjustment that the Canadian 
Transportation Agency recommended some weeks ago.  I want to 
remind those critics that should this bill not be implemented by 
August 1, less than three months from now, then the 4.5% rate 
increase would be very real to the farmers in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in the House have to make sure that this $178 million 
decrease in railway freight revenues goes forward.  I cannot 
believe anyone would stand and say that they would block an 
initiative that would give farmers money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the earlier discourse by my friend from the 
Canadian Alliance, the agriculture critic from Manitoba, on a 
previous motion.  He was talking about the farming crisis in 
Canada, especially in western Canada.  Accepting the premise of 
his arguments that these are tough times for farmers, then let us 
do something about it.  Let us start to improve the grain 
transportation system and let us put money on the table that the 
farmers desperately need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not trying to imply in any way that there will be any 
attempt by members in the House to deny farmers the early passage 
of this bill so the money can start flowing on August 1.  I do 
think everyone has to realize that this is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government feels that it is important for all farmers to 
have the opportunity to experience the cost reduction because the 
new revenue cap provisions we have announced will be monitored by 
the Canadian Transportation Agency.  If a railway violates the 
revenue cap it will be forced to repay the excess revenue plus a 
penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further protect against possible price gouging on branch 
lines, we have introduced protection for these shippers in the 
form of a rate limit tied into grain rates on nearby mainlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in the House would agree that farmers deserve a break. 
They need a logistic system that will move their grain to market 
at the lowest possible cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also looking to the wheat board to help accomplish the 
task of triggering new competition.  The question was how this 
should be done.  The role of the wheat board is one of the more 
divisive issues in western Canada.  Seeing it from afar, I can 
understand both sides of the argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our friend from the New Democratic Party, in a comment he made 
during the previous debate on the motion, talked about the 
lessons of the 1920s and the depression, and the genesis for the 
creation of the wheat board in, I believe, 1943.  Friends from 
the Alliance were saying that times have changed.  Well, they are 
both right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty tough for a Liberal to stand in the House of 
Commons and say that both the Alliance and the New Democrats are 
right on the same issue, but we cannot lose the lessons from the 
past.  We cannot ignore what the New Democratic member was saying 
about the terrible deprivation and struggles that farmers had 
during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s but, on the other hand, times 
change.  There are modern technologies and new systems for 
logistics.  The entire world has changed.  The global trading 
patterns have changed.  In that sense, the Alliance is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have done in this bill, perhaps not to the liking of the 
Alliance and some others, is that we are now starting to move the 
wheat board.  We are moving to the recommendation of Justice 
Estey who said that the wheat board's role in transportation 
should be reduced.  In fact he said it should be eliminated, but 
we can eliminate something by reducing it in various ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is whether or not, in the long run, the wheat board 
will still have a role in transportation, as Mr. Estey 
recommended, or whether there is some middle ground which takes 
into account the concerns raised by my friends on the New 
Democratic side and, quite frankly, the members on our side of 
the House, in particular my two colleagues from Winnipeg who are 
well versed in this subject and have been immeasurably 
constructive in this whole debate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are starting to move with the wheat board.  Some have argued 
that the wheat board should be removed entirely, as I have said, 
Mr. Estey and others.  Others have argued that we have just moved 
to democratize the wheat board and therefore it needs time to 
prove it can deliver benefits to farmers.  We listened to both 
sides, weighed the pros and the cons, and identified a level of 
change that will allow the grain handling and transportation 
system to move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board, through the introduction of a tendering 
activity, will drive costs out of the system.  This increased 
competition between grain companies and railways will be 
beneficial.  They will be held accountable and made competitive 
for logistic services provided for tendered grain. The change 
will allow the grain companies to better control their own assets 
and will increase overall efficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The details of this part of our reforms will be contained in a 
memorandum of understanding to be signed between my colleague 
responsible for the wheat board and the board before Bill C-34 
comes into force.  The MOU is a firm commitment from the board to 
introduce a more commercial system and once in place it will be 
made public at the earliest appropriate date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that we can make this public tomorrow so that the 
members on the other side can have the weekend to look at it 
before I go to committee on Monday.  That is not a promise but 
that is something on which I have been working with my colleague 
responsible for the wheat board, because in fairness, the members 
on the other side whose role is to criticize the government must 
have the tools at their disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working around the clock to get the consultations done. I 
hope my colleague responsible for the wheat board, in response to 
speeches a little later, will be able to clarify that.  In a 
perfect world I would like to see my colleagues on the other side 
go home tomorrow afternoon with some weekend reading, which would 
be the MOU between the government and the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the revenue cap and the new role for the wheat board deal 
with commercializing grain institutions that until now have been 
run as administrative and regulatory solutions.  The government 
also wants to ensure that shippers are protected from the 
exercise of unfair market power to buy the railways.  As a 
result, we are introducing changes to the final offer arbitration 
provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shipper community has stressed that the final offer 
arbitration is too long and expensive.  At the same time, 
shippers have said that they would not support changes that would 
harm the effectiveness of this particular dispute solving 
mechanism. Again, we listened to the complaints and we are 
amending the appropriate provisions of the act to allow for 
simultaneous exchange of offers and a summary process that is 
shorter, less costly and will assist small shippers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people, including my colleagues in the Liberal caucus from 
western Canada, are looking for changes in railway track access 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Where? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues from 
western Canada were so exhausted by the advice they gave me that 
I told them not to worry, that I would carry the debate this 
morning and that they could come back this afternoon and have a 
repartee with the opposition.  They have been remarkable.  They 
have been up nights. The agricultural committee of the Liberal 
caucus and the northern and western caucus have been marvellous 
to work with.  It has been one of the greatest experiences of my 
parliamentary life to have that give and take, that thrust and 
parry and to come forward with a consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues are looking for changes in railway track access 
rules as a means to increase rail competition.  As I say, it is a 
tough issue, especially in the rail sector where there are only 
two companies and obviously they dominate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Estey recommended enhancing running rights to allow any 
person to apply for the right to run on another railway's line. 
This change would effectively open up running rights to 
provincial short lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Kroeger suggested that further study was needed on all 
methods to increase competition, especially running rights. Other 
open access proposals came along late in the review process, 
including the idea of promoting a regional railway. 
We have listened to all these views, as we have listened to 
everything else, and have decided to refer this particular 
complex part of the equation of open access, including enhanced 
running rights and the regional railway concept, to the upcoming 
statutory review of the act which must begin no later than July 1.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now busy working on the terms of reference for this 
review.  The terms of reference will state unequivocally that the 
issue of open access, joint running rights and regional railway 
concepts are to be examined on a priority basis with an interim 
report no later than six months after it starts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that some people have said that we should deal with this 
right now.  Let us not plunge into a system-wide experiment that 
may affect the reliability of our entire system just for the sake 
of saying that our industry is competitive.   If we want to do 
what is right for our national transportation system and for the 
grain farmers, we need to examine this particular component 
closely in a forum that allows all stakeholders to express their 
views.  Some stakeholders have already indicated they are looking 
forward to providing representation on ways to enhance 
competition in the railway sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is extremely important for farmers to have a logistic 
system that moves their grain quickly and inexpensively, it is 
also important that railways are able to make appropriate choices 
to cut costs and increase investment and productivity.   Equally 
important is the ability of smaller operations to increase their 
chances at continuing business and to provide competition in the 
rail sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our objectives when we introduced the Canada 
Transportation Act in 1996 was to establish a regime that would 
see short line railways come forward.   This has been really 
quite successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty per cent of all the lines filed for abandonment under the 
1996 CTA have been short line, including in western Canada.  That 
of course is not satisfactory for those communities on those 
railways that have been abandoned and not taken up by short 
lines.  However, I do not think anyone can dispute that there was 
a degree of overbuilding by the railways, especially in some 
parts of western Canada.  There could be no economic 
justification, in our changing times, with access to motor 
vehicle transport and better roads, for some abandonments to take 
place.  However, 80% of those that filed for abandonment by CN 
and CP going to short line rail is a pretty good accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill addresses a number of problems that were identified 
during the grain consultation process.  The amendments to the act 
will help to further encourage the establishment of short line 
railways in all parts of Canada.  It will also help out 
communities that lose a grain dependent line by having the 
railways provide transitional compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I must say that I am very sympathetic to the 
members from western Canada who have drawn attention to this 
aspect of the 1996 act.  This will be a focus in the first six 
months of the review because there are ramifications in other 
parts of the country, especially in large urban areas like 
greater Toronto, greater Vancouver and big cities like Montreal 
where the railways, by virtue of changing patterns and better 
highway system, are moving out of the core.  They wish to abandon 
lines in the centre of these cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, it is folly to rip up track if there is a potential 
use whether by a short line or a freight operator, as we have 
seen under the act, in parts of western Canada, Ontario, Quebec 
and elsewhere; or if those rights of way can be used for commuter 
and urban transit.  A municipality in Halifax right now is 
considering the purchase of a line that CN wants to abandon. This 
would alleviate congestion in Halifax.  The same thing is 
happening Toronto.  It is the same in Vancouver with the Arbutus 
line which is a potential corridor from Vancouver airport to the 
downtown core. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something we have to be very sensitive to.  I am 
certainly very cognizant of getting a better handle on the 
abandonment process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does recognize that when we do abandon, 
especially trackage in western Canada, it puts increased pressure 
on rural roads.  As a result, the Government of Canada will be 
prepared to make a contribution of $175 million over five years 
to help address this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do these provisions help us move toward a worldclass 
system but they will provide a better protection for communities. 
Too many communities in western Canada have suffered because 
their rail lines have gone.  The way of life represented by these 
towns is an important part of the fabric of this country and must 
be preserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are giving communities a new chance to take a 
direct involvement in the operation of their local branch lines. 
That is why we want to improve grain roads to assist these 
communities and to keep them thriving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no good if this country ends up having all its population 
living in Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, 
Vancouver and other large cities.  Rural Canada is an indelible 
part of who we are as a people and it must be preserved.  The 
Liberal Party will preserve it and this bill does preserve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this type of environment, it is important that the benefits 
of reforms are seen by all system participants.  That is why we 
are introducing a monitoring mechanism.  Continuous monitoring 
will be designed and implemented by an independent, private 
sector third party that will measure and assess the impact of 
reforms on farmers, on the wheat board, on the efficiency of the 
system, including the ports, and on the overall performance of 
the grain handling and transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mechanism of monitoring will help the government determine 
if changes are making the appropriate impact.  As I have said, 
the grain industry is too important to Canada's economy and to 
our way of life for us not to monitor these changes closely.  The 
fact that it is being done at arm's length will put paid to any 
notion that somehow this is an inside evaluation done by the 
government for its own nefarious reasons.  We would never do 
that.  The fact that this will be independent, arm's length 
monitoring underscores our sincerity.  I know the hon. members on 
the other side understand that the government is sincere about 
continuous monitoring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the wheat board, the grain companies and the railways 
will have to work together to develop new industry procedures 
that reflect the changes.  If they choose to compete and if they 
choose to manage the system effectively, then the system will 
reach its full potential and farmers will benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has introduced this bill which is the main part 
of a reform package that will modernize the grain handling and 
transportation system.  If we want a worldclass grain logistics 
system, then we need to move forward.  We need to make the system 
more accountable, more efficient and more cost-effective.  The 
package within this bill is part of a move to bring us closer to 
that goal of efficiency and competitiveness.  Canadian farmers 
deserve this type of system.  They need it to maximize their 
advantages in the global marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that we have a narrow window of opportunity in terms 
of the parliamentary time to get this package in place.  Again, I 
want to thank the members on the other side for their support and 
co-operation in getting this bill through.  I truly believe that 
by embarking on this step we will see competition improve in the 
years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member from outside of western Canada, if I can make the 
observation, I think there is an element of fear based on history 
and past practices of stakeholders that inhibits the embracing of 
total reform.  That is understandable.  When people have been at 
the mercy of the elements and at the mercy of big institutions, 
like the railway companies and the grain companies, they know 
that the farming they are engaged in is always fraught with 
difficulty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it was U.S. President Roosevelt, going back to 1932-33, 
who said that the greatest fear is fear itself on the part of the 
people.  I understand that fear.  I understand those people who 
say that the wheat board is their only guarantor of fairness and 
equity.  It is the only one that will be there to regulate the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board has an important role and will continue to have 
an important role in the marketing of grain, but what is at issue 
in this debate is its role in transportation, logistics and to 
what degree it should remove itself in the name of greater 
competitiveness.  It is not inconceivable that once we start 
along this path those people who had fear in the past will see 
that their fears are now assuaged in a way that will permit them 
to introduce even greater flexibility and competitiveness down 
the road.  I really believe that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is a dynamism in western Canada and in the farming 
community that is really quite admirable, especially among 
younger farmers going into other crops, into lentils, peas, 
barley, soya and all these various non-grain crops.  There is now 
more food processing being done in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in the old days, when I was first a member, it was always 
the point that we had to change the Crow and make changes to the 
transportation regulatory system so that competitive forces could 
be unleashed and secondary manufacturing processing could be done 
in western Canada.  That is now happening.  Diversification of 
the farming community and greater processing is being done, and 
we welcome that.  Meat processing is not done in the stockyards 
in Toronto on St. Clair Avenue anymore.  It is done in places 
like Calgary and other cities in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is that right from the point of view of economics, but 
it is right from the point of view of social equity as a nation. 
For too long too much of the production was done in the large 
centres in the east.  Now we are seeing a greater diversification 
and a greater equality in the economic activity across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that vein, this act, if passed, and I hope it will be passed 
expeditiously, will be another landmark reform that enables 
producers, other interested parties and stakeholders in western 
Canada to gain better economic solidarity, better prospects, 
become more prosperous and ensure Canada's reputation as one of 
the greatest farming nations in the world and certainly one of 
the greatest grain producing farmers in the world.

would lead off a debate on a bill like this one, which is

for this since 1996.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to do something which is rare and congratulate the 
Minister of Transport.  The minister admitted that he does not 
always get his own way.  We in western Canada, all of the farmers 
in western Canada, wish that he had gotten his own way because 
the minister tried to bring about what Chief Justice Estey along 
with Mr. Kroeger recommended.  That was denied to him by his 
seatmate, the minister in charge of the wheat board, and a few 
Liberals from the city of Winnipeg.  That is a fact and it will 
not be missed by the people of western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the minister for his vision.  A minister from the 
great city of Toronto could see the problems in western Canada, 
but the minister in charge of the wheat board and other hon. 
members refused to look at the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the year 2000, but this bill in many ways will take us 
back to the 1950s.  Hospitals do not use 1950s X-ray machines. We 
do not see farmers running around with Massey-Harris 17 combines. 
We do not see a DC Caterpillar building roads.  With this bill 
the Canadian Wheat Board will be empowered with a role it was 
never designed to have in the first place.  The wheat board will 
now have a dual role.  It will be involved in a more intricate 
way with transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I watched what happened in 1996 with the railways.  For the 
record, the instructions given by the government to Chief Justice 
Estey were “To ensure that Canada has the most efficient, viable 
and competitive grain handling and transportation system”.  He 
did just that.  However, when the report came back indicating 
that there would be more openness and more competitiveness which 
would allow the grain industry in western Canada to let the wheat 
board play a role in direct negotiation with the railways, the 
Minister of Transport got shot down by his own party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister in his speech referred to hundreds of meetings 
during a two year period.  Mr. Estey and Mr. Kroeger never 
changed their reports.  These learned gentlemen recommended in 
language which everybody understood that Canada needed a 
commercially driven system.  These learned gentlemen were not 
interested in protecting the status quo.  That had failed.  They 
were not interested in protecting an institution.  They brought 
back a report which would ensure that Canada had the most 
efficient, viable and competitive grain handling and 
transportation system.  These gentlemen were not out to penalize 
the railways.  They wanted the cheapest freight rate possible to 
deliver grain to market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House that this will not last.  This issue will 
come back to us in a few years.  We will have to go through this 
whole issue again simply because this does not meet the needs of 
this century.

time with my colleague from Selkirk—Interlake, if that is 
permissible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  That will take unanimous consent 
because the hon. member is seeking to split a 40 minute speech. 
Is there unanimous consent to permit the hon. member to split his 
speech?  I assume it would be on an equal basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this bill will not bring 
grain transportation into this century.  As a matter of fact, I 
would suggest that this bill demonstrates the failure of the 
government to honestly look at the recommendations of Estey and 
Kroeger.  It has really put those recommendations through the 
shredder.  It has paid little or no attention to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is bad enough for the farmers in western Canada, who are 
fighting a subsidy war, to have their input costs driven up 98%, 
but I want to look at a few other figures to demonstrate what has 
happened in the last 15 years.  Grain elevation costs are up 52%. 
Canadian Wheat Board costs are up 56%.  With all due respect to 
the big bad railways, their freight rate has actually decreased, 
due to other measures, some 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned one time in a speech in the House that when a person 
is in grade six in Saskatchewan they have to take as part of the 
curriculum a course to learn to hate the railways.  Again, that 
is a very popular theme.  However, let us say that both Canadian 
Pacific and Canadian National are not so irate as the minister 
mentioned because of the forced 18% reduction.  What they are 
irate about is that they are being forced into a contractual 
agreement not with the elevator companies, not with the grain 
companies, but with a government agency.  That is what is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the minister of minerals interfere with potash or coal? 
Would the minister interfere with the shipment of those products 
to market?  No way.  That is exactly what Justice Estey and Mr. 
Kroeger recommended.  Get out of it.  Both the CPR and the CNR 
would tell us “Give us a completely commercialized system and we 
will show you further freight rate reductions”.  That is what 
Justice Estey said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  His report was put through the shredder.  I have 
given credit to the transport minister.  However, he had to 
concede to his colleagues, and that is too bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to everyone in the House that the amount of money 
which will be saved because of the 18% reduction will be short 
lived.  I also suggest that in a few short years we will be right 
back discussing this issue in the House again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge what the minister said about the memorandum of 
understanding.  I would have liked to have had that sooner. 
If the Canadian Wheat Board is to enter into the negotiation 
process through the ports of Vancouver, Prince Rupert, Thunder 
Bay and Churchill, then I want to get into the age-old problem of 
who decides which port.  It has been said that wheat is 16% 
protein and the rest is politics.  Now it will become more 
politics, not less.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House an example.  If we have a sale of No. 2 
milling flour for the Asian market, it is then up to anyone who 
has any degree of responsibility to move that shipment and the 
tonnage required through the port which will represent the least 
cost.  If it should happen to be that the least cost would be to 
ship it through Prince Rupert, that is where it should go.  If, 
for instance, they are servicing the South American market and 
that same grain can be moved at a reduction in the freight cost 
through Port Churchill, then that is where it should go.  That 
has not happened in the past and I do not think it will happen in 
the future.  I know that is not in the best interests of those 
who produce the grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be of interest to know that the same union which 
handles the facilities at Lakehead is the same union that handles 
the facilities at Port Churchill.  They hate each other now. They 
do not want each other to have any more grain.  Where is the 
biggest interest?  I see my colleague from Thunder Bay.  There is 
more interest in Thunder Bay.  There are more MPs.  There are 
more votes.  That is where politics gets into grain, and it 
always has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No requirements have been specified.  There is nothing within 
this bill in respect of the conduct of the Canadian Wheat Board 
in the process of tendering or operating under the contractual 
system.  We have some questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board is taking on a new role.  It is getting into the 
shipping business.  I would like to ask these questions.  Will 
the wheat board fall under the Canada Transportation Agency? 
Will it fall under the agency that deals with fairness in 
competition? To whom will the wheat board report?  Certainly not 
to the House, because information we want from the wheat board is 
protected under the Privacy Act.  It and CSIS are the only two 
institutions which are so protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the producers, the grain companies and the railways know 
outside the tendering process what the implications will be?  I 
understand from the railways that they are going to have to 
provide to the wheat board certain information which is strictly 
confidential to the railway's operation, but the wheat board, in 
turn, does not have to provide that information to the industry. 
We have a real problem with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk briefly about the regulatory powers to 
control car allocation.  Gone are the days of the order book.  In 
three years the old block ordering of cars will be obsolete.  We 
are in a brand new era.  The wheat board knows exactly what 
elevator, what commodity, what grain and what type of grain is in 
every elevator in Saskatchewan and across the west.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All it has to do is provide those elevators, those companies 
that have the grain, with the shipping order.  Let them bid and 
see who can get the cheapest rate to get that grain to market. 
That is what the report said.  That is what Estey said. That is 
what Kroeger said.  They wanted to bring Canada into this new 
century. Unfortunately that is not going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Minister of Transport's colleague would like us 
to say that the Canadian Alliance is going to oppose the bill. 
That is what he would like but he is not going to fool anyone. We 
are going to oppose the bill through motions in committee.  We 
will support the bill because it is the end of the crop year and 
because of the August 1 deadline.  It is a temporary measure to 
save the farmers some money but it is not the answer.  We will be 
back and back until they bring us into this century to provide us 
with what Kroeger and Justice Estey recommended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry the minister did not get his way on this.  I wish he 
had.  Certainly the people in western Canada wish he had. They 
feel very much betrayed by the minister in charge of the wheat 
board and those ministers opposite who live in the city of 
Winnipeg. They will not forget this.  It will be forever on their 
minds. I will do my part as a representative not just of my party 
but of my constituency and those across Canada to let them know 
that once more the thousands of dollars that went into the report 
literally went through a paper shredder.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on probably one 
of the most important issues to affect western Canada and in 
effect the whole country with the reform of the rail 
transportation pertaining to grain handling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister said, all those involved in the western grain 
handling and transportation system agree that the system is 
broken and it must be fixed.  This includes farmers, grain 
companies and yes, even the regulators like the NFU and the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  They agree that something has to be done 
because the system is not great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The western Canadian grain industry however has not been well 
served by the legislation that is being brought in today.  The 
problem is not the consensus among the farmers and the farm 
community.  The problem is clearly the difference between those 
who highly regulate the grain industry and farmers through the 
use of monopolies and those that would use the democratic free 
market system to attain the most efficient and effective grain 
transportation system.  Clearly that is what the debate is about. 
It is sad to see that once again the regulators held sway with 
the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about who speaks for farmers, we should make one 
quick point that the farmers own two grain companies, the 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and Agricore which represents Alberta and 
Manitoba.  Also, farmers are on the board of directors of the 
United Grain Growers. 
Representatives of private industry are primarily James 
Richardson with Pioneer, Cargill, Louis Dreyfus and the Patterson 
grain company out west.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people and organizations identified very clearly to the 
minister on behalf of farmers, the very people that would make or 
break from changes to the grain transportation system, that the 
whole system has to move to a commercial contract system of 
moving grain.  They did not ask to move an inch.  They did not 
ask to move a foot. They asked to move the whole yard to the goal 
line. That is why I say today that this solution will not work in 
the best interests of farmers in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague said, the Canadian Alliance will support this 
legislation only with the recognition that the Liberal government 
is only capable of dealing with the western grain industry 
through regulation and cannot see its way clear to move to the 
marketplace to have it improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current system is rigid, unaccountable and does not 
efficiently serve the needs of the participants including 
farmers.  Severe systemic breakdowns in the handling and 
transportation system which recur every few years are 
demonstrations of this need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system does not just cost farmers.  When the problems reach 
the news it costs them money every day.  The inefficient use of 
our grain handling and transportation system means that every day 
farmers pay far too much to get their grain to port.  It is not 
because of the fact that there is not enough regulation, it is 
because there is too much regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the control the Canadian Wheat Board exerts over the 
system, grain companies and railways cannot manage their 
facilities and equipment in the most efficient manner.  For 
example, railways and grain companies have tried to set up 
regularly scheduled grain trains that would cycle between primary 
elevators on the prairies and the terminal elevators at the 
ports.  These types of dedicated trains would be able to bypass 
railway switching yards, would make more efficient use of railway 
and grain company staff and would allow grain companies to better 
plan the arrival of ships and save farmers millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister referred to just on time deliveries.  The rest of 
the Canadian economy has moved to that system.  A regulated 
system is being imposed on the western Canadian grain industry 
when the rest of the country is benefiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of the famous free trade debate.  Ontario and 
Quebec were most fortunate over the years to have had the auto 
pact agreement and eventually the free trade agreement which 
included the rest of the country.  Here again, why can western 
Canadian grain farmers not be included along with the rest of the 
industries of this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the debacle in the winter of 1997 former Justice Willard 
Estey was asked to review the western grain handling and 
transportation system and to recommend changes to the government. 
Much to the government's surprise, he did exactly what it asked 
him to do and recommended changes to improve the system.  The 
underlying theme of Justice Estey's 15 different recommendations 
is the need for a more open, market based grain handling and 
transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key recommendations from Justice Estey involved the 
role of the Canadian Wheat Board.  I would like to point out that 
neither Justice Estey nor Mr. Kroeger nor the Canadian Alliance 
is recommending that the Canadian Wheat Board be disbanded.  In 
the case of these amendments to the Canadian Transportation Act 
the recommendation, including our position, is that the Canadian 
Wheat Board should be at the port level doing what its job is, 
marketing grains on behalf of farmers and doing the best job 
possible. That is where it can increase the farmers' income.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like a government sitting in Ottawa trying to micromanage 
the Canadian economy.  That is what the government is trying to 
do through the wheat board with the Canadian grain industry.  One 
cannot run a grain industry from the backrooms of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the recommendations Mr. Estey put forward were implemented, 
the Canadian Wheat Board would hire the grain companies to move 
grain to the port through an auction process, a tendering 
process, and the grain companies would be responsible for 
arranging freight with the railways.  Producers would sign 
contracts with grain companies for the delivery of the grain. 
This recommendation is required if we are to replace the current 
centrally planned system with a commercial contract driven 
system.  However, as I pointed out, the Liberal government did 
not like the recommendations which would have softened the 
Canadian Wheat Board's ironclad hold on western grain farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just say one last thing about the Canadian Wheat Board. 
The farmers should be able to have a vote with the delivery of 
their grain to the marketer of their choice.  It may be according 
to the Canadian Wheat Board in particular that all the farmers, 
knowing the big advantages the wheat board puts out, would 
continue to market the farmers' grain, but let us let the farmer 
decide that for himself based on his own farm's best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Kroeger appeared before the Standing Committee on Transport. 
He stated, “My conclusion was very much along the line of 
Justice Estey's, that unless you went to a more commercial 
system, you could not really achieve major improvements”.  Mr. 
Kroeger gave the federal government a progressive report that if 
implemented, would be a step toward a more efficient, commercial, 
accountable western grain handling and transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point I have mentioned all the grain companies, the 
railways, many farmers, and the two gentlemen who did special 
studies and held massive consultations across the country.  To me 
the evidence is overwhelming as to where we should have moved as 
a country and where this legislation should be today, but it is 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Western farmers repeatedly said that freight is one of their 
major costs, approximately one-third of the expenses in most 
cases.  Over and over again farmers ask why they are the only 
commodity group where the producer pays the freight and is 
responsible for the condition and any added cost for the product 
throughout the shipping network. The farmer consistently ends up 
holding the bag in this whole system.  That should have been 
changed, could have been changed, but it has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prairie Farm Commodity Coalition estimates that reforms to 
the current grain handling transportation system could have saved 
farmers over $300 million annually.  That figure can be argued 
either way a bit, but it is certainly more than the estimated 
$178 million the minister is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that the figure of $178 million is 
based upon the idea of about 30 million tonnes of grain delivery 
in a year.  The fact is that in 1998, the figure was only about 
$26 million.  Once again, just like in the AIDA program, the 
government is throwing out figures that sound great and glorious, 
but when it comes down to the final crux and the farmer sees his 
final bill, we may see that the saving to farmers is not the $178 
million the government is putting out to the newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effects in the long term and even in the short term of two 
or three years may soon come home to roost and show that this 
legislation has done little or nothing for farmers, as they see 
the loss of exports, if this system does not improve. 
I question that this will improve the system sufficiently for our 
customers to consider us to be a reliable exporter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is claiming that the system will be more 
commercial and accountable because it is reducing the role of the 
Canadian Wheat Board in grain transportation.  Sadly this is not 
the case.  Key to the government's plan is a memorandum of 
understanding that will detail how the Canadian Wheat Board will 
carry out the tendering process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should remind everyone interested in the debate who is 
listening, including many city people, that the Canadian Wheat 
Board is simply an arm of the government.  It is directly under 
the control of the resource minister and the Canadian Wheat Board 
minister whom I call the Regina minister.  We have recently found 
in this debate that we have the Toronto minister.  Now we also 
have the Regina minister.  I do not know exactly what handle has 
been attached to the minister of agriculture yet, but we will 
wait and see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope to see the MOU entered here.  We have asked and had 
conflicting statements from the ministers with regard to it.  I 
think we will find it difficult to pin down the triumvirate of 
the agriculture minister, the transport minister and the wheat 
board minister as to who will be the real spokesman.  I encourage 
the Prime Minister to allow the transport minister to be the 
spokesman for this legislation and to have the minister of the 
wheat board step back and let the responsibility fall where it 
should with the transport minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that the Canadian Wheat Board will draft any 
proposal that will reduce its ironclad control over the grain 
handling and transportation system.  Under the MOU the Canadian 
Wheat Board will likely still be directly negotiating with the 
railways for hopper cars, even for the 25% of grain movement that 
will be tendered to the grain companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, nothing has changed.  The Canadian Wheat Board is 
still between the grain companies and the railways.  This system 
is neither commercial nor accountable.  The Liberal government's 
decision comes after the Canadian Wheat Board launched an 
estimated $200,000 advertising campaign against the changes 
proposed by Justice Estey and Mr. Kroeger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the recent Liberal policy convention, the Liberal delegates 
overwhelmingly passed a motion calling for the Canadian Wheat 
Board's continued involvement in the grain handling and 
transportation system.  Instead of listening to Canadian farmers, 
the Liberal transport minister has listened to Liberal delegates, 
the majority of whom come from outside western Canada.  He has 
listened to the Canadian Wheat Board lobby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big players, the players that are actually being affected by 
the legislation, were relatively unanimous.  From the level of 
farmer through to the grain companies and the railways, those who 
were direct players in this system were not listened to as we see 
from the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many farmers are appreciative of having regulated freight rates 
lowered.  I have stated already that I agree it will be 
beneficial to have those rates lowered, but I do not think that 
many farmers totally agree with the Liberal caucus and the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ad hoc coalition for transport reform actually represents 14 
farm organizations in five provinces.  There are officials from 
the grain industry.  I did not mention this, but the people at 
the ports of Vancouver, Prince Rupert and Thunder Bay are also 
concerned.  The government of Alberta is involved.  The Canadian 
Industrial Transportation Association and the Northwest Corridor 
Development Corporation are involved in advocating on behalf of 
this system.  The coalition stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are firmly convinced that reforming the grain handling and 
transportation system will lower transportation costs to farmers, 
increase competition and make Canada's grain delivery system more 
effective for our farmers.  But a balanced package is needed.  If 
the government only acts on the railway issues, it will 
accomplish nothing and could make the system even worse.  That is 
why we want the government to take immediate action on the most 
important issue and to end the role of the Canadian Wheat Board 
in transportation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how much more overwhelming it could be to the 
government than all the documentation it has received from the 
coalitions, grain companies, farmers and many others.  Surely the 
weight of opinion should have carried the day.  Even someone not 
knowing anything about the grain handling system and talking pure 
economics would have told the minister that regulating a 
commercial enterprise was the most inefficient way of doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only look at many crown corporations.  I think of the 
B.C. ferries and the wonderful things governments have tried to 
do in the area of commercial enterprise.  It does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only look back to when the government owned Canadian 
National Railway.  Why oh why did our grain not move in the most 
efficient and cost effective way when the government owned 
Canadian National Railways?  It was because when the government 
owned that railway it was highly regulated.  There were no market 
signals to bring efficiencies into it.  Every time there needed 
to be a wage settlement, pay raises and that kind of thing, there 
was no relation to market forces.  It was just that it was the 
government and it had taxpayer money.  The government could take 
that money from taxpayers whether or not they wanted the 
government to have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, we ended up with Canadian National Railway dragging 
down Canadian Pacific Railway into the same mediocrity.  That is 
what is wrong with the whole regulated system.  If it could have 
worked, it would have worked when the government owned CN 
Railway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those comments I think I have made the point quite clearly 
that the highly regulated system being imposed on Canadian 
farmers, the rail industry, the grain companies and the ports 
will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave this last message.  We in the Canadian Alliance 
will be continuing to advocate and pressure for the real changes 
needed to make our western Canadian farmers economically 
self-sustainable and for the whole industry to prosper and 
contribute to the well-being of Canadians across the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I rise today to speak to Bill C-34.  My remarks 
will focus on the following three areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I wish to immediately say that the Bloc Quebecois is 
opposed to Bill C-34 for the following reasons:  as we see it, 
this bill authorizing financial assistance to western producers 
is a form of subsidy in disguise.  I will explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we believe that the government's timing in introducing 
Bill C-34 is nothing but a play for votes in western Canada, 
where the Canadian Alliance has a strong base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I will show that this government is inconsistent and that 
there is no link with Canada's transportation policy because the 
measures in this bill address western issues only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will, if I may, give a short background.  A few minutes ago, 
the Minister of Transport said that there had been broad 
consultation and that he had worked closely with Justice Estey 
and reviewed the Kroeger report. However, there seems to be a 
real dichotomy between what this report says and the results we 
saw a few weeks ago. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, on October 5, 1999, the Minister of Transport 
thanked Mr. Kroeger for his great effort in trying to solve the 
problem of grain handling in Western Canada.  He also said that 
this report would be followed up with a study and that he was 
going to address the 12 to 15 recommendations contained in the 
report.  After the report was tabled, three public information 
sessions were held.  Finally, the federal government's policy 
was released a few weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address one of the recommendations of this voluminous 
report. 
This report was submitted to the three ministers who announced 
the federal government's intentions a few weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was submitted to the Minister of Transport, the Minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, and the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food.  At that time, the three of them said 
that they were going to take into consideration all of the 
recommendations made in the report in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the first recommendation contained in the report's 
conclusion.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Estey report urges special measures be taken to revitalize 
some of the ports in the grain handling and transportation 
system; the Ports of Prince Rupert and Churchill, and the 
St. Lawrence Seaway. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report in question is the one from October 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same three ministers turn up again on May 10, 2000—the same 
three tenors, namely the Minister of Transport, the Minister of 
Natural Resources responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, and 
the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food—to announce to us that 
the policy will apply to the ports of Vancouver, Prince Rupert, 
Thunder Bay and Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The St. Lawrence Seaway was forgotten, yet it is, as hon. members 
are aware, an important link for the economy of Quebec.  How can 
the Minister of Transport come this morning to announce to us 
with great fanfare that he was acting on the Estey report, when 
one of its recommendations is not even included in the May 10, 
2000 press release? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wondered if there had been a mistake, if perhaps the three 
ministers had not read certain parts of the report. 
I like to point out the things the Liberals do.  Often, by 
putting documentation together, we can see that things get lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 29,2000, the Minister of Transport introduced a bill to 
reform legislation on grain.  Once again, the minister said he 
had consulted and acted on the Estey report and that this was 
all being done in collaboration with his colleagues.  Here is 
the conclusion of the press release that explained in broad 
terms the content of Bill C-34, which we are debating today: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A memorandum of understanding between the Canadian Wheat Board 
(CWB) and the Minister responsible for the CWB will be in place 
by the time the legislation takes effect. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at second reading today. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The memorandum will provide for the phasing in of more 
competitive tendering by the CWB for logistical services for its 
grain shipments through the ports of Vancouver, Prince Rupert, 
Thunder Bay and Churchill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the government has forgotten the first 
recommendation of the report, which said clearly they would be 
through the ports of Prince Rupert and Churchill and the St. 
Lawrence Seaway.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members know what that means?  It means that once again the 
Liberals opposite are ignoring the existence of Quebec.  The 
entire policy turns on the people in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short term, for the entire economy of Quebec and the 
ports that operate along the seaway—Montreal, Quebec City, 
Baie-Comeau, Port-Cartier and Sept-Îles—this means major economic 
losses.  In the short and medium terms, it means the government 
wants to eliminate the seaway and follow other avenues, so as 
once again to put Quebec at a disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are considering Bill C-34, the grain bill. But all 
what this government has done with respect to transportation 
since 1997 is close control towers in small airports and hand 
back aging ports requiring major investments to municipalities, 
without throwing in any interesting subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government promised to return ports to municipalities and 
other paramunicipal agencies, but the ports it is giving back 
are in terrible shape.  With this policy, it is actually further 
reducing the effectiveness of these five ports, which underpin 
the economy of the St. Lawrence Seaway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is talk of savings and development.  This decision even 
hurts Ontario, because the Great Lakes will now be bypassed. 
There are also ports on the Great Lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this government want?  The crisis now facing western 
producers is also related to the rules of international trade. 
We know that these rules are strict and that they do not allow 
any leeway for governments trying to provide support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government promised the WTO to reduce export 
subsidies and domestic measures and, at the same time, open up 
the market. What are they doing with Bill C-34?  They are taking 
$175 million, sending this amount to help with grain 
transportation, and this becomes a subsidy in disguise designed 
to placate western producers who are mad at the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has always turned towards western Canada. 
If this government had used the normal means of intervention to 
help these people in crisis, the World Trade Organization would 
have said “You are not entitled to do so”.  With Bill C-34, this 
government, which specializes in camouflage, managed to use a 
disguised subsidy of $175 million to help westerners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did that same government do when the Quebec pork producers 
were in crisis?  Nothing.  It hid behind the framework agreement 
between the federal minister of Agriculture and his provincial 
counterparts.  What did the federal government do to help Quebec 
sheep producers with the scrapie situation?  Nothing.  What is 
it doing now to help the very many cranberry growers in my 
riding?  Nothing, once again.  On the other hand, it managed to 
find $175 million to help western producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear this government talking about its national vision, 
its vision from east to west, I find that the vision of Bill 
C-34 starts at Manitoba and runs west to the Pacific, with the 
entire eastern part of the country having been left out.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, they are attacking the port infrastructures of Quebec 
by not even including in this bill the St. Lawrence Seaway, which 
directly links Ontario and Quebec with the United States and 
beyond.  It does not take an advanced course in economics to 
understand that things do not operate east-west, but that what 
needs to be developed is north-south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this government continues to repeat its historical 
errors.  It has no national vision.  That is why the Bloc 
Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-34.  It is a vote-seeking bill. 
There have been election rumours for the past few weeks.  The 
Bloc Quebecois is dying to get out there against the federal 
Liberals. 
The Bloc Quebecois is eager to settle its accounts with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw this in the case of the Young Offenders Act with the 
Minister of Justice including standards in the legislation, once 
again in deference to the west.  Today, with Bill C-34, we see 
the Minister of Transport is continuing the same practice in an 
effort to mollify the west.  But Quebecers will not be taken in 
by the pre-election manoeuvring of the government opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport should reread the entire Estey report, 
especially the first recommendation.  The Minister of Transport 
should also think nationally—one policy from east to west and not 
one for just four provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His colleague, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, should 
be made aware of the problems of Quebec producers, take his 
courage in hand and help them too—which he has not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand the third member of the trio, obviously.  He is 
one of the few Liberals from western Canada who is established 
in his riding and, in addition, he is responsible for the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  I understand he supports this and that he 
is happy to have the Minister of Transport and the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food support Bill C-34. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we have seen since the report is a sort of process in which 
this government is once again neglecting the east and forgetting 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out what this means for 
transportation.  This week, the Commissioner of the Environment 
and Sustainable Development came down quite hard on the current 
Minister of Transport. 
I am going to talk about the Minister of Transport's policy.  I 
am no longer talking about the agricultural sector, about grain, 
or about ports, but about the airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister does not even have the courage and leadership to 
sit down the two parties involved, Canadian International and 
Air Canada, so that they can try to harmonize the various 
collective agreements governing their employees.  What do we 
have right now in airports all over Canada?  Complete chaos, and 
the frustration can be seen in employees' eyes.  Who is getting 
hurt?  Consumers, the people using the airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows that this government and this Minister of Transport 
bungle everything they touch.  We know that the airports are in 
a mess right now. The St. Lawrence Seaway is being ignored. The 
government is introducing western-oriented policies. Eastern 
Canada and Quebec are being forgotten. 
It is high time that this Minister of Transport started paying 
attention to these issues and finding solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-34 and I 
will again give the reasons why.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that $175 million for western producers is a form of 
subsidy in disguise, a way to get around the rules of 
international trade.  It is also nothing more than a play for 
western votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the bill completely ignores the reality of Quebec's 
economy, and the first recommendation in the Estey Report, by 
failing to address the issue of the St. Lawrence Seaway. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened to my colleague from the Bloc with great interest.  I 
think he has chosen an unfortunate day to talk about the 
disparity between Quebec and the rest of Canada given the news 
about sponsorship of money and where moneys are going from the 
government.  I am talking about the fact that on a province by 
province basis, some 71% of the money is going to la belle 
province.  As the newspaper suggests, the money is going into 
Quebec by the truckload and into the rest of Canada by the 
teaspoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today to speak about the grain transportation bill. 
I am pleased to take part in this debate on behalf of our caucus. 
Before I get into the thrust of my remarks, I want to 
acknowledge the fact that the Minister of Transport paid tribute 
to three former senior members of parliament who knew a lot about 
grain transportation, one of them being Les Benjamin, a 25 year 
member of parliament for the New Democratic Party.  I am sure Mr. 
Benjamin is watching this debate at his home in Regina this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three weeks ago and a day, the Minister of Transport and his 
colleagues announced some changes to the grain handling and 
transportation system, a number of them at a news conference 
across the street.  They included replacing the rate cap with a 
revenue cap and reducing railway revenues by 13.5% per tonne. 
They actually said that it was 18% but it is only 13.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board control over transportation and 
logistics has been sharply curtailed.  It must tender at least 
25% immediately and 50% by the third year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I apologize for not informing you at the 
beginning of my speech, but I will be sharing my time with my 
colleague, the member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of other things were contained in that press release: 
$175 million for prairie roads and highways; changes to final 
offer arbitration when shippers and railways cannot agree; the 
CTA was being amended to facilitate branch line transfers to 
short lines; and monitoring and reporting, by as yet an 
unidentified private sector third party, to assess all of these 
impacts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-34, as it was drafted and presented to us this week, does 
not deal with a number of issues.  Money for prairie roads was 
alluded to by the Minister of Transport earlier in his address. 
We have been advised that a memorandum of understanding is being 
negotiated separately between the minister responsible for the 
wheat board and the wheat board itself and that this agreement 
will be in place when the legislation takes effect on August 1, 
if the government gets its way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say, just as a quick aside, that we in this caucus are 
concerned about moving to at least 50% of transfer to the wheat 
board.  This may be too much too fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everybody has exhibited some frustration over the timing 
involved.  We have talked about Mr. Estey's report which came out 
in December 1998.  We have talked about Mr. Kroeger's 
recommendations in September 1999.  Absolutely nothing happened 
on this file between September and May 10.  Even then, it took 
the government 22 days after the major announcement to actually 
bring forward legislation for parliamentarians to look at and 
consider. 
Despite that, its intention is to ram the bill through and have 
it ready for the new crop year.  With great respect, it is 
contemptuous not only of producers but of parliamentarians as

</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from the arbitrariness of the government's actions, we 
have some significant concerns with the bill as it is drafted. 
There is no productivity sharing formula.  I will take a minute 
to explain what that means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1992 farmers shared in efficiencies with the railroads. 
In other words, when we had more fuel efficient locomotives and 
larger hopper cars, when the railroads laid off staff, when we 
built inland terminals and had unit trains, windfall profits 
accrued.  Those prior to 1992 were shared with the producers. 
They have not been shared with them since 1992.  The estimate, 
and nobody seriously disputes it, is it is about $700 million in 
windfall profits.  There is no suggestion in this legislation 
that that productivity gain sharing, either in the past or in the 
future, is about to be shared with the producers.  We have a 
major concern with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second concern deals with the rate differentials between the 
branch and the main lines.  As I understand the bill, the 
differential rate cannot exceed 3% between a single car on a 
branch line and a single car on a main line.  The question that 
needs to be asked is how many single cars are likely to be loaded 
on a main line?  The answer is not many.  As a result of that, we 
are fearful that the costs on the branch lines will be 
uneconomical and will accelerate branch line abandonment.  In our 
opinion, the rate differential should be no larger than the 
actual differences in the costs.  As an aside, we also say that 
the short lines will unlikely be able to negotiate fair revenue 
sharing with the railways.  This too needs to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lower freight rates should have been developed immediately after 
the Kroeger report came down in September.  Grain transportation 
is an extremely complex subject, as the Minister of Transport 
readily acknowledged in his address.  Yet this is being rushed 
through in the dying days of this session of the 36th Parliament. 
It is impossible for us to assess this legislation when we do not 
even know for example the details of the wheat board tendering 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can anyone say this is good or bad until we see what the 
government has in mind on railway competition?  Since before 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba existed as provinces, we had the 
Crowsnest Pass freight rate agreement which came into effect in 
1897.  It came into effect because the Canadian Redpass region 
was a long way from tide water.  Governments, at that time and 
subsequently, recognized that if we were going to take advantage 
of it we had to provide subsidies to offset the long distances 
and the high costs of transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the current minister responsible for the 
wheat board put the final nail in the Crow coffin in 1995 and 
paid out on what it thought was a one time basis.  Of course last 
year it had to augment that because the input costs and the 
transportation costs are so significantly high for ravaged 
western Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not involve the government any longer in helping 
the producer.  It says it is up to the private sector, the 
railways and the grain companies, to do that.  If I may be 
permitted an old adage, it is a little like putting Dracula in 
charge of the blood bank.  It is unlikely to be a good outcome 
for producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also fails to address what will happen if and when 
Canadian National and Canadian Pacific are acquired by U.S. rail 
lines. If it was not for the Surface Transportation Board in the 
United States, we already know that a merger would be in place 
between Canadian National and Burlington Northern Santa Fe 
Corporation. CN refers to it as a merger, but it is really 
gobble-ization by Burlington Northern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if we end up with two Americanized railways?  We 
already have the American flag on the Canadian Pacific 
locomotives and on a couple of grain companies. How will that 
result in any effective competition that farmers can take 
advantage of in order to access the best price?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about NAFTA. Time will not permit me to deal 
with that, but we certainly are going to be dealing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me sum up this way on the bill.  Over the last decade the 
federal government has eliminated the Crow, repealed the Western 
Grain Transportation Act, altered the car allocation policy and 
privatized Canadian National.  In each announcement there were 
soothing words by the government that this was in the best 
interests of the producers, that it would benefit them.  The 
reality is that in each of these four instances and others, 
farmers have been hurt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister spoke this morning about everyone having to 
compromise and everyone having to mix a little water with their 
wine.  I can say that the farmers were deluged by the water and 
the grain companies and the railways have enjoyed most of the 
wine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is why should producers and opposition politicians 
believe the government this time after having been disappointed 
so many times in the past?  We are about to embark on 48 hours of 
virtually non-stop hearings on the bill beginning next Monday. 
We think there are a number of improvements that can and should 
be made.  We will be introducing those amendments and we hope 
that they will find favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just by way of conclusion, while we will not be obstructionist 
and hold up the bill, we are not prepared to support Bill C-34 as 
it appears now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to make a brief comment and then end with a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns I have about the bill before us today is 
that the powers of the wheat board stay intact and the wheat 
board remains the single desk selling agency for the grain of the 
Canadian farmers.  That is extremely important.  Having been born 
and raised in Saskatchewan, having seen the plight of the farmers 
over the years and having heard the stories of my grandfather 
many years ago about the fight for the wheat board, it is 
extremely important that we maintain the wheat board as a single 
desk selling agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One concern I have is that the new forces of the extreme right 
in the country, the Reform Party, which now calls itself the 
Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance Party, wants to put an end 
to the Canadian Wheat Board as we know it.  It says it wants to 
allow competition. I read in the Regina <I>Leader-Post</I> this 
morning that Tom Long who is running for the leadership of the 
reform alliance party is saying he wants to “put an end to the 
Canadian Wheat Board monopoly”.  We heard the same thing 
repeated in the House this morning by members of the Reform 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That goes against what Canadian farmers have fought for, 
believed in and have lived for, for many years, that we have a 
very strong Canadian Wheat Board that is a single desk selling 
agency that markets all the wheat for the Canadian farmers across 
the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my colleague whether or not he shares the same 
concern I have about this extreme right-wing movement of the 
Reform Party, the Canadian Alliance party, that wants to gut the 
Canadian Wheat Board in effect by allowing competition to the 
Canadian Wheat Board, and end the Canadian Wheat Board in the 
role we have always known which is to protect the farmers of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle for his question.  I say to him 
that I am proud to belong to a party that has always believed, as 
the member himself indicated in his comment, in the power and the 
need for the Canadian Wheat Board to assist farmers and ensure 
that there is price pooling at the best price available to them. 
It is something the farmers in western Canada have fought for for 
decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of a voluntary board is heresy.  It is impossible to 
envisage how that would work.  I find it difficult to swallow the 
idea that the Canadian Wheat Board is falling out of favour after 
seeing the election results a couple of years ago.  I expect when 
we see the next round of elections the folks that were elected in 
those elections by farmers were by and large very strong 
supporters of the Canadian Wheat Board and I think that will 
continue in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, certainly the extremist NDP is 
quite clear in that central planning and socialism is the way to 
accomplish things. 
That the NDP has never become the official opposition in 
parliament throughout its long history is testimony to the fact 
that Canadians do not buy into a central planned economy the way 
the NDP would have us believe.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If 75% of farmers want to be involved and sell their grain 
through the Canadian Wheat Board, I have no problem with that. 
But why would we force the other 25% who do not want to market 
their grain through the Canadian Wheat Board to do something that 
is against their economic best interests?  Can the hon. member 
explain that to me?   Why would they be put in jail for doing 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is an interesting 
question but it needs to be dissected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if a person lives in Lethbridge, Alberta or 
somewhere along the border between Canada and the United States, 
there may be a lot of good arguments for that person wanting to 
market his grain himself perhaps south of the line. If a person 
lives in northern Saskatchewan or in Debden, Saskatchewan, it is 
a much more difficult thing.  That is what the Canadian Wheat 
Board has always been about.  It is about price pooling and 
getting a fair share and a fair return for people regardless of 
where they live in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of whether it is 75%, there is a majority government 
sitting over there that was elected with 38% of the vote, so let 
us talk reality on this topic. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-34, amendments 
to the Canada Transportation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has a great potential to influence the income of 
western Canadian farmers.  It is in this context that I wish to 
begin speaking to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the incomes of western Canadian farmers in the past 
couple of years have been at Depression era levels.  It was 
distressing to learn within the last couple of weeks that in 
Saskatchewan the income in the early part of this year dropped a 
further 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at where farmers spend their money, we find that 
grain farmers spend at least one-third of their gross income from 
grain on transportation.  Any improvements that can be made to 
help them on the cost side in transportation are very important 
indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation does offer farmers a break on freight rates. In 
that respect it is very important.  I might add that this is a 
break the railways can very well afford.  CP Rail announced for 
the first quarter of 1999 profits of $187 million on rail.  That 
is a 33% increase over the previous year.  Can the railways 
afford to give farmers a break on transportation costs?  You bet 
they can. This legislation promises that but the question we have 
to ask ourselves is at what cost to these same farmers in the 
medium and long term? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from my hon. colleague from Palliser about the Crow 
rate and the Crow benefit.  When the Liberal government took away 
the Crow rate it did something very similar to what it is doing 
here.  It said it was going to give farmers a payout.  The 
government gave them a payout for one or two years and took away 
the Crow rate in perpetuity. Farmers are huge losers on that 
score. In Saskatchewan we estimate it is to the tune of $320 
million every year in perpetuity scooped out of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we fear here.  The government is giving us a 
carrot. It is giving farmers a carrot of $178 million in freight 
reductions next year, but we ask ourselves what is going to 
happen in two, three, five, ten and twenty years? It is for that 
reason the NDP caucus is going to oppose this bill as it is 
currently written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to explain our parliamentary rationale for this. It 
goes to the heart of our role as an opposition party in the 
parliamentary system.  We believe that this is flawed 
legislation.  It is our responsibility to point out those 
significant flaws and to try to get some improvements in the 
legislation.  That is what we are going to be doing.  It is not 
simply for parliamentary reasons.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has the potential to affect farmers' income for many 
years to come.  We believe that it has to be as good a bill as 
possible.  That is the reason, as a parliamentary opposition 
party, we feel disappointed with the bill.  We will oppose it at 
this reading.  My colleague from Palliser has indicated that we 
will not try to delay this process, but we want and are obligated 
to point out the flaws in the bill because it is in the financial 
interests of tens of thousands of Canadian farm families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Palliser has spoken about how squeezed and 
telescoped this whole process is.  It was two and a half years 
ago that Mr. Estey was appointed to study the whole matter of 
grain freight rates.  We have come to the point now where we have 
two or three weeks left before the parliamentary summer break. 
This is when the government decided to introduce the legislation, 
in the full knowledge that it will not receive a thorough airing, 
and that the committee process, which is often where amendments 
and improvements are made, will be severely hampered.  It will be 
difficult, if not impossible, for the opposition parties to 
squeeze any decent concessions out of the government on the most 
important aspects of the legislation.  We are keenly disappointed 
by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Palliser has talked about some of the big 
problems with the legislation.  I want to give a bit of context 
and background.  Mr. Estey did his job and was followed by Mr. 
Kroeger.  From our perspective, Mr. Estey listened to the last 
best offer of CP Rail and put it into his report, saying that it 
would freeze freight rates for six years, that it did not want 
them dealt with in the longer term.  There has been a rate cap in 
place.  My colleague has indicated why it has been so important 
over time to have a rate cap in place.  The railroads did not 
want that.  It was our observation that Mr. Estey gave the 
railroads almost everything they wanted.  Interestingly, it was 
pressure put on the government by members of this party and farm 
groups which led to a mini revolt in the Liberal western caucus 
at the Liberal meeting last spring, which began to wring out a 
few concessions.  I believe that is why we actually have a 
decrease in freight rates rather than a simple holding of the 
line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might also add that the railroads are always talking about the 
need, as do our colleagues in the Canadian Alliance, for 
competition.  They do not want regulation; they want competition. 
They do not want regulation when it applies to them, but they do 
not want competition either.  We were calling for open running 
rights, where anybody who could put together a rail company could 
use these lines, just as we all use the telecommunications 
infrastructure.  Of course the railways did not want that because 
that would introduce competition.  I note in this legislation 
that we do not have that.  We will have somebody look at open 
running rights in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  The railways do not want regulation; they want 
competition, or so they say.  What they really want to do is 
maintain an oligopoly, which they have done for the last 100 
years.  That is precisely why the government has to intervene 
with some form of regulation.  We are in a situation, which will 
not change, of monopoly and duopoly.  In this type of situation, 
if we cannot introduce competition, which so far has not 
happened, the government has to play a role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the remaining few minutes I want simply to talk about the two 
or three things that are most important from our point of view 
about this new legislation.  First, it significantly removes the 
Canadian Wheat Board from its role in co-ordinating the 
transportation of grain for export.  We believe now, as we always 
have, that removing the board from a transportation role will 
erode the power of farmers within the system and will undermine 
and cripple the board's ability as an exporter of grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go into more detail on that because I want to get to 
what is the single most important thing, and that is the 
replacement of the current freight rate cap with an annual 
revenue cap.  The are two problems, which my colleague from 
Palliser outlined.  We saw this happen, if I might say, this past 
April when the railroads were granted a 4.5% increase in freight 
rates based on the cost of things like fuel.  That is fair 
enough.  What did not happen is that we did not look, and the 
Canadian Transportation Agency is no longer mandated to look, at 
what are the railways' real costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague mentioned, they have made great savings through 
efficiencies.  They have fewer and fewer elevators all the time, 
so farmers have to bear the cost of hauling the grain farther. 
The railways save money. 
The farmers pay more money.  However, when it comes to the rates, 
that is never reflected. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the single most important problem.  We have a situation 
set up where there is a revenue cap, but the government will not 
look at what efficiencies the railways manage to capture, and 
they do not have to share those with farmers.  If we set up a 
system like that for the long term, farmers will be set up in 
perpetuity as losers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has mentioned that the estimate is that since 1992 
the railroads have saved approximately $700 million in 
efficiencies.  They did not want to share any of it.  They are 
now having to share $178 million.  When we look ahead, they will 
win in perpetuity and farmers will lose in perpetuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might simply say in closing that when the Estey report came 
out our colleagues in the Reform Party, or the Canadian Alliance, 
came out with a news release saying “Do it all and do it right 
away.  We cannot do it fast enough”.  I wonder why they always 
end up on the railroads' side.  I wonder if that could have 
anything to do with the fact, for example, that, in the last year 
I looked, Canadian National donated $70,000 to the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is people on this side of the House, people in our party, who 
are looking out for the best interests of farmers, and I dare say 
not those groups who are taking funding from the railroads, the 
banks and probably the international grain companies as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe this is flawed legislation.  We cannot support it at 
this time.  Our interest is in the income of farmers and the 
health of farm communities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it never ceases to amaze me that the 
New Democrats end up not ever speaking on behalf of farmers or 
representing farmers.  I believe from their speeches that they 
represent the National Farmers Union, which they believe to speak 
for farmers, and the Canadian Wheat Board, which is a government 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote a portion of a letter to the minister: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now time to move forward on these recommendations and 
create an environment that fosters competitiveness so that we can 
achieve our potential in international trade.  If you do not act 
on these recommendations we can only expect ongoing regular 
disruption of the transportation system.  This will result in 
continuing damage to our reputation as a reliable exporter, and 
the continued loss of international market share trade.  We must 
have the vision to act now to ensure a better future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is signed by Neil Silver, president of Agricore, Leroy 
Larsen, president and chairman of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, 
Ted Allen, president and chairman of the United Grain Growers, 
among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people speak for farmers.  What do you have to say about 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  What does “he” have to say about 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that people in the farm organizations are looking at 
this and saying “We do not like this, but it is the best we 
think we can get at this time and we will settle for it”.  I 
respect them for doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that our role as an opposition party would be to 
squeeze as much as we can out of the legislation for farmers.  I 
am quite surprised, frankly, that the Canadian Alliance members 
are not trying to do the same thing.  I wonder if this is not 
because they have an ideological predisposition which hampers 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time we get into any situation where we want to support 
farmers, all Canadian Alliance members can talk about are tax 
reductions.  As a matter of fact, to use another example, the New 
Democratic Party caucus on the farm income issue has been arguing 
strenuously for the last two and a half years that we have to 
support farmers in their time of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance, which was until now of course the Reform 
Party, in its taxpayer budget of 1997—and I have it in front of 
me, but I will not hold it up because that would be using a 
prop—would take $1.2 billion out of the departments of 
agriculture, forestry and fisheries.  This is how those members 
want to help farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ask who speaks on behalf of farmers, I am not about to 
say that we speak on behalf of farmers, and I would hope members 
of the Canadian Alliance would not say they speak for farmers, 
although they always do.  I think the question we might want to 
ask is, why are they not proposing the kinds of policies that 
would help farmers?  That is a question they should ask.  I ask 
again if it might have anything to do with the corporate friends 
they keep, including Canadian National.

will get an opportunity to talk to this, but I would like to ask 
a question of my colleague from Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about ideological predispositions.  I recognize that 
the NDP certainly believes in a different role for the Canadian 
Wheat Board than perhaps do I, my party and certainly the Reform 
Party, but I would ask a very simple question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize and understand the member's desire to keep the 
Canadian Wheat Board as a single desk marketer.  He and I will 
argue about that point.  However, why is it that the Canadian 
Wheat Board sees the necessity of controlling the transportation 
of that commodity when all it is looking for is to be a single 
desk marketer?  It needs to sell the commodity.  Why is it that 
it must have control of the transportation in order to simply 
sell it and market it internationally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for that simple question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I could answer by way of discussing, and my colleague 
knows this situation well, the case which was brought before the 
Canadian Transportation Agency within the last couple of years 
about whether or not the railroads were fulfilling their 
obligations for moving western grain.  Without going into all of 
the details, after a lengthy process in which everybody had a 
chance to say their piece, it was deemed that the railways were 
not meeting their obligations to move western grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the railways would take any chance they could to 
improve and increase their leverage.  That is what we saw in the 
kinds of recommendations which came out of the Estey report.  I 
argue now, as I have argued in the past, that if we take away 
that entire function from the Canadian Wheat Board of marshalling 
cars to move its own grain, we will severely cripple its ability 
to market grain on behalf of Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation already takes away much of that power and 
authority from the Canadian Wheat Board.  I would ask my 
colleague, who will speak next, how much of that authority he 
wants to strip away from the board. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will open my comments by answering the question from the hon. 
member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar.  I would suspect that 
smarter people than I, Mr. Kroeger and Mr. Estey particularly, 
have indicated that all of the transportation component should be 
taken away from the Canadian Wheat Board.  That is not coming 
from me; that is coming from learned people who understand the 
system certainly better than I and the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let me say to the people who are listening to this debate 
that it is not a terribly sexy debate.  It is not terribly 
romantic. It does not have a lot of real substance to it with 
respect to eastern Canada and people in Ontario and Quebec.  It 
is a western Canadian issue.  However, this is terribly, terribly 
important to producers and farmers in western Canada.  It is all 
about getting more money for a commodity produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It costs producers in my area of western Canada one-third of the 
total commodity price to transport their commodity from point 
<I>A</I> to export markets.  One-third of what they receive for 
their commodity is eaten up by transportation costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are speaking of the opportunity of a savings on that 
horrendous cost.  Those savings will not go into some frivolous 
netherland.  The savings will go to pay bills that farmers and 
producers have acquired over the last growing season.  The 
savings will pay for shoes for their children, gas for their 
automobiles and for ongoing living expenses that a lot of people 
in this great country of ours take for granted with a paycheque 
that comes in every two weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an uncontrollable cost that producers have to face every 
time they put a bushel of grain on a railcar.  They cannot simply 
go to the shipper and ask to pay less or negotiate a lower price, 
because they do not have the ability to do that.  What they have, 
unfortunately, is a control that is thrust upon them, and in this 
particular case a control that is put on by the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about grain transportation.  This debate has been 
going on for decades.  The government had a golden opportunity to 
put into place some changes that would actually benefit the 
producers, the growers of that commodity.  It lost that 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the Minister of Transport knuckled under to the 
minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board.  He knuckled 
under to the minister of agriculture for whatever reason.  He 
knuckled under to self-interest groups that still believe there 
must be 100% control of the Canadian Wheat Board in 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made a serious mistake.  He is now putting forward to 
parliament a piece of legislation that is truly flawed.  He holds 
up the $178 million potential savings, and I underscore the term 
potential, to producers.  We will support any amount of money 
that can be saved and passed on to producers. However the $178 
million is simply a proposed amount that can be saved by 
producers.  We will talk about that a little later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister came here this morning with quite substantial 
crocodile tears and apologized on behalf of the government for 
putting the opposition in such a position where it had to deal 
with this type of legislation in a very short period of time. 
Between now and when we rise is about two weeks.  It is unheard 
of to put a piece of legislation through the House in that short 
timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it being forced upon us as the opposition in such a short 
timeframe?  The minister said that he did not have time to bring 
it to the House.  Mr. Estey and Mr. Kroeger, in particular Mr. 
Kroeger, tabled the report on September 29, 1999.  We now stand 
in the House on June 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in that timeframe?  Why was the legislation not 
put before us so that we would have the proper amount of time to 
take it to committee to listen to the stakeholders the minister 
said he listened to and talked with.  He had the opportunity of 
taking into consideration and bringing into play all their 
opinions before putting the legislation forward.  We as the 
opposition, we as the heart and soul of parliament, should have 
have had the same opportunity.  Unfortunately we did not because 
the three ministers, the troika, put their hands together and 
said they should just wait until the final moments of the House 
to bring forward the legislation and really stick it to the 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are really sticking it to farmers.  They are sticking it to 
the producers in my area.  In a very short period of time we will 
try to put forward some amendments to the legislation to make it 
better and more palatable to the producers we would like to see 
being served by the piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Kroeger put forward a report.  The report was very specific. 
He said that grain rail transportation should be commercialized. 
It was pretty simple.  It should be commercialized, taken out of 
the hands of the Canadian Wheat Board.  However, what we have in 
the legislation is something totally outside what Mr. Kroeger 
wanted to attempt to put into place.  If Mr. Estey and Mr. 
Kroeger were here right now they would be biting their tongues 
for not speaking against what the government has put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efficiency of the grain handling and transportation system 
in Canada, which moves $6 billion worth of grain to market each 
year, has been the subject of debate for many years.  Many 
contend that the current system cannot continue to operate as it 
is to maintain the competitiveness of the international world 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past inefficiencies in the management of the Canadian 
grain transportation system have caused serious damage to the 
Canadian grain export industry and the prairie economy.  Delayed 
1997 shipments, primarily of wheat contracted to international 
customers, resulted in demurrage charges of $65 million, paid for 
primarily by producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been estimated that an additional $35 million were lost 
in potential sales because of Canada's inability to deliver.  Not 
only is the reputation of my producers in western Canada 
affected.  All of Canada's reputation is now being affected 
internationally.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reports came forward and we wanted to change the 
inefficiencies that were built into the system, particularly in 
1997.  The cornerstone of the legislation before us is the $178 
million which the government has held up and said must get 
through by July 31, August 1 being the new crop year, or farmers 
will lose $178 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a projected $178 million, as I said earlier.  It is based 
on a revenue cap on the railroads of $178 million less, based on 
the transportation of 30 million tonnes of grain last year.  We 
only moved about 26 million tonnes of grain.  The $178 million is 
a projected saving that may be slightly higher than what the 
actual saving may well be with that revenue cap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also not quite understood as yet whether that $178 million 
will translate into producer savings.   We do not know where that 
$178 million will end up.  It may end up in the grain companies. 
It may well end up in the bank accounts of the Canadian Wheat 
Board, but it may not end up in the pockets of Canadian 
producers.  We must confirm where the dollars will end up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation speaks of 25% of the contracts being tendered to 
railroads.  That is a very good step.  Mr. Kroeger decided that 
100% should be tendered as a commercial system, but 25% is being 
proposed in the legislation.  It will be 25% commercialized 
tendering next year.  It will be raised to 50% tendering three 
years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board will enter into a memorandum of 
understanding with the minister responsible for the Canadian 
Wheat Board that will set the parameters, the constraints the 
Canadian Wheat Board will follow with respect to the 25% 
tendering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some conflict.  The minister responsible for the 
Canadian Wheat Board said that they have not quite negotiated the 
MOU.  Now we hear from the Minister of Transport that the MOU may 
well be available to us tomorrow.  I hope the Minister of 
Transport is correct.  It will be very difficult to deal with the 
legislation in committee next week if we do not understand what 
the role of the Canadian Wheat Board will be with that 25% 
tendering capability in the system.  We need that MOU.  We hope 
to get it for next Monday when we head into committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also says that even with the Canadian Wheat Board 
having an influence in the 25% tendering, there must be for room 
the board to manoeuvre.  It decided to contract an arm's length 
third party to monitor the 25% commercialization of the system. 
That is a wonderful step but I would suggest two points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the terms of reference of the arm's length monitoring of 
the system should be dealt with by committee or by parliament so 
that we recognize what the terms of reference will be.  We would 
then know exactly what the the company that gets the tendered 
contract is looking for to make the system work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the company doing the monitoring should report to 
parliament, not to the three ministers.  Heaven forbid, if some 
of the information that came forward suggested perhaps the 
Canadian Wheat Board was not doing its best to make this system 
work, perhaps that information would not become public.  The 
information should be public.  Any reports from the monitor 
should come directly to parliament.  Then we would find out how 
the system is operating or whether there is some manipulation to 
make it fail.  That is something we could certainly talk about 
when we are discussing the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to see the minister responsible for the Canadian 
Wheat Board here.  I know he will listen to me very carefully 
when we debate the bill in committee next week and make the 
necessary changes to the legislation so that Canadians will be 
comfortable that the system will be given a very good chance to 
succeed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister had been here earlier he would have heard me say 
that I am not quite convinced $178 million is the right number. 
It is a projected number based on a fictitious number.  Maybe we 
should consider placing a real number in the legislation so that 
there will be guarantees that $178 million is the amount to be 
passed on to producers.  Maybe that is something we should look 
at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the little carrot dangled by the three ministers on 
May 10 was a suggestion that $175 million be placed into rural 
roads.  The government neglected to mention that the $175 million 
would over five years.  The government has a tendency not to come 
out with that kind of the information.  That amounts to $35 
million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stood in the House not many months ago and suggested that the 
government should put into place a rural roads strategy.  The 
amount of $175 million over five years is not even close to what 
is needed for rural roads.  The Minister of Transport, the 
minister from Toronto with his crocodile tears, stood to say he 
was sorry that he did not have an opportunity to bring forward 
the legislation earlier.  He also said that he understood rural 
Canada.  He does not want all people to live in major urban 
centres and knows that there is a need for rural Canada.  The 
minister from Toronto would not know rural Canada if it bit him 
on the nose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural roads are absolutely vital to the lifeblood of rural 
Canada.  Everything we do comes down to transportation on our 
roads in most cases.  Our roads are currently being beat up, 
almost to the point where they are impassable, because the 
railroads have abandoned rail lines and grain is transported on 
rural roads to inland terminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the legislation $175 million over five years is a 
pittance, a drop in the ocean.  Not only that.  There is no 
method by which it will be implemented.  Let us take that with a 
grain of sale from the three ministers.  They are dangling a 
carrot so that they can suggest there should not be any 
opposition to their legislation, that it should just go through 
because it is the best thing since sliced bread. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board's control of the rail car allocation is 
probably the most serious factor in the whole legislation. Having 
only 25% of the rail transportation tendered, or commercialized 
as it is known in the industry, allows the Canadian Wheat Board 
an opportunity to sabotage the whole process.  The Canadian Wheat 
Board has total control of the system right now.  It has the 
opportunity of allocating rail cars to certain grain companies 
and to certain areas of the provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba 
and Alberta.  It unfortunately has a lot of control that no one 
can really understand, particularly the producers of western 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would like an open, honest and transparent transportation 
policy so they can negotiate with shippers and know who was at 
fault if a product does not get delivered where it is supposed to 
get delivered.  Right now there are so many fingers in the pie 
and so many people pointing fingers at each other that there is 
no accountability within the system.  That in itself is part of 
the downfall of the whole transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Progressive Conservative Party would like to make 
three points.  First, we will not prevent this piece of 
legislation from going forward between now and committee and 
third reading stages.  Second, we wish to put forward many 
amendments to make it a much better piece of legislation than 
what is before us today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I will say right now, because I may not be here in three, 
four or five years, that I can assure the House the legislation 
will be coming back.  This does not solve the problem.  It will 
exacerbate the problem.  Ultimately producers will stand up and 
revolt.  They will say, in unison, that they do not want to have 
these controls placed on them because they are not working. 
Producers will not work forever for no return on their 
investment, which is exactly what is happening right now. It is 
happening because there are too many governmental controls on 
what it is they can and cannot do.  This is just the final straw 
that will break the producer's back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation will be back in the House in the very 
near future.  It will have to be debated and dealt with again. 
Eventually the government may get it right.  Better yet, there 
may be a different government and a different party on that side 
of the House that will in fact do what is right for producers in 
western Canada.  I do hope that I will stand on that side at some 
time and have the opportunity to have the input that is 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport stood up and said that change is 
difficult to embrace.  He quoted the fact that there was nothing 
to fear but fear itself.  Why did he not embrace that change? 
Why did he not fear fear itself and put forward what Mr. Kroeger 
wanted him to, what Mr. Estey wanted him to and what was right 
for Canadian producers?  He cannot have it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition was right.  The minister was spooked by 
the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board.  He was 
spooked by a couple of members sitting in Winnipeg who would not 
know the difference between a field of canola from a field of 
wheat.  He was spooked and he did the wrong thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I will have the opportunity to make the necessary changes 
to this piece of legislation that will make it better for all 
producers in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to slag this 
particular piece of legislation.  In saying that, we will support 
having it go forward to committee so that we can look at the MOU 
to see just how the negotiated settlement between the Minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board and the Canadian Wheat 
Board have decided how they are going to control transportation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Brandon—Souris, in his rather lengthy and 
long-winded address, raised a number of points, some of which 
actually had some merit.  However, I would like to ask for some 
clarification and comments on a couple of those points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raised a very legitimate and valid point about 
the state of rural roads in the prairie provinces.  Both coming 
from the prairie provinces, we share the concern of the state of 
rural roads.  He pointed out that $175 million has been allocated 
for the prairie provinces over five years.  Is this to be equally 
distributed among the three prairie provinces or is it just for 
one prairie province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the federal government collects literally 
billions of dollars per year in fuel taxes.  When these fuel 
taxes were introduced to placate the critics, the promise was 
“Yes, we are going to charge you a tax on all the fuel you 
purchase, but we are going to reinvest that into the road and 
highway systems of the country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member, even though I run the risk of 
allowing him to talk longer.  With $3 billion per year in revenue 
and $175 million paid out over five years in road construction, 
is there not something fundamentally wrong with this picture? 
When I take $3 billion a year, that is $250 million a month in 
fuel taxes that the federal government takes in, and, in its 
largesse, it will give us on the prairie provinces $175 million. 
Would the hon. member comment further on what he knows about 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made 
mention that I was speaking long-windedly and that perhaps I did 
not have a lot of substance. 
He asked me the same question three times.  Perhaps the next time 
he could be a bit more detailed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are actually two questions.  How is it to be distributed? 
It is my understanding—and I certainly will not hang my hat on 
this—that it is to be distributed based on a percentage of the 
grains that are being transported from the provinces.  I will 
give a percentage breakdown.  As I understand it, of the $175 
million, $35 million per year for five years, Alberta will 
receive 19%, Saskatchewan will receive 62%, Manitoba will receive 
18% and B.C. will receive .4%.  This is how it is to be allocated 
for western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the excise taxes on fuel with respect to dollars put back 
into the highways of western Canada, it is absolutely deplorable 
the billions of dollars taken out of our economy and not put back 
into the road systems.  I have stood in the House many times and 
asked for a long term, well thought out, well financed plan to 
work tripartite with municipalities, with provincial governments 
and with the federal government to put dollars back into the 
rural road infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, unfortunately, does not see that expenditure in 
rural Manitoba or in rural Canada as a priority or even a 
requirement, which surprises me because the Minister of Transport 
has said that he is now an expert on rural Canada.  I suspect 
that he would recognize that is a bigger issue than the $175 
million over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there was one more point 
that came to mind after I listened with great interest to the 
member's lengthy address.  I made note of one comment he made, 
which I agree with.  He said that Bill C-34 was being sold to us 
as a bill that is supposed to benefit producers.  That is the 
guise under which it was introduced and the face the government 
is trying to put on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, would the hon. member not agree that over the past 
decade the federal government has done the following things: It 
eliminated the Crow, which was supposed to benefit producers; it 
repealed the Western Grain Transportation Act, which was supposed 
to benefit producers; it changed the grain car allocation process 
in the guise of benefiting producers again; and, it privatized 
CN? All these major restructures were supposed to result in a 
benefit.  Why would we believe the government now about Bill C-34 
to radically change the aspects that it will be changing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Brandon—Souris have any confidence that 
Bill C-34 will in fact benefit producers, and will the $4 per 
tonne that the government is talking about even translate into a 
benefit to producers that will help the family farm survive on 
the prairies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as a small clarification, 
it is $5.92 a tonne that is being expected to translate into 
savings to producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member.  I do not believe that the $5.92 
will find its way into the pockets of producers.  I feel, 
somewhere between the railroads, the grain companies and the 
Canadian Wheat Board in particular, that a lot of that $5.92 may 
well disappear.  I am not so sure that the $5.92 a tonne is the 
real number.  I am not sure if this $178 million that is being 
held up as the rationale for pushing the bill through the House 
so quickly is the real number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not convinced me that this $178 million is 
there, although it does say that it is an 18% reduction in the 
revenues.  I appreciate that but I am not so sure it will get to 
the producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for his question on whether I believe this will help 
producers, the member obviously did not listen to my lengthy 
debate.  I said that was not going to happen.  I do not believe 
this legislation will in fact help producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We disagree on the rationale for that.  The hon. member believes 
it will not help producers because 25% of the control will be 
taken away from the Canadian Wheat Board.  I feel it will not 
help producers because enough of that control has not been taken 
away.  I feel it should be a truly commercial system.  There 
should be competition within the system.  There should be main 
line access by other competitors. It should be open because that 
truly would help producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We disagree on the reason and rationale, but I think both of us 
agree that it will not help producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the House ready for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The question is on the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 31, 2000 consideration of Bill C-32, 
an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 28, 2000, as reported (with amendment) 
from the committee, and of the motions in Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
ought to have been able to rejoice with a projected budget 
surplus over the next five years of what, according to the 
minister's own analyses, will be $95.5 billion. 
For the first time, we can anticipate, for such a considerable 
length of time, some amazing surpluses in federal public 
finances.  The last budget by the Minister of Finance is, 
however, a great disappointment.  Why?  One has to think about 
where those $95 billion have come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three main sources for the Minister of Finance's 
budget surpluses of the past two years and the next five to 
come.  A surplus of that size is not good news when one learns 
its sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, since 1993, since this Minister of Finance has 
been in that portfolio, things have been arranged so that the 
taxpayers of Quebec and of Canada have paid $30 billion more in 
taxes without the Minister of Finance having to announce any 
increases.  This was done by not indexing the tax tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget, he announced that he was going to start 
indexing.  It will, however, take years and years to correct the 
tables to reflect inflation, years before the Canadian taxpayers 
can see any difference in their pockets as far as a tax return 
is concerned.  We are talking $30 billion in additional taxes 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another significant source of the Minister of Finance's surplus 
is the employment insurance fund.  Year in and year out for the 
past four years now, he has been dipping into the employment 
insurance fund to find surpluses ranging from $6 billion to $7 
billion annually.  These funds are made up of the contributions 
of employers and employees to the employment insurance fund, not 
the federal government's contributions, for it has not put a 
cent into it since 1992.  So one part of the surplus the 
Minister of Finance is so proud of comes from the surplus in the 
employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another major source of these surpluses. The Minister 
of Finance, who is full of compassion for society's 
disadvantaged and who blithely puts his hand to his heart as he 
thinks of Canada's poor children, is the same Minister of 
Finance who, in 1994, put a budget mechanism in place that year 
after year ensures systematic cuts are made to the Canada social 
transfer, without any announcement of them.  This transfer 
enables the provinces to fund social assistance, income 
security, post-secondary education and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with the minor adjustments he made in his latest budget, 
the 2000 budget, by 2003, the Minister of Finance will have 
withdrawn no less than $32 billion from these transfers to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take a look at the Minister of Finance's evaluation of 
the surpluses over the coming years and the evaluation of what 
he has systematically stolen from these three budget items, we 
cannot miss the striking similarity of the figures.  He will 
take the $90 billion from taxpayers as disguised tax increases 
and from the Canada social transfer by cutting it on the backs 
of the provinces.  He will take it as well from the surplus in 
the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be pleased with what he calls good management of 
public finances and what we call robbery of taxpayers, the most 
disadvantaged in society and the unemployed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget that the surplus in the employment insurance 
fund is not just an over-contribution by employers and employees. 
It is also the product of a tightening of the criteria under 
which unemployed workers may benefit from this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are members aware that only 42% of those unemployed can benefit 
from the employment insurance plan?  It no longer covers the 
majority of the clientele it serves.  This has got to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With surpluses coming out his ears, the Minister of Finance 
should be thinking about showing real compassion, instead of 
deliberately waiting until an election campaign is in full swing 
before announcing any sort of relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government knows perfectly well that it will have a 
$95 billion surplus over the next five years, according to the 
minister's estimates, and over $140 billion according to ours, 
it is unconscionable to wait, while the problems of poverty and 
the problems in the health care system throughout Canada and not 
just in Quebec grow worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been an anti-Quebec campaign since we came here.  We 
are more aware of it in the Bloc Quebecois, since we are the 
only ones defending the interests of Quebecers in this House. 
We are very aware of the systematic attacks and anti-Quebec 
propaganda around here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to poverty, when we see the latest figures provided 
by such bodies as the National Council of Welfare, it is 
outrageous, scandalous and unacceptable that a Minister of 
Finance, who will have surpluses coming out his ears over the 
next few years, does not introduce drastic measures to do 
something about this poverty, does not restore the Canada social 
transfer, and does not make the EI system more flexible in order 
to benefit unemployed workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the issue of poverty since the Liberal 
government has been in power, the government led by the little 
guy from Shawinigan, it has increased for all categories of the 
population.  Let us look at the case of children alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, during the election campaign, the Liberal Party of 
Canada was critical of the Progressive Conservatives because, at 
the time, there were one million poor children in Canada. 
The latest statistics indicate that there are 1.5 million poor 
children in Canada, an increase of 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are poor children, this is because there are poor 
parents, and if there are poor parents, this is because the 
Minister of Finance, the Prime Minister and this Liberal 
government have blithely slashed the Canada social transfer, and 
have accumulated a stupendous surplus, with plans to accumulate 
still more in coming years, on the backs of the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the incidence of poverty among female seniors, 
it comes close to 50%.  What is this government doing to remedy 
poverty in this group, in Quebec and in Canada?  Nothing.  It is 
swimming in surplus funds and is proud of it, but is doing 
nothing to remedy the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as seniors are concerned, according to the Canadian 
Council on Social Development, we are seeing the reversal of a 
trend that has been in place for the past 30 years, which was to 
ensure that seniors had a decent income.  Now we are in the 
process of quietly impoverishing certain sub-categories of 
seniors, while we ought to be continuing along the path of 
ensuring them a stable and fair income in a society that claims 
to be full of compassion and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the new forms of poverty this government has 
created, we see that even now there is a new phenomenon which is 
impoverishing the employed.  Now we have the working poor, a 
phenomenon we had not seen for several decades. 
People work, but because of a variety of factors, including 
government inertia when it comes to correcting injustices, such 
as in federal taxation, they are becoming poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  A couple with one child and a single 
income starts paying federal income tax once their income 
reaches $13,700, whereas in Quebec, this family would pay income 
tax only once their income reached $30,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it reasonable, when they have surpluses coming out of their 
ears, for the government to start taxing poor families with a 
dependent child at $13,700? 
In Quebec, the situation has long been rectified, and income tax 
is not applied until the income threshold of $30,000 is reached.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it reasonable for this man, who is boasting about having 
surpluses—and the money is here, not in the provinces—to continue 
to brag about these surpluses, with his Prime Minister bragging 
about the Canadian model around the world, while no thought 
whatsoever is given to reforming taxation for Canada's poorest 
families as the Bloc Quebecois has been requesting since 1993? 
It is deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal taxation is now contributing to the impoverishment of 
society, and that is serious. 
When the Minister of Finance sits on his behind doing sweet 
nothing and ignoring our requests, despite all these surpluses 
in his budget 2000 forecasts, that is completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not to mention, and I will conclude with this, that the money we 
give this government, the $32 billion Quebec taxpayers hand over 
every year to this government, is being used to pay off their 
buddies in the HRDC scandal, in the form of grants to friends of 
the Liberal Party for the ministerial tour around Quebec to 
spread anti-PQ propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their buddies are getting money.  But it is money from our 
pockets—$32 billion from Quebecers—that is paying for this 
anti-Quebec propaganda, for ministers to parade around singing 
the praises of federalism and squandering our tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to vote against this bill at report stage now 
before us.  The Bloc Quebecois is here to defend the interests 
of Quebec and of Quebecers, because they are very ill served by 
this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, unlike the previous speaker, I am definitely here to 
defend the rights of all Canadian citizens.  I want to make that 
perfectly clear to you, Mr. Speaker, and to the entire House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some great concerns about the amendments that are 
proposed to Bill C-32.  In particular, clause 35 of Bill C-32 is 
consequential on clause 36, the substantive provision of this 
act. I will therefore speak to why the government cannot accept 
the motions to delete clauses 35 and 36 of Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 35 and 36 amend the Excise Tax Act to address the issue 
of tax evasion.  These measures are intended to deal with 
exceptional circumstances where there is clear and unequivocal 
evidence of an intention to evade the payment of tax and where 
the collection of taxes is therefore in perilous jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are important safeguards in the use of this measure.  In 
particular, the Minister of National Revenue must apply to court 
for judicial authorization.  The court can place whatever 
condition it deems appropriate on that order.  The court order is 
then subject to appeal by the taxpayer.  There is a process in 
place that is to be followed and can be followed by each and 
every taxpayer in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A similar provision relating to income tax already exists in the 
Income Tax Act.  The proposed measure would give the Minister of 
National Revenue the same tools to protect against tax evasion 
under the Excise Tax Act as he has for income tax purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons and many more, the government believes this is 
an important measure and we cannot accept this motion. Although 
it is not surprising, considering the fact that the hon. member 
for Medicine Hat said he wants to in some way, shape or form, 
actually delay, under Bill C-32, the delivery of over $2.5 
billion in increased payments under the CHST.  That in itself 
speaks volumes for the hon. member for Medicine Hat and his party 
for their basic thinking of the way Canada should be run and the 
way we should evolve under our taxation system. Without a doubt, 
they are unequivocal in their support of the scandalous and 
scurrilous flat tax.  My dad used to say that if something is too 
good to be true, it usually is.  That is definitely the case with 
this flat tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the vast majority of the MPs in the Canadian 
Alliance, not counting a few of them present here today, 
basically think along the American tradition. 
They want to Americanize our country Canada especially with 
regard to the taxation system and the way we distribute the 
taxpayers' hard-earned dollars to make the social fabric of our 
country the best in the entire world.  But they do not want to do 
that.  They want the Napoleonic version of life where might makes 
right; look after the rich and forget about the middle income 
people and most assuredly forget about the poor people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell hon. members who will benefit from the flat tax. The 
rich will benefit, because under the flat tax proposal, people 
making about $40,000 a year will pay about the same tax that they 
are currently paying under our system, but those people making 
$100,000 would pay approximately $4,000 less.  Does that seem 
fair?  It certainly does not seem fair to me and I know it does 
not seem fair to the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it was such a great tax, why would the American friends of 
the hon. member for Medicine Hat not embrace this tax with open 
arms?  The ultra right-wing of the Republican Party, Newt 
Gingrich himself, has decried this flat tax saying it will not 
work.  The reason it will not work is simply that under the flat 
tax system there will be less money brought in to the revenues of 
this country.  Therefore, we would not have the same amount of 
taxpayers' dollars to distribute, to make Canada and equitable 
place for all citizens to live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the flat tax we would not be bringing in as much money, so 
what does the Canadian Alliance plan to do? The CA most assuredly 
plans to eviscerate our social system.  CA members have already 
said that.  They are on the move.  One of its members currently 
sitting here is running for the CA leadership. He is talking 
about a two tier health care system.  Let us Americanize the 
health care system.  There is a bright idea.  He must be a 100 
watt bulb.  In America 38 million people as we speak are not 
covered under health insurance. The single public payer use 
system we have in Canada is recognized around the world as the 
very best there is on planet Earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other countries, including the United States of America, 
would like nothing better than to move to our medicare system. 
Under the flat tax we would not be able to have that because we 
would not be bringing in the proper amount of money to look after 
our medicare system.  Why would we not have enough money? 
Because the rich people would not be paying near the income tax 
they should be paying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one believe that the more that we gain out of the country, 
the more that we prosper, the more that we should be willing to 
share with our fellow citizens.  But not under the flat tax 
system.  Under the flat tax system the rich pay less and the poor 
get more.  By more I mean they get more right in the ear.  They 
would not get a darn thing extra out of the flat tax system. They 
lose, they lose and they lose, because there would not be money 
in there to make the system work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Medicine Hat espouses the great benefits of 
the flat tax but maybe he should join the flat earth society 
because it just will not work.  He knows it and hon. members 
opposite know it.  That is part and parcel of their amendments to 
Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have got the ire up of the big fellow across the way, but he 
knows we are right.  He knows that the Liberal government is 
reducing the taxes.  We have reduced taxes by $58 billion in the 
last three to four years and we will further reduce them.  We are 
on the road to economic recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is recognized without a doubt as the best country in the 
world in which to live.  The former leader of the hon. members 
opposite is now running as the leader for a new party.  He 
happened to be flying around the world on taxpayers' dollars a 
couple of years ago and said, “Canada is a third world country. 
Do not come to invest in Canada”.  Is that the type of person we 
want running this tax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just noticed that the hon. member for Medicine Hat is 
listening to what I have to say.  I do not know if he will get up 
and make a comment but I would like him to make a comment on the 
flat tax system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 9 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-31, an act respecting immigration to Canada and the 
granting of refugee protection to persons who are displaced, 
persecuted or in danger, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to see democracy in 
action in this place.  I always take pride in standing up to 
speak to immigration issues.  I often remind the House of my 
family's background and how proud I am as a Canadian to be able 
to serve as a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to Canada in the early seventies as a year old child.  My 
family was forced out of our home country of Uganda as refugees. 
We came to Canada with mixed feelings.  We were coming to a brand 
new country, a new place, as strangers.  We left home where I was 
third generation born.  Unfortunately we were leaving under the 
tyrant regime of Idi Amin.  They were not pleasant circumstances. 
Members of my family lost everything when they left that country: 
their businesses, their homes and all their money.  They came to 
this country as penniless refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one note we were saddened having to leave that country.  On 
the same note we were very fortunate to be embraced by this great 
country where opportunity and freedom are often taken for 
granted.  This is something I know the Canadian Alliance takes 
very seriously.  I am glad to be able to serve as a member of 
parliament 28 years later and to be able to stand up for those 
things about which I feel so dearly.  I know a number of 
Canadians feel proud to stand up for democracy and freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take steps back from time to time to remind us of how 
important those ideas are, especially in light of what happened 
to my family and what happens to millions of people around the 
world in unfortunate regimes where human rights and democracy are 
taken for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians we can be leaders and show the world how diversity 
and strength in diversity exist in Canada. We can share that 
information and be leaders around the world, hopefully bringing 
democracy and human rights to a lot of countries that do not have 
those practises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is neither here nor there.  Today we are discussing at 
second reading Bill C-31, the immigration and refugee protection 
act.  When reviewing this bill and the changes being proposed, 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration touts the new 
legislation as being tough.  It is to fix many of the problems 
currently faced within Canada's immigration system today. 
The truth is that the bill will not accomplish its objectives. It 
is likely to significantly slow down the entire immigration 
system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time resources are limited.  We have problems within the 
refugee process.  We have problems of immigrants wanting to go 
through a fair process to be evaluated before they come to 
Canada.  The last thing we need is for our immigration system to 
slow down, which would unfortunately encourage the illegal 
entrance of immigrants.  We will see more problems like the 
Chinese boat people and people profiting from trying to get 
people into the country illegally.  That is something we want to 
try to stop.  The best way to do it is to look at ways that will 
speed up the process and attach more resources to the immigration 
system, not slow it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter what is contained in the new act, it will never be 
effective if the government does not ensure improved management 
of the system, better training, tighter auditing and more 
emphasis on enforcement.  This is what I was referring to, 
especially when I mentioned the problems we faced in our

with refugees coming to the country illegally and many people 
profiting from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first complete overhaul of Canada's immigration laws 
in 24 years.  It was a good attempt to try to improve our current 
system.  Some amendments have been made to the current 
Immigration Act, introduced to the House of Commons in 1976, the 
most notable of which were changes to Canada's refugee 
determination system in the late 1980s with the creation of the 
Immigration Refugee Board.  This change was brought about by the 
controversial 1985 Singh decision that stated all refugee 
claimants were to be allowed an oral hearing of their claim and 
the right to appeal a negative decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time successive governments have interpreted the 
decision to mean that all refugee claimants, in fact any foreign 
national on Canadian soil, should be given the full protection of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  This interpretation 
of the Singh decision is a major contributing factor to Canada 
becoming the number one target for people traffickers and asylum 
seekers the world over.  It has allowed our immigration and 
refugee system to become overly bureaucratic and prone to legal 
delays.  The minister of immigration had a real opportunity—

the hepatitis C scandal from tainted blood has not been

</I></B></P><P align=left>Contaminated blood was not tested in Canada when other countries 
were carefully screening theirs.  Canada imported dirty blood 
from prisons in Arkansas.  Thousands of Canadians are sick 
because our watchdog, particularly the federal watchdog, failed 
them. Judge Krever's study recommended helping every sick victim. 
Yet federal Liberals chose to compensate victims only between 
1986 and 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over two years after that promise only the lawyers have been 
paid any compensation.  The Harris government in Ontario has 
agreed to compensate all victims, which is quite a contrast. 
Federal Liberals were forced to vote against the forgotten 
victims outside the 1986 to 1990 period.  My question is why.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Liberals on the human resources 
committee have dealt a body blow to their very own minister. 
They released a report today that recommends the dismantling of 
the human resources department in the wake of the billion dollar 
bungle by the minister.  They want the department carved into 
several smaller pieces so the amount of damage that the minister 
can do in the future will be limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister continue in her position when even her own 
Liberal colleagues have lost confidence in her? 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the report has just been made public.  Under the rules 
of the House, we will study it and we will make a reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government and a caucus, we certainly have complete 
confidence in the Minister of Human Resources Development, an 
outstanding minister and an outstanding parliamentarian. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the Deputy Prime Minister is 
the only who still has confidence in her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human resources minister has lost the confidence of 
Canadians, the opposition and now her own Liberal colleagues on 
the committee.  Her very own colleagues think she is incapable of 
managing HRDC unless large portions of the department are taken 
away from her.  It is a damning indictment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this, how can the minister justify keeping her job? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thought the hon. member was going to get up and 
congratulate this government, including the minister of HRDC, for 
the fact that the real gross domestic product was 4.9% in the 
first quarter, the 19th consecutive quarter of growth and the 
longest string of uninterrupted gains since the mid-1960s.  These 
are achievements of this government, including the minister of 
HRDC.  The hon. member ought to recognize this if he has any 
ethics at all. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously the Deputy Prime Minister 
picked up the wrong briefing note, that had absolutely nothing to 
do with the HRDC department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has come up with a new and innovative way of 
dealing with incompetence.  Instead of answering the demands of 
Canadians and the opposition to remove the HRDC minister from her 
department, he intends to follow the urging of his very own 
caucus and remove the department from the minister, piece by 
piece, bit by bit until all that remains is her image consultant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister not save the Prime Minister from going to 
all this trouble and do the honourable thing, resign? 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, after listening to that question I now know why the 
former Reform Party is hiding its incompetence by trying to 
change its name, but it will not get away with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian

concerned about hiding the results of internal audits than about 
the fact that HRDC bungled a billion dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A memo from a treasury board senior policy analyst to the deputy 
comptroller general warns about government managers' “backlash” 
in the wake of HRDC's damning internal audit.  The senior policy 
analyst then states that managers are planning to be more careful 
about the wording of future audits.

Treasury Board Secretariat is always very involved in the 
government policies that relate to financial practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perfectly normal that, over the past two years, we have 
conducted a full review of the responsibilities of managers in 
the public service to update them.

taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials are now suggesting that future audits need to be 
massaged to ensure that damning information is whitewashed. 
Senior policy analysts warn that it will be necessary to keep a 
closer eye on what is written in future audits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the minister my question again.  Why is the 
government more concerned about the political spin than about 
solving the problem of the billion dollar bungle?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
seems to me that the Canadian Alliance member should at least be 
able to recognize that it is a Treasury Board policy to allow, 
as soon as they are fully completed, internal audit reports to 
be made public without anyone even having to submit a request 
under the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not a transparent policy, then what is? This is very 
clear, and this is how we intend to continue to improve our 
policies at Treasury Board.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services has said that, 
since the CIO has been under his responsibility, no contracts 
have been awarded without tender.  We would have to conclude 
that, before him, it was standard practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned that, since he became responsible for the CIO on 
June 4, 1998, hundreds of thousands of dollars in contracts have 
been awarded without tender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much longer is the minister going to go on denying the

<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat that the Canada 
Information Office has always awarded its contracts according to 
Treasury Board policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I would say to the leader of the Bloc Quebecois and 
to the House that on March 8, 1999 I sent a written directive to 
the CIO informing it that, effective April 1, 1999, any contract 
over $25,000 had to be put out to tender.  Those are the facts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> That is very 
interesting, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, what the minister has just said is that he 
assumed responsibility for the CIO on June 4, 1998, and that the 
directive was issued eight months and six contracts later in 
March 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the minister said that no contracts over $25,000 had 
gone out without tender.  Will he admit today that it was only 
as of March 1999, and for practically one year, that he awarded 
contracts without tender?  As for those after March 1999, we are 
still waiting on access to information, and we will see the 
outcome of that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat that the CIO has always 
complied with Treasury Board policy and guidelines with respect 
to the delegation of authority.  All contracts have been awarded 
in accordance with this policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it was on March 8, a few months later, that I said 
why we had to change this policy.  On March 8, I issued a 
directive that any contract over $25,000 had to be put out to 
tender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House that, since April 1, 1999, all contracts 
in excess of $25,000 have been put out to tender. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
minister has just said he rigorously observes Treasury Board 
policies, I will point out that there are two main circumstances 
under which tenders are not called:  when national security is 
at issue and when market conditions indicate that nothing would 
be saved by calling for tenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the CIO awards a $27,000 contract without calling for 
tenders to Groupe Cible's Serge Paquette, a former Liberal 
candidate, to monitor the media, is this a matter of national 
security or market conditions? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat that the CIO has always 
followed the delegation of authority policies of the Treasury 
Board with respect to contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For two days, Serge Paquette has been the subject of discussion. 
I would remind the Bloc Quebecois House leader that Mr. Paquette 
was a candidate in 1988. Is he not entitled to earn a living, 
like other Canadians?

forget that Mr. Paquette was a candidate in 1988 if the 
government will forget it as well and have him go through the 
tender process.  That would be fine.  It would be excellent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister if he is prepared to forget all former 
candidates and Liberal members who systematically circumvent the 
tendering process and use public money to organize government 
propaganda in Quebec at our expense? 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government

the mother house in Quebec.

foreign ownership to 20%.  It is important to Canadians to 
control their banks and we are in full agreement.

allegations of corruption and the spread of organized crime in 
our ports resulting from the disbandment of the ports police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I raised concerns about important investigative

our number one law enforcement priority is fighting organized 
crime.  In fact the RCMP backs up any provincial or municipal 
port police or any other police force in the country in order to 
fight organized crime.  That is what the RCMP does.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
response from the solicitor general is just more of the same old 
excuses.  He might as well put up a neon sign in Vancouver saying 
that it is open season for the international drug trade.  I have 
been fighting tooth and nail to help stem the drug crisis in the 
downtown east side.  Without the port police, people in that 
community are threatened by crime and corruption.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian

House leader has any idea what legislation he will be bringing 
forward over the next week or so.  I would also like to know if 
there is going to be a fall session of parliament or an early 
election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, once I have finished answering 
the question perhaps I could ask my own supplementary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon we will resume consideration of Bill C-31, the 
immigration bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The business for tomorrow will be report stage of Bill C-11, 
respecting Devco, and report stage and third reading of Bill S-3, 
respecting international tax treaties.  If that business finishes 
early tomorrow I do not intend to call other business at that 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday we shall return to Bill C-32, the budget bill that was 
passed at report stage earlier this day.  We will do that bill at 
third reading.  That will be followed by resumed consideration of 
Bill C-31 if it has not been completed today.  In the event that 
it has, which I understand is possible, then we will resume 
consideration of Bill C-33, the species at risk legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuesday, June 6 shall be an allotted day during the normal 
sitting hours.  There have been consultations with other House 
leaders and there is agreement that we would sit Tuesday evening, 
under special provisions to be agreed to in the form of a motion, 
to complete the third reading of Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Wednesday I expect that the House shall consider Bill C-25, 
the income tax amendments, and Bill S-10, the DNA data bank 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thursday, June 8 shall be an allotted day.  At the present time 
it would be my intention to call Bill C-19, the war crimes bill, 
at report stage and third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the business of the House until the end of next week, at 
least to the extent that we can determine at the present time.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK186">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-31, an 
act respecting immigration to Canada and the granting of refugee 
protection to persons who are displaced, persecuted or in danger, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, prior to question period, I was 
talking about the changes being proposed to Canada's immigration 
and refugee laws.  For the benefit of those who are tuning in 
now, we are talking about Bill C-31.  I was also talking about 
how proud I am as a refugee myself, coming here almost 28 years 
ago, to be a Canadian and about how disappointed I am to see our 
immigration system not being able to keep up with the demands 
that have been placed on it and the problems that has created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot keep up with the pressures on our immigration system 
and the unfortunate spin-off of problems.  People are fed up 
waiting to go through the application process, either on the 
refugee process side or on the general immigration side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen many problems over the last number of years because 
of the lack of resources that have been placed in this particular 
area of the government.  We hope this will be changed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration touts 
the new legislation as being tough and fixing many of the current 
problems facing the system, it will not accomplish its objectives 
and will likely to significantly slow down the entire immigration 
system.  This is a big concern for us in the official opposition 
and for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter what is contained in the new act, it will never be 
effective if the government does not ensure that there is 
improved management of the system, better training, tighter 
auditing and more emphasis placed on enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on the idea of enforcement in light of the 
people smuggling and the number of refugees who have come from 
China in the recent past.  This has raised a lot of questions 
about our immigration system and specifically the track record of 
the government on the management of the department.  We do need 
to seriously address these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The passage of Bill C-31 would be like signing a blank cheque to 
a government that has proven incapable of managing Canada's 
immigration system.  The regulations will actually determine how 
the new immigration laws are applied and enforced. As I said, the 
immigration minister had the opportunity to make this bill work 
better but she has not done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area I want to touch on specifically is where we saw some 
really tough talk from this minister, especially when it came to 
describing the new legislation.  The bill will not deliver the 
necessary changes to re-establish the integrity of the 
immigration system and protect our borders from organized crime, 
terrorists, people smuggling and illegal immigration.  These are 
things that are very important to Canadians in light of some the 
things that have happened recently.  They want to see their 
immigration system work and their borders patrolled effectively. 
They want to see the resources needed to process immigrants and 
refugees put into the department to make the system work more 
effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for higher maximum penalties for the crime of 
human trafficking.  On the surface this appears to be 
strengthening our laws, and it does, but it will have little or 
no effect on the flow of illegal immigration to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stiffest penalties would apply only to those in charge of 
people trafficking operations.  They are untouchable under 
Canadian laws as they operate primarily outside the country. The 
biggest problem is how to actually bring to justice the people 
who are profiting from the illegal trafficking of people. If the 
bill does not even begin to address this issue, then we have 
failed.  The government has failed to strengthen this particular 
part of the bill and to stop the problem of illegal refugees and 
immigrants coming to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mid-level organizers who may live in Canada are protected by 
organized crime rings and are rarely caught and seldom convicted. 
Once this bill comes into force, it would be surprising to see 
even one person convicted and given a harsh penalty for the crime 
of human trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current maximum penalties have never actually been applied 
to anyone convicted of people smuggling.  In fact, as of 1999 the 
highest penalties ever handed out were 10 months in jail and a 
$3,000 fine.  This is hardly the type of justice that should be 
put down on these sorts of people who are creating the crimes 
specifically pertaining to immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to enforcement, Bill C-31 mirrors the current 
Immigration Act.  All that has really changed is how the act is 
laid out.  The minister's strong message should not fool 
Canadians into believing this piece of legislation will fix the 
system.  This bill lacks the necessary teeth to seriously address 
Canada's growing illegal immigration problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is touted as the result of extensive consultation with 
the Canadian public, industry experts, law enforcement agencies 
and parliamentarians.  The fact is that successive studies and 
reports were ignored by this minister.  She would be hard-pressed 
to point out where even a handful of the recommendations can be 
found in the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen over and over again that when recommendations are 
made through the public process, through inquiries, through a 
number of different channels trying to involve the public to 
improve legislation, to be reflective of what Canadians want in 
this country, that the government seems to ignore grassroots 
Canadians.  It seems to ignore the people that this type of 
legislation affects the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable to Canadians.  It is unacceptable to the 
official opposition.  We see legislation continuously pass 
through this place that could go a step further, that could be 
better, that could help Canadians.  However, unfortunately, with 
the government's lacks of response to grassroots Canadians, we do 
not see legislation being improved the way we would like to see 
it improved and the way Canadians would like to see it improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the new immigration bill were good legislation, which it 
is not, it would not be effective until the government implements 
better management, training, auditing and enforcement within the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 10 years the auditor general has stated that Canada's 
immigration and refugee system is in serious need of repair.  The 
government has continually failed to listen to Canadians as well 
as potential immigrants and refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general in his recent evaluation of Canada's 
immigration department states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole, we are very concerned about the Department's 
ability to ensure compliance with legislative requirements in 
this area.  We noted serious deficiencies in the way it applies 
admissibility criteria related to health, criminality and 
security.  It is somewhat disappointing to note the limited 
progress it has made since our 1990 Report....We believe that the 
Department needs to take corrective action without delay to 
ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the Canadian 
Immigration Program. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the auditor general speaking about Canada's immigration 
department and still the government refuses to acknowledge some 
of these criticisms, even from its own advisers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something which Canadians need to take note of, 
especially when we are dealing with a bill that hits so close to 
home, the immigration and the refugee matter.  It is a shame that 
this government will not even listen to its own auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the abysmal track record of the government and its 
management of the department, this is a very dangerous piece of 
legislation.  Much of the regulation in the bill is left to the 
regulation side and is not included in the legislative process 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk, generally, about what Canadians want to see 
when they look at their immigration system and the things that 
system should provide.  Canadians want an immigration system 
which will accommodate independent immigrants who will quickly 
add to our economy, which will welcome genuine refugees and which 
will reunite these people with their families as soon as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed to deliver what Canadians want in 
this new bill.  There are a total of two clauses in Bill C-31 
that refer to independent immigration.  The rest is left to the 
regulations, as I said.  Regulations will give the minister and 
her department the authority to determine, without guidance from 
the legislation, the definition of the terms child and common law 
partner; how to apply to amend the point system; how many of 
these applications would be approved every year; the number of 
immigration applications accepted each year; and the designation 
of classes of people such as spouses, foreign workers or foreign 
students who would be eligible for landing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises a few concerns for Canadians to have this sort of 
discretion left to the regulations and not defined specifically 
in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the committee process my colleague from Lakeland, who is 
our immigration critic, put forward a number of amendments to 
deal with this area, trying to strengthen this legislation to 
make it more responsive to some of the things I have mentioned, 
and especially trying to put some teeth into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the committee process we would hope there would be an effort 
made by all members of this place to be non-partisan and to put 
forward amendments to improve legislation, no matter what side of 
the House they sit on.  Committees are supposed to represent 
democracy and bring forth good ideas to make legislation better. 
They should not be involved in partisan politics. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have seen committees continuously deteriorate to 
become havens of partisan politics, where we do not try to help 
one another improve legislation, especially when a member of the 
opposition puts forward amendments which could make government 
legislation better.  Government members continuously vote down 
those amendments.  It is not that opposition members want credit 
for those amendments, they just want to see Canadians well 
served.  They want to see legislation improved and they want to 
see the committee process work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and again we see the government continuously slap 
opposition members in the face.  It slaps the committee process 
in the face and does not allow the committees to work the way 
they are supposed to.  It is disheartening.  It is disheartening 
to members of the opposition who are trying to serve their 
constituents and trying to improve legislation for Canadians.  It 
is disheartening for Canadians who sometimes have the opportunity 
to tune in to committees.  We do not even open up that process as 
much as we should.  It is disheartening to Canadians to see their 
parliamentary system not working the way it should to improve 
legislation.  We in the official opposition continue to fight to 
improve the transparency of this place, to improve the way the 
committee system works and hopefully to even have freer votes in 
the House to improve legislation.  No matter what side of the 
House members sit on, if they have good ideas which can improve 
legislation, those ideas should be heard and endorsed in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned with how immigration will benefit 
Canada.  This legislation provides no clear or firm laws to 
govern immigration.  Once again, Canada's immigration system will 
be left to the hands of bureaucrats and the government, leaving 
very little room for accountability to the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to summarize some of the points I have made in my 
speech today, especially in light of this bill and the changes 
that have been proposed to the immigration and refugee protection 
bill.  The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration touts this 
legislation as being tough; that it will fix many of the problems 
Canada's immigration system faces today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I and many of my colleagues have demonstrated, this bill will 
not accomplish its objectives and is likely to significantly slow 
down the entire immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the result Canadians do not want.  The result we were 
fighting for was to make our immigration system work better.  We 
want to have a system which focuses its resources properly, which 
makes this process work more effectively and which processes 
legitimate refugees and immigrants more effectively, not a system 
which is bogged down by a government that fails to lead and fails 
to make its system more transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned at the beginning, as an immigrant to this country 
it disappoints me greatly that this government will not act to 
implement the changes which Canadians want. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
really wonder whether the hon. member for Edmonton—Strathcona 
and I read the same bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, his understanding of the bill strikes me as rather 
minimal.  Since he mentions the fact that he is an immigrant, I 
am proud to say that I am no longer one—I am now a Canadian.  I 
will therefore speak as a Canadian, but one who knows what 
immigration is because I have been through it myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pick up on a few points. I should say that there 
are so many errors and misunderstandings about Bill C-31 on 
immigration and refugees that it is simply not possible to touch 
on all the points raised by the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there are four I would like to examine, the first being the 
fact that this bill is intended to strengthen immigration, 
people's plans to immigrant to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, for instance, that the minister has already concluded 
co-operation agreements with international agencies throughout 
the world for the specific purpose of stopping illegal 
immigration to Canada, not when these people land illegally in 
Canada, but at the source. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT64"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT64"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1525

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the minister has already travelled, to the 
People's Republic of China for instance, precisely in order to 
try to negotiate agreements with the government of that country 
to dry up illegal immigration to Canada at the source.  I 
believe that the hon. member for Edmonton—Strathcona has 
forgotten these points, which are to my mind very important 
ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to mention that there have been some very 
extensive consultations on this bill, and on Bill C-16 on 
citizenship.  We know that the minister and her predecessor in 
the House of Commons both held consultations across Canada. 
From speaking to a good many of my constituents, since my riding 
contains a large number of Canadians who were born elsewhere, I 
know that they are extremely pleased with this bill the minister 
has introduced, and totally support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member for Edmonton—Strathcona speaks of there 
having been consultations which the minister did not heed, I 
have to object.  I can see that my constituents are very 
pleased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind this hon. member, who benefited from 
generous legislation, who was able to come here to Canada with 
his family and who perhaps was able to bring in other relatives, 
that Canada is a generous country.  We do not want illegal 
immigration, but we do want to continue our tradition of 
generosity toward people, be they refugees or immigrants, to 
welcome them and later welcome their relatives when they want to 
bring them over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is room here in Canada.  We are all from somewhere else. 
Either we or our parents or great-grand parents came from another 
country and we want to continue that great tradition of which 
Canadians are proud and for which we are known throughout the 
world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not know exactly 
where to begin to address some of the comments the hon. member 
raised.  She raised some interesting points.  I will, however, 
try to address at least the last of her comments before I attack 
some of the other things she said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anyone would argue the fact that the immigration 
system should be generous.  The immigration system should work in 
favour of potential immigrants and refugees coming to this 
country, as it did when my family came, as she so rightly pointed 
out.  Unfortunately, things have deteriorated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, under this government's leadership things have become 
worse, especially when it comes to processing refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B>  Prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am being heckled from 
across the way about proving this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen more cases of people profiting from the trafficking 
of illegitimate refugees.  They have become more numerous, as we 
have seen from the news.  We have seen it more than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned in my speech, we do not have the proper resources 
and efforts are not being made to allow our immigration system to 
process refugees as well as immigrants expeditiously.  That is 
why there is so much pressure for people to jump the queue, to 
look at illegal ways to enter this country.  That would not be 
the case if our system worked effectively.  The proof is in the 
pudding.  This is common knowledge to many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we in the opposition have proposed many changes to 
the legislation which would focus resources more effectively to 
allow our system to process potential immigrants and refugees 
more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague opposite referred to the minister's trip to 
China to try to deal with this situation.  Unfortunately, her 
travels ended up to be mostly a joke.  She did not accomplish 
anything which she set out to do.  If travelling would solve the 
problems, we would not have to be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to take a good look at this.  I addressed the case of 
how this bill failed to meet the immigration minister's tough 
talk in describing the new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, when it comes to the integrity of the immigration 
system to protect our borders, to fight organized crime, 
terrorists, people smuggling and illegal immigration, this bill 
falls short.

else. By the time anybody comes to their MP usually they have 
gone through all of the other bureaucratic channels and then they 
try the political route.  By the time they come to our door they 
are extremely frustrated. Usually what I hear is that they are 
trying to do everything through the proper legal channels and 
within the parameters set out in the Immigration Act and they are 
having a terrible, tough time getting into Canada but people who 
arrive here by illegal means are brought ashore and embraced. 
Would my colleague remark on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that in my 
own experience, in my short time of being in this place, 
immigration is one of the biggest concerns that comes to my 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately it seems that the problems people are facing when 
it comes to bringing their own family members or various other 
people to this country, have grown ever so numerous. As I pointed 
out during the course of my speech, most of it seems to be that 
the immigration department cannot process immigrants properly. It 
takes forever.  People are frustrated.  It seems that the 
resources are not being allocated effectively.  We are not doing 
our job and the government is not doing its job in trying to 
serve the public and Canadians who are trying to go through the 
legal process, who go through the proper application process to 
get their friends, family or other immigrants to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the frustration every day in my office. Constituents are 
complaining about different parts of the immigration system. 
They complain that they have exhausted all the channels.  Some of 
them are in tears because they do not know where to turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government not responding to the needs of immigrants, 
to families and trying to be charitable or generous as my hon. 
colleague mentioned?  This is the last thing many constituents in 
my riding who are coming to me with immigration problems feel. 
They feel that the government is not being generous, that it is 
not dealing with immigration files expeditiously.  That is one of 
the great failures of this bill.  I wish we could have improved 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must inform the 
House at this stage that we are entering into a new phase of the 
debate.  From this point on speeches will be of 10 minutes. There 
will be no questions or comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very disappointed to learn that we are limited to 10 minutes 
because we are finally on a subject that we can really engage in 
some necessary debate, on the matter of policy relating to 
immigration and refugee issues. After struggling through Bill 
C-16 endlessly, it now seems we have very scant opportunities to 
really debate issues of substance regarding immigration policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I think it is a mistake to enter into any 
serious policy debate on the subject of immigration until we 
first answer the question, how big a country do we want?  How big 
should Canada be?  Why should we be setting policy if we do not 
even know what the goals are?  This debate has never really taken 
place in any meaningful way in the country.  Should Canada be 100 
million people?  Is there room for 200 million people or 50 
million people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir Wilfrid Laurier at the turn of the last century said Canada 
should be 100 million people by the year 2000. 
Frankly, given the birth rate and the demographics of the time, 
his statisticians and demographers were correct.  Had we 
maintained the same birth rate in 1900 throughout the whole 
century, we would be at 100 million people today.  He was 
correct, but things have changed. The birth rate has dropped 
dramatically. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the two things we have to look at if we are serious 
about growing our population and moving our population forward. 
Birth rate and immigration are the two factors that demographers 
build into their models when they are trying to see what Canada 
will look like 10, 20 and 50 years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the current birth rate without any immigration, in 100 years 
time we would be a country of 18 million people.  We are 32 
million today and 100 years later we would be 18 million people. 
Cities like Minneapolis will be bigger than that 100 years from 
now.  The computer models show that without immigration our 
population would shrink.  It cannot afford to shrink if we are 
going to be competitive in the new global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, obviously everyone in the House accepts that 
immigration is necessary for Canada for future economic growth, 
but how much?  We have not had that debate.  How can we set law 
and policy dealing with immigration if we do not know what our 
targets are, if we do not know what our goals should be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to preface my remarks with an urgent call that we 
should be having an honest non-partisan debate about what we want 
Canada to look like in the coming years.  It is very hard to say 
if Bill C-31 has any merits or if it meets our needs because we 
do not have any clear goal of what those needs are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have serious reservations about Bill C-31 and I 
share some of those feelings.  I have heard it said that it 
really asks more questions than it gives answers because, as was 
pointed out by the previous speaker, it is just a framework 
document.  All the meat and potatoes, all the guts, are going to 
be left to regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regulations are not things which are debated in the House.  It 
is a dramatically undemocratic process to let us figure out what 
colour to paint the lunch room and let someone else do all the 
important decision making, like how fast the assembly line should 
go. I feel slighted that we are not going to be debating the 
issues of substance.  That is all going to be within the 
regulations and within the purview of the minister and not within 
the purview of the House of Commons.  We are very concerned about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does contain a number of positive measures.  The 
consolidation of all the protection related decisions in the 
Immigration and Refugee Board will be a positive move. Ultimately 
however, critics we are talking to are saying that by 
inconsistently applying human rights norms in some context and 
then violating them in others, the bill fails to demonstrate any 
underlying commitment to justice and to our international 
obligations in the various institutions like the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the negative side I want to point out that the bill 
demonstrates an unhealthy obsession with criminality without any 
safeguards to protect the wrongly accused.  I believe this stems 
directly from the hysteria associated with six boatloads of 
illegal migrants who drifted up on the shores of British Columbia 
this summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that other countries are coping with this as 
well and coping with it in a more mature way.  Australia had 88 
boats of illegal migrants last year.  We had six.  It expects 150 
this year, but we do not see the same hysteria or the same urge 
to crack down, get tough and change immigration laws and policies 
based on what is really an anomaly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a saying that it is a poor sailor who sets his course 
by the lights of a passing ship.  What happened last summer was 
lights of a passing ship, and here we are prepared to permanently 
change our whole immigration policy based on that. That worries 
me and it worries a lot of the people we have been talking to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of issues I would like to go through.  One of 
the things we have to deal with, and it is a necessary evil I 
suppose, is the penalties which have to be increased for the 
trafficking of humans.  It is by international agreement more or 
less that all the countries of the world are starting to crack 
down on the illegal trafficking of human beings. 
It is one of the most reprehensible things going on in the world 
today.  It is tantamount to slavery and bonded labour.  These 
things cannot be tolerated in our country.  Therefore we approve 
the increase in the penalties for illegally trafficking people 
and the exploitation that is often associated with it.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We draw a cautionary note however.  I point out that in part of 
our history we were very proud of illegal trafficking and 
smuggling of human beings.  We had the underground railroad 
which, breaking all the laws of the land, illegally smuggled 
slaves from the deep south and brought them to Canada.  That is a 
part of our history we are very proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All over the world there are modern day underground railways 
taking place where people are being delivered from persecution by 
people who are breaking the law to do it.  I remind the 
architects of this legislation that we should not ignore the very 
real, courageous work that is going on in terms of smuggling 
people.  Sometimes people are being smuggled out of danger to 
save their lives. There is a line we have to view there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I must mention.  The bill makes reference to 
the best interests of the child.  We believe that incorporating 
that language is a step in the right direction. It shows up at 
various points in the bill.  But we do not believe it goes far 
enough.  Canada has stipulated to the UN Convention on the Rights 
of the Child and the language is far stronger within that 
convention.  We believe that the language in the legislation 
should accurately reflect the language we are already bound to 
under the UN convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must comment on the aspect of criminality.  I have noted 
before that we are disappointed in how much the bill concentrates 
on this aspect.  To bar anyone making a refugee claim who has 
ever been convicted of a “serious crime” is a terrible mistake. 
This is something we will call to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this clause Nelson Mandela would not qualify for 
immigration into this country because he was convicted of what 
was thought to be a serious crime in his home country.  He would 
not be allowed into this country.  The government and the 
Liberals were fawning all over themselves to touch the hem of his 
garment when Nelson Mandela graced us with his presence and now 
they are passing legislation one year later which would 
effectively bar that same man from ever becoming a Canadian or 
even taking sanctuary in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think this through.  There are some places with corrupt 
dictatorships where people are persecuted and put in prison for 
political ideology or any number of other reasons when they do 
not deserve to be.  Those people should not be barred access to 
Canada if they seek refuge here because they may have committed 
crimes under a regime that we do not even agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along those same lines we should be very careful that when we do 
revoke citizenship or turn people away from this country we never 
ever send them back to places that are known for torture or where 
they run the risk of being tortured because again, we are 
stipulated to the United Nations convention on torture.  We must 
make sure that our rules would never force such a thing to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I will mention in my final minute is that this 
government is missing a valuable opportunity to do something 
about the racist head tax.  The right of landing fee is 
absolutely racist.  It is racist because it economically 
discriminates against those who come from third world developing 
nations and who are often people of colour.  For those from West 
Germany it is not that hard to raise $975.  For those from the 
Sudan it is three years income and is impossible.  Therefore, 
whether by action or omission, we are inadvertently selecting 
people based on race.  The head tax should be eliminated if we 
are to welcome people to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I had more time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by 
complimenting the member for Winnipeg Centre for his very 
reasoned comments about the over-reliance of this new legislation 
on regulation rather than having the rules clearly stated and 
built into the bill.  This is just another of hundreds of 
examples that we have seen in the last seven years of the gradual 
erosion of the powers of parliament and the handing over to 
either the centre of the government or the bureaucrats, or both, 
the powers which should be exclusive to us in this Chamber.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the son and grandson of immigrants I have a very keen 
interest in what I see happening around me these days.  We have 
become, for the third time in a century, an immigration dependent 
country, an immigration dependent economy.  I do not think anyone 
would deny at this point that in order to keep the pump primed we 
do have to bring in more people, preferably people with skills, 
people with ambition, and people who can contribute physically 
and financially to the maintenance and growth of our economy. 
This should be the prime purpose of immigration.  This is what 
Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record I would like to quote the policy of the Canadian 
Alliance Party on that particular point: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have an immigration system that will accommodate 
independent immigrants who will quickly add to our economy; a 
system which will welcome genuine refugees and which will reunite 
people with their families as soon as possible. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed to deliver that, and I do not see any 
sign in the new act that it is on the line for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to address briefly the question of refugees, which 
seems to be the part of the Canadian immigration system that is 
attracting the most public attention and is causing the most 
concern to the general population.  It really hurts me as a 
Canadian to see how our country has been made a laughing stock of 
the world because of the way we handle refugee claimants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Migrants get their toes on Canadian soil, say the magic word 
refugee, and they are in.  That is a wonderful setup for criminal 
traffickers in human beings or for plain scofflaws and queue 
jumpers.  This is not the way to run a country.  If we to do it 
that way, why have an immigration department at all?  This issue 
is that it is becoming a rubber stamp.  It makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes back to a court decision in 1985.  The Singh decision 
made very clear that once people gets their toes on the ground 
they have all the rights and privileges of a Canadian citizen, or 
at least that is the way the decision was interpreted by the 
immigration department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government extended the Singh decision to mean that all 
refugee claimants, in fact any foreign national who lands on 
Canadian soil, should be given the full protection of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  That interpretation is 
certainly a major contributing factor to Canada becoming the 
favoured target all over the world for people traffickers, for 
scofflaws, for people who cannot be bothered to go through the 
formalities of proper immigration procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new legislation will outsing Singh.  According to the new 
act anyone who applies for entry into the country, no matter 
where in the world, automatically gains protection under the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  There is no other 
country on the face of the earth that gives citizenship rights, 
or rights equal to those of citizens, to foreign nationals 
outside its borders.  People trying to get into this country will 
think we have lost our minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to immigration officials who have read the bill 
and see what is coming. 
Obviously I cannot quote their names but they are appalled.  They 
are asking what they are going to do now when what looks like a 
spurious applicant comes before them and they say no for a good 
reason.  The person will then immediately invoke the rights our 
citizens would have under our constitution to challenge the 
decision made by these officers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the officers are confronted with this often enough, they will 
simply throw up their hands and say “It is no use.  We cannot 
keep bailing.  The hole in the boat is getting bigger all the 
time.  Our jobs are without purpose.  We will just have to open 
the floodgates and let people in”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope that clause in the legislation will be amended 
out before we finally get to vote on it.  It is an absurdity.  I 
do not know who makes up these things, but it must be somebody 
with a fine imagination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked about the idiocy of the new legislation, but there 
are some good things in it.  There is the stiffening of the 
penalties for trafficking, for example.  However, if we look at 
that closely, those clauses are without much meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone is a big time people smuggler, that person will not 
come to Vancouver, set up a booth on Hastings Street and say 
“Come now and we will arrange your illegal immigration”.  He 
will reside either in his home country or in a third country 
where we cannot get at him.  We have a law that says one could 
get a million dollar fine or a year in jail.  So what?  It has no 
effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard today a couple of times about how our minister has 
presumably partially stopped the flow of illegal immigrants by 
going to source, making trips and talking to officials in the 
source countries of illegal immigrants.  I am sure, oh so sure, 
that really deterred a lot of people.  In the real world how many 
do we think it deterred when we have legislation coming up that 
will give people the right and the opportunity to say that if we 
do not want to let them into our country they will appeal again 
and again and eventually get in.  What is our minister doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I deeply regret that I have only 10 minutes.  I wanted to tell 
the House a whole bunch of horror stories on the other side of 
the coin about legitimate immigrants, people who have come here 
with the best will and intent.  They have good jobs and are 
contributing to the country.  However, after years and years of 
effort, they have been unable to get landed.  I have a number of 
them in my constituency.  Even though I am in a rural and 
so-called remote area, I get more of these kinds of cases than of 
almost anything else but income tax.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, following on my colleagues I think 
it would be best if I asked a question in relation to Bill C-31. 
We have had many different waves of immigration in our history. 
From the Irish to the Chinese, to <I>The Last Best West</I>, we 
have had waves and waves of immigration. 
Why is it that in the last 10 or 15 years we have had more 
problems than in the previous 150 years?  That is the question 
Canadians want addressed.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To try to make the claim that this party is against immigration 
is absolutely false.  We have to put this department in its 
proper place so that it can function properly.  On a scale of one 
to ten Canadians might rate health care at five or police 
protection at two, but when it comes to immigration Canadians 
probably rate it at minus three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two doctors in my constituency, a husband and wife, were brought 
into the country.  They laboured long and hard, day in and day 
out.  They applied to go back to South Africa for a break and 
tried to get a permit to re-enter Canada.  They were two very 
honourable and trained physicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will find out this weekend when I return home if they were 
allowed re-entry into Canada.  They have tried their very best. 
They came to their member of parliament.  I tried everything I 
could, and finally on the day of the departure they said if they 
were denied they would never return to Canada.  These people came 
here and slaved it out in our hospitals, and that is the kind of 
treatment they receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give one more example.  Last week a girl in Ukraine had 
gone through everything legally.  She travelled 12 hours on the 
train to Kiev.  When she got there she thought all her papers 
would be in order.  Instead of just walking up and taking a card 
for the line up to get in the queue, she had to buy a place in 
the line in front of the Canadian embassy, right before the 
immigration officials.  What made it worse was that her 
application form was stamped rejected before she even completed 
the inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on, but this is what Canadians are telling me.  Like 
my colleague for Cypress Hills—Grasslands, I find these people 
come to their members of parliament when everything else breaks 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every case has been proven to be overly bureaucratic and prone 
to excessive legal delays.  Why is it that we are so absolutely 
tough and ignore those people who not only would make good 
citizens but are well trained and ready for a job in Canada.  One 
gentleman said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless this department becomes more effective in implementing 
better management, better training, better auditing and more 
enforcement within the system, it will continue to fail 
Canadians.

department.  It is atrocious.  I have files in my constituency to 
prove that this is so.

integrity of Canada's immigration system to protect yourselves 
from crime, terrorists and people smuggling is disgraceful”.  As 
my hon. colleague just mentioned, when we pick up the paper, it 
is unbelievable to see who is granted status immediately when 
they come into the country.  Yet, there is file after file on 
people who have been denied access and on cases which are still 
being looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do Canadians want?  We want the system we had in the last 
century that brought people into the country.  We had no 
immigration problems with law.  We had no immigration problems 
with unemployment.  What do we have to have?  We want an 
immigration system that will accommodate independent immigrants. 
We want the process of coming in to be improved.  Not only that, 
we do not want them to suffer unnecessary delays.  We need these 
people because they quickly add to our economy.  We welcome 
genuine refugees.  They know and have been told all around the 
world to get their feet on Canadian soil and they will be 
protected by the charter.  Our legal immigrants do not even like 
what they see.  Those who have come here are insulted by this. 
The government has failed to deliver what Canadians want and 
expect of this department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In attempting to be all things to all people, we have disgraced 
immigration in Canada.  We need to take the bill back, redraw it 
and go outside this Chamber to get information from people who 
are concerned about immigration.  We are not doing it.  Until we 
make big changes to this bill and to the approach taken by the 
department, we will continue to have an immigration scandal well 
into this century as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise on Bill C-31.  My hon. 
colleagues from Souris—Moose Mountain and Cypress 
Hills—Grassland focused on how immigrants who are trying to come 
into the country are frustrated by the process.  They spoke very 
eloquently.  I am going to focus on a few other areas 
specifically within the refugee process which I am very familiar 
with.  I was there last year when 600 Chinese boat people landed 
in Victoria and on Vancouver Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The name of the bill, the immigration and refugee protection 
act, suggests that the government wishes to protect refugee 
applicants.  I suggest that it makes Canada the easiest target 
for abuse of the refugee system in the world.  I will show the 
specific details in the bill.  That is not what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want an immigration system that will allow immigrants 
to come into Canada efficiently and quickly. Immigration built 
Canada and our economy thrives on it. Canadians want a system 
that welcomes genuine refugees, like people from Kosovo, East 
Timor and other places that are in conflict or danger.  What we 
do not want is a reputation for receiving economic refugees, or 
queue jumpers, or people who are abusing the system. 
Also once we get that reputation, people will want to come to our 
country through this process for illegitimate reasons and use it 
as a corridor to get into the United States.  They could have 
other reasons that could be illegal.

now were practically thrown out the front door of the courtroom 
last week by a justice in Victoria who was prepared to drop all 
the charges.  That has not happened, but it shows there is grave 
concern about the system and there is no leadership coming from 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus on the specifics. There are two key flaws in the 
bill which neutralize any possible positive changes the 
government could make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one relates to the Singh decision, the 1985 Supreme 
Court of Canada decision which states that genuine refugees, and 
I want to emphasize genuine refugees, would be afforded 
protection under the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that when these people come to Canada they are not 
genuine.  They are in fact economic refugees who are abusing the 
system and therefore should not be afforded the protection of the 
charter.  The government's interpretation of the Singh decision 
is that if someone puts one toe on Canada's soil and says they 
are a refugee, they are going to get charter protection. That is 
not what the Singh decision says.  It says that if a person is a 
genuine refugee under the definition of the Geneva convention 
then they would be afforded all the rights and protections of the 
charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is worse is the government is putting its own 
interpretation of that court decision into legislation.  Clause 3 
of the bill states, “This act is to be construed and applied in 
a manner that ensures any person seeking admission to Canada is 
subject to the standards, policies and procedures consistent with 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms”. That is appalling. 
It is an utter disgrace and an abuse of power.  Any person. They 
could be convicted criminals, terrorists, or queue jumpers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to a process where we honour our commitment to the 
Geneva convention. To give any person who shows up in this 
country and says “I am a refugee”, regardless of their past and 
how they got here all the protections of Canadian citizens, we do 
not give that to people who are trying to come into this country 
legitimately. There are people applying to our embassies abroad 
saying, “I would like to immigrate to Canada”.  We do not give 
them the protection of the charter for crying out loud, but a 
person who gets their toe on our soil does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People get on planes and rip up their passports.  I do not know 
how many hundreds of flight attendants have told me as I commute 
between Ottawa and Victoria on a weekly basis that when they do 
international flights it is a big problem.  Passengers destroy 
their documents on the plane and they get off the plane and say, 
“I am a refugee,” and here they are.  That is one flaw. It is 
absolutely unconscionable the government would even consider 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is the bill expands the definition of who can become 
a refugee in Canada.  Canada's definition goes well beyond what 
our commitment is to the Geneva convention.  Again we are a 
signatory to that convention.  We in the Canadian Alliance would 
like to honour that and we would do our fair share when we need 
to step up to the plate.  However the government is putting into 
legislation that any terrorist, any criminal, anyone for any 
reason who puts a toe on this soil, has the protection of the 
charter, which is absolutely wrong. 
We are ensuring that Canada is going to be the world's number one 
target for human smuggling operations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The nine Koreans who are on trial right now in Victoria and who 
came within a hair of being released and sent home to continue 
their business were laughing.  They were waiting for us to fly 
them home in one of our jets so they could fill up more boats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely unbelievable that the government cannot see a 
problem.  I want to emphasize that the problem is not the 600 
refugees who came on boats last year; it is the 20,000 or 22,000, 
I do not have the exact number but it is in that neighbourhood, 
who each year cross our borders or come through our airports.  It 
is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are cases in my office where Americans have come across 
the border saying, “I am a refugee. I have my toe on your 
soil”. They are afforded all the rights. It takes anywhere from 
two to five years to process them.  They come here for various 
reasons, whether it is health care or whatever.  They get 
processed.  We provide for them.  In my opinion there is not a 
genuine refugee from the United States who is facing political 
persecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is worse is that they leave and then they come back into 
Canada. They only have to be out of the country for three months 
before they can come back in and start a new claim.  I have files 
in my office of people coming from the United States on their 
third refugee claim.  The only thing they have to do is leave the 
country for 90 days.  It is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak to immigration officials in Victoria all the time.  They 
are equally frustrated that the government has taken no 
leadership.  They do not have a clue what is going to happen this 
year.  They have no money in the budget to deal with it.  More 
refugees are expected to arrive on a regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How has the government shown leadership?  By expanding the 
definition of refugees and bringing in legislation to guarantee 
charter protection when the Singh decision actually states that 
it is only for genuine refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue that when these people arrive here, we should have 
concerns of whether they are genuine refugees and detain them 
until we can determine very quickly, whether it is weeks or 
months, if they are genuine refugees.  If they are not, then they 
are not going to be afforded those charter protections. We can 
interpret the Singh decision in that manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for action.  The bill is full of empty threats of 
maximum penalties for snake heads and organized crime.  Does the 
minister of immigration believe that she is going to go over to 
China and apply our laws to people over there?  I do not know if 
she thinks she is a keystone cop.  It is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one way to send a message to stop human smuggling 
and stop the pain and misery of the people coming over in those 
rusty old ships, to stop them from dying en route.  There is only 
one way and that is when they arrive here, bring them ashore, 
help them out for a few days if they need medical attention, then 
put them on a plane and send them home. We would be doing them a 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to consider that and to quit trying to 
play politics and trying to score political points.  Canada's 
reputation is becoming an absolute disgrace in the international 
community as we are opening our borders up to who knows who.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is an honour to enter the debate on the immigration 
and refugee protection act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I had to leave for a while to attend a committee 
meeting, but I listened to as much of today's debate as I could. 
I was taken back in my memory to the early days of my life, when 
the fact that we were immigrants to Canada was burned into my 
brain and into my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one of those very fortunate people who is here because my 
grandparents made the decision to immigrate into Canada. I am a 
first generation Canadian.  My parents, though they did not know 
each other when they came to Canada, were each in their very 
early teens when they came here.  I believe my dad was 12 years 
old.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember listening to the conversations of the adults in our 
family.  We were supposed to be sleeping, but we would listen to 
them talking about life in the old country, the hardships they 
endured and the way in which they escaped.  They were very 
grateful to be in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one who fundamentally is supportive of the idea of 
immigration.  I like the idea that in Canada we can move from 
province to province freely, especially because my family came 
from a country where to go to a neighbouring city to visit 
relatives they had to get a permit from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It sounds like Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I grew up in Saskatchewan and we do not have 
those rules in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the great freedoms that should accrue to human beings is 
the freedom of movement within the land they are going to and the 
land they are coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My grandmother often expressed gratitude because her family grew 
up in Canada instead of Russia, from which they had escaped. 
Even though I did not experience it firsthand, the stories were 
repeated frequently in my youth and I learned them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very important that in the early 1920s Canada 
extended an open hand of welcome to my family.  I am one who 
believes that if I have received a benefit, I should pay it back. 
It is the old maxim of do unto others as you would have them do 
unto you.  I do this even at home.  When I picked up a hitchhiker 
the other day I told him that I was not giving him a ride because 
I was looking for points.  Long before I ever ran for elected 
office I picked up hitchhikers because I was a hitchhiker myself 
when I was a young student. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having had my family come to Canada as immigrants, I believe we 
should do everything possible to admit people who have the 
potential to be good citizens, who will contribute to our society 
by working hard, providing for themselves and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-31 is supposed to address some of the problems that we 
have within our immigration system, but as some of my colleagues 
have pointed out in earlier debate today it falls far short of 
the goals that most Canadians want for our immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think of the people who come to Canada as bona fide good 
people, it really is an affront to them that we would do anything 
less than protect their integrity entirely by making sure that 
those who are not qualified to be here, who are here on illegal 
or dishonest pretences, should not be permitted to stay, and 
thereby to tarnish the reputation of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes we in my party are charged with not being immigrant 
friendly.  That is a totally false accusation.  Whenever people 
say that they are distorting the truth about what we believe in. 
We in the Canadian Alliance believe that there should be a very 
orderly immigration system and that people who meet the 
qualifications should be able to enter our society in Canada, 
enjoy it and contribute to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned about the fact that some people who come to 
Canada are given exceedingly excessive opportunities to rip off 
the system when it has become very clear that they are not honest 
immigrants. 
They do not come under the classification of being people who 
would satisfy the needs of Canadian society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does one handle this?  I believe the intent of the bill 
should have been that in the event people are shown to be, for 
example, trafficking in people, we should have taken very strong 
measures against the traffickers.  It was not done.  I am 
concerned that, with our very weak policies, Canada will become 
the worldwide haven for international criminals.  It is totally 
unconscionable that these immigrant smugglers take large amounts 
of money from people who need to escape from their own country, 
for whatever reason.  These illegal people runners take large 
amounts of money from them and then, to add insult to injury, put 
their lives at risk by putting them into vessels which are not 
seaworthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, being a very compassionate nation, rightfully opens up 
its doors to them when they come to our shores.  I do not think 
anybody would suggest that we should not look after their 
immediate physical needs, but as long as we have a very soft 
policy on this kind of immigration it will continue and it will 
grow.  The only way to stop it is to make sure that those who are 
doing it do not have the reinforcement of having success in their 
illegal enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the government should take very strong measures 
in this area.  This is not our party policy, but one of the 
things which I personally think we should do is use radio 
transmissions to communicate directly with people in the 
countries from which these people come.  We should put out a 
message which says that for those who are not genuine refugees, 
just simply coming to our shores will not mean automatic access 
to our country.  That would dry up the source of business for 
mercenaries who trade in human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What most Canadians want, certainly the ones I have talked to, 
is an immigration system that accepts refugees who are genuine 
refugees, and accepts with open arms immigrants who are capable. 
One of the shortcomings in our country is that when we are not 
able to train our own citizens in certain skills, Canadian 
immigration laws become a huge barrier to our business people and 
manufacturers who want people to come from other parts of the 
world where they have received the training.  They are not 
permitted to come here.  Yet other people, with all sorts of 
nefarious motivations, are allowed to come and we do not have the 
mechanisms to get rid of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand as a proud Canadian, as one who believes that we should 
show compassion and care for those people who genuinely need it. 
I stand simply to encourage the government to improve the refugee 
and immigration policies, bills, motions and laws.  This bill 
will not do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let me start by picking up on what was said by my 
colleague from Winnipeg Centre who was in the midst of delivering 
what I thought were some interesting remarks when his time ran 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He started with the question:  How big should Canada be?  What 
should the immigration number be?  What should the population be 
before we add— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt, but I have just been advised that the hon. member for 
Sydney—Victoria has already spoken in this debate.

much more to say. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  No, it is Vancouver Island North, Madam Speaker. 
I want to get it right, just to ensure that I am not put in the 
position of being told I have already spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  And with such an important riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Yes, such an important riding.  As a 
matter of fact, from a citizenship or immigration perspective, 
perhaps my riding was rather pivotal in bringing this issue to 
parliament because that is where the boats carrying the Chinese 
migrants landed last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are Canadians looking for in our immigration act?  That is 
the key question we should be asking.  The official opposition 
has a very clear picture of what that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want an immigration system which will accommodate 
independent immigrants who will quickly add to our economy, which 
will welcome genuine refugees and which will reunite these people 
with their families as soon as possible.  This government has 
failed to deliver what Canadians want in this new bill.  That is 
a pretty simple equation, but it is a very important question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fabric of our country and the future of our country is 
dependent on people.  We all know that.  People are what make 
this place.  We all came from somewhere.  We are all basically 
immigrants from somewhere, or progeny of immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is saying that the changes to the act we are 
debating today are the result of consultation.  All I can say is 
that it is pretty selective choosing from that consultation.  I 
cannot find in my heart or in my head where the changes being 
brought forward reflect the concerns of Canadians when it comes 
to our immigration system.  Those concerns are many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are not concerned about the level of immigration; people 
are concerned about the components of immigration.  People want 
assurances that we are bringing to Canada people who will benefit 
Canada in the long run and people who need the safe haven of 
Canada.  We want to do good for the world, but we also want to 
look after the best interests of the future of our society and of 
Canada.  That means we have to put some safeguards in place, and 
those safeguards are very important indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament we all work with immigration cases 
every day of the week.  Our administrative staff work on 
immigration cases every day of the week.  We also work with 
immigration officials.  We know what the problems are in the 
system.  We probably know the problems in the system better than 
almost any other group of Canadians as a collective.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major question right now is how to take whole issue of people 
smuggling and turn it on its head.  Canada, as we know, has 
become a target.  There are two ways to do it.  We can use the 
hammer and try to penalize the people smugglers or we can remove 
the incentive to smuggle people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not particularly good at using the hammer.  As a 
matter of fact, we are terrible.  We have an international 
reputation for it.  One way to describe the posture of successive 
governments in Canada when it comes to this kind of issue is to 
say that we are not warriors, but boy scouts 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All things being equal, an incentive is always better than a 
penalty if the same results are achieved.  It usually costs less 
and is much more effective.  People do it because that is the 
natural course of events given the set of rules and the 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are operating under a perverse system when it comes to 
immigration in Canada.  The way our immigration act is construed 
and the way these changes have been made still lead us to the 
very same place where the likelihood of penalty that is 
meaningful to a people smuggler is almost nil and the likelihood 
of a major reward is infinitely large.  The consequence of that 
is like a government subsidy.  If something is subsidized, we get 
more of it.  There is nothing here to tell me that we will reduce 
people smuggling as a consequence of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a status quo document that the minister is using as a 
public relations message in order to defend the Liberal love of 
the status quo while at the same time trying to sell to the 
public the fact that she is actually doing something when we know 
that this is not going to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a larger problem here.  The United Nations has defined a 
refugee and we signed that convention.  Canada, in its 
wisdom—and I am being facetious when I say Canada in its 
wisdom—has chosen not to follow the UN convention on refugees. 
If we had followed that convention, most of the people who have 
arrived and declared refugee status would not be refugees because 
they arrived through a safe country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the UN convention says that refugee status is declared 
at the first safe country of arrival.  If Canada has refugees 
arriving in large numbers there can be only one reason:  we are 
being targeted and it is symptomatic of a bigger problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bigger problem we have is that we have the easiest, most 
vulnerable, most generous and easiest acceptance ratio of any 
western nation community.  That is not doing us a favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it is leading to is that we are not getting the average or 
better than average client refugee profile.  There is a tendency, 
when creating a system such as ours with all those 
vulnerabilities, that we will end up with a lesser group.  We 
will particularly end up with that element, a small element 
admittedly, but an element with criminal intent to a larger 
degree than countries with tougher standards. 
I think the Canadian public has again been sold a bill of goods. 
The changes in this bill will ensure that Canada remains the 
number one target for human traffickers and queue jumpers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one reads that clause it sounds laudable, does it not?  It 
sounds like a great process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer the telephone in my riding office was ringing off 
the hook when those people arrived by boat and our system was 
unable to deal with them in an expeditious manner.  Yet here we 
find on page 18 of the bill, subparagraph 33(2)(b), that a person 
will not necessarily be ruled inadmissible.  It says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—does not lead to a determination of inadmissibility by reason 
only of the fact that the foreign national entered Canada with 
the assistance of a person who is involved in organized criminal 
activity. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, that is a neon sign to the world saying that 
foreign nationals just have to plead their innocence.  If they 
come here on a boat, they will be okay.  Canada will say that it 
may get after the captain of the boat to whom the foreign 
nationals might have paid money, but the foreign nationals, being 
so-called innocent passengers, the traffic or the merchandise, it 
will not necessarily exclude them at all.  In fact, come one come 
all is the essence of what that says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the problem with the clause that talks about the 
charter of rights and freedoms.  Certainly we want to deal with 
processes of decision in an orderly manner with hearings, rights 
of appeal and so on under the spirit of the charter of rights and 
freedoms, but there seems to be a difference between the ability 
of someone who comes to the border in a car and pulls up to the 
kiosk.  At that point the customs person asks a few questions and 
what an individual says through that car window is later taken 
into consideration if the person is called into the office.  What 
the individual says to those questions on the statement of 
purpose:  who are you, are you a citizen, and whatnot, are 
admissible and can be used to further assess the individual's 
admissibility or whether they should be arrested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if someone is found on a boat floating on to the 
western coast of Canada?  The statements made to the questions 
who are you and what are you doing here can be inadmissible 
because the foreign nationals did not have their charter warning 
or did not have access to a lawyer who knew what would go on in a 
later hearing.  The ability of officers or anyone to ask or 
investigate in the beginning to find out what has happened gets 
struck down because it will be later argued that the person's 
charter rights were violated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other clauses that I have a particular problem with 
is the proceeds of crime section.  I notice that clause 123 on 
page 53 is particularly good.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No person shall possess any property or any proceeds of any 
property knowing that all or any part of the property or of those 
proceeds was obtained or derived directly or indirectly as a 
result of the commission of an offence under subsection— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It then provides the penalty.  The penalty of course is a stiff 
fine or up to 10 years in jail.  We have to wonder, by the way, 
when anybody has ever been significantly prosecuted for trading 
in people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international reputation of Canada is very poor in that 
regard.  The motive is high because the profits are high. It is 
much safer to deal in people than it is to deal in drugs because 
the penalties are not there.  Of course the act already says that 
the commodity that they are dealing in will be legal and accepted 
rather than being contraband, such as drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's reputation on prosecuting and acting as a deterrent to 
those who are involved in what I call the modern day version of 
the slave trade really is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at this clause I see that there is a fine and jail, 
but what about all the proceeds of the crime?  We have proceeds 
of crime legislation under the criminal code but not under the 
immigration sections.  We cannot go after the various houses, 
lands, vehicles and all the rest of it that may be owned legally 
through a holding company or whatever, but upon any ordinary 
investigation could be traced to the proceeds of this type of 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we need to go after more carefully the 
tremendous financial incentives that cause people to get involved 
in this kind of business:  the human misery of trading in people. 
This is a great deficiency in the bill itself.  I have attempted 
to deal with that in a private member's bill which is currently 
in the system to be drawn.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to have confidence again in the immigration 
system.  Governments, both through the Conservative years and 
since 1993 with this administration, have failed to bring 
anything forward of substance to deal with the tremendous 
disrepute that our immigration system has fallen into.  Average 
Canadians have observed case after case of how the system has not 
responded as they want, or as they see their country and how they 
define themselves as Canadian.  They have seen illegals come into 
the country and abuse the system, which has carried on for ever 
and ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to restore confidence in the Canadian immigration system 
so that when someone says he or she is an immigrant, the person 
can immediately command respect because of the knowledge of the 
orderly and high standard system.  We know that the person has 
come through a system which brings great respect to the 
individual.  I hope the government will restore confidence in the 
immigration system again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise again in the House to raise the issue of 
Scotia Rainbow.  I find it unfortunate that I still have to do 
this but it is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still too many unanswered questions with regard to the 
operations of Scotia Rainbow.  There are questions like how much 
money did it receive by way of federal and provincial sources and 
how many people is it employing?  We would think that these would 
be easy questions to answer.  It looks like the government cannot 
do it or does not want to be held accountable.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be easy for the government to put this issue to rest 
once and for all if it would just give us the answers.  Why does 
it continue to protect Scotia Rainbow?  What stakes does it have 
in this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This drama continues under the guise of economic assistance for 
Cape Breton Island.  We all agree that Cape Breton's economy is 
in desperate need of help.  After the government's devastation of 
the fishery, the devastation of the coal industry, and the 
devastation of employment insurance, health care and 
post-secondary education, all caused by the Liberal government, 
Cape Breton Island needs to rebuild its economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the government do in return?  It sent money to the tune 
of $20.9 million to a company.  Is this the thanks Cape Bretoners 
get for working hard and building this nation?  It amounts to a 
slap in the face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Cape Breton are not looking for handouts.  All we 
are looking for is a commitment from the government to long term, 
well paying, sustainable jobs on the island.  There is no doubt 
that the federal government has sent a lot of money to Cape 
Breton.  The only problem is that there is nothing to show for 
it.  Large numbers of initiatives have been co-opted by a few 
with self-interests.  These self-interests are costing Cape 
Breton its economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking is quite simple.  How many jobs were created at 
Scotia Rainbow, and how much money did it receive from the 
federal government?  That is all.  The government keeps saying 
that it has nothing to hide.  It is all very simple.  If there is 
nothing to hide then show us the facts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to respond to the question of the member for Bras 
d'Or—Cape Breton regarding Scotia Rainbow Incorporated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scotia Rainbow Incorporated is an aquaculture operation 
headquartered in Arichat, Nova Scotia, and operating a number of 
sites throughout Cape Breton Island and northeastern Nova Scotia. 
The community of Arichat lost hundreds of fish processing jobs as 
a result of the groundfish moratorium and a corporate decision to 
demolish the fish plant, the community's largest employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year Scotia Rainbow employed up to 250 people on a seasonal 
basis at various sites on Cape Breton Island.  The company 
projects employing up to 300 people on a seasonal basis this 
year.  Scotia Rainbow is one the largest aquaculture operations 
in Nova Scotia.  It is an export oriented company with products 
sold in Japan and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently Scotia Rainbow encountered financial difficulties.  On 
February 28, the Bank of Montreal issued a demand notice pulling 
its $10 million line of credit.  The bank obtained court approval 
for the appointment of an interim receiver on March 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response, Scotia Rainbow filed a notice of intention to file 
a proposal with the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on March 10. 
This notice of intent effectively prevents the bank from 
proceeding with the liquidation of the company's assets until the 
court determines that there is no likelihood of Scotia Rainbow 
being restructured into a viable company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 19, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia extended the 
deadline for the filing of a restructuring proposal until June 
30.  At present the company is working to find further private 
sector investment in order to restructure its financing and 
effectively replace the financing provided through the Bank of 
Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has to date invested approximately $8.8 
million into Scotia Rainbow.  The $8.8 million was provided 
through a $1 million repayable contribution or loan from the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, an interest bearing loan 
from the Farm Credit Corporation of $5.8 million, and a $2 
million investment from the transitional jobs fund administered 
by Human Resources and Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of this total, $800,000 have been repaid to the Farm Credit 
Corporation.  Of the $8.8 million, $5 million were provided for 
the initial startup of the company.  The remaining $3.8 million 
from the Farm Credit Corporation were provided for the expansion 
of the company, which was partially completed prior to the Bank 
of Montreal sending its demand letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt the hon. parliamentary secretary but his time has 
expired. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
