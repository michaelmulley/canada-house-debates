	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this past Sunday, September 29, the spiritual leader of the Greek 
Orthodox Church of Canada, His Grace Bishop Soterios was 
elevated to the ranking of Metropolitan by His All Holiness 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and the Holy Synod. In 
addition, I am proud to say that our Diocese of Canada will now, as 
a result, be recognized as a Metropolis.
<P>
	It is a very proud moment for all Orthodox Canadians of 
Hellenic descent to have this honour bestowed on us. As the 
spiritual leader of the Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, His 
Eminence Soterios has worked diligently with zeal, compassion 
and understanding to improve our lives spiritually within a united 
Canada.
<P>
	Over many years of dedicated service to the Lord and to the 
congregations, His Eminence Soterios has worked tirelessly, 
initiating programs to address the needs of both young and old, 
such as family counselling, women's issues, senior services and 
youth programs.
<P>
	To this end I wish to express my heartfelt congratulations, 
wishing His Eminence good health and longevity. May the good 
Lord give him strength to continue his excellent work.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the construction work on the new Perley Bridge 
between Grenville, Quebec, and Hawkesbury, Ontario, was begun 
this past June 10, the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services indicated that 50 per cent of the workers would come from 
Quebec, and 50 per cent from Ontario. Yet, on the construction site, 
the majority of workers are from Ontario.
<P>
	Dufferin Construction apparently hired its workers through the 
Hawkesbury Employment Centre. Unfortunately, the Lachute 
employment centre does not offer the same service as its Ontario 
counterpart. In Quebec, workers have to contact the Commission 
de la construction du Québec, the CCQ. The only problem is that 
the employer, in this case Dufferin Construction, has not contacted 
the CCQ for a list of potential workers.
<P>
	I am therefore asking the minister of public works to intervene 
so as to ensure that Quebec workers may enjoy the same 
opportunities as their Ontario colleagues, as promised by the 
Minister last June.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday in the House the Liberal member for 
Souris-Moose Mountain made grossly inaccurate statements. He 
alleged that I was telling people in his riding to not respect the law. 
That is totally false. In fact it was the opposite.
<P>
	The audience of over 200 was clearly told they should work to 
defeat the Liberal government so that Reform could repeal Bill 
C-68 and farmers and shooters would not have to register their 
guns.
<P>
	The member did not come or even send representatives to this 
most important meeting in Moosomin. For over 200 farmers to 
show up at this meeting at harvest time shows how important an 
issue this is. They are frustrated with a government that does not 
listen and runs roughshod over the fundamental rights of people. 
Useless laws cause people to lose respect for the law.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Is this member telling his constituents to immediately run out 
and register their guns? Has he done an about face and decided 
that gun registration is a cost effective way of controlling crime?
<P>
	I request that he immediately withdraw his statement. It is totally 
unacceptable for the member to blatantly misrepresent my words 
and Reform policy.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, where are the 
Atlantic Liberal MPs? Why will they not speak up for their 
constituents?
<P>
	Last Friday I challenged all Atlantic Liberal MPs to sign a 
motion that would require the House to debate the new EI fisheries 
regulations. As of today, not one Atlantic Liberal MP has agreed to 
sign the motion that would allow proper debate.
<P>
	These new regulations, which were quietly tabled, will see the 
employment insurance benefits for fisheries reduced by $33 
million. The savings will come from lowering benefits, shortening 
the duration of benefits and penalizing repeat users.
<P>
	Today I challenge my colleagues from all parties to rise above 
partisan politics, to preserve the quality of life and dignity of our 
fishing families. With these new EI regulations, the government is 
unfairly punishing our fishers.
<P>
	I ask all my colleagues to sign. I only need about 30 signatures 
and it will be debated in the House. Atlantic fishing families are 
waiting for Parliament to do what is right, to stand up and protect 
their livelihood.

	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Robert Bourassa was a man who represented Quebecers throughout 
Canada, and his political career was devoted to promoting the 
collective prosperity of his fellow citizens. He was, in brief, one of 
the architects of modern Quebec and he had a vision of Quebec of 
the future.
<P>
	Everyone who has known Mr. Bourassa has been struck by his 
strong democratic values and his particular sensitivity to the most 
disadvantaged in our society.
<P>
	Throughout his entire career, his prime objective was the 
economic development of Quebec, but he was also concerned about 
social justice. Robert Bourassa was a real human being and easily 
approachable. No matter how busy he was, his door was always 
open.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>

Speaker, as a member of Parliament and a lifelong farmer, rural 
economic development is at the top of my priority list. As the fall 
harvest is upon us, I would like to take this opportunity to pay 
tribute to all Canadian farmers who help make the Canadian 
economy strong by their hard work and determination, particularly 
those farmers from my riding Dauphin-Swan River.
<P>
	We can be proud that Canada's farmers produce the safest and 
highest quality food products in the world. Our farmers make a 
valuable contribution to the Canadian economy. Agriculture 
accounts for 8 per cent of the GDP and 15 per cent of all 
employment in this country.
<P>
	Hats off to Canadian farmers. Their efforts and hard work will 
continue to help Canada remain the best country in the world. Let 
us not forget that rural economic development initiatives of the 
Liberal government ensure that all Canadians, rural and urban, 
benefit from strong economic growth.

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with the 
passing of Robert Bourassa, today Quebec has lost a great defender 
of Quebec's interests. A man of principle, brave, tenacious and 
dedicated both to his family and to Quebec. He has put his mark on 
our history.
<P>
	Throughout his life he fought for Quebec with conviction, 
determination and skill, always showing the greatest respect for 
allies and opponents alike. He leaves an impressive political 
legacy, as reflected in his economic policies as well as in his 
repeated demands for broader powers for Quebec.
<P>
	On behalf of all my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, I wish to 
extend our most sincere condolences to his wife and children.

	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, most 
Canadians thought that the previous minister of immigration was 
hopeless, but the new one is even worse. She has failed to get rid of 
more than 1,300 bogus and criminal refugee claimants in the 
Vancouver area alone.
<P>
	In March I wrote the minister about one of many in my riding, a 
man who has been forging passports so that other criminals could 
get into Canada and join him. It was a profitable home based 
business. He paid no income tax on the proceeds. He had no 
business licence and he remitted no GST.
<P>
	For passport forgery he got three paltry month's probation at 
home. He even qualified for Canadian citizenship after entering 
Canada for a second time after lying to immigration officials about 
his past. Now he is accused of sending someone else in his place to 
the citizenship ceremony.
<P>
	When will this failure of a minister start earning her salary by 
ridding us of these criminal refugees and taking some meaningful 
action to put a stop to them getting into the country in the first 
place?

	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
there is good news in Chatham, Kent county for the economy, 
farmers, workers and the environment. Commercial Alcohols Inc. 
has announced the construction of an ethanol plant. The $153 
million facility will generate 400 direct and indirect jobs, provide a 
new market for 15 million bushels of corn, and create additional 
jobs in trucking.
<P>
	Once the operation of the plant is under way, it will run 24 hours 
a day, seven days a week, producing 150 million litres of fuel 
ethanol and industrial alcohol. It is a truly Canadian success story.
<P>
	This announcement demonstrates that investors are confident in 
the Canadian economy and they are confident in the government's 
alternative fuels policy. This announcement also demonstrates that 
we can achieve great things in partnership with the private sector.
<P>
	I wish to thank Commercial Alcohols Inc. and all those who 
helped this plant to succeed. I urge my colleagues and all 
Canadians to share in the success. Think Canadian and fill up with 
Canadian ethanol blended fuels.

	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was very sad to hear the news this morning of the death 
of Robert Bourassa. Although I campaigned for one of his 
opponents during the leadership campaign in 1983, Mr. Bourassa 
did me the honour of appointing me to his cabinet in 1985.
<P>
	Even after our political paths diverged, Robert Bourassa showed 
me and my two colleagues, Richard French and Herb Marx, the 
understanding and courtesy that imbued all his personal relations.
<P>
	In paying tribute to his memory, I would like to take the few 
moments I have to talk about a side of his character that is less 
well-known. He was, above all, a very warm individual. Seemingly 
cool, he was simply a very nice man. Behind that stern face 
sparkled a great sense of humour. He was, above all, unfailingly 
cordial and sympathetic in his dealings with all his colleagues. He 
never took himself seriously. His door was always open, and the 
most junior member would always feel welcome and find a 
sympathetic ear.
<P>
	I therefore wish to express my loyalty to and respect for the man 
who was, more than a leader-he was a friend. To Mrs. Bourassa 
and her family I wish to extend our profound and most cordial 
sympathy.

more than $20 million would be invested in the Biotechnology 
Research Institute in Montreal.
<P>
	This institute, which is part of the National Research Council of

it opened in 1987, the BRI has helped businesses as prestigious as 
Ibex Technologies, Medicorp, Immunocorp, Quantum

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I remember the first time I met him and we spoke. He was 
crammed with his feet up to his chin in a used car that I used to 
drive around as a political organizer. In that position he made a 
commitment to me and to other Quebecers that night-I was a 
novice at the time-that he had a deep commitment to public 
service and to ensure that members of Quebec's cultural 
communities continue to play a strong role in Quebec's future

weapons entirely. It is not enough just to talk about getting other 
countries who have not signed the treaty yet to sign on, like India. 
The fact is that countries like India, while I wish they would sign 
the treaty, have a point when they say that the countries who now 
possess nuclear weapons should be working to abolish those 
weapons faster than they are.
<P>
	I urge the government to break out of the NATO mindset and to 
work toward the abolition of nuclear weapons, weapons which I

principle of free speech which is the foundation of a free and

freedom to commit an act ends when that act causes another 
individual harm.
<P>
	This is the case with slasher films. Just as movies can inspire us 
to do great things, they can also inspire individuals to commit

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in his testimony before the Somalia commission this 
morning, Roberto Gonzales, the former director of public affairs at 
National Defence, made a shocking revelation, stating that not only 
was General Boyle, the chief of defence staff, aware of a plan to 
tamper with information to be released but that he had actually 
approved this plan.
<P>
	In light of the fact that Mr. Gonzales states unequivocally that 
final approval for the cover-up operation came from General Boyle 
himself, how does the Minister of Defence intend to react to such a 
damning revelation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have made 
the same argument a number of times over the last few weeks. We 
have a process that is now working and that is the commission of 
inquiry. All people are free to come to the inquiry and give their 
evidence and facts as they see them.
<P>
	It is inappropriate for anyone's testimony, anyone's set of facts, 
anyone's set of circumstances that is being raised at the inquiry to 
be debated in the House of Commons. Let the commissioners do 
their work. Let them issue a report and the government will 
respond.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Gonzales testified he met with General Boyle in 
person to get his approval to tamper with the information, which is 
no insignificant matter.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Defence. I can see that he 
wants to keep General Boyle in his position at all costs, but in the 
light of the numerous allegations condemning the chief of defence 
staff, does he not consider he should be relieved of his duties at 
least-and I think people would consider this the minimum-until 
the investigation is complete?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

to be allowed to do its work, to do it in an unfettered way and come 
to reasoned judgments. Then the government will respond.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are 
fundamental principles of justice at stake and they concern a 
number of individuals who will be going before the inquiry. We 
should allow the inquiry to hear all the evidence and allow each 
individual the right that all Canadians deserve, and that is to be 
heard in an impartial setting and have those people who are 
conducting the inquiry come to reasoned judgments in a way that 
will reflect the principles of Canadian justice.

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister just heard the defence minister renew his 
support for General Boyle, in spite of the very serious accusations 
made against him this morning under oath by Mr. Gonzales, who 
was the director of public affairs when the falsified documents 
were released.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not think that, this time, his defence 
minister has gone beyond the acceptable?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of National Defence just provided the 
government's view on the issue: We asked a commission of inquiry 
to look into all the issues relating to the incidents in Somalia and to 
report to us, so that we could take appropriate action. As the 
minister said, all kinds of allegations are made before a 
commission of inquiry. Some people say certain things, while 
others have a slightly different view. There are lawyers who make 
representations on behalf of each of the parties involved.

recommendations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary is also for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not think that, from a strictly ethical 
point of view, such serious accusations against the Chief of Staff 
justify General Boyle's suspension, at least for the duration of the 
inquiry? If the Prime Minister will not dismiss General Boyle from 
his duties, will he at least suspend him?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the commission of inquiry is currently conducting its 
proceedings. We hope it will release its findings at the earliest 
opportunity. The sooner the better for everyone.

to be heard and we must wait for the commission to render its 
judgment, before taking action.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this morning I received a very moving letter from a retired 
armed forces captain, Stephen Ransier in Guelph. What made it 
moving was that along with it he included his Canadian service 
decoration for years and years of military service in the Canadian 
Armed Forces.
<P>
	This is what he said: ``I have concluded that I can no longer wear 
my Canadian forces decoration-with pride or honour''. He lists 
the reasons why: lack of moral leadership; a minister of defence 
who appears to have no concept of or interest in the military; and a 
chief of the defence staff who abrogates his responsibilities.
<P>
	What does the Prime Minister have to say to Captain Ransier and 
others like him who are so disappointed in the leadership at the top

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will tell this gentleman that it is exactly because we are 
very preoccupied with the morale in the armed forces following the 
incident in Somalia that this government did the very unusual thing 
of setting up an inquiry into the matter. It is exactly because I want 
the commission to finish its work that I will not prejudge the 
conclusions of the commissioners.
<P>
	I have respect for all the people serving today in the armed 
forces. All of them are not responsible for what happened in 
Somalia. When the results are known, we will act. In the meantime 
we have to respect the commission and let it finish its work. After 
that we will make our decision based on its recommendations.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will give the Prime Minister the letter.
<P>
	As a young soldier Captain Ransier protected the current Prime 
Minister during the FLQ crisis. He apparently stood outside the 
current Prime Minister's door when he came back from Pierre 
Laporte's funeral. He accompanied Mrs. Chrétien to the grocery 
store during those unsettled times. Now he is looking to the Prime 
Minister for protection of the morale and reputation of the 
Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	What is the Prime Minister's response to soldiers who are 
looking to him to protect the morale and reputation of the Canadian 
Armed Forces from mismanagement by the Minister of National 
Defence and the chief of defence staff?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is an inquiry.
<P>
	I am happy that the gentleman did his job properly when he was 
there. He was rewarded with a decoration for the work he 
performed. He should not jeopardize the services rendered because 
there is an inquiry at this time. He should not try to politicize the 
issue.
<P>
	At this moment what is important is to go with the inquiry, let 
the commissioners ask the questions, get the answers, weigh the 
pros and cons of every testimony and render a judgment. It is not 
for anybody in the House of Commons to decide matters which are 
discussed in front of an inquiry and prejudge the conclusion. That 
would show a complete lack of respect for the commissioners who 
are doing a difficult job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know political letters when I see them and this is not a 
political letter.
<P>
	I will hold Captain Ransier's decorations in trust and I will 
return them to him on the day when he can wear them with pride 
and honour. I will hold them in trust until there is a new defence 
minister and a new chief of defence staff. How long will Captain 
Ransier have to wait?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is precisely the way to politicize the issue. The leader 
of the third party cannot find a lot against the government and he is 
looking for an occasion to have his picture in the press with the 
soldiers.
<P>
	We will run the government the way we think it should be run. 
The proper way to run a government is to show respect to the 
commission. We must let the commissioners do their job. They 
have sworn to do their job properly. When the commission 
completes its work we will act accordingly. That is the way things 
are done in Canada. We will not find anybody guilty before the case 
is closed.

<P>
	Over the past five years, Revenue Canada has audited the excise 
taxes of only one oil company and of no tobacco products 
manufacturers, thus risking the loss of millions of dollars, because 
there is a four year limitation on audits. In other words, after four 
years, you can no longer recover the money. We are not talking 
about smuggling here, but lax tax controls.
<P>
	Can the revenue minister explain to us why her department did 
not do its job properly, letting millions of dollars that it can never 
recover disappear daily?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have been doing our work.
<P>
	What I want to explain to the House is that even though audits 
were not completed, we were constantly monitoring the tax 
revenues from these companies. There was absolutely no 
indication that there were any changes to the amounts of revenue 
which the government was receiving.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, might we remind the minister that the number 
of public servants assigned to audit functions has been plummeting 
in her department for 20 years and that the auditor general tells us 
that, since 1991, those left have been doing only GST audits.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	I therefore ask the minister what she is waiting for to hire or train 
new auditors, thus making it possible to carry out the required 
controls within four years and collect millions owed the federal tax 
department?

the world. This issue of leadership goes right to the heart of the 
matter. If they do not do something, they are going to get someone 
killed in our Canadian Armed Forces.

being looked into by the inquiry.
<P>
	For members to come here to the House of Commons and exploit 
the pain of an individual soldier, to come here to the House of

Mr. Speaker, being a former member of the Canadian Armed

	The worst situation in the Canadian Armed Forces and for 
personnel in the Canadian Armed Forces was when the chief of 
defence staff stood up, blamed everything on his subordinates and 
said that his subordinates lacked moral fibre. That was the worst 
thing that ever happened.

House: ``When we form government, every minister in the cabinet 
that I will be presiding over will have to take full responsibility for 
what is going on in his department. If there is any bungling in the

<P>
	The Minister of Labour is in the process of reviewing part I of 
the Canada Labour Code. The task force he set up for that purpose 
recommended in its report, the Sims report, which was tabled this 
past January, that the RCMP be given the right to collective 
bargaining.
<P>
	Since RCMP officers are the only police officers in Canada who 
do not have the right to collective bargaining, will the minister 
undertake to use the current revision of the Canada Labour Code to

<P>
	Now we find out just how different the government's view is. 
She has issued new guidelines to immigration officers that they are 
to bend over backward to avoid detaining illegal immigrants and

<P>
	The Reform Party believes that an escaped dangerous offender 
who savagely beat a defenceless woman during a robbery should 
not even be allowed to claim refugee status in Canada, never mind 
being released from detention. The Liberals think that not only 
should he be released but he should be welcomed with opened

<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
What explanation does the minister have for the delay in

we recognize in the minister's response that he is forgetting one 
more time about the victims of crime.
<P>
	Fourteen years ago Darlene Boyd's teenage daughter was raped 
and murdered, her body burned by Jim Peters. In four months this 
murderer can apply for early release under section 745 of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>

through this torment and anguish one more time?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney </B><B>General

have spoken to her directly about this issue. I saw for myself the 
enormous tragedy she has had to endure and live through.
<P>
	I know I speak for all members of this House when I say our 
hearts go out to Darlene Boyd and to others who find themselves 
facing those types of tragedies.
<P>
	If the hon. member and his colleagues in the Reform Party would 
co-operate with us and support Bill C-45, as I urge them to do, we 
will change the provisions of the Criminal Code so that before 
anyone who is in custody can bring such an application they would 
first have to have it screened by a judge of a superior court to 
demonstrate, and they would bear the onus, that there is a 
reasonable prospect of their success in front of a jury.
<P>
	Second, they would have to persuade a jury unanimously, as 
opposed to the present two-thirds rule, that they should be given 
permission to apply early to the parole board.

has been part of criminal law for 20 years, while improving it and 
ensuring that it is available only in exceptional cases. I urge the

however, the figures should be looked at rather carefully to see 
what level those accidents are on. In fact, in terms of the more 
serious accidents there is a very slight change.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if the minister wants to talk about gross

behind the monopoly selling of barley. That is why a plebiscite is 
so important.
<P>

organization will be intrigued with the hon. gentleman's allegation

<P>
	Atomic Energy Canada and Ontario Hydro are proposing to 
import plutonium fuels from the United States. If the federal 
government agrees to this proposal will the minister commit our 
government to a full environmental assessment with public 
hearings to afford Canadians a fair and full opportunity for 
meaningful input?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me reassure the hon. member that any decision in 
relation to the importation of MOX fuel is a very long way off.
<P>
	Feasibility studies are presently being done in relation to the 
possible use of MOX fuel in Candu reactors. If it proves feasible 
then obviously there still has to be a decision made by the United 
States or perhaps Russia as to whether they choose the Candu as an 
option for disposal.
<P>
	In relation to the hon. member's specific question, let me 
reassure him that all relevant federal and provincial environmental 
health and safety assessment processes and licensing processes will 
be followed. Many of those processes involve full opportunity for 
the public to participate and to offer its point of view.
<P>
	Let me reassure the hon. member that the public will have ample 
opportunity for input into any final decision-

question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	On December 20, the minister stated that he did not want the rate 
restructuring in the field of telecommunications to be done at the 
expense of accessibility. The minister said: ``Accessibility is 
currently not at stake and we will make sure that it will not be in the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification,

continuously allow competition to play an important role in the 
provision of services, including the area of telecommunications.
<P>
	During this process, the CRTC has been involved. It is very 
important to recognize that during the restructuring in this area of 
telecommunications there may be inconveniences that arise.
<P>
	However, the marketplace is an important place that sets the fee 
structures, and when the marketplace takes priority it comes up 
with a level of funding and a level of pricing that is superior with 
lower costs for the consumer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the hon. member's answer, but the fact is that consumers 
will pay more, not less. Incidentally, the federation of consumers' 
associations and the National Anti-Poverty Organization proposed 
the setting up of a fund to ensure universal access to 
telecommunications for low-income people and the regions.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Industry follow up on this suggestion?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one year ago the Supreme Court decided to revoke its ban 
on advertising, and while 40,000 Canadians die every year from 
tobacco the Prime Minister plays golf with the president of 
Imperial Tobacco.
<P>
	If the minister is not prepared to put tobacco under the 
Hazardous Products Act, I would like him to tell this House what 
he is prepared to do to prevent 40,000 Canadians from dying every 
year from this most preventable disease.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am happy to receive the support of the Reform Party as it relates 
to our blueprint and the direction in which we wish to proceed in 
terms of tobacco.
<P>
	The hon. member has quite wrongly described the best solution 
as it relates to tobacco consumption in this country. We hope to 
move forward in a comprehensive way which will address a variety 
of things from enforcement to the proliferation of youth smoking.
<P>
	The hon. members yell out from their seats. It has taken them

<P>
	At a meeting this past weekend the minister agreed that Canada 
along with other countries would forgive certain debt to third world 
countries. At a time when Canadians are being asked to bear the 
burden of our own deficit and debt reduction measures, why are we 
forgiving other nations?
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this was indeed a landmark decision taken by the G-7, the IMF, the 
World Bank and the creditor nations of the Paris Club. As a result, 
some $5 billion to $7 billion of debt of the poorest of the poor 
countries in the world will be forgiven and they will be put in a 
position where they can put their existing debt on a sustainable 
basis.
<P>
	We should not discuss this in terms of the arid numbers on a 
sheet of paper. We should realize that as a result of this, millions of 
children who otherwise would not get vaccinated will receive 
vaccinations. As a result of this, children who would otherwise not

result of this, food will be put on their tables and decent 
hospitalization will be provided.
<P>
	The reason that this Canadian initiative, among others, has taken 
hold is because this nation understands that we are one world and 
we must take care of each other.

proud yesterday when we applauded the Olympians on the floor of 
the House of Commons, including many of my Liberal colleagues. 
But as we were applauding, the Liberal government was gutting the 
support program for Canadian Olympians.
<P>
	In light of the support shown yesterday by the representatives of 
Canadians on the floor of the House of Commons, would the Prime 
Minister consider shutting down the information office with its $27 
million allocation and provide that money to support Canadian 
Olympians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at a time when we are 
cutting across the board and at a time when we are facing very 
difficult decisions, we increased the individual payments to 
athletes by 25 per cent. Last year we invested $20 million of the 
taxpayers' money assisting our athletes in what proved to be the 
absolute best performance ever at the Olympics.

turned the corner on some of our economic problems, that in future 
years we can build an even stronger national mandate for national 
sport as a nation builder.

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Even when he is reminded of the very high level of 
unemployment, the Prime Minister does not seem to want to budge 
on the unemployment issue. When he is reminded that the 
unemployment rate in Canada has remained above 9 per cent for 71 
consecutive months, the longest stretch since the 1930s, he does 
not seem to be moved to action either. A report released by the 
Conference Board this week shows that the real unemployment rate 
among young Canadians exceeds 25 per cent.
<P>
	I would like to give the Prime Minister another chance to tell this 
House he welcomes this opportunity to announce a reduction to 
Canadians in their unemployment insurance overcontributions-an

death of Quebec's former premier, Robert Bourassa.
<P>
	I would like, first of all, to mention the exemplary courage he 
demonstrated during his long battle with the illness that finally 
claimed his life.
<P>
	He met this ultimate test, as he met all the other tests in his life, 
quietly and with determination.
<P>
	I extend my sincerest condolences, of course, to his wife Andrée, 
with whom I had the opportunity to speak earlier this morning, and 
to his children and grandchildren, as well as his former colleagues 
and friends.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="4990"> 4990 </A></B>
<P>
	In Robert Bourassa, our country has lost a great Canadian, who 
always worked to improve the lot of his fellow Canadians.
<P>
	I first met him in the early 1960s, when he was a tax advisor with 
the Department of National Revenue, here in Ottawa. He went on to 
teach at the universities of Ottawa, Laval and Montreal, and took 
up a position as director of research with the Bélanger commission 
on taxation.
<P>
	He began his political career in 1966, when he was elected MNA 
for Mercier. Four years later, at the age of 36, he became the 
youngest premier in the history of Quebec.
<P>
	His first term of office will be remembered primarily for the 
contribution he made to the modernization of Quebec through the 
massive James Bay hydroelectric project. In launching this project 
and introducing social programs, such as health insurance, Robert 
Bourassa showed his keen long term vision in trying to equip 
Quebec with the economic and social tools it needed to meet the 
challenges of the future.
<P>
	After his defeat in 1976, he withdrew from active political life to 
teach and reflect on the future of Canada. He was again elected 
leader of the provincial Liberal party in 1982 and resumed the 
position of premier of Quebec from 1985 to 1993.
<P>
	The memory I will carry of his long career in politics is the 
following: Robert Bourassa was at once a proud Quebecer and a 
proud Canadian. He was always an ardent federalist, who defended 
Quebec's interests within Canada. He remained convinced that, 
despite the challenges and complexities of Canadian federalism, 
Quebec's place was with Canada. He sought the cultural and 
linguistic development of French Canadians, while holding firmly 
to the belief that Canada would continue to serve Quebecers well in 
this regard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Robert Bourassa served Quebecers well during his time as 
premier. He was always a voice of moderation and reason. He was 
convinced that Quebec's future prosperity lay within Canada and 
Canada's with Quebec.
<P>
	Mr. Bourassa devoted himself to public service for more than 30 
years. I know, today, all Canadians will wish to express their 
appreciation for his life and work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I pay tribute to the memory of Robert Bourassa, who gave his 
life in the service of his fellow citizens. On behalf of the 
government of Canada, of members in this House, and of all 
Canadians, I share the pain felt by Mrs. Bourassa, his family and all 
Quebecers. On behalf of all of them, I say to Mr. Bourassa: We 
thank you.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today Quebec mourns the passing of the former Premier 
of Quebec, Robert Bourassa, a man who  spent nearly 30 years of 
his life serving Quebecers to the best of his ability.
<P>
	In 1960, Mr. Bourassa started to make his mark as a professor at 
the University of Ottawa, Laval University and the University of 
Montreal. Elected for the first time in 1966 in the riding of Mercier, 
Mr. Bourassa embarked on a long and brilliant political career.
<P>
	In 1970, his perseverance, his talent as a communicator and his 
energy made him, at the age of 36, Quebec's youngest premier. He 
was an excellent politician, and was responsible for a number of 
impressive achievements that remain today as symbols of Quebec 
society. The decisive role he played in building a modern Quebec is 
reflected, as the Prime Minister mentioned earlier, in our health 
insurance system and the James Bay project, for instance.
<P>
	Mr. Bourassa was always concerned about Quebec's future. He 
was responsible for the signing of the Meech Lake Accord, whose 
demise was certainly not his fault. He did everything to save the 
accord. His efforts to renew the Canadian federation were 
praiseworthy, even if they were to no avail.
<P>
	I had the pleasure of sitting with Mr. Bourassa in the Quebec 
National Assembly when I was elected for the second time as a 
member of the Parti Quebecois in 1985. I soon realized he was a 
very human person who profoundly respected his opponents. In 
fact he taught me a very useful lesson in politics when I was the 
energy critic and stood opposite him: he taught me that in politics 
one must never underestimate one's opponent.
<P>
	A man of consensus and discipline, Mr. Bourassa was until the 
very end an enduring benchmark in the political history of a 
province that is gradually evolving towards political sovereignty.
<P>
	On my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues and the 
people of Quebec, I wish to extend my most sincere condolences to 
the family and friends of Mr. Bourassa. Today, Quebec has lost a 
great man.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to quote something that Mr. Bourassa 
said, in which there is a lesson for us all: ``Happiness is being able 
to fight for one's convictions''.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr.

Robert Bourassa on the sad occasion of his death.
<P>
	Allow me first of all to express sympathies to his family and to 
the people of Quebec on this loss of a husband, father and a 
political leader. These sympathies are expressed on behalf of the 
Reform members of Parliament and their constituents, many of 
<P>
<HR>

whom live in  constituencies and areas a long way from Quebec and 
yet who feel the loss that Quebecers feel today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My wife Sandra and I wish to extend our heartfelt sympathy to 
his wife, Andrée, and their two children, François and Michelle.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In paying tribute to his memory we could focus on a number of 
things as other speakers have done: his academic contributions, his 
political work, the acts of his government and his commitment to 
keeping Quebec within Canada.
<P>
	The attribute that I would like to select for tribute is a more 
human one. We in this Chamber, who spend all our time on politics, 
do not spend enough time paying tribute to human characteristics, 
and that is his courage in adversity, particularly in his latter years. 
In his latter years he carried out all his political and governmental 
work while suffering from a painful illness. The willingness and 
ability of a public servant to attend to the affairs of others while 
enduring personal pain and suffering is a rare attribute. It is one 
which should be recognized and praised particularly on this 
occasion.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	We salute today the many contributions of the late Robert 
Bourassa, but particularly his courage in adversity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of my colleagues in the New Democratic Party, I wish to 
offer a tribute to Mr. Bourassa, as well as to convey our sympathies 
to his family and friends.
<P>
	Canada and Quebec have lost one of their masters in the art of 
politics, and a great public resource. The political life of Robert 
Bourassa reflects in many ways the history of Quebec since the 
quiet revolution.
<P>
	He also played a central role in some of the most important 
moments in the history of the Canadian federation, namely the 
October crisis and the negotiations around the Meech Lake accord.
<P>
	History no doubt will attest to the difficulties he encountered in 
trying to accommodate the aspirations of Quebecers and those of 
other Canadians within our federal institutions. It will also attest, 
however, to the fact that there were people of good will, like Mr. 
Bourassa, who made that effort, and that the effort is worthwhile.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I first met Mr. Bourassa when I was vice-chairman of the special 
committee of the House of Commons on federal-provincial fiscal 
relations. We met with former premiers in 1981 in the 
parliamentary dining room. We gathered a lot of former premiers to 
receive their advice on how to deal with federal-provincial fiscal 
affairs. At that time Mr. Bourassa was a former premier, but he was 
to go on from there to make one of the political comebacks of the 
century and to become premier again.
<P>
	I remember also that he first came to my attention when I was a 
teenager as the premier of Quebec during the October crisis. All 
Canada was riveted on the events happening in Quebec at that time.
<P>
	I see him as someone who tried to balance his perception of 
Quebec as a community and his perception of Canada as a 
community where Quebec could thrive not just as individual 
Quebecers but also as a community.
<P>
	My sadness today is not just for Mr. Bourassa; it is for the fact 
that the ambivalence and the ambiguity which he expressed so well 
has been broken. Many of his critics-critics not of him but of the 
things which he stood for-have prospered. The kind of Canada 
which he sought to build is on the ropes.
<P>
	I say to all of us here that the one thing we could do to honour his 
memory would be to revitalize the kind of Canada which he had in 
mind. I did not always agree with him, but he knew that the best 
place for Quebec was within Canada and that the best kind of 
Canada was a Canada open to Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is 
a day of great sadness for all those who had the pleasure, indeed I 
would term it a privilege, of knowing Robert Bourassa.
<P>
	I would like to pay tribute to his courage, his constant 
companion throughout his political career, as well as throughout 
his illness. My most heartfelt condolences, and those of my party, 
to Mrs. Bourassa, their children and grandchildren.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Robert Bourassa was the incarnation of modern Quebec. 
Throughout his long career, economic issues were his main 
concern. In 1970, he headed the government at a crucial time in 
Quebec history. In that context, he was able to stay the course and 
focus on his fundamental objectives: Quebec's cultural security 
and its economic progress.
<P>
	Quebecers' unshakeable belief today in their ability to be the 
masters of their own economy is, in large part, the work of Robert 
Bourassa.
<P>
	Mr. Bourassa was the incarnation of modern Quebec in all of its 
dimensions. He spoke to us knowingly of our own ambitions and 
also reflected our ambivalence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians would often remark that Mr. Bourassa for them was 
an intriguing political figure. Those of us who knew him well and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4992"> 4992 </A></B>
<P>
were from Quebec were always  tempted to reply that he was a true 
reflection of the people of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Robert Bourassa too felt ambivalence, the ambivalence of a 
person with a very great responsibility. He was always concerned 
with protecting and furthering the interests of a mainly 
francophone population.
<P>
	This concern was ever-present, whenever discussions and 
negotiations were held on the future of Quebec and of Canada, in 
Victoria in 1971 and in the 1980 and 1995 referendums, and 
especially in the negotiations around the Meech Lake accord.
<P>
	What needs to be kept in mind concerning that event is that he 
had obtained an agreement which satisfied both Quebec and the 
other Canadian partners. Events, unfortunately, took a different 
turn, and history will be the final judge.
<P>
	On a personal note, I remember Mr. Bourassa as a generous and 
affable man, one who was able to resist the temptation to lower 
debates to a personal level and one who, of all the politicians I have 
had the opportunity to observe, was without a doubt the one who 
always treated his colleagues, his opponents, the media and the 
general public with the utmost respect.
<P>
	The second quality that characterized Robert Bourassa was, 
without a doubt, his exceptional perseverance. Who, after the 1976 
election, would have dared predict that he would return to public 
life? Yet he did, and stronger than ever, at the head of majority 
governments in 1985 and 1989. Twenty years ago, who would have 
thought that people would one day hold him in such affection?
<P>
	We shall all keep in our hearts the undying memory of an 
exceptional head of government and, what is more, a great man 
who never admitted defeat.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I ask you all to rise for a minute of silence in 
memory of Mr. Robert Bourassa.

on. With the tabling of a notice of ways and means motion today, 
the government is acting to implement the finance committee's 
recommendations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is a textbook case of the system working as it should. The 
auditor general has done his work as a watchdog. Parliament 
listened and asked a committee of the House to investigate. The 
committee probed and reported back to Parliament with 
recommendations. And now the government is proposing to 
implement those recommendations swiftly and fully.
<P>
	It is imperative that Canadians have absolute faith in the tax 
system. People have a right to demand that everybody pays their 
share. That is why, from the time this government took office, we 
have worked hard at constantly improving the fairness of the tax 
system.
<P>
	Each of our budgets has closed loopholes. We have said that we 
will constantly scrutinize the fairness and effectiveness of the tax 
system. This measure today is  further evidence of our 
commitment. It will ensure that all emigrants from 
Canada-including individuals, trusts and corporations-will pay 
Canadian tax on any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4993"> 4993 </A></B>
<P>
capital gains that have accrued in Canada up to the time of 
departure. They will either pay the tax immediately or give 
Revenue Canada security to pay those gains when the property is 
actually disposed of.
<P>
	This measure takes effect immediately.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This measure will ensure that all those leaving Canada to live 
abroad, including individuals, trusts and corporations, will pay 
Canadian tax on any capital gains that have accrued in Canada up to 
the time of departure, if they are in fact emigrating. They will pay 
the tax immediately or will give Revenue Canada security to pay 
those gains when the property is actually disposed of. This measure 
takes effect immediately.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If these measures had been in place in 1991 the tax policy issue 
identified in the auditor general's report would not have arisen. 
This is not an issue about family trusts.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	We removed all tax advantages for family trusts in the 1995 
budget. One faces same tax policy questions whether one is talking 
about the transaction described in the auditor general's report or 
determining what rules apply to the small businessperson who 
moves from St. Stephen, New Brunswick, to Calais, Maine.
<P>
	Exceptions to this rule will include gains that accrue on 
Canadian real estate and Canadian business property: things that 
Canada can always tax when they are ultimately sold. There will 
also be an exemption for pensions.
<P>
	As well, emigrants with any significant property, including real 
estate, will have to report it all to Revenue Canada when they leave. 
This will help Revenue Canada ensure that former residents pay the 
tax they owe to Canada.
<P>
	All persons who have been in Canada only temporarily will of 
course not be subject to these requirements.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With our new measures, Canada will be implementing one of the 
strictest systems in the world with regard to taxpayer migration. 
Indeed, Canada is only one of three or four countries that have any 
system at all for taxing people who leave. The United States does 
not have such a system, nor does most of Europe or Japan.
<P>
	The motion to which I speak also implements the committee's 
more technical recommendations which have to do with issues 
such as the scope of the definition of the term taxable Canadian 
property and the character of property that is distributed from a 
trust to a  non-resident beneficiary. These are complicated points of 
law and policy.
<P>
	I expect that many members in this House and many of their 
constituents will want to take part in shaping this legislation's final 
form. They will have that opportunity as it proceeds through 
Parliament.
<P>
	I would like to thank the auditor general for bringing an 
important issue to Parliament's attention. I would also like to thank 
the chairman and the members of the finance committee. Their 
careful research and their thorough report have laid the foundation 
for this motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I wish to convey my sincerest sympathy to Mr. 
Bourassa's family.
<P>
	In his statement, the Minister of Finance confirmed that the 
Liberal government helps some people to avoid paying taxes. He 
confirmed that he has done nothing to end the family trust scandal 
in which $2 billion in assets was transferred to the U.S. without a 
penny in tax being collected.
<P>
	Should we be surprised? Since the beginning of this affair, the 
behaviour of the Liberal members on the finance committee has 
been unworthy of parliamentarians. They tried to undermine the 
credibility of the auditor general.
<P>
	According to the minister's statement, Canadians must have 
confidence in the tax system. They are entitled to demand that 
everyone pay his or her fair share.
<P>
	On behalf of all the taxpayers in Quebec and Canada, I ask the 
Liberal government to shed light on this scandal and plug the tax 
loophole, instead of throwing the borders wide open as they are 
now doing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If the minister truly wants, as he claims in his ministerial 
declaration, to re-establish confidence in the fiscal system, he must 
shed light on the scandal of December 1991 which permitted a 
family trust of $2 billion to be transferred tax free in the United 
States. He must demonstrate to Canadians that they can have 
confidence in the system. With the scandal and the complicity of 
the government, the proof must be given.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have three points with respect to the government's 
policy initiatives just outlined by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	First, I am glad that in his statement he eliminated the criticism 
of the auditor general which had pervaded the finance committee's 
own report.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4994"> 4994 </A></B>
<P>
	It makes no sense to distinguish criticism based on wasteful 
policies and the wasteful implementation of sound policies caused 
by faulty bureaucratic decisions. Waste is waste and the auditor 
general must fight it wherever he finds it.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	Second, I agree with the minister that this entire controversy is 
not about the roll of family trusts as a vehicle for the evasion of 
taxes. The contemptible tax loopholes that once existed were 
closed by legislation some time ago.
<P>
	I respect the integrity and goodwill of my colleagues from the 
Bloc Quebecois serving with me on the finance committee. 
However, after listening carefully for many hours to expert 
testimony on family trusts and capital gains taxation, I reluctantly 
and respectfully disagree with their continued allegations that 
family trusts have served recently and continue to serve as vehicles 
for tax evasion and avoidance.
<P>
	Third, I want to raise a point of disagreement with the 
government's approach to solving the one clear and important 
problem identified by committee witnesses. This problem concerns 
the lack of data on real estate and private business assets left behind 
untaxed by emigrants. Under present rules the government taxes 
capital gains on these assets whenever they are sold and a fair value 
has been established.
<P>
	Presently Revenue Canada has in place a rather unreliable 
system for assuring that the sales of these assets are recorded and 
taxed properly. Such sales are not brought to the attention of 
Revenue Canada automatically and emigrants avoiding the 
payment of these taxes are difficult to catch once they have moved 
abroad.
<P>
	The government has chosen to tighten the net for catching all 
capital gains on such assets by a mandatory reporting rule and the 
payment of a security deposit. I find the latter provision to be an 
unnecessarily harsh and punitive measure. Many emigrants will not 
have assets acceptable to Revenue Canada as a security deposit and 
will be hard pressed to come up with some.
<P>
	It would have been much kinder and more efficient for Revenue 
Canada instead to put contingent liens on real estate and ask 
operating divisions of the department to report the sale of privately 
held firms showing up in tax returns.
<P>
	I regret that the government has failed to take the kinder and 
gentler approach to regulation and the treatment of Canadians. 
These emigrants deserve our respect and compassion even after 
they have decided to take up residence in another country.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I declare the motion carried.
<P>
	I wish to inform the House that because of the ministerial 
statement, Government Orders will be extended by 18 minutes.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed from September 25 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-45, an act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial 
review of parole ineligibility) and another act, be read the third 
time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak, even if it is 
for a brief time, on this important bill.
<P>
	During the course of the lengthy debate on this bill, when we sat 
and listened to Reform members go on and on about its evils, I kept 
asking them pointedly what were their views on caning. I know one 
of the their colleagues is a staunch supporter of caning and I wanted 
to hear about their party policy on this issue. However, not one of 
those members had the courage to answer my questions.
<P>
	I want to point out some of their inconsistent statements on this 
bill and on other matters and then I will come to the caning point.
<P>
	I am sure the members of the Reform Party are relieved that 
closure has been applied on this bill because it lets them off the 
hook from all the inconsistent statements they have been making.
<P>
	First, I have a quote on rehabilitation from the hon. member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, who I thought often exhibited some 
sense in the House. I quote from page 3888 of <I>Hansard</I> where he 
said: ``It is not to say that we are not concerned about 
rehabilitation. It is not to say that we are not concerned about 
prevention''.
<P>
	Yet the hon. member for Crowfoot, that well known expert on 
justice issues, said on page 3878 of <I>Hansard</I>: ``A life sentence is 
not about rehabilitation. It is about punishment and retribution''. 
He should speak with the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de 
Fuca to find out what he thinks.
<P>
	The hon. member for Cariboo-Chilcotin said: ``I am not 
suggesting that people who had a difficult childhood should not be 
given consideration. It is our intention that all Canadians should 
have the opportunity to come to their full potential and do what 
they truly choose to do''.
<P>
	Yet the hon. member for Wild Rose, who is well known for his 
liberal views, said: ``To those who argue that these criminals can be 
rehabilitated, let them prove this after they have served their full 
term of 25 years and not a moment sooner''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> That is their kind of thinking. Listen to the 
applause that rings out from the Reform.
<P>
	On page 4294 of <I>Hansard</I>, the hon. member for Beaver River 
said: ``Yes, criminals need attention, rehabilitation, love and 
caring''. And the hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam said: ``It is 
not about rehabilitation. It is about providing a fair and just 
penalty''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> More, more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> They want more and they are going to get it.
<P>
	Also on page 4294 of <I>Hansard</I>, the hon. member for Beaver 
River said: ``Some murderers and violent offenders are curable. 
They are not all incorrigible. Some of them will be rehabilitated. 
Some will care and will have a genuine conversion experience in 
prison. They will want to make their lives better and pay back to 
society some of the terrible things they did by doing good work''. 
That does not fit well with the hon. member for Wild Rose.
<P>
	Then we have the hon. member for Peace River getting into it. 
He said: ``These inmates do have the right to earn their way out of 
prison after a period of time. If they do try to upgrade their skills 
they have a chance to be rehabilitated''. Yet the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville said: ``I question the need for killers to have 
any rights when they are in jail''.
<P>
	Listen to the inconsistencies in those statements.
<P>
	Then we have the hon. member for Calgary Centre, who is 
considered a moderate in the party and who was reduced to tears 
after his public caning at the caucus meeting of the Reform Party 
last summer. On page 3885 of <I>Hansard</I> He said: ``We are not 
concerned about Olson. He is not going to get out''. We do not need 
to scare Canadians with that. That is not what the Reform Party is 
saying''.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Yet we had the hon. member for St. Albert on page 4260 saying: 
``Mr. Olson and others like him will be able to walk the streets of 
this country absolutely and totally free after 25 years, perhaps 
sooner''. What garbage. Which one is right, Calgary Centre or St.  
Albert? Calgary Centre happened to be right on that occasion, but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4999"> 4999 </A></B>
<P>
my goodness, there are so many mistakes and inconsistencies in 
these statements that it is hard to imagine what is going on here.
<P>
	Let us turn to the glimmer of hope clause. The hon. member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca says: ``The Reform Party has been 
accused of being without sympathy, but it is simply not true. 
Reformers believe that sympathy and consideration must be for 
victims and for criminals''.
<P>
	Yet the hon. member for Crowfoot said: ``Murderers should not 
be given a glimmer of hope or any incentive to ease the burden of 
the severity of the punishment for what they have done''. The hon. 
member for Wild Rose said: ``I frankly do not care if killers' hopes 
are dimmed by the prospect of no early release''. That is what they 
said. Which one is speaking for the Reform Party, Esquimalt-Juan 
de Fuca or Wild Rose? Let them make up their minds.
<P>
	We then have the ``throwing away the key'' quote by the hon. 
member for Calgary Northeast who said: ``The feeling is that the 
return of capital punishment is desirable and necessary-To cater 
in any way other than providing the bare necessities for existence 
to any of these low life individuals-''. That is his opinion of these 
people.
<P>
	The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley said: ``Do 
not let them out. They should spend the rest of their lives behind 
bars''. I could go on and on, but I want to turn from these 
inconsistencies to the question of caning.
<P>
	I have a clipping from the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> dated Thursday, 
February 27 of this year. In it the hon. member for Calgary 
Northeast is championing caning. He said: ``They have a corporal 
punishment system''-this is in Singapore of course-``and the 
offenders sit up and take notice of it''. Apparently they cannot sit 
down afterward. ``So I am going to take a look at just how effective 
it is,'' said the Reform justice critic, the hon. member for Calgary 
Northeast.
<P>
	The article goes on to state that corporal punishment was 
abolished in Canada in 1972. Said the member for Calgary 
Northeast: ``It was part of our justice system and personally I think 
it should be back again''. He seems to have changed his tune 
because we all know he cancelled the trip. He wrote a little article 
for the Calgary <I>Herald</I> that I have here which was published on 
March 22. Shortly after that he recanted and decided that spanking, 
corporal punishment, caning and whipping were not things with 
which we really should proceed. He decided to abandon them.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Northeast decided that the trip to 
Singapore was going to create waves and cause too much trouble. 
In fact, one of the former Reform members said that it was 
extremist and got the boot. She  was fired right out of the party. She 
went to a caucus meeting and what went on there we do not know, 
but one suspects there was some caning and she got the boot. She 
said that it was extreme. Do members know something? She was 
right. I do not know if there is a Canadian here who does not think 
so except the hon. member for Wild Rose.
<P>
	I have more. Here is the latest article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> from 
the other day. The hon. member for Calgary Northeast got on to the 
subject of prurient literature in the prisons. Apparently somebody 
in some prison somewhere, I think it was in Edmonton, had 
received some bad magazines in the prison, was selling them and 
inmates were reading them. The hon. member for Calgary 
Northeast is quoted as saying in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>: ``If he wants 
to entertain himself, give him a good book to read and they might 
want to start with the Bible''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, of all people to talk about starting with the Bible. I 
know the hon. member for Calgary Northeast started with the 
Bible. He got to the book of Leviticus and quit. The problem is that 
he stopped when he read about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a 
tooth. He really should have read on. There is another section of the 
Bible called the New Testament. If he had read that he might have 
had some of the milk of human kindness come out in some of his 
speeches.
<P>
	I see the member sitting with his leader. His leader's father, as I 
recall, was something of a preacher and knew something about the 
gospel. He might do well to sit down with the leader of his party, 
read the New Testament and try to understand some of the 
intricacies of the law that was pronounced there. It might help to 
relieve him of some of the extremism that is exhibited in his 
speeches and is clearly one that is inappropriate for this kind of 
article.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	Imagine suggesting that inmates sit down and read the Bible. 
Perhaps he should take a break from his parliamentary duties, 
which perhaps the electors of Calgary Northeast will provide after 
the next election, and he can sit down, read the Bible and take up 
another convocation, another employment 
opportunity-convocation is the wrong word-vocation. Never 
mind the ``con'', it is just ``vo''. He could get out there and preach 
the gospel or read the Bible in a public way. I think it would help 
him with his extremism.
<P>
	I know some of the newspaper articles are misleading. They 
suggest that he is the justice critic for his party. I understand he is in 
fact the solicitor general critic and he is supposed to deal with 
matters relating to prisons.
<P>
	We have here in his speeches on this bill some of the most 
extraordinary statements about the virtues of imprisonment and 
how people have to be locked up, jailed and put away. He does not 
say he is going to lock them up and throw away the key. However 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5000"> 5000 </A></B>
<P>
one of the members the other day told us right here in the 
Chamber-I am sure I heard him say it and I think it was the hon. 
member for Vegreville, but I would not want to misquote and I do 
not have this one written down-that in fact anyone who is 
convicted of a violent offence should serve the entire sentence in 
prison. If a person gets a life sentence for a violent crime, they go 
to prison for life and they do not come out. If that is not lock them 
up and throw away the key, I do not know what is.
<P>
	What we have here is the Reform Party trying to capitalize on 
this issue by saying on the one hand it believes in loving kindness 
and compassion. The hon. member for Beaver River in her 
speeches exemplifies this. Then we have on the other hand a group 
which says no, no, no. Which is party policy? I invite the leader to 
stand up and clarify the matter for us.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Bourassa-Citizenship.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in the debate on Bill C-45. Before making my speech, I 
must say that the way the hon. member for Kingston and the 
Islands expresses himself is reflective of a situation that we have to 
put up with in this House.
<P>
	The hon. member spent a lot of time replying to Reformers to 
conceal the fact that, in introducing this bill, the Minister of Justice 
has responded to the comments made by Reformers, particularly 
regarding the case of Clifford Olson who, as we know, became 
eligible to apply for parole this spring.
<P>
	Reformers took advantage of the situation, and the Minister of 
Justice quickly improvised because, they were speaking up in the 
west and they still are in this House, even though it is not their turn 
to do so. The Reform Party made a big fuss over this issue in 
western Canada.
<P>
	In some way, this is relatively good for the Liberal Party. When 
it comes to certain political issues, the Liberals often try to say two 
different things, depending on whether they are out west or in 
Quebec. This bill is a good example of that.
<P>
	So, the reformers often mention that the number of dangerous 
offenders roaming the streets is increasing. They scare people by 
referring to all sorts of terrible incidents in their comments, in their 
questions and in their interventions in debates such as this one. 
They are very interested in repression, but care little about 
prevention and the means to avoid a rise in crime.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Once, during the period for questions and comments, I reminded 
a Reform Party member of a figure, and I told myself that I would 
bring it up again. What about it? In 1993, Canada had the fourth 
highest rate of incarceration in the world, 130 prisoners per 
100,000 population. The country with the fourth highest rate of 
prisoners in the world. These figures come from the Department of 
Justice.
<P>
	The United States leads the field, with 565 persons for 100,000 
population. We are talking here about the land of liberty, where 
several states have the death penalty. I am speaking about the 
United States, of course, a country whose judicial system the 
Reform Party members would like to copy. Let it be noted that the 
Liberals are very sensitive to the legal concerns of Reform voters. 
That is why the justice minister introduced this in the month of 
June.
<P>
	But what about the crime rate? Canada's homicide rate compares 
favourably to that of the United States, with 1.98 murders, fewer 
than 2, for 100,000 population, against 8.5 for 100,000 population 
in the United States. Internationally, Canada falls within the 
average of 1.94 for 100,000 population.
<P>
	Once again, we must look not just at the murder rate, but at who 
is committing these murders. In Canada, they are committed by 
members of the victim's immediate family in 36.1 per cent of 
cases; by immediate acquaintances other than family members in 
46.6 per cent of cases; and by strangers-as we keep hearing from 
the Reform Party-by people unknown to victims, in only 15.9 per 
cent of cases.
<P>
	I would like to hear the Reform Party, and the Liberal Party as 
well, express an interest-as do certain people I know on the health 
committee-in ways of preventing spouses and former spouses 
from murdering their partner or former partner, and then attacking 
and killing their children. I would very much like to hear the 
Reform Party propose solutions to family situations such as those. 
As the statistics show, that is the real problem in Canada.
<P>
	In fact, there is a certain increase in rates, at least in Quebec, 
because that is where I live. Recently, we have seen many cases of 
people, men, in particular, it must be admitted, for it is usually men 
who kill their former spouses and then very often kill themselves. 
What difference would parole make in these cases?
<P>
	Why are the Reform and Liberal Party members focusing 
desperately on one part of the problem, on the 15.9 per cent of 
crimes that are committed by strangers. And of these strangers-I 
do not have the figures-a certain number are gangs of criminals, 
motorcycle gangs. We saw this in Quebec. People were not known 
to each other, but had a mission. These are senseless murders. 
Enough of scaring people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5001"> 5001 </A></B>
<P>
	In most cities in Canada, and in Quebec in any event, there are 
not all that many, but there are some and as long as there are any 
at all, it is a serious problem. But I am worried. There have been 
cuts in unemployment insurance, in social programs at all levels. 
Perhaps it does not come under federal jurisdiction, but there 
should be more programs so that the provinces can spend more 
on prevention, assistance to families, to the people going through 
difficult periods, in order to prevent situations like this from 
happening.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	But no, that is not what they do. There is much fanfare about 
amending the act, but they are making it up as they go along. They 
are not consulting the experts in the field, and, without any 
consultation, they introduced this bill in the House late in June. 
They waited for the summer to go by and then brought it back. I am 
well aware that the Liberal majority will impose its point of view 
and that we will have to live with the result.
<P>
	I invite my colleagues, those across the way and elsewhere, to 
take a greater interest in the real problems, the more vital problems 
affecting families and leading to an increase in domestic violence. 
That is the real problem.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise to participate in the debate on Bill C-45.
<P>
	Since the Liberals and the separatists apparently share the same 
philosophy on criminal justice, it has fallen to the Reform members 
of the House to object in principle to the bill as well as to its details. 
This they have done with great vigour and distinction. I can add 
little to their arguments other than to support them with my vote.
<P>
	What I would like to do is to analyse the bill as a product of the 
Liberal approach to criminal justice as a whole. What I would like 
to argue is that not only is the product flawed, but the whole 
approach on which it is based is flawed.
<P>
	What are the distinguishing characteristics of the Liberal 
approach to criminal justice illustrated by the bill which Reformers 
and growing numbers of Canadians reject? I will refer to three 
characteristics.
<P>
	The first characteristic is a perverse set of priorities. The Liberal 
approach to criminal justice puts the rights of persons accused or 
convicted of crimes ahead of the rights of victims and law-abiding 
citizens. We see this perverse set of priorities in the bill, but we 
even see it in the Liberal inspired charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	Under the charter section on legal rights, there is one general 
section affirming the right of everyone to life, liberty and security 
of the person, but that is followed by 16 additional 
provisions-rights on arrest or detention, rights of a person 
charged with an offence and so forth-all pertaining to the rights of 
persons suspected, charged or convicted of crimes. There is one 
general clause affirming the rights of Canadians to public safety 
and protection of the person. There are no clauses at all on the 
rights of victims. There are 16 provisions pertaining to the rights of 
persons suspected, charged or convicted of crimes.
<P>
	The Liberal set of priorities when it comes to public safety and 
criminal justice is perverse. It is perverse because the priorities of 
the Canadian people would put the rights of victims and 
law-abiding citizens ahead of the rights of persons accused and 
convicted of crimes.
<P>
	In the bill before us we see exactly the same perverse set of 
priorities. What was the sole purpose of the original section 745 
which the government insists on maintaining and amending rather 
than scrapping? It was to provide a faint hope of parole eligibility 
for convicted first degree murderers. It was yet another Liberal 
effort to affirm the rights of persons convicted of crimes, and the 
most heinous crimes, while the rights of victims of crimes and 
law-abiding citizens remain undefined or at risk.
<P>
	The bill before us alters the procedure but still maintains the 
original purpose. The bill is the product of a perverse set of 
priorities and deserves to be rejected on that ground alone.
<P>
	The second distinguishing characteristic of the Liberal approach 
to criminal justice, again illustrated by the bill, is an excessive 
reliance on bureaucratic compromise. If in doubt, especially on 
matters of principle, compromise. That is the Liberal approach. 
The bill is nothing but a compromise, a half measure that satisfies 
no one except those poor souls who believe that compromise is 
virtuous for its own sake.
<P>
	There are some policy issues where half measures simply will 
not do. We cannot be half committed to national unity. We cannot 
be half committed to fiscal responsibility. We cannot be half 
committed to democracy. We cannot be half committed to public 
safety.
<P>
	The public wants section 745 scrapped. According to the 
government's philosophy of criminal justice, the section should be 
retained as it is. But rather than do one or the other, scrap or retain, 
the government came up with a half baked compromise in the form 
of this tinkering amendment. The distinguishing characteristic of 
the government's approach as exemplified by the bill was 
bureaucratic compromise.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	This tinkering amendment exhibits all the characteristics of 
bureaucratic tinkering. First degree murderers are now to be 
divided into different categories. Bureaucrats like to categorize. A 
screening measure is set up for all section 745 applications. 
Superior court judges, not just the chief justice of the superior court 
in a  province, are drawn into the process, and the rules governing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5002"> 5002 </A></B>
<P>
juries hearing section 745 applications are amended. What can we 
call all this except bureaucratic fine tuning of a compromise 
position?
<P>
	If there is anything worse than government by the lawyers, of the 
lawyers, for the lawyers, it is government of the bureaucracy, by 
the bureaucracy, for the bureaucracy, and this bill smacks of both.
<P>
	My colleagues and I have no faith in bureaucratic tinkering, 
particularly with the Criminal Code and indeed in the whole area of 
criminal rehabilitation.
<P>
	Thinking of the ineffectiveness of bureaucratic action in these 
areas, the inability of bureaucratic measures and institutions to 
protect people or to rehabilitate criminals, I am reminded of a 
poem by the Canadian poet George Pepki, inspired by the 
children's nursery rhyme ``Humpty-Dumpty'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Humpty-Dumpty sat on a wall<BR>
Humpty-Dumpty had a great fall;<BR>
All the king's horses and all the King's men<BR>
Couldn't put Humpty together again.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And what is the moral to this little rhyme?<BR>
A moral with meaning for men in our time?<BR>
The moral is this, and its lesson is true:<BR>
There are certain things that the state cannot do.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If all the King's horses and all the King's men<BR>
Cannot put an egg together again,<BR>
Is it not a false hope, an illusion, a sin,<BR>
To ask civil servants to reconstruct men?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A third distinguishing characteristic of the Liberal approach to 
criminal justice is its growing disregard for the will of the people.
<P>
	When Liberalism first emerged as a distinct political philosophy 
in 19th century Britain, its distinguishing characteristic was faith in 
the common sense of the common people. That was the essence of 
Gladstone's great reform bills which extended the franchise to 
ordinary people; the right to make important governing decisions 
to more and more ordinary people.
<P>
	Gladstone treated the people as a great tribunal to which the 
greatest issue of state could be brought for discussion, not only 
discussion but decision.
<P>
	But something happens to Liberals long in office. They begin to 
trust themselves and their friends and their advisers more than they 
trust the people, until finally in the last decade of the 20th century, 
mistrust of the common people has become the distinguishing 
characteristic of a degenerate Liberalism.
<P>
	In this House a private member's bill introduced by the hon. 
member for York South-Weston, supported by members on both 
sides of the House, represented the wishes of the Canadian people 
with respect to section 745 of the Criminal Code. Their wish was to 
scrap the section, which was the effect of Bill C-234.
<P>
	But what has the government done? It attempted to derail in 
committee the bill which represented the will of the people and has 
substituted for it this bureaucratic  compromise we have before us 
representing the elitist views of the Minister of Justice and his 
colleagues. And to add insult to injury, the government now 
invokes time allocation to cut off debate and force the bill through 
a reluctant House.
<P>
	Unless there is a display of courage by government 
backbenchers in the House, something we see far too infrequently, 
the government whip will coerce his colleagues to support this 
bureaucratic compromise and once again disregard the will of the 
Canadian people with respect to a Criminal Code provision.
<P>
	In conclusion, Reform MPs reject both the bill and the whole 
Liberal approach to criminal justice on which it is based: this 
perverse set of priorities, bureaucratic compromises and blatant 
disregard for the will of the people. We urge other members to 
reject the bill and to bring back to the House and support Bill 
C-234, which more accurately reflects the will of Canadians on this 
issue.
<P>
	We look forward to the day when a fresh start will be made on 
criminal justice in this country, one based on principle rather than 
bureaucratic compromise, one in which the rights of victims and 
law-abiding citizens take precedence over the rights of persons 
accused or convicted of crimes, one in which respect for the will of 
Canadians becomes the guiding light of the Canadian Criminal 
Code.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
honoured to follow my leader in this final debate on this bill. I rise 
today to speak once more in opposition to Bill C-45 because it 
demeans the value of a human life and it is unworthy of support.
<P>
	I have repeatedly stood in this House, as have my colleagues, 
and asked one simple question, a question the justice minister and 
the Liberal government have failed to answer. What is a fair and 
just penalty for the taking of an innocent life?
<P>
	Last week when I was in Quebec with the standing committee 
which is in the process of reviewing the Young Offenders Act, I had 
an opportunity to meet with several convicted first degree 
murderers.
<P>
	One young man had killed his mother, father and brother. 
Another had stabbed his girlfriend 18 times. I asked them what they 
believed was a fair and just penalty for their crimes. I asked if 10 
years was enough for what they had done. They said: ``If we were 
to ask the victims if 10 years was long enough the answer would be 
no. If we were to ask them if 25 years was long enough, the answer 
would still be no''. No length of time would be long enough in the 
eyes of their victims according to these murderers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5003"> 5003 </A></B>
<P>
	What then would be an appropriate penalty? We must answer 
this question. This unanswered question remains at the heart of 
today's debate.
<P>
	On February 24, 1976 the Liberal government introduced Bill 
C-84 to abolish the death penalty and to create two new categories 
of murder, first and second degree murder, both of which carried a 
minimum sentence of life imprisonment. Those convicted of first 
degree murder were to serve 25 years before being eligible for 
parole while second degree murderers would serve between 10 and 
25 years prior to release.
<P>
	The 25 year minimum for first degree murder was the Liberal 
government's trade off for the abolition of the death penalty. 
Instead of the death penalty society was to be protected by the 
incarceration for life of those who deliberately and with 
premeditation killed with no consideration for parole until a 
minimum of 25 years had been served.
<P>
	However, unbeknown to the vast majority of Canadians, the 
Liberal government of the day betrayed them by slipping section 
745 into the Criminal Code. Section 745 nullifies the term life 
imprisonment and bestows on killers an unjustifiable right to early 
release before serving a minimum of 25 years.
<P>
	An hon. member who spoke earlier is absolutely right when he 
quoted me as saying a life sentence is not about rehabilitation. I 
mention it because of the importance of this issue. It is about 
punishment. What is a fair and just punishment for the wilful 
premeditated taking of an innocent life, particularly of our 
children?
<P>
	It is also about retribution for the most horrible crime in society, 
the unlawful taking of an innocent life and the devastating affect 
this has on society. Liberals do not believe in punishment, at least 
those who run the Liberal government. They do not believe in 
punishment or retribution, only in rehabilitation. That is what we 
have been getting from the bleeding hearts for the past 25 years. 
They tolerate the most extreme crimes in society at the expense of 
law-abiding Canadians. They mock and scorn the requests of all 
those who seek the removal of section 745 of the Criminal Code in 
its entirety.
<P>
	The pathetic performance today by the member for Kingston and 
the Islands is a typical example of that mocking and scorning that 
goes on in this House on such a very serious matter. In the absence 
of capital punishment I am confident Canadians, as the Canadian 
Police Association and the chiefs of police believe, the minimum 
penalty for first degree murder should be life imprisonment with 
absolutely no chance of parole until at the very least 25 years have 
been served.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The government talks about the glimmer of hope. There is the 
glimmer of hope which all Canadians would support and that is 
after 25 years give that individual, if rehabilitated, an opportunity 
for parole.
<P>
	Bill C-45 does not meet those demands. Bill C-45 does not 
ensure a minimum of 25 years imprisonment. In fact, Bill C-45 is 
nothing more than a meagre attempt by the justice minister to sugar 
coat this repulsive provision of the Criminal Code for reasons of 
political expediency. This is not just my view. This is shared by 
victims' groups all across this country.
<P>
	To amplify this point I would like to read to the House portions 
of a recent letter addressed to the justice minister by Mrs. Debbie 
Mahaffy on behalf of Action for Victims:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How can you skate over the glaring surety of a charter challenge regarding 
slapping an electronic bracelet on an innocent yet potential high risk offender but fail 
to deal adequately with releasing convicted first and second degree murderers? Oh 
right, they only lost their freedom of movement for a determined number of years 
but earn their rights to an early release.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Shelving C-45 and Olson's judicial review and finally giving more than a quick 
look at high risk offenders by actual legislation looks like, sounds like a pre-election 
handout to me. It is obvious that you may be able to avoid ever having to deal with 
Olson's judicial review or the contentious Bill C-45, as they can be put on a slow 
back burner until the election is over. But we will not fail to recognize that this 
shuffling of files on your desk is just clever politics.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We hear from a mother who lost her daughter at the hands of a 
murderer expressing her concern to the justice minister in as 
eloquent a manner I suppose as I have see yet.
<P>
	Bill C-45 strips multiple or serial killers of the right to apply for 
early parole and creates an additional bureaucratic hurdle for single 
killers to jump before exercising their right to a full jury review of 
their parole ineligibility. Bill C-45 contains a royal 
recommendation which allows for the expenditure of additional 
funds for section 745 appeals.
<P>
	When questioned in June, the justice minister said the extra 
money will be allocated to Correctional Service Canada for longer 
periods of incarceration for those killers denied a judicial review 
by a jury. This is misleading and an absolute joke. The justice 
minister via Bill C-45 has set up another level of appeal for first 
degree murderers and this is what will incur additional costs. 
Multiple killers currently incarcerated will not apply directly to a 
jury but must first satisfy a superior court judge that their 
application for a reduction in parole will have a reasonable 
prospect of success.
<P>
	If the superior court judge denies one of these 28 multiple 
murderers their right for a judicial review by a jury they can appeal 
this decision to a higher court, of course at taxpayer expense.
<P>
	As well, if the jury denies them a reduction in their parole 
ineligibility, provisions within section 745 allow them to apply 
again. The same process will be applicable to all first degree 
murderers. I question the necessity for  extra funding in this regard, 
given the number of criminals, including violent criminals, who 
will never see the inside of a prison as a result of the Liberals' 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5004"> 5004 </A></B>
<P>
alternative measures as contained in Bill C-41 and the change from 
indictable offences to summary conviction fines as prescribed in 
Bill C-17.
<P>
	Bill C-45 may delay but will not prevent killers from getting a 
judicial review and ultimately a reduction in their parole 
ineligibility. Bill C-45 and the review of a killer's application by a 
judge will do nothing but add an expensive layer of bureaucracy to 
our growing justice industry.
<P>
	This will add to Canadians' financial strain and undermine their 
personal security. The minister's June 11 introduction of Bill C-45 
just 10 days before the House recessed for the summer was nothing 
more than a half baked attempt to deflect criticism for not 
preventing Clifford Olson from once again making headlines 
despite the fact he had almost three years and ample support to 
bring this bill before the House.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	The minister's efforts to limit child serial killer Clifford Olson's 
bid for early release failed. To the horror of all Canadians who have 
shared the pain of the Rosenfeldts and the other 10 families whose 
children were brutally ripped from their lives on August 12, 1996, 
Clifford Olson was eligible to apply for early release.
<P>
	As revealed in the court challenge on Bill C-68 launched by the 
governments of Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario and 
Yukon, the minister did not adequately consult his provincial 
counterparts regarding that bill. I would respectfully suggest that 
the provincial attorneys general are not alone. Canadians have not 
been consulted with regard to Bill C-45. Canadians have not been 
granted by this Liberal government an opportunity to be heard on 
the issue of section 745, as they have not been granted an 
opportunity to voice their opinion on capital punishment.
<P>
	I conclude by saying again that I oppose Bill C-45 because it is 
unworthy of my support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
during the first session of Parliament I served as one of the 
members of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. 
It is a job I took very seriously since I was one of the select few 
given the job to look after justice legislation on behalf of 295 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	The most troublesome problem I encountered as one of those 
members was the Liberal government's deliberate fast tracking of 
legislation through this House. For example, last year with only 
two weeks left before the House recessed for the summer, Bills 
C-41 and C-68 were brought before the House for report stage and 
third reading, although they had been reported out of committee 
weeks before. The minister deliberately waited until the eleventh 
hour and time allocation was used to limit debate and thus exposure 
for both of these contentious bills.
<P>
	The most recent example of this undemocratic fast tracking is 
this bill, Bill C-45. Since 1993 the Reform Party has been asking 
the justice minister to repeal section 745. The justice minister 
waited until there were only eight sitting days left for the House 
last June, knowing full well that the bill could not be properly 
debated in that short period of time. The most important point is 
that with only eight days for debate, this allowed only one day for 
study and review by the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs.
<P>
	There is no way on earth that proper analysis could take place in 
just one day. This is an insult to the whole process and certainly an 
insult to the victims of crime who tried so desperately to have 
section 745 repealed. It also was very repulsive to the number of 
witnesses who wanted to appear before the committee.
<P>
	In order to let the Canadian people hear a sample of what these 
witnesses had to say, I would like to take this opportunity to present 
the testimony of Joanne Kaplinski. She said: ``I am a survivor of a 
murder victim and have been forced to endure a judicial review 
under section 745. It would also appear that because of the law of 
the day, I will be required to live through that ordeal yet again, as 
the co-convicted has advanced his application''.
<P>
	She tells the story of how her brother Kenneth was robbed and 
later shot twice in the head at point blank range. Forensic evidence 
revealed that he in all probability was made to kneel before his 
killer. His decomposed body was found two months later.
<P>
	She goes on to state: ``We, Kenneth's survivors, also received 
life sentences and became initiated into a very exclusive club, 
probably more exclusive than the Canadian Club, but it is a club 
that I assure you no one here would ever want to join. The initiation 
is the death of a loved one by violence. Membership dues are 
extracted from us each and every day of our lives as survivors of 
such violence.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	``In sum it has been over 18 years coping with the aftermath of 
those two parolees' actions. We got on with our lives, or rather we 
got on with picking up the pieces of our shattered lives, but never 
would we be able to look at the world with the same eyes again. 
Evil was no longer some ethereal concept, it was real and tangible. 
I think our profound despair came from being forced to look into 
the abyss, the depth of human cruelty and suffering.
<P>
	``In December 1993 we once again were forced to revisit that 
same abyss and relive what we had to go through in 1978. All our 
pain of course was resurrected by the section 745 application of one 
of Kenneth's murderers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5005"> 5005 </A></B>
<P>
	``We the public feel duped by the machinations and doublespeak 
of bureaucrats. By making available this section 745, however 
reworked, the Liberal government of the day is sending a message 
to Canadians across the country that murder in this society will 
be tolerated. I think that conveys a very sad statement about the 
value of our lives, yours and mine, as Canadian citizens. Fifteen 
years is not adequate denunciation for the wanton destruction of 
human life. My brother Kenneth was, by volition of those 
convicted, sentenced to death, and that sentence for Ken was 
eternal and irrevocable''.
<P>
	As can be seen from this witness's comments, to have a bill of 
this magnitude fast tracked as it was through the justice committee 
is appalling. There are many more witnesses with compelling 
stories. Time will not allow me to convey their thoughts and 
certainly this Liberal government did not allow them the time to 
convey their thoughts through the proper channel of the justice 
committee. It is clear that the whole process of not studying the bill 
and not giving everyone an opportunity to share their information 
is nothing but a direct insult to the victims' families who worked so 
hard throughout this nation to repeal section 745.
<P>
	After this mere one day analysis, the bitterness started to set in 
with these witnesses. They felt they were just shoved aside. One of 
those people was Darlene Boyd. She later sent me a copy of a letter 
she wrote to the justice minister about issues she had to get off her 
chest. Her letter is as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since being in Ottawa to testify before the justice committee, which I felt was a 
rushed and last minute formality, I have had the opportunity to examine Bill C-45.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My feelings, as you know, concerning section 745 are total repeal. Thousands of 
Canadian people have supported and continue to support total repeal, believing 
repeal is the only concrete measure that will keep first degree murderers where they 
belong, in prison for at least 25 years, this being the maximum punishment provided 
to us by your government for premeditated first degree murder.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I also understand Mr. Nunziata's Bill C-234 has expired in the Speaker's hands. 
Bill C-234 should have been voted on for the third time in the House before Bill 
C-45 was ever presented. Is there no priority given in matter of sequence? John's bill 
drew positive results for repeal from many Liberals. My question to this is what 
political pressure suddenly made them support amending rather than repealing 
section 745?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am receiving letters every day, as I am sure Mr. Rock has been, from people 
demanding total repeal. These people I have never met, but truth in sentencing is 
what concerns them. Most feel betrayed by our justice system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Rock has said he is listening to the Canadian people. Bill C-45 does not 
demonstrate this.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Rock, you have referred to us as the ``victims industry''. We never classified 
ourselves as part of any industry. We are ordinary people who have paid a price far 
too great to establish such a petty organization. We never asked for this fate and we 
are not victims, we are survivors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is one thing I need advice on and that is how to tell our son, who has not yet 
put his life back together since his sister's murder, that the man convicted and 
sentenced to life in prison will be applying for and probably will be granted his day 
in court to tell everyone what a good person he has become in the past 15 years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Who will take responsibility when he falls apart? Bill C-45 will be guilty of this 
crime.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My family is three people. There are hundreds who will be affected if section 745 
is not repealed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Does the charter of rights not protect us, or was it written just for murderers?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I appeal to you not as politicians, but to anyone who holds family and friends 
dear. Because murder shows no bounds, please reconsider repeal and make it 
impossible for these killers to once again exploit my family and the families of 
others.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	I have thousands of these letters from victims. I visit them in 
their homes and at rallies. I am sure the member for Kingston and 
the Islands has never been to a victims rally. He would not know 
what they are all about. However, when I spend time with these 
people, I for the life of me cannot understand for the slightest 
moment why we would adopt a bureaucratic procedure such as Bill 
C-45 over the good common sense of the people all across Canada 
who are screaming and demanding loud and clear: ``Repeal section 
745''.
<P>
	What is the matter with a government that will not listen to the 
people? It is called tyranny and it is time that tyranny was crushed.
<P>
	Please bring back Bill C-234 and repeal section 745 on behalf of 
the Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me this afternoon to speak again to Bill 
C-45. I say it is a pleasure because obviously, with the government 
enacting time allocation yet again on another piece of legislation, 
we find the unfortunate situation that a number of my colleagues 
and I am certain colleagues from the other parties as well would 
have liked to have spoken again on this bill and are being denied, I 
believe, their right to do just that.
<P>
	It is a pleasure for me to be allowed the opportunity to once 
again try to get my message through to the Liberals on the opposite 
side of the House and the supporters of the justice minister. He 
continues to bring forward these weak-kneed, half-baked pieces of 
legislation, instead of doing, as my colleague from Wild Rose so 
aptly said just moments ago, what the people of Canada are 
demanding and expecting the Government of Canada to do.
<P>
	I suppose it could be said that after quite a number of hours of 
debate on C-45 what more can be said that has not already been 
said on this issue. Reluctantly, Reform has come to understand that 
the only way to get through to the Liberals is to repeat our points 
over and over again. That is unfortunate. I am sure all of us in the  
Reform Party would much rather be discussing some other 
legislation today and be moving forward with some other 
constructive legislation. However, no matter how hard we try, it 
seems that we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5006"> 5006 </A></B>
<P>
run up against a brick wall and cannot get our message through to 
the Liberal government.
<P>
	That was clearly demonstrated at the start of the debate this 
afternoon. After the vote on the government's time allocation 
motion on this piece of legislation, the hon. member for Kingston 
and the Islands got up and read through transcript after transcript of 
things that the Reform Party had said but had nothing constructive 
of his own to say about the legislation. He was merely attacking us 
for what we were trying to say. If only, and I mean this sincerely, he 
had listened to what was being said. Instead he simply poked fun at 
what the Reform Party has been trying to say on this piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	Obviously, as it has been said repeatedly and I will repeat it 
again, the thrust is that the people of Canada are demanding the 
repeal of section 745. It is that simple. That is the crux of the issue 
here.
<P>
	This has been said before and I will say it again and again. The 
independent member for York South-Weston brought forward a 
private member's bill. It had the support of the majority of 
members of the House and moved on to committee. I expected that 
perhaps with a few minor amendments that piece of legislation 
would ultimately be passed into law. Obviously it had the support 
of the people of the country and it had the support of the majority of 
the representatives of the people of the country. That is what should 
have happened.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	I believe the way the justice committee handled this particular 
private member's bill is an insult to the private members' process 
in this place. I am absolutely appalled at the way the private 
member's bill of the member for York South-Weston was treated. 
I want to draw the attention of the House and the people who are 
viewing the debate this afternoon to that point.
<P>
	The second point which I want to make, which has been made 
before, is that what we should be moving toward, what Canadians 
are demanding, especially when it comes to multiple murderers, is 
a system of consecutive sentencing. It does not matter how many 
lives murderers take, they get one life sentence. We are debating 
whether they should get 15, 17, 18 or 25 years.
<P>
	I believe the vast majority of the people of Canada would 
support consecutive sentencing. It has been implemented in some 
U.S. states. If a person takes one life they get 25 years; two lives, 
50 years; three lives, 75 years; and it keeps on going. Individual 
lives must count for something.
<P>
	What I hear when travelling across the country is that people are 
simply fed up with the weak justice system and the criminals who 
flaunt it.
<P>
	We can all quote statistics until we are blue in the face; however, 
despite whatever the statistics are saying about violent crime being 
on the decline or whatever the case may be, the reality is that 
people feel threatened. People feel unsafe in their homes, on the 
streets and in their communities. They are telling us to do 
something about it.
<P>
	Reform members have been endeavouring to do that. We have 
been trying to drive that message home. We have repeated time and 
time again what we are hearing from Canadians.
<P>
	What Canadians are crying for is the bottom line. I can stand and 
say how I feel, but what are Canadians saying? What is the mood of 
the country out there?
<P>
	I had a recent poll done in my riding of Prince George-Peace 
River. One of the questions that was asked was: ``How do you feel 
the federal government is doing with respect to criminal justice 
issues?'' This was a scientific poll. What we found was that 6 per 
cent of those polled said it was doing very well. Twenty-seven per 
cent said it was doing an adequate job. However, 56 per cent said 
that the government was doing a poor job. Another 11 per cent were 
uncertain.
<P>
	Two-thirds of the people in my riding either feel that the 
government is doing a very poor job with respect to criminal justice 
issues or they are unsure what it is doing. That clearly indicates that 
there is a growing sentiment in the country that the government is 
weak on crime. That has been reinforced again and again by the 
justice minister, who continues to bring in these half baked 
schemes which do not get to the root of the problem.
<P>
	A number of my colleagues have outlined where we should be 
going and where Canadians are demanding we go on criminal 
justice issues. We have to concentrate more on victim rights. That 
is paramount in the minds of Canadians. It is high time this 
government started to address the real concerns which are out there 
among average Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a short 
time ago the member for Kingston and the Islands was waxing 
eloquent with quotations from <I>Hansard</I>. You could ask, Mr. 
Speaker, why he quoted so eloquently from <I>Hansard</I> things that 
were said by Reformers in this House supporting the views of 
Canadians across the country but he never bothered to quote from 
the victims' families, the people who have suffered from the crimes 
of these people the member for Kingston and the Islands is trying 
to protect. He did not bother to quote from the people who suffer 
because of his liberal minded rules about law and order.
<P>
	Since the member for Kingston and the Islands is so fond of 
quoting from the printed word, I would like to quote a few things 
that he said. I have here an article from the <I>British Columbia 
Report</I> of July 15 of this year in which the member for Kingston 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5007"> 5007 </A></B>
<P>
and the Islands, when talking about the protection of VIA Rail 
tickets that members in the House had, said: ``I think we were 
hoodwinked by the people who introduced the bill''. The people 
behind the alleged plot are members of his own Liberal 
government, reports the reporter in the article.
<P>
	The member for Kingston and the Islands said: ``I think we were 
hoodwinked by the people who introduced the bill''. On this bill 
before us I would venture to say the member is being hoodwinked 
again: ``The MP for Kingston and the Islands suspects faceless 
bureaucrats were negligent in their duties although he is not quite 
sure who is to blame for introducing the bill but he says `I don't 
know anyone who reads every bill. I don't'''.
<P>
	No wonder he is so easily hoodwinked. He does not even read 
the bills. Since he does not read the bills I can tell that he also does 
not bother listening to his constituents or he would know that 
repeal of section 745 is supported by an overwhelming majority of 
Canadians coast to coast. We do not have to be a rocket scientist to 
find that out.
<P>
	Just as they support the repeal of section 745, they also support a 
complete and effective overhaul of the Young Offenders Act. They 
want a referendum on the return of capital punishment. They are 
totally dissatisfied with the Liberal's performance on justice issues.
<P>
	These Liberal trained seals on the other side of the House 
support a closure motion to shut down meaningful debate on an 
issue of great importance to the people of Canada. They stand there 
and call us extremists for speaking the minds of Canadians coast to 
coast. That is too bad. The real extremists in this place are the 
people who sit on the government side. They are the ones 
responsible for a debt that will hit $600 billion on November 22; 
600 billion of debt on the shoulders of our children and our 
grandchildren. They are the extremists who let murderers and 
sexual offenders out of prison early so they can commit more 
crimes.
<P>
	There is ample evidence that letting these people out before they 
have served their sentences causes a great many more crimes. I am 
going to quote some bureau of justice statistics of 1989 from a 
study that was done in the United States between the years 1973 
and 1989. In 1989 the bureau of justice statistics issued some 
estimates of how many crimes are prevented while criminals are 
locked up rather than walking the streets.
<P>
	Analyst Patrick Langan concluded that higher incarceration rates 
between 1973 and 1989 cut the number of rapes by 66,000, 
robberies by 323,000, assaults by 380,000, burglaries by 3.3 
million, and that imprisonment clearly contributes to major cuts in 
the number and cost of violent crime.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	Those Liberals can stand there and call us extremists, but they 
are the extremists. Because of their policies, Canada has probably 
<P>
suffered tens of thousands more rapes, tens of thousands more 
violent crimes, hundreds more murders and God knows how many 
million more burglaries; simply because of their wishy-washy 
justice approach.
<P>
	Over the past 20 years or so our justice system has tended to 
concentrate on this wonderful theory of rehabilitation and treating 
the root cause of the crime. Everybody has had this terrible 
childhood. ``Oh, my God, the reason I am such a bad guy is that I 
had this terrible childhood. Nothing ever went right for me. I did 
not win the Lotto 649. It is just dreadful''. Some of these people 
have to start taking responsibility for that they do.
<P>
	Everybody in Canada, except the people who sit on the other side 
of the House, are sick to death of this ``oh, dear the poor things''. It 
is time for some justice.
<P>
	I would like to mention another experiment that took place in the 
United States. The police commissioner for New York, Mr. 
William Bratton, was quoted shortly after he was appointed 
security director for the subway system in 1990: ``Eureka, we have 
discovered the root cause of crime. It is criminals''.
<P>
	He adopted a hard line approach in addressing the problems of 
graffiti, fare evasion, panhandling and assaults that were taking 
place in the subway system in New York. He said: ``The way to get 
this thing under control is to take a hard line approach of zero 
tolerance on graffiti, spitting on the sidewalk, all of that sort of 
stuff''. He took this hard line approach where he insisted and the 
security people clamp down on any incidents of panhandling, 
graffiti, spitting on the sidewalk.
<P>
	Within one year there was an impressive improvement. 
Robberies were down 75 per cent; serious felonies on the subway, a 
drop of 64 per cent.
<P>
	Mr. Bratton subsequently became the police commissioner for 
New York where his methods have resulted in a 31 per cent drop in 
murders, a 25 per cent drop in car theft and a 22 per cent drop in 
robberies. How much evidence do we need?
<P>
	The people who were flagrantly disobeying the rules of law, 
when they discovered there was zero tolerance for minor crimes, 
realized that there would be zero, zero tolerance for the major 
crimes and they stopped committing them.
<P>
	As long as they were getting free counselling and free 
rehabilitation and were told how terrible their childhood was, they 
just kept disobeying the law. For God's sake, we are such patsies. 
When are we going to get real? It is time to get tough. Not a day 
goes by, and I believe this applies to members on the other side as 
well, that I do not get phone calls and letters to my office telling me  
people are sick and tired of this pandering to criminals. They are 
sick and tired of it and it is really time we started to do something.
<P>
	On May 11 this year the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> reported that during a 
meeting of the attorneys general, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario 
pushed for the total repeal of section 745; Ontario, Manitoba and 
Alberta.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5008"> 5008 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> A great province.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> A great province says my 
colleague from Ontario. They are all great provinces. The attorneys 
general knew what the people wanted. They knew they needed to 
get rid of this section in order to return some stability to the 
sentencing and serving of punishment.
<P>
	Members on the other side constantly get excited if we talk about 
punishment. For some reason we are not allowed to punish people 
for committing crimes. Please do not punish them. These things 
can be carried to extremes.
<P>
	The justice minister suddenly thinks it is okay to let people out 
after 15 years where there is evidence that they will not commit the 
crime again. Let us let them out. Why keep them locked up? We 
can carry that argument to the extreme and say we recognize they 
committed murder, but why lock them up? They will never do it 
again. Why does it have to be 15 years? Why not 15 hours? They 
are so repentant and they promise to take counselling and they will 
learn French and do whatever is necessary. And they are let free. It 
has to stop
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	When the attorneys general of the provinces start pushing for the 
repeal of these sections, it is time the justice minister started 
listening. The attorneys general are telling him his gun control bill 
is misdirected. They told him Bill C-33 was misdirected. They 
have told him that section 745 is misdirected and they have told 
him the Young Offenders Act revisions were misdirected. When is 
he going to start listening?
<P>
	It is a travesty of justice that closure was moved on this bill 
today. I urge members, please, in a last minute appeal, vote against 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
reason I have only five minutes to speak is that the government has 
moved closure again on a bill. I would like to talk for the couple of 
minutes I have left on why this bill is symbolic of two things that 
have become obvious of this Liberal government.
<P>
	One thing that has become obvious is that Liberal leadership is 
an oxymoron. There is no such thing as a Liberal leader. There is a 
Liberal follower, there is a Liberal bootlicker, there is a Liberal 
cave in, there is a Liberal puppet, there is a Liberal wishy-washy 
half-baked social engineering attempt at doing something, but 
there  is no Liberal leadership. That is what I would like to talk 
about.
<P>
	I would like to show how this bill is symbolic. Out on the west 
coast there is a symptom we know of when we talk about fish, that 
the fish rots from the head down. What we have in this example is 
the fact that not only is there no Liberal leadership, there is no such 
thing, there is also a rot at the top. The rot at the top has started to 
create a stench. It is not only something that maybe we could say is 
a mistake but an actual stench surrounds what is going on here 
today.
<P>
	We should be debating the private member's bill from the 
member for York South-Weston. We should be debating in this 
House the elimination of section 745. This House passed that 
private member's bill. We in this House said that we approve in 
principle the bill of the member for York South-Weston that we 
will abolish-not tinker with, not play with, not jack around 
with-we will abolish section 745.
<P>
	This House passed that bill. It was approved by all members of 
this House. It was sent to committee and then what happened? That 
Liberal leadership, the concept that is foreign to the government, 
said to their Liberal committee: ``This bill must not ever see the 
light of day''. What is it? Was the bill too popular, was there too 
widespread an appeal?
<P>
	I will tell you what it is. The bill was sent to committee. The bill 
was then sent from committee to cyberspace. The Minister of 
Justice should be showing some leadership on this. If he had the 
guts to vote against it that is one thing, but instead he just says: 
``Let us hope it goes away''.
<P>
	People have talked about the government's half measures, that it 
moves half way on different things. It is not half way, it is nowhere. 
This bill has no support. The Canadian police chiefs will not 
support it. The victims of crime will not support it. The Canadian 
people will not support it. If the Liberals were to ask in their own 
ridings, there is no support for this half measure. There is none. 
Canadians want this section eliminated. Reform members have 
gone through the reasons it is not supported by anyone.
<P>
	Maybe the reason the member for Kingston and the Islands 
wanted it is that he knows the prisoners can now vote. Maybe there 
is something in it for him. Maybe it will swing the riding.
<P>
	What has happened here in the House is that the Liberals have 
told their backbenchers: ``We can have a free vote on private 
members' bills whenever you want''. It is like a drug. They say: 
``Oh thank you. I feel so good about this. I will vote my conscience, 
I will vote what I think my constituents want''.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	They did that, to give them credit. They did that on the bill from 
the member for York South-Weston. When they were appeased, 
when they felt good, when the drug and the sedative was flowing 
through their bodies, what happened? The bill was sent to 
committee to never see the light of day. I do not know where the 
sedative is. I do not know whether someone has to take it with a 
double shot of rye to make them feel good.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5009"> 5009 </A></B>
<P>
	The backbenchers should be angry over this. They should say to 
the government: ``When we pass legislation in this House, when it 
goes to committee, we want to vote on it''. They should have the 
right. It was wrong. There is no leadership over there. This thing 
stinks.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should give RCMP officers the 
right to unionize and to bargain collectively under the Canada Labour Code.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, is it not somewhat of a paradox, although 
it is not perceived as such, that today I should stand up in this 
House and defend what is undoubtedly one of Canada's best known 
symbols? This is proof that nobody in this House will be able to 
say, either in the future or in reference to the past, that the official 
opposition has not lived up to its responsibilities.
<P>
	I expect the parliamentary secretary to generously mention it in 
his reply; as you know, if there is someone who is often critical of 
the official opposition, it is my colleague, the member for 
Vaudreuil.
<P>
	On a more serious note, I believe that as parliamentarians we 
must realize that discrimination of a peculiar kind has been going 
on for years within the RCMP. Around 16,000 officers are finding 
themselves in a legal vacuum the likes of which is unheard of, a 
very unhealthy situation indeed.
<P>
	People listening to us must realize that the RCMP officers are 
protected neither by the Labour Code nor the Public Service of 
Canada Act. Therefore, the situation is that some clearly essential 
workers are discriminated against and cannot exercise their rights 
to collective bargaining.
<P>
	It is quite paradoxical, because members of Parliament are 
certainly already aware of the situation.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	At least three commissions of inquiry have stated that labour 
relations were among the difficulties pointed out to the legislator. 
We cannot rise today and plead innocence saying that we did not 
know about the situation, that we do not know what it is all about. 
On the contrary, the situation was brought to the attention of the 
cabinet and of the parliamentarians. But there has always been 
some reluctance to act on this issue.
<P>
	Closer to home, the labour minister, also a member for Montreal, 
asked for a task force, which reviewed and reported on part I of the 
Labour Code, which we want to update, and rightly so. Among the 
recommendations in the report Sims, named for the commission's 
chairman, there was obviously a finding to the effect it was 
unacceptable that all police officers in Canada, except RCMP 
members, had the right to collective bargaining.
<P>
	It was recommended to take action to see how this group could 
be unionized. We will come back to what this right to unionize 
means concretely. Believe it or not, Mr. Speaker, and knowing how 
sensitive you are, I am sure you will have great difficulty admitting 
it, but it remains that, despite the information available, despite 
three inquiry commissions, despite the recent tabling of a report, 
the minister responsible for this issue has still taken no action.
<P>
	Let it be clearly understood: currently in Canada eight provinces 
and 200 municipalities use the RCMP as their police. We have to 
remind Canadians and the people who are watching us how flagrant 
this discrimination is since two categories of employees who do the 
same kind of work do not have the same rights. That is the situation 
we want to correct.
<P>
	When I tabled my motion, I had clearly in mind what this means 
in the workplace, how unhealthy it can be when employees cannot 
collectively determine, influence and work to ensure they have a 
voice on the working conditions they will be subject to. That is 
why, periodically, there have been labour relations problems in the 
RCMP.
<P>
	In order to restore a healthy labour relations climate in the 
RCMP, I think that a certain number of requirements must be met. 
First of all, employees must have the right to collectively negociate 
their working conditions. This is not a meaningless statement. 
What is a collective agreement if not a consensus expressed on 
paper setting out the rules, procedures and avenues of appeal 
available if the parties cannot come to an agreement?
<P>
	Not only are RCMP officers prohibited from making 
representations on collective bargaining, but they are in a 
practically unprecedented situation. Anyone who is familiar with 
labour relations knows how unhealthy this  situation is, since, as a 
manager, the RCMP Commissioner must implement directives and 
make deci-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5011"> 5011 </A></B>
<P>
sions, acting as both judge and jury. One does not need a law degree 
to realize how unhealthy this is.
<P>
	Again, this government-with its cow-like disposition-refuses 
to step in and take the measures needed to correct the situation.
<P>
	As I said earlier, for healthy work conditions to prevail within 
the RCMP, officers must have the right to bargain collectively. 
They must, of course, have the right to form an association, to have 
democratically elected representatives recognized as such, and to 
submit grievances to an outside organization that is independent 
and neutral.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	I trust that the parliamentary secretary will, when he rises in a 
few minutes, admit that when there are disputes in the Public 
Service there is an outside third party to judge grievances and reach 
a decision, as well as appeal mechanisms of which both the 
employer and the workers are aware. That third party is the Public 
Service Commission, or in certain specific cases Treasury Board, 
or the Public Service Staff Relations Board. These are known 
bodies and have a precise role. Their independence of action is 
acknowledged, because they are accredited by both management 
and labour.
<P>
	This is the crux of the debate. It is all the more admirable 
because these are not workers who have shirked their 
responsibilities. They are all very aware of their responsibilities 
which, moreover, have a special nature in the RCMP relating to 
national security and protecting the public interest.
<P>
	This is why the representations they are making to us as 
parliamentarians are not for the right to strike. That is not what is 
involved when RCMP employees, through a national association, 
are calling for recognition of a certain number of rights. What is 
involved is the right to compulsory arbitration, outside the RCMP 
of course, but they are not calling for the commissioner to be bound 
by the decision, and therefore not for a final and binding arbitration 
such as there is in place today. There are already clauses within part 
I of the Labour Code which permit this.
<P>
	The employees of the RCMP have even facilitated the work of 
the legislator. So much so that they proposed a bill containing a 
certain number of stipulations. If we wanted to go ahead and be 
serious about the attention we give employees of the RCMP, any 
member in this House, but especially the government majority 
whose responsibility it is, could well introduce a bill giving those 
employees the right to collective bargaining and the right to group 
together into an association.
<P>
	I hope that people who are listening tonight understand that this 
is what this debate is about, something harmless, the basis of work 
relations.
<P>
	Believe it or not, RCMP employees-officers, I am not talking 
about civilian employees, I am talking about officers-have been 
waiting for this decision for at least ten years. How is it that 
nothing has been done? Since 1993, we have seen a total lack of 
understanding of what is going on in the RCMP.
<P>
	Let us take the following example: there is currently a divisional 
representative process. However, this process is more like a small 
shop union than like what exists elsewhere in the public service. As 
an MP, I suggest that we give a legislative framework to the RCMP 
so that those people can form an association and collectively 
decide, collectively negotiate their collective agreement.
<P>
	If ever there is no majority, I am quite convinced, and I would 
even dare to bet on a large beer, Mr. Speaker, that the Parliamentary 
Secretary will tell us in a few minutes, when he stands up: ``Yes, 
but there is already a negotiation process.''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Did you read my speech?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> I know the Parliamentary Secretary. He is awfully 
predictable.
<P>
	In a while, he will stand up and tell us: ``Yes, but there is already 
a process for representational purposes and nothing indicates that 
they want this process expanded.''
<P>
	I am telling this to put off the Parliamentary Secretary: let us 
give the RCMP and its employees a legislative framework and 
leave it to them to take advantage of it. I hope the government will 
not go on doing nothing, that it will listen attentively and will act to 
help workers who are victims of discrimination even when faced 
with a problem.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Let us take a concrete example. Let us look at what happened. As 
we know, the government is proud to have promoted bilingualism 
in the public service through all sorts of measures, and the 
parliamentary secretary believes in this principle.
<P>
	The commissioner-and this is nothing personal-became an 
institution through an act of Parliament and was both judge and 
judged regarding bilingual bonuses. Under this program, when a 
public servant passes a written and oral test, he is eligible to a 
bonus of $800. This is not a huge amount, but it is better than 
nothing.
<P>
	These workers suffered a prejudice because it was claimed they 
were not entitled to the bonus, even though the courts ruled in their 
favour. What did the government do to correct the situation? Rarely 
does one witness such a lack of sensitivity. The government 
introduced a bill in which it took a malicious pleasure in legislating 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5012"> 5012 </A></B>
<P>
that these workers were clearly not covered by the Public Service 
of Canada Act or the Canada Labour Code, in spite of the fact that 
some, mostly Quebecers  living in Quebec, are bilingual and were 
deprived of this bilingual bonus. Such an anomaly would not exist 
if things were more clear.
<P>
	Let us talk about the right to unionize. In a democracy, what is 
the point of having a charter of rights and freedoms? What is the 
point of boasting about freedom of association and pay equity for 
all, if this type of discrimination is being perpetuated? If RCMP 
officers were covered by part I of the Canada Labour Code, the 
employer would face reprisals if it objected to its employees 
forming a union. Indeed, the employer cannot interfere if the 
conditions regarding the application for union certification and the 
related process are met.
<P>
	We must keep this in mind when we discuss issues such as this 
one.
<P>
	How does the parliamentary secretary intend to restore good 
working relations in such a sensitive milieu as the RCMP if we 
deny these workers the fundamental right that all the other public 
servants in Canada enjoy?
<P>
	If we were holding a meeting here tonight, not with members of 
Parliament, but with RCMP employees, can you imagine what 
would happen? How could one of us explain to these workers who 
pay taxes, get up every morning, take an oath and serve their fellow 
citizens, that they do not have the right to sit at the bargaining table 
and negotiate their working conditions, that they do not have the 
right to have their grievances heard by a third party, unlike the rest 
of the public servants? How can we explain that and how can we 
remain so stubborn when inquiry after inquiry comes to the same 
conclusion as the most recent report. That report does not date back 
to the year 1992 before Christ, it is the Sims Report that was tabled 
last January. The Sims Report, which I have the pleasure to quote 
quite often in this House, recognizes that these workers are being 
wronged.
<P>
	So, I hope that my colleagues both from the government side and 
from the Reform Party as well as the Bloc members will try to put 
an end to this type of discrimination.
<P>
	The one thing we should keep in mind at a time like this is that 
there are still eight Canadian provinces who retain the services of 
RCMP officers for policing purposes.
<P>
	If the government could come up with some examples or if the 
parliamentary secretary were to rise in this House and say: ``Yes, 
but I would like to tell the hon. member about a police force in 
Canada that is excluded from the rights that some are asking for'', I 
would really be shaken. I will say that there is something wrong in 
my rationale, that my arguments were not convincing enough, that 
there is a lack of information. But it is not the case. Through you, 
Mr. Speaker, I challenge the parliamentary secretary, who I know is 
always looking for new challenges. I challenge him, before the 
Canadian people, to give us an example of a similar police force.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary will have to do his homework well, 
but if he can give us an example of another police force that is 
denied the right to collective bargaining and that does not belong to 
a union, I will be contrite. I will rise on a point of order and admit 
that I was wrong.
<P>
	But I know perfectly well that the parliamentary secretary will 
not find one such example because it is well known that this is a 
case of discrimination, that the RCMP is in a unique situation.
<P>
	In conclusion, you know that the government will embark on a 
review of part I of the Labour Code, that there will be a 
parliamentary committee on which I will sit, and I think we must 
use this debate to get the government to say that it is willing to give 
the RCMP the right to unionize and to bargain collectively to 
finally put an end to a flagrant and unacceptable case of 
discrimination.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the 
motion put before the House by the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	I am sure that the hon. member's motion is prompted by concern 
for the welfare and well-being of the membership of the RCMP-a 
concern that I can assure him I and our government share.
<P>
	We are only too aware of the RCMP's crucial role as Canada's 
national police service and of the need to support RCMP members 
in their professional duties and to ensure their personal welfare.
<P>
	For example, the government recently introduced Bill C-52 in 
this House. This amendment to the RCMP Superannuation Act will 
ensure that RCMP members serving outside Canada in ``special 
duty areas'' are automatically considered to be on duty 24 hours a 
day, and therefore will receive complete benefit coverage.
<P>
	The government introduced this bill because it realizes that 
RCMP members serving their country in a peacekeeping mission, 
in hazardous areas, should not have to worry about their own or 
their families' well-being. This is an example of the kind of 
practical and meaningful action this government is taking on behalf 
of the women and men of the RCMP.
<P>
	Through various initiatives, our government is committed to 
improving the safety and security of Canadians, and, at the same 
time, to helping the police, including the RCMP, do a better job. 
We want to ensure that the police have the tools they need to carry 
out their professional duties.
<P>
	Let me give you a few examples. We have instituted tougher 
measures for sex offenders who victimize children. We have 
created a national system for screening applicants for paid or 
volunteer positions where, once  again, work with children is 
involved. We have amended the Young Offenders Act to provide 
for tougher sentences. We have reformed the sentencing process to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5013"> 5013 </A></B>
<P>
ensure more consistency and to give greater emphasis to public 
safety and the needs of victims.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The safety and security of Canadians has been a priority of the 
government since it took office. I have given but a very few 
examples of its initiatives. However some people, such as the hon. 
member ask the question: Why has the government not made the 
unionization of the RCMP a priority? It is a fair question.
<P>
	The RCMP is our national police service and as such it operates 
national programs that are used by other law enforcement agencies 
and police forces in every part of the country. These are special 
services that no other police service in Canada can provide.
<P>
	I will give some examples as the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve asked me to do. The RCMP maintains 
the national crime computers, including the Canadian Police 
Information Centre that feeds into most other police forces and 
patrol cars in Canada. The RCMP runs the national forensic crime 
laboratories and provides forensic services, again to police 
jurisdictions throughout the country.
<P>
	The RCMP also operates the source witness protection program 
which can assist other police jurisdictions with the relocation of 
witnesses and sources throughout Canada. As we all know, Canada 
is a signatory to a number of international agreements and 
conventions and our international reputation depends on the RCMP 
providing never ending protection to embassies and diplomats 
across Canada.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	The RCMP provides protection for prominent people while 
visiting Canada, visiting heads of state and governments, the 
Governor General, supreme court justices and even the Parliament 
Hill area.
<P>
	The RCMP given its respected international reputation, has also 
been called on by the United Nations to provide civilian 
peacekeeping in various locations around the globe including the 
former Yugoslavia and Haiti.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Clearly, the RCMP is not just any police force. No other agency 
could provide all the services that I have just mentioned. Without 
exaggeration, a work action by the RCMP could become a matter 
of life or death.
<P>
	We place great importance on the safety of Canadians who rely 
on the services of the RCMP. That is not to say that the government 
ignores the rights of the RCMP membership. Far from it. The 
government realizes that, where a union does not exist to represent 
federal employees, then there is a special obligation to listen to  
those employees and to ensure that there is an effective system for 
addressing workplace issues.
<P>
	That is why the RCMP has a system of employee representation. 
This very progressive system is known as the Division Staff 
Relations Program. The backbone of the Div-Rep program, as it is 
known, are the 29 representatives elected by regular and civilian 
members of the RCMP. The Div-Reps regularly meet with division 
Commanding Officers and also, on a national basis, with the 
RCMP Commissioner to represent the membership.
<P>
	The informal nature of the Div-Rep program promotes access to 
the top management of the RCMP and even to the Solicitor 
General. If relations were dominated by a formal and legally 
binding collective agreement, I wonder if this kind of access could 
still continue.
<P>
	Many members strongly believe that the co-operative approach 
which the Div-Rep program offers has been highly effective in 
advancing the interests of the membership and in finding workable 
and practical solutions to the members' concerns. For example, the 
Div-Reps played a key role in securing new regulations which 
provide better occupational health and safety protection for 
members.
<P>
	The Div-Reps can also take credit for the successful constable 
reclassification initiative which was of particular importance in 
addressing pay level concerns of newer members. The initiative 
was successful, in part, because Div-Reps could take advantage of 
the present flexible system.
<P>
	The Div-Rep system allows the RCMP and the government to 
quickly manage resources to meet new pressures and needs. This 
type of timely response would be more difficult under a locked-in 
collective agreement. In short, the Div-Rep program works, and 
has worked for many years, efficiently and effectively.
<P>
	The motion put before this House by the hon. member is 
well-intentioned but it does not take into account the fact that the 
RCMP, in the Div-Rep program, has a proven system of 
representation. It is not clear why there is a need to tamper with a 
system that is already working well.
<P>
	The government will continue, as in the past, to support the 
RCMP in their duties and work with them to resolve workplace 
issues and, where possible, to improve working conditions.
<P>
	But we will bear in mind the unique nature of the Force and their 
crucial role in maintaining the safety and security of Canadians. It 
is for these reasons that we cannot support the motion before us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has put forth a motion that 
calls for the government to give RCMP officers the right to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5014"> 5014 </A></B>
<P>
unionize and to bargain  collectively under an act other than the 
Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	Of course, he claims to have the best interests of the members of 
the RCMP at heart, and perhaps we should accept that at face value.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	However, we would have to wonder if it is not just a small group 
of people with personal agendas who he is really out to represent 
today.
<P>
	We also have to wonder what the hon. member thinks the RCMP 
stands to gain from what he has proposed here today. He contends 
that his motion was a follow up to the Sims report. However, let me 
read what the recommendation actually states on page 50 of the 
report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government should undertake a process to determine the appropriateness of 
RCMP officers having the right to organize and to engage in collective bargaining 
under a statute separate from the Canada Labour Code. Such a process should 
consider the interests of the members of the RCMP, existing associations of 
members, management and the public.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let me say that the Reform Party supports the traditional role of 
the RCMP as a police force representative of and responsive to the 
population it serves in Canada's regions. The Reform Party also 
recognizes the right of workers to organize democratically, bargain 
collectively and to strike peacefully. However, there is an 
important distinction to be made between private and public sector 
collective bargaining.
<P>
	Strikes in the private sector of course may cause some 
inconvenience to the public but they are primarily a contest 
between the employer and the employees. The employer loses 
profits, the employees lose wages and both sides know that either a 
prolonged strike or a bad agreement could put the enterprise out of 
business and could put the employees out of jobs. Incentives exist 
for both sides to seek a settlement in good faith.
<P>
	The situation in the public sector is quite different. Because of 
the monopolistic nature of most public services like the RCMP, 
alternatives are not readily available in the marketplace.
<P>
	Is the hon. member, through his motion, proposing that the 
RCMP should be given the right to strike? He knows all too well 
that the aim of a public sector is to inconvenience or even endanger 
the public in the hope that citizens will persuade or pressure the 
public employer to give into the union's demands. He knows that 
governments usually do not lose money in a strike. In fact, they 
save money by not having to pay their employees' wages during 
the duration of the strike.
<P>
	Moreover, the member knows that the government plays two 
conflicting roles. It is not only a player in the collective bargaining 
process, it is also the supreme rule maker.
<P>
	As we have witnessed time and again in this House, the 
government ends public sector strikes by legislating workers back 
to work. Is that what the member would like to see happen? I rather 
doubt it.
<P>
	Members have heard me say repeatedly in the House that the 
Reform Party supports the final offer selection arbitration process 
when management impasses jeopardize health, safety or the 
national economy.
<P>
	Finally, often arbitration gives labour and management the tools 
to resolve their differences. Final offer selection does not favour 
one side over the other and it eliminates the need for government 
interference in the negotiations. It puts the onus on both sides to 
reach an agreement and it can be used equally by labour or 
management to provide a permanent, just and effective settlement.
<P>
	In preparation for this debate, I contacted members of the RCMP 
stationed in detachments throughout my constituency to find out 
what they thought about unions and the bargaining process. I found 
that there was zero support or enthusiasm for the creation of unions 
from within the ranks of the RCMP. I think that is a very important 
element to be considered in debating a bill of this type.
<P>
	Last year, when RCMP officers appeared before the 
subcommittee on government operations, they testified that out of 
the over 1,000 members in Manitoba, only 15 wanted to unionize. 
In British Columbia, 156 RCMP officers, out of a possible 4,600, 
attended a meeting organized by union proponents to discuss 
organizing and half of those 156 left the meeting before it ended.
<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
	There is a mechanism within the RCMP to deal with 
labour-management issues that is part of the RCMP Act 
regulations. The division staff relations representative program, or 
DSRR program, has been in place for 20 years and it enjoys the 
support of the vast majority of members of the force. The officers 
in each division across the country elect at least one full time 
representative and two part time representatives.
<P>
	The RCMP members serving in detachments throughout my 
constituency indicated to me that they are satisfied with this current 
arrangement.
<P>
	Since there is virtually no support in the RCMP for a union, the 
hon. member's motion seems to me somewhat unnecessary. His 
efforts and energies might be directed to other areas deserving of 
his immediate attention. He should be suggesting ways for the 
government to reduce the debt, eliminate the deficit, balance the 
budget, give taxpayers like those hard working members of the 
RCMP a tax break that they most certainly deserve.
<P>
	If the hon. member is concerned with the plight of the RCMP he 
would be willing to call for a tougher Young Offenders Act. I 
believe it would be very frustrating for an RCMP officer to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5015"> 5015 </A></B>
<P>
continually collar these people who are given a rap on the knuckles 
and then turned loose.
<P>
	The hon. member would be advocating a get tough on crime 
agenda like the zero tolerance policies the Reform Party is 
proposing. He would be calling for a referendum on capital 
punishment for first degree murder for those who kill police 
officers and find out if there is support, and I suggest there is, in 
Canada for exactly that, capital punishment for first degree murder.
<P>
	If the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve were really 
interested in the well-being of RCMP officers, he would focus on 
issues that are of concern to the members of the force, concerns 
that we hear when talking to the members of the force on a daily 
basis.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to the motion of the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	The issue of giving RCMP officers the right to unionize is not a 
new one. In fact, more recently, since my hon. friend went much 
further back in history, it goes back to the Gingras decision handed 
down in March 1994 which established that RCMP officers were 
entitled to the bilingualism bonus. To reach this conclusion, the 
Federal Court of Canada had to establish that RCMP officers were 
part of the public service.
<P>
	It is immediately clear what the consequences are of the ruling in 
the Gingras case: if RCMP officers are part of the public service, 
they are also subject to other legislation that governs members of 
the public service, and more specifically, the Canada Labour Code 
and part I of the Canada Labour Code, which confers the right to 
unionize.
<P>
	Of course the Gingras decision was not about the right to 
unionize, so the Federal Court of Canada did not have to rule 
specifically on that right. By inference, one can at least argue, since 
that is what is being argued today before the Quebec Court of 
Appeal, that RCMP officers have the right to unionize. An 
additional ground is based on the Canadian Charter of 1982, 
namely that the right of association includes the right to unionize. 
But we should let the courts rule on that issue.
<P>
	Meanwhile, what did the government do following the Gingras 
case? It could have very conveniently taken the case to the 
Supreme Court, something this government seems very fond of 
doing. But no, it did not. It tabled a bill in the House. This was Bill 
C-58, at the time, which, after the House was prorogued, was tabled 
again as Bill C-30.
<P>
	This bill is a declaratory bill. In other words, the government is 
acting like a court. It did not go to the Supreme Court to ask
<P>
whether RCMP officers are really part of the public service and 
subject to the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	No. The government is handing down the decision the Supreme 
Court might have handed down or the decision the government 
would have liked the Supreme Court to hand down.
<P>
	In the declaratory provision included in Bill C-58, which has 
become Bill C-30, the government is saying that, for greater 
certainty, RCMP officers are not part of the public service and 
therefore that the Canada Labour Code does not apply to them. 
Nice way to exclude them.
<P>
	What the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve said earlier is 
characteristic of what is going on in Canada. The RCMP operates 
and does a tremendous job at the federal level and in eight 
provinces.
<P>
	As a member of the government operations committee which 
reviewed Bill C-58, I can tell you however that there is a deep 
malaise within the RCMP. It seems to me that the present system of 
representation by divisional representatives is not working or 
working poorly. There appear to be at least two diverging views. 
On one hand, we have the RCMP command telling us that 
everything is working fine, and on the other, we have members and 
members' representatives telling us that it is not working. There 
are two sides to the coin.
<P>
	For my part, I have reasonable doubt that the system is not 
working; the RCMP commissioner who, to all intents and 
purposes, is a separate employer can send a dispute to arbitration 
and chose to abide or not by the adjudicator's decision.
<P>
	Listen, if I prosecute you in a civil court and win, you will have 
no choice, I will have the decision enforced. Willy nilly, you will 
have to abide by it. This is one element that is missing. If, in our 
society, one party in any civil suit could escape the application of a 
ruling against it, we would have a pretty strange judicial system.
<P>
	That is exactly the kind of system that members of the RCMP 
have to deal with. We do not want to force them into unionization. 
We want them to have the legal framework required so they may 
chose freely whether they want a union or not.
<P>
	Earlier, I heard my colleague, the member for Wetaskiwin, say 
that in his region, several officers told him they did not want to be 
unionized, that very few had attended the briefing meeting. This 
reminds me of Quebec, a long time ago, when unions were not very 
popular and when, if people were present at information sessions 
on unionization, a trustee or some other official would take down 
their names to be sure their contract would not be extended or they 
would be made to change schools if they were too vocal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5016"> 5016 </A></B>
<P>
	Clearly, there is no legislative framework which governs these 
things; no one can impose sanctions if an employer hampers the 
fair and usual process of  requesting union certification. It is quite 
easy to understand why the officers will not go to the meetings.
<P>
	But the best way to find out is to give them their legal 
framework, to apply to them Part I of the Canada Labour Code, 
with one major exception. Contrary to what was said earlier, 
contrary to what my good friend, the hon. member for Vaudreuil, 
was saying earlier, the right to strike was never requested in any 
way for officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; they are 
not asking it themselves.
<P>
	In a properly working society, with the exemplary work that 
RCMP officers do, this right, I believe, must not be recognized. But 
should we go for mandatory arbitration, a final offer? This is a 
system that can be discussed for a long time. But the right to strike 
must not be granted at that level, and neither for the Sûreté du 
Québec or the OPP in Ontario.
<P>
	They must have the right to free bargaining, to confronting ideas, 
to negotiating, to making compromises, to improving a climate. 
The climate must be improved, otherwise the pressure will build up 
and things will get out of hand in the RCMP. We will end up with a 
service in which things are as bad as with CSIS, where just about 
everything is rotten. We cannot get information, whether it is from 
the director of the service, or from the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee, which is supposed to monitor CSIS but rarely reports 
to us, particularly to the sub-committee on national security, on 
which I have the honour of sitting, along with the hon. member for 
Vaudreuil, whose riding may soon be called Vaudreuil-Soulanges. 
These are the reasons.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	The best way to solve the issue is to provide a legislative 
framework in which officers will be allowed to vote. Let them 
decide, through a vote, whether they want to unionize or not, 
whether they want to form an association.
<P>
	If the vote is negative but takes place within an appropriate 
legislative framework, it will be respected, just like the no vote was 
respected in Quebec, on October 30, 1995. If the vote is 
affirmative, it will be respected because the Canada Labour Code 
will apply. We do not want to force anyone to join a union, but the 
reverse should also be true, in that we should not prevent people 
who want to form a union from doing so.
<P>
	The best way to proceed-and that is what the hon. member for 
Vaudreuil is indicating and he would probably like to have another 
chance to speak to correct a few statements he made earlier, 
because I think the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has 
seriously shaken him, and when he gets an opportunity to do so he 
might change his mind. As for me I would be willing to let him 
change what he said if he wants to-but the best way to proceed 
would be to let people vote.
<P>
	As it will be for us in the next elections in the riding of Vaudreuil 
and in the riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, and probably in 
your riding too, Mr. Speaker, there will be several candidates, 
people will put an X beside a name and we will count up the votes. 
Everything is organized. Election officers, returning officers and 
clerks, are appointed, the system is there and working.
<P>
	People are not told in advance that they have to select this or that 
person to represent them. People make their decision. 
Fundamentally, let us apply to unionizing the electoral system that 
is applied in Canada.
<P>
	Let us ask the members of the RCMP if they want the Canada 
Labour Code applied or not. If they say no, the problem will be 
resolved to everyone's satisfaction. Some members claim that they 
do not want to form a trade union. If they say yes, then the Canada 
Labour Code will of course apply, but without the right to strike. I 
will not fight for the right to strike for policemen in Canada.
<P>
	One thing seemed strange to me. When I asked at RCMP 
headquarters, during consideration of Bill C-58 in committee, the 
only reason given to me for the opposition there to unionization 
was that RCMP officers do work not done by any other police force 
in Canada.
<P>
	I asked for examples. They said the protection of ambassadors. It 
is true. For example, here in Ottawa, the RCMP is responsible for 
the protection of ambassadors. I was told that it is also responsible, 
or is supposed to be responsible, for the safety of the Prime 
Minister's residence.
<P>
	It is also true that, in Toronto and Quebec City, two provincial 
capitals, the OPP and the Sûreté du Québec are responsible for the 
protection of the consular corps. The activities of the consulates are 
exactly the same as those of the embassies. So, if that is the only 
distinction, let the members of the RCMP be treated just like their 
colleagues of the Sûreté du Québec, the police of the Montreal 
Urban Community and the OPP. Let them enjoy the same benefits 
as their counterparts in the provinces and cities.
<P>
	I would even go farther. On the government operations 
committee, my colleague from Surrey-White Rock-South 
Langley put forward an amendment to Bill C-58 whereby part II of 
the Canada Labour Code would apply to the RCMP and give its 
members occupational health and safety protection. I was the only 
one to support her proposal, which was rejected by the three 
members of the government on the committee. Why should we 
refuse to give occupational health and safety protection to the 
members of the RCMP?
<P>
	That said, I will take my seat to allow my colleague who moved 
the motion to make a nice conclusion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
really do not get the picture when it comes to  the motion put 
forward by the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve or the 
support that the member for Bellechasse has given on his behalf 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5017"> 5017 </A></B>
<P>
and on behalf of the handful of RCMP members who would like to 
see a union. For the most part, I believe it is only Quebec members 
who seek a union for RCMP officers.
<P>
<B>(1855 )</B>
<P>
	I have a letter which was written to me a short time ago on 
request from RCMP representatives. I would like to read that letter 
because it explains the viewpoint of the approximately 16,000 
RCMP officers, apart from those the member 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is referring to who seek unionization.
<P>
	The letter represents the thinking of a group of representatives 
from 22 different divisions and districts within the RCMP across 
the country. It states:
<P>
	``I cannot emphasize enough that the members supporting 
unionization and/or associating with the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police are few in number when compared to the overall numbers of 
members serving in the force today. The spokespeople for these 
individuals reside primarily in Quebec and Ontario-''. Those 
seeking the unionization fall basically within those two provinces. 
``-with a small following in the lower mainland of British 
Columbia. They boast approximately 2,000 members of our some 
17,000 members nationally''. It is very small representation 
according to the member who has put the motion forward.
<P>
	``There is also some debate as to the accuracy of that figure, as 
some would argue that there are fewer than 2,000 presently paying 
dues to the various fledgling associations in Quebec, Ontario, 
British Columbia and the national capital region. Other attempts at 
starting up associations which support collective bargaining have 
failed in other provinces. In fact, member surveys conducted by our 
representatives in both Manitoba and New Brunswick have 
revealed only a relative few who support such a notion''. I believe 
that is supportive of what the member for Wetaskiwin pointed out 
earlier.
<P>
	``Our present system of employee representation is the division 
staff relations representative system (DSRR). The foundation of 
this process can be found at section 96 of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police Act regulations''. I am sure the member knows 
that.
<P>
	``Presently there are 28 representatives duly elected by the 
members from across Canada and one represented who we have 
elected internally to represent our interests in the area of 
compensation''.
<P>
	This letter is signed by some of those divisional representatives, 
but there are names of others who support the contents of the letter 
which appear here. They number 22 out of 28.
<P>
	``You will note on pages following this document that it bears the 
signatures of the representatives and a number of members 
represented by each representative''. Some have signed on behalf 
of those who actually do the representations. ``The overwhelming 
majority of those are opposed to the notions put forward by the 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. None of these gentlemen 
have been consulted in any way concerning this motion and 
notwithstanding any claim the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve may advance, there has been no 
consultative process conducted by the individual members who 
approached the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve to the rank 
and file membership of the force''.
<P>
	The member is dancing a jig and there is no music. Very few 
people within the rank and file are supporting the motion put 
forward.
<P>
	``You will hear from the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
that some of the individuals who have contacted him are also duly 
elected representatives''. The writers of the document 
acknowledge that. ``That is true. What is also true is that those duly 
elected representatives have likely failed themselves to consult 
with the majority of the very members whom they represent to 
obtain the mandate necessary for the actions they are taking. These 
are the very same representatives who have chosen to closely align 
themselves with the Canadian Police Association, CPA, who as you 
know is a lobby group who represent most unionized police 
departments in the country, which does not include the RCMP''. 
Their support comes from the CPA to continue this push.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	``Even if unionization were to be appropriate for the RCMP, 
open dialogue and input from all members would have to occur 
before any such action could be considered''. It is not coming from 
the membership at large but a handful of individuals out of the 
provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and some out of British

	That is the representation that seeks not to support this member's

not clearly researched it by those who have approached him and do

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was courteous in this debate and I 
never questioned anybody's intentions. I will not permit my 
colleague to question the quality of my research and my work, and 
I ask him to apologize for the unkind remarks he made about me.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think this is clearly a matter of debate 
between the member who is proposing the motion and the member 
who just spoke.
<P>
	The member who just spoke has one minute left to conclude his 
remarks, then the other member will have three minutes to respond.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is clear that union organizers have 
attempted to take over the RCMP. Their elections have failed to 
win the support of rank and file officers. Then without consulting 
rank and file officers in the field, these organizers came to this 
member to try to unionize through a motion put forward in 
Parliament. It is obvious there is not the support.
<P>
	This motion is ill conceived and there is very little support by 
rank and file officers for unionization in any form. I would say to 
the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve to leave well enough 
alone.
<P>
<B>(1905 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are approximately three minutes 
left. If the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve wishes to 
summarize and close the debate, there being no other speakers 
standing, he is entitled to do that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is unfortunate that the Reform Party was unable to speak 
on the essence of the motion but spoke only on the form of it, as is 
its detestable habit.
<P>
	I do not claim-and I want my Reform colleagues to be clear on 
this-that all RCMP workers supported this motion. What I say to 
my Reform friend, and I challenge  him to prove me wrong on this, 
is that there is a group of some 3,000 people who want a different 
representation system.
<P>
	One would have to be extremely obtuse and dull-witted to claim, 
as does the Reform member, that the people who want unionization 
and collective bargaining right do not represent anyone. Reform 
members should be a little more open and better informed. There is 
something structural there that has to do with their capacity for 
greater generosity. I have no illusion that all this will change.
<P>
	But essentially, I think we have the right as parliamentarians to 
speak up in this House without being falsely accused and say there 
is a labour relations problem, that there may be a number of 
solutions to this problem and that one of them might be the right to 
unionize without the right to strike.
<P>
	This must be very clear. None of the workers we are talking 
about here tonight has asked for the right to strike. These workers 
are well aware of the fact that, considering the nature of their 
functions, it would not be in the best interest of Canadians that they 
have the right to strike. What must be recognized is that peace in 
the work place will be achieved with a negotiated and debated 
document, approved by everyone and called a collective 
agreement.
<P>
	What is clear also is that the workers have the right to associate 
in a system other than the one that prevails. I am annoyed that this 
debate has given the Reform members the opportunity to make 
such detestable accusations.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for the consideration 
of Private Members' Business has now expired and the order is 
dropped from the Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
continue my speech, I shall, if I may, pay tribute to ex-Premier of 
Quebec Robert Bourassa, who died today.
<P>
	I arrived from Chile in Montreal with my family in 1974, when 
he headed the Quebec government. I had fled a dictatorship and 
immediately realized he was a great democrat, who showed a great 
deal of respect for dissenting opinions. He was also very open to 
ethnic communities. I want to pay tribute to his courage in politics 
and in dealing with his terrible illness. I also want to extend my 
condolences to the Bourassa family.

<P>
	On June 4 this year, I put a question to the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration about the government's plans to 
eliminate the citizenship rights of children born in Canada of 
parents who are not citizens. I said that a measure of this kind 
would be a direct attack on the children of claimants of refugee 
status or persons already recognized as refugees by Canada.
<P>
	In an interview published in the <I>Toronto Star</I> last May, the 
minister suggested that Canada might remove the automatic right 
to citizenship of children born on Canadian territory. This 
statement aroused a great deal of criticism, especially from the 
Canadian Council of Refugees. One hundred and eight 
organizations wrote to the minister to express their objections.
<P>
	These organizations included the Public Service Alliance of 
Canada, the Bureau de la Communauté chrétienne des Haïtiens de 
Montréal, the TCA, the Collectif des femmes immigrantes du 
Québec, the Canadian Action Committee on the Status of Women, 
the Canadian Labour Congress, the Canadian Jewish Congress, the 
Canadian Hispanic Congress, the Canadian Ethnocultural Council, 
the Canadian Arab Federation, the Jesuit Refugee Service, the 
Table de concertation de Montréal des organismes au service des 
réfugiés, the Vancouver Refugee Council, the Vigil Toronto 
Refugee Assistance Organization, and so forth.
<P>
	Under current legislation, except for the children of foreign 
diplomats, anyone born on Canadian soil automatically becomes a 
Canadian citizen. Most nations adhere to the jus soli or law of the 
soil principle and grant citizenship to anyone born within their 
borders. Most countries, including Canada, also recognize they 
have an obligation to reduce the number of stateless people.
<P>
	Until now, Canada has granted citizenship to the Canadian-born 
children of refugee claimants. The jus soli or law of the soil 
therefore represents a basic principle in the definition of 
citizenship in Canada and reflects the values of Canada and Quebec 
in this area.
<P>
	During the consultations carried out in 1994 by the Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, of which I am a 
vice-chairman, I asked departmental officials to provide us with 
statistics on the number of children born to persons who were not 
Canadian citizens. They were unable to give us exact figures. All 
they could say was that approximately 400 children were in this 
situation. The problem therefore is really not of such a magnitude 
as to require a legislative amendment and changes to a basic 
principle-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the hon. member's time 
has run out.
<P>
	The hon. parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration has the floor. 1910-3
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must admit 
the question of the member for Bourassa is a bit puzzling. He 
knows full well we are examining all aspects of the citizenship 
issue. This includes citizenship for children born in Canada.
<P>
	Furthermore, the hon. member knows this because he is on the 
Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, as he has just 
stated, and the committee recommended that children born in 
Canada should be Canadian citizens only if one or both of their 
parents is a permanent resident or Canadian citizen.
<P>
	I am particularly surprised that the hon. member is showing such 
concern over recommendation number 12 of the standing 
committee report, especially since there was no dissenting opinion 
on this particular recommendation from the Bloc Quebecois 
member of the committee when the report was submitted.
<P>
	It should be of no surprise to anyone, in particular a member of 
that committee, that the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
takes the standing committee's advice and opinions very seriously.
<P>
	The government, however, has made no final decisions 
regarding proposed amendments to current citizenship legislation. 
We are still in the process of reconciling issues brought forward 
from the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration and 
by the Canadian public. It is important that a consensus be reached 
on a number of issues.
<P>
	Let me assure all members of the House that when decisions are 
taken on these important issues they will be informed.
<P>
	Next year is the 50th anniversary of our citizenship. This will be 
a welcomed opportunity for everyone in this House and for 
Canadians across the country to celebrate the common bonds which 
unite us all. I know we are all eagerly anticipating this very special 
milestone in the life of our country.
<P>

House is deemed to have been adopted. The House stands 
adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow.
