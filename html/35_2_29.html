<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFHUMANRESOURCESDEVELOPMENTACT">DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES 
DEVELOPMENT ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from April 18 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-11, an act to establish the Department of Human 
Resources Development and to amend and repeal certain related 
acts, be read the third time and passed, and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak in the House this morning in support of the 
amendment by my colleague, the hon. member for Mercier, calling 
for nothing short of the withdrawal of Bill C-11.
<P>
	Need I remind members that the Liberal Party of Canada, 
faithful to the objectives established by its guru of the last decades, 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, took office in the House of Commons in 
October 1993 with the clear intention of giving government in 
Canada a more centralized structure. Right from the beginning, 
there was a major offensive action against the autonomy Quebec 
was aiming at.
<P>
	During the more than two years of the present administration, we 
have seen countless examples of this thrust towards centralization, 
bill after bill. Bill C-11, creating the Department of Human 
Resources Development, and arising from the reform of that 
department in June 1993, is yet another manifestation of the 
centralist intent of the federal Liberal government.
<P>
	Bill C-11 is but another step in the invasion, by the Liberal 
central government, of Quebec's jurisdictions in the area of social 
and economic development.
<P>
	Clauses 6 and 20 of that bill are extremely revealing about the 
federal government's will to limit the freedom of action of the 
Quebec National Assembly. Clause 6 defines the powers, duties 
and functions of the minister which now extend, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-to include all matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to the 
development of human resources of Canada-with the objective of enhancing 
employment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister is given considerable powers and will be free to act 
without the approval of the provinces, I repeat, without the 
approval of the provinces.
<P>
	In fact, this bill contains no provision on provincial jurisdiction, 
let alone on honouring this jurisdiction; on the contrary, it denies 
Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction over manpower training and 
development.
<P>
	Consensus has just been established once again, with a 
unanimous statement at the latest summit held in Quebec, a 
consensus of all parties: employers, unions, as well as the social 
and political communities. But they refuse to recognize it and thus 
fail to respect Quebec's dominion in an area of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction, that is, manpower training and development.
<P>
	Clause 20 lists the organizations with which the department may 
enter into agreements. It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>20. For the purpose of facilitating the formulation, co-ordination and 
implementation of any program or policy-the minister may enter into 
agreements with a province-, agencies of provinces, financial institutions and 
such other persons or bodies as the minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So the minister may put anyone he wants in charge of managing 
his department's policies and programs without having to justify 
himself in the House or worrying about the Quebec government's 
directives. And what are those directives? Nothing very 
complicated: the Government of Quebec has its own legislation, an 
act relating to the executive council of the Government of Quebec. 
And what does that mean? Allow me to review it for the Liberal 
government.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I believe I am waking up two or three hon. 
members. They are awake now, fine.
<P>
	The legislation on the executive council provides that only the 
government, through its intergovernmental affairs, can enter into 
agreements, make arrangements or establish programs on behalf of 
all agencies, municipalities, school boards and parapublic 
agencies.
<P>
	What is the Liberal government doing systematically in its 
legislation? It ignores the executive council act and the exclusive 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1696"> 1696 </A></B>
<P>
responsibility of the Government of Quebec for agreements outside 
of Quebec. Now, not only does the Liberal government 
systematically treat Quebec  lightly, but it does so explicitly in all 
its bills in a pernicious and vicious way and with total disregard for 
provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	The minister will have the power to enter into agreements with 
all local agencies and municipalities. And we all know there is a 
clear consensus among Quebec municipalities regarding a regional 
development strategy with the federal government and its secretary 
of state and bypassing the Quebec government. According to 
Quebec employment minister, Mrs. Louise Harel, this bill is the 
antithesis of the Quebec consensus on manpower policy, the 
antithesis of the single window concept.
<P>
	This bill prevents Quebec from implementing its own integrated 
social policy. On the other hand, the federal government is giving 
itself the legal basis to encroach on provincial jurisdictions 
whenever it feels like it, for example in the areas of childcare and 
manpower.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	As the official opposition critic for heritage and cultural 
industries, I cannot help but relate this bill to Bill C-53 establishing 
the Heritage and Cultural Industry Department. Both are extremely 
centralizing.
<P>
	In the area of communications, for instance, the action of federal 
government is unequivocal. The successive rulings of the Supreme 
Court of Canada on broadcasting in 1931, on cable television in 
1977 and on telecommunications in 1994 have given exclusive 
jurisdiction to Ottawa in those areas and thus have deprived 
Quebec of any prerogative in the area of communications.
<P>
	Here are a few examples of the federal government's tendency to 
centralize everything in this area. On February 27, 1992, with Bill 
C-62, the legislation on telecommunications, Ottawa announced its 
intention to pass new legislation in order to put in place a consistent 
policy for the entire country overseen by a single regulatory body. 
In this, however, it totally ignored Quebec's identity and legitimate 
aspirations of wide reaching autonomy because of its distinct 
nature.
<P>
	Another example of centralizing policy. On October 31, 1994, 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage said that the information 
highway should be controlled by the federal government, meet 
national objectives and promote Canadian culture. Quebec should 
be able to control the socio-economic and cultural issues relating to 
the information highway since the federal government did not 
share its strategy for the French content of the information 
highway.
<P>
	In setting up her cabinet on June 25, 1993, and I am talking about 
the Conservatives here, Prime Minister Kim Campbell created the 
Department of Canadian Heritage in order to promote a Canadian 
cultural identity based on Canada's foremost characteristics: its 
bilingualism and its multiculturalism.
<P>
	The federal government decided to combine under the authority 
of the Department of Canadian Heritage all areas, according to Bill 
C-53, which established the department, relating to Canada's 
identity, values, cultural development and heritage, thereby 
denying Quebec's true cultural identity. This department's mandate 
made no provision for the difference in Quebec's culture and so, as 
usual, Ottawa denied Quebec's cultural reality by melding it with 
Canada's cultural identity based on bilingualism and 
multiculturalism.
<P>
	In fact, all legislation concerning the major policies of the 
Liberal Party of Canada is extremely centralizing and continues to 
be expressed bill after bill. The Canadian federal system is a 
centralized political structure, and the Liberal Party is its master 
builder.
<P>
	Bill C-11, which establishes the Department of Human 
Resources Development, is nothing more than the logical 
conclusion of a long series of legislative measures aimed at 
denying the existence of Quebec and its ability to establish a 
legislative and institutional framework to suit its needs, its 
uniqueness and its aspirations.
<P>
	Bill C-76, legislation implementing certain provisions of the 
budget of February 1995, is another example of the Liberal 
government's efforts to negate the state of Quebec. I would remind 
you that, under this legislation, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is using savings realized from the reform of 
unemployment insurance to set up a human resource investment 
fund. This fund will be used for manpower training, among other 
things, and will therefore give the central government massive 
discretionary and centralizing powers over an area that is under 
Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction-education-thereby completely 
disregarding Quebec's policies in the area.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	Let us look at other examples. Interprovincial trade is another 
area in which the federal government likes to impose its 
centralizing vision. Bill C-88 shows the federal government's 
determination to act as judge and jury in interprovincial trade and 
to give itself, through this bill, a power of enforcement through 
orders it issues. Thus, it can extend the application of any federal 
legislation to the provinces, as stated in clause 9(1)(<I>c</I>), in other 
words, to exert control over its partners by declaring itself in all 
disputes the sole judge and jury able to decide.
<P>
	This unitary state attitude of a centralizing federal system is in 
contradiction with provincial identities and, as such, impedes the 
development of Quebec. This attitude is also reflected in Bill C-46 
establishing the Department of Industry. Its clause 8 states 
specifically that the Minister of Industry is responsible for regional 
economic development in Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
	This bill only goes to show that there is overlap with respect to 
regional economic development by confirming the federal industry 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1697"> 1697 </A></B>
<P>
department's right to interfere in an  area of jurisdiction over which 
Quebec has been demanding control for a long time.
<P>
	Bill C-91 to continue the Federal Business Development Bank 
under the name Business Development Bank of Canada is another 
example of centralizing federal legislation. Clauses 20 and 21 of 
this bill are totally unacceptable to Quebec. Clause 20 provides that 
the Business Development Bank ``may enter into agreements with, 
and act as agent for, any department or agency of the government 
of Canada or a province, for the provision of services or programs 
on their behalf''.
<P>
	This is another example of how, bill after bill, the government is 
invading provincial areas of jurisdiction, and going as far as 
stipulating in a piece of legislation how to do it, completely 
ignoring the legislation on Quebec's executive council where it is 
said that the Quebec government alone may enter into agreements 
and arrangements with governments outside Quebec on behalf of 
its own agencies, institutions, and municipalities.
<P>
	However, the federal government keeps turning a deaf ear, 
refusing to abide by the laws of Quebec. Bill after bill, it keeps on 
centralizing without any constitutional consultation. It claims it is 
decentralizing, it claims it is willing to talk to everybody, but 
quietly and slyly, one bill at a time, it is giving itself all the tools to 
centralize.
<P>
	Moreover, government members congratulate themselves for 
being open, flexible, ready to talk to anyone. But talks will not go 
very far, since with every new bill they become judge and jury, and 
can impose their own policies and legislation.
<P>
	Under this clause the Liberal federal government pursues its 
strategy of centralization, a political strategy the objective of which 
is, I remind you, to substantially restrict the Quebec government's 
ability to act in the area of economic development, ultimately 
preventing it from achieving political autonomy.
<P>
	The demagogic approach developed by the present Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, who claims that Canada is the most 
decentralized country in the world, is an insult to intelligence and 
reflects a bad faith which is a major impediment to finding a 
solution regarding Quebec's place in North America.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	In spite of the incessant pleas of the Quebec government to 
develop its own economic and social policies, the Liberal Party of 
Canada always said no and used every available legislative means 
to restrict the decision making power of Quebec National 
Assembly.
<P>
	The new Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs may very well 
claim that the Canadian federation is one of the most decentralized, 
but we are of the opinion that it is one of the most centralized in the 
world. This is why  2,308,266 Quebecers voted for sovereignty on 
October 30.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe you will find unanimous consent for the 
following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the vote previously scheduled to take place on Monday, April 22 be 
further deferred until Tuesday, April 23 at 5.30 p.m.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
altogether sad and happy to speak to this bill. I am happy, because I 
hope my speech will help to sink it into oblivion, and sad because it 
shows once again that the federal government has no clue how to 
interpret the results of the October 30 referendum.
<P>
	Bill C-96, which became Bill C-11, gives the Department of 
Human Resources Development new powers that it did not have 
previously. It was already inappropriate before the referendum and 
it is all the more so now. However it is almost the exact opposite of 
what was said in the last throne speech.
<P>
	Indeed, in the speech from the throne, the government was 
telling us very humbly: We intend to withdraw from the provinces' 
jurisdictions. Five or six areas were mentioned, forestry, recreation 
and manpower, to name but a few. We know what was behind the 
government's withdrawal in matters of manpower. It was probably 
a trick to save time.
<P>
	Despite this announcement in the speech from the throne, we 
were also told, among other things, that the federal government had 
no intention of interfering in areas of provincial jurisdiction 
without the consent of a majority of the provinces. Of course, 
Quebecers are perfectly aware, in this context, that it will be 
relatively easy for the federal government to get the consent of a 
majority of the provinces and that, most of the time, Quebec will 
lose out as a result of this throne speech promise.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Richmond-Wolfe, has explained 
very capably how the federal government has intruded upon 
provincial jurisdictions over the last few months. He described how 
this bill is another example of federal intrusion in Quebec's 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	I think it is impossible to improve this bill. That is why the 
member for Mercier asked that it be brought back to its starting 
point or at least that it be sent to the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development so that the committee can 
determine if anything can be done with it.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1698"> 1698 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	I agree that we should not increase the powers of the Department 
of Human Resources Development because, in the past, it has 
abused its powers. A case in point is unemployment insurance 
reform.
<P>
	In the throne speech, we were also told that the government 
would ensure the viability of social programs. So we have two 
commitments related to the subject at hand: first, the government 
will withdraw from the provincial areas of jurisdiction and they 
will not intrude on any others; second, it has committed to ensuring 
the viability of social programs.
<P>
	Then, what did the government announce in the throne speech? 
Among other things, a $7 billion cut in transfers to provinces. What 
will the impact of such a measure be? It will be remembered that 
the Canada health and social transfer covers health care, income 
security and post-secondary education. It is clear that by passing 
the deficit on to the provinces, the federal government will force 
them to make drastic and difficult decisions that will not 
necessarily be in the best interests of the population.
<P>
	I would like, however, to highlight the impact of those measures 
on post-secondary education, mainly at the university level. If 
provinces receive less for universities, the tuition fees will almost 
certainly go up.
<P>
	What will happen then? We have to try to find some kind of 
common thread in all this. If tuition fees increase, young people, in 
order to make ends meet, will try to get as many hours of paid work 
as possible.
<P>
	We seem to be forgetting about the society in which young 
people live. We live in a consumer society. We cannot ask young 
teenagers and young adults to live as if they were cloistered, as 
recluses, excluded from all economic activity. A recent study 
showed that, in Quebec alone, teenagers spend $1 billion on 
consumer goods.
<P>
	Some paternalistic people might say that if they are short of 
money they should refrain from spending. However, this would be 
hypocritical because, really, we have chosen a consumer society as 
our economic model. It means that the money that young people 
are spending fuels the economy. Therefore we cannot-and it 
would be stupid to do so-tell young people: ``If you do not have 
any money, just do not consume''.
<P>
	The increase in tuition fees means that young people will 
increasingly be looking for work. And if they do work more, we 
can forecast the consequences. I am a former school principal and I 
know what it means for young people to work more than 15 hours a 
week on top of their regular school work, which is their first 
priority. Already, in the last year of high school, where there are 
virtually no fees, almost half the students work, have paid 
employment to be able to fit into our consumer society and to 
purchase what they see advertised on TV and everywhere in the 
media.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	So, young people will work more, will have a little less time to 
spend on their studies, and we are entitled to think that their grades 
will suffer and that some of them will not pass. Because they have 
been unable to spend as much time as they should on their studies, 
college and university students will have to repeat some courses. In 
some cases, it will no doubt be more dramatic. They will probably 
have to also repeat a whole year, whether in high school, college or 
university.
<P>
	If we keep in mind that it costs about $10,000 to live while 
attending university, we realize how an increase in tuition fees is a 
short-sighted decision. For the federal government to reduce 
transfers to the provinces when this will result in an increase in 
tuition fees shows a lack of foresight. Eventually, we will have to 
pay a price for such measures, in terms of social costs.
<P>
	Not only will students be sometimes put in situations where they 
will fail some courses or have to repeat them, but we can also 
imagine that the need to work more hours will lead to some of them 
dropping out. Young people who can no longer invest enough time 
and energy in their studies will lose interest at some point. They 
will realize they are in over their head will drop out of school.
<P>
	Once again, we have an example of the hypocrisy of the society 
we live in. There are campaigns against dropping out, but at the 
same time, young people are put in a situation where they are 
obliged to reduce the time they spend on their studies. So, some 
have to drop out of the school system. To a large extent, it is bad 
political decisions that are leading systematically to dropping out 
and, more often than not, even though education comes under 
provincial jurisdiction, the problem is created at the federal level 
and transferred to the provincial level, and people are left with the 
impression that it is the provinces that are making bad decisions.
<P>
	The budget speech was pernicious, through the $7 billion in cuts 
to transfers to the provinces, but as if that were not enough, the 
federal government went further by saying, in a very hypocritical 
way: ``We will reform unemployment insurance''. It is not 
reforming unemployment insurance, it is destroying a system that 
workers and businesses have paid for from their own pockets, since 
the federal government no longer contributes in any way to the 
unemployment insurance fund. It has infiltrated a system put in 
place by employers and employees and is now busy wreaking 
havoc with it.
<P>
	I want to address three aspects of this government's destructive 
behaviour. If this reform ever sees the light of day despite all the 
demonstrations and protests in the maritimes, Quebec and else-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1699"> 1699 </A></B>
<P>
where, the government may be persuaded to soften the blow by 
these demonstrations, which cannot be anything but emotional 
because people feel affected in their daily lives, knowing the 
impact this reform will have on their living conditions, their 
children  and so on. It is therefore only normal for them to 
demonstrate vigorously against this bill.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	I wish to draw your attention to two measures in particular 
provided for in this bill. These two measures revolve around the 
same figure, $900 million. As members may recall, the 
government told us in the throne speech about its intention to 
ensure the viability of social programs. As far as I know, a country 
that creates social programs does not necessarily do so for the 
wealthy. Who needs social programs? The most vulnerable in our 
society, those in a precarious situation. But it is precisely these 
vulnerable people the government is targeting.
<P>
	The government tells us it will take $900 million away from 
seasonal employees, part time workers and, of course, the students 
I referred to earlier. It is trying to sell them the illusion that perhaps 
one day, if the context is just right, they may qualify for 
unemployment insurance benefits. No one really believes this 
given how hard it is to receive benefits and how high the eligibility 
thresholds have been raised. Not many people believe those 
workers in a precarious situation will ever qualify for benefits.
<P>
	Seasonal workers are being penalized. My colleagues on the 
human resources development committee have condemned this 
reform on numerous occasions, almost singlehandedly if I may say 
so, because of a lack of support from members who should have 
been more concerned about the rights of their constituents, be they 
from the NDP or the Reform Party-although it would be 
somewhat more surprising coming from that side. At any rate, I am 
convinced that, in the ridings represented by members of the 
Reform Party, there are workers whose jobs are not secure and who 
will be hurt by this bill.
<P>
	Unfortunately, only Bloc Quebecois members were courageous, 
strong and proud enough to stand up for the disadvantaged and for 
those whose work situation is precarious.
<P>
	I would like to say a few more words about students, as they are 
always on my mind because I was a school principal in a previous 
life. Students will be particularly hard hit by this reform. Naturally, 
the government assures us that, in the particular case of students, 
contributions made by those who did not earn $2,000 will be 
refunded. But we know that only in 25 per cent or so of the cases 
will contributions actually be refunded, because nearly 75 per cent 
of students will earn more than $2,000. Just try to live on less than 
$2,000 a year while attending university. It is obvious that the 
$2,000 limit is grossly underestimated and does not reflect the 
financial needs of students.
<P>
	As a result, businesses will see their payroll taxes increase. Last 
week, I treated myself to a meeting of the  human resources 
development committee, where witnesses from Manitoba were 
saying exactly the same thing as what employers from my riding 
had told me, namely that raising payroll taxes on small 
business-the people giving evidence were from the restaurant 
industry, which, as we know, is particularly vulnerable to 
competition-will have immediate and dramatic consequences.
<P>
	Employers required to pay higher unemployment insurance 
payroll taxes will necessarily be driven to consider reducing the 
work time they used to distribute among their part time employees.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Consequently, employees will undoubtedly be subjected to more 
pressure, they will have to give a higher performance to do the 
same work in fewer paid hours. So, when the government claims 
that the unemployment insurance reform will create part time jobs, 
it is indulging in wishful thinking, because it will rather do the 
opposite.
<P>
	If the Minister of Human Resources Development really listened 
to what employers have to say on the matter, he would realize that 
his dreams do not correspond to reality. The reform will decrease 
the number of jobs, part time jobs in particular, and workers will be 
overburdened.
<P>
	I will conclude now, because I realize that my time is running 
out. In my opinion, not only did the government wickedly impose a 
$900 million cut on the most insecure and poorest workers, but it is 
also taking $900 million from the poor to distribute to the rich.
<P>
	This is really what the government is doing when it says: 
``People will stop contributing for the part of their salary exceeding 
$39,000''. Previously, the maximum insurable earnings was 
$42,500, so lowering it to $39,000 will result in savings of $900 
million. This amount equals the one we mentioned before. In other 
words, the government takes from the poor to give to the rich. This 
bill is totally unfair, and we should not give more powers to a 
government which implements such a measure.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Speeches cannot exceed a maximum of

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay: </B>My speech today deals with third reading of 
Bill C-11, an act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development and to amend and repeal certain related acts, and with 
the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Mercier to 
withdraw this legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1700"> 1700 </A></B>
<P>
	For the benefit of our listeners, let me point out that this bill was 
debated at second reading during the first  session of this 35th 
Parliament. We resume the debate where we left it before the Prime 
Minister decided to prorogue Parliament, last January.
<P>
	First, a general comment must be made regarding this 
legislation. The government wants to change its administration and 
reduce its size and costs. This in itself is a laudable goal. 
Consequently, it merges, eliminates or creates new departments, 
which means that legislation is required to legalize the situation of 
several ministers and departments. Indeed, several ministers were 
sworn in under the former names of their department, not the new 
ones.
<P>
	I did an intellectual exercise which was meant to be objective, 
even though objectivity is always subjective. I examined certain 
documents dealing with this bill, I reread several speeches made in 
this House at second reading, when the bill was known as Bill 
C-96, and I took a look at a few letters and memos released by 
colleagues, organizations and ministers.
<P>
	What I noticed was a great deal of consistency. With his bill, the 
minister has managed, as have many ministers in this government, 
to unite everyone against him. Let us take a closer look at what 
some have said or written about this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	First and foremost, Quebec's employment minister who, on 
October 4, 1995, issued a communique indicating that the 
Government of Quebec was associating itself ``with its labour 
market partners to oppose the designs of Ottawa on the issue of 
manpower''. The minister was echoing the position taken by the 
board of directors of the Société québécoise de développement de 
la main-d'oeuvre, which includes major employer associations and 
unions, as well as representatives of the co-operative, community 
and academic world. That same morning, the corporation had 
issued a statement indicating its unanimous rejection of this piece 
of legislation. At that time, Mrs. Harel, the minister, wrote: ``This 
bill is the very opposite of the consensus on manpower in Quebec, 
the opposite of the single window principle. This proves that 
Ottawa is committed to continuing and even increasing its costly 
duplication and overlap in the area of manpower in Quebec''.
<P>
	The next day, October 5, 1995, the Canadian Institute of Adult 
Education also issued a press release, entitled: ``Bill C-96: Minister 
Axworthy's Blueprint for Society or How to Manage Without the 
Provinces''. Today, six months later, the institute could issue the 
same release except for two things: the bill has changed numbers 
and is now called Bill C-11, and the minister responsible now is the 
one who was then the transport minister, before the Prime Minister 
did a major cabinet shuffle last January.
<P>
	Here are a few excerpts from this press release which is still 
relevant today: ``This bill seriously undermines the equity principle 
governing the social security system in Canada and denies the 
exclusive jurisdiction of provinces over manpower training and 
development. With this bill, the federal government has 
demonstrated a blatant lack of respect for the aspirations of the 
provinces.-Clauses 6, 20 and 21 leave no doubt as to the 
centralizing designs of the federal government''.
<P>
	Two days later, on October 7, 1995, Henri Massé, then secretary 
general of the FTQ, a labour confederation representing nearly half 
a million workers in Quebec, signed a press release describing the 
dangers of federalism and urging the government to refrain from 
intruding into the field of manpower training in Quebec. The FTQ 
cautioned the federal government about any attempt to intervene in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction and to set up parallel structures.
<P>
	He went on to say: ``There is a strong consensus favouring 
Quebec's becoming solely responsible for policies on manpower 
adjustment and occupational training within its borders.-The 
Conseil du patronat itself agrees with the unions on this.-Even 
Robert Bourassa's Liberal government opposed a similar move by 
Ottawa in 1991''.
<P>
	Mr. Massé then pointed out that the bill will confer extensive 
powers to the minister who could always bypass the provinces. 
Finally, Mr. Massé concluded that: ``This bill leaves the door wide 
open for privatization and contracting-out of certain programs, 
including the unemployment insurance plan''.
<P>
	On November 28, the very same day that Bill C-96 was to be 
voted on in this House, the Minister of State for Joint Action, 
Minister of Employment and Minister of Immigration and Cultural 
Communities in the Parizeau government sent out yet another press 
release saying, and I quote: ``Bill C-96-now Bill C-11-is a fraud 
and it confirms the federal government's intentions to 
systematically bypass Quebec's jurisdiction and institutions to 
maintain, and even increase, duplication regarding manpower 
related measures in our province, under the guise of 
decentralization''.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	It goes on to say: ``Bill C-96 amounts to a flat rejection of the 
unanimous Quebec consensus to the effect that the federal 
government must completely withdraw from the manpower sector 
and give related budgets back to the province.- Ottawa's tactic 
was formally condemned by all labour market partners. Ottawa has 
confirmed it intends to pursue its centralist manpower policy and 
ignore the specific needs of the Quebec labour market, thus 
dismissing the consensus in Quebec on manpower issues which 
stresses the need to fight unemployment effectively by allowing for 
the differences in the various labour markets across Quebec  and

<P>
	So, based on these brief reactions and comments and since I do 
not have much time, I have come to the conclusion that, with this 
bill, the federal government is far from withdrawing from the 
manpower sector. On the contrary, it is getting more involved. And 
what worries me is that the minister in inconspicuously using this 
bill to give himself even greater powers at the expense of the 
provinces.
<P>
	The basic points of the bill are reflected in certain clauses. The 
powers, duties and functions of the minister are defined in clause 6, 
which stipulates:
<P>
6. The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to and include all 
matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to the development of the 
human resources of Canada not by law assigned to another Minister, department, 
board or agency of the Government of Canada, and are to be exercised with the 
objective of enhancing employment, encouraging equality and promoting social 
security.
<P>
	Under legislation now in force, the powers of the minister deal 
with the creation, implementation and organization of human 
resources in Canada, placement services, unemployment insurance 
and immigration.
<P>
	Since these parameters have been left out of the bill now before 
us, the phrase ``all matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction'' 
is most disquieting.
<P>
	Certain clauses give the minister the authority to entrust 
whomever he wants with the management of his department's 
policies and programs without having to discuss this with anybody, 
including Parliament.
<P>
	To conclude, this bill is a sinister manoeuver but the official 
opposition has not been taken in. With this bill, Ottawa wants to 
gain full control over the labour market policy and human 
resources development in Quebec. We say no to this bill, which is 
one more reason for Quebec to separate.

	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (for the Minister of Health)</B> moved that Bill 
C-18, an act to establish the Department of Health and to amend 
and repeal certain acts, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to speak today in 
support of Bill C-18.
<P>
	Health is one of the most fundamental areas of government 
activity in our time. It is as much a basis of our economic success 
as it is a basis for our social strength.
<P>
	Canadians have come to see Canada's approach to health issues 
as a valued example of the country's greatness. This bill will put 
the legal framework in place for us to keep moving forward as a 
modern department in a time of challenge.
<P>
	You will forgive me if I read like this. I guess I have reached the 
age where health is very important to me. I do not mean to make 
light of this but my arms are no longer long enough to read my 
notes. My pride nonetheless has not been just a product of vanity, 
but it is a product of Canada's record of accomplishment and 
achievement in the broad health domain.
<P>
	We have a health system that some of my colleagues opposite 
will recognize as the envy of the world. Yet we are at a time when 
people recognize the strains on the system and they are worried 
about the capacity of governments to meet the challenges these 
strains produce. Nonetheless what we have accomplished in this 
field shows the strength of the Canadian federation to address 
challenges. It shows the Constitution of Canada allows all 
governments to do what is right for the people of this land.
<P>
	I will spend a few minutes reflecting on the leadership role the 
Government of Canada has played in the development and 
evolution of health and health issues. After all it, is the actions of 
the federal government, together with the provincial and territorial 
governments, that have built the system. Each has had a role to play 
that has been tested as constitutionally sound, and each still has 
such a role.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1702"> 1702 </A></B>
<P>
	Speculating on what the Fathers of Confederation would have 
done if they could have looked into the future, it is kind of a 
parlour game currently in Ottawa. Would the Fathers of 
Confederation have drafted a constitution different from the one 
we currently have if they could have imagined today's health 
system and its costs?
<P>
	The Fathers of Confederation assigned responsibilities as best 
they could and set out some principles to guide them. Almost from 
the time the constitutional ink was dry governments, courts and 
citizens have been interpreting those responsibilities based on 
contemporary context, and that is the genius of our Constitution. It 
is not simple a document, words on paper, or a historical curiosity 
from an another era. It is a living part of the fabric of Canadian 
society.
<P>
	During the course of this debate some hon. members have cited 
various powers over health that our Constitution has assigned to 
provincial legislatures. They point to these and then claim the 
government has no right to work toward better health for 
Canadians. Can one imagine the absurdity of such a claim that the 
government has no right to take a leadership role? Can one expect 
an abandonment of responsibility? Obviously I disagree, as I think 
many of my colleagues on this of the House would.
<P>
	The Constitution does not assign health as a complete and 
distinct subject to either the provinces or to the Parliament of 
Canada. It is much broader and farseeing.
<P>
	It is certainly correct to note, though, there are provincial powers 
that relate to health. This is beyond debate. Sections 92(7), 92(13) 
and 92(16) of the Constitution deal mostly with hospitals, 
properties, civil rights and local matters. Section 92(2), which 
deals with local taxation and spending, would have extensions also 
for health implications.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary can 
continue his intervention after question period.

elimination of the $7.5 million grant that was paid annually to the 
tokamak project at the Canadian centre for magnetic fusion located 
in Varennes.
<P>
	By killing this research project on a new form of clean energy 
that creates jobs, the minister sacrifices 20 years of development 
work in the area of fusion, $70 million in infrastructure and about 
100 specialized jobs.
<P>
	The minister had the audacity to say in this House that about 25 
per cent of her department's investments in research and 
development were in Quebec. However, the union of professional 
scientists at the Institut de recherche en énergie du Québec tells us 
that, at the present time, the federal Department of Natural 
Resources and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited spend only 8 per 
cent of their energy research and development budget in Quebec. 
With the elimination of the tokamak project, this would fall to 6 per 
cent.

forward as a result of the search that was conducted under the 
auspices of the chief of defence staff.
<P>
	The Somalia liaison team of the department is cataloguing that 
and will report to the commission. The commission is satisfied that 
the report, combined with testimony that will be given in 
subsequent hearings, will get to the bottom of the documentation

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is high time the minister stopped mocking everyone. He 
has been sweet talking the House for the past two and a half years. 
Nobody believes him anymore. Enough is enough.
<P>
	Counsel made it clear this morning that gaps remained and 
documents were still missing. Would the minister explain why it 
takes so much effort and time and so many warnings and 
ultimatums for the department to deliver, bit by bit, some of the 
documents the commission of inquiry has repeatedly asked for? 
When exactly is the  minister finally going to assume his 
responsibilities, for once?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this minister 
and the government took its responsibility by setting up the 
Somalia commission specifically to deal with issues such as 
documentation.
<P>
	There were documents altered. There were documents 
destroyed. Was there a cover-up? These are the matters on which 
the inquiry will get to the bottom.
<P>
	What the commission asked us earlier in the week was to 
produce a cataloguing of the documents themselves. It said that 
they were dissatisfied at that point in time with the explanations of 
the department.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	I think some real progress has been made. It has been reflected in 
what the commission counsel has said this morning. I understand 
the commission counsel has said that the documents which have 
come forward and which are now being catalogued in the report by 
the Somalia liaison team together with testimony under the 
auspices of the mandate of the commission will get to the bottom of 
it and will address the specific question of the hon. member.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr.

were told last fall by a second officer, who confirmed the statement 
of Colonel Haswell, that the army chief of staff along with other 
officers developed a plan to change the name of documents 
requested under the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	As this new information considerably undermines the credibility 
of the minister and the chief of staff, why is the minister refusing to 
relieve General Boyle temporarily of his duties, at least for as long 
as it takes the commission of inquiry to thoroughly examine this 
whole sad affair and people to regain their trust in the army and the 
government?
<P>

that specific question were given earlier this week in replies to 
questions put forward by members of the Reform Party. I will not 
take very much time of the House to go into that except to say that 
we in this country believe in due process. Due process means that 
people have a right to give their views, their side of a story to 
defend themselves against accusations.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Finance confirmed that up to a 
billion dollars will be paid to the governments of the maritime 
provinces as compensation for their potential loss of tax receipts 
due to the process of harmonizing the GST and provincial taxes.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Why does 
negotiating the harmonization of the GST with the sales tax in the 
maritime provinces require all Quebecers and all Canadians to foot 
the bill for a portion of the consumer taxes currently assumed by 
the people of the maritimes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as 
I said yesterday in response to the hon. member's question, there is 
no announcement yet. We are currently negotiating. I shall be 
pleased, if the negotiations are successful, to answer specific 
questions on the agreement, if one is reached.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the hon. member will understand that I am going 
to defend the principle that the regions of this country must help 
each other. Otherwise, this would be a denial of such things as 
equalization, where three of this country's provinces help out the 
other seven.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister is mixing applies and oranges. If he wants to 
have an equalization formula with his new GST reform, let him say 
so. We are talking of two totally different things.
<P>
	The GST and the provincial sales tax have already been 
harmonized in Quebec. There was no negotiation on compensation. 
Do you know what kind of a message that sends to Quebec? That 
any time you co-operate with the federal government, you end up 
paying for it. If there is a $1 billion compensation payment to the 
maritime provinces, that means Quebecers will be paying $250 
million to the governments of the maritime provinces, to their 
treasuries, as compensation for those governments' lower tax 
receipts. Where is the logic in that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member's position is totally ridiculous, perhaps because of 
his lack of understanding of Canada. Canada is a country in which 
the regions help each other out.
<P>
	For example, if Canada decides to help out the aeronautical 
industry, Montreal will reap the benefit, not Saskatchewan or New 
Brunswick. Or, another example, if it decides to help out the 
pharmaceutical industry, as in  fact it has, Montreal will reap the 
benefit, not Alberta or Prince Edward Island.
<P>

assets and should place those assets at the service of the country as 
a whole.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The minister desperately wants Canadians to believe that the 
military brass did not try to cover up the Somalia scandal. He 
desperately wants us to believe that missing and altered documents 
were simply the result of computer error or clerical error. Twelve 
boxes of documents. That is what senior defence officials were 
forced to grudgingly turn over to the Somalia inquiry.
<P>
	The commission counsel announced this morning that there are 
still gaps. How much more evidence does the minister need before 
he takes some action, any action, on the Somalia cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

not reflect what was said this morning by the commission.

them.

	On the public affairs issue, those documents will be the subject

Mr. Speaker, the minister tries to make us believe that this was a 
timely delivery of documents when he knows full well that these 
documents should have been delivered a year ago to the Somalia 
commission.
<P>
	Along with the 12 boxes of information turned over to the 
inquiry, we also learned from Roberto Gonzales, a former director 
general of public affairs at DND, that General Boyle approved of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1708"> 1708 </A></B>
<P>
plan to hide important Somalia documents. This confirms earlier 
allegations made by Colonel Haswell who said that Boyle, de  
Chastelain and Mr. Robert Fowler knew of the planned cover-up.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm today that General Boyle had nothing 
whatsoever to do with the cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really should 
refuse to answer such innuendo. The hon. member has made 
selective accusations every day in the House. He has maligned a 
public servant, who is the chief of defence staff.
<P>
	All of these matters will be dealt with by the commission 
starting next Wednesday. That is the place where all the evidence 
should be submitted. That is the place where people should be 
heard. That is the place where conclusions should be drawn.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, why will the minister not show some leadership and 
take the bull by the horns instead of dragging the bull into the 
House each and every day?
<P>
	General Boyle said he had no knowledge of a plan to alter, 
rename and destroy documents related to the Somalia affair. 
Colonel Haswell and Roberto Gonzales say that is not true. They 
say that all Somalia information requests had to be approved by 
General Boyle. Boyle's signature even appears-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member will please put his question 
directly.

cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member can be assured that I certainly have taken the bull by the 
horns. I have done that by answering his questions all week.
<P>
	The hon. member has gone through a number of contortions. I 
have pointed them out on the utility of the inquiry.
<P>
	The hon. member has gone from the position that the chief of

aside, and to the fact yesterday that he does not blame him. Today

intentions will materialize with respect to the issue of nuclear 
fusion.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Since we started asking the natural resources minister questions 
on the tokamak project, she has been giving us rubbish for answers. 
For instance, she said that in Quebec the loss of this project would 
be balanced by the manufacturing and sale of Candu reactors, 
which is false, since this will benefit mainly New Brunswick and 
Ontario.
<P>
	Moreover she told us that Quebec is getting 25 per cent of her 
department's expenditures. We checked, the actual figure is 8 per 
cent, and it will fall below 6 per cent with the cancellation of the 
tokamak project.
<P>
	Can the federal government bring its Minister of Natural 
Resources back to her right mind and make sure that Quebec is no

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.): </B>Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the finance minister had a little problem with his throat. I hope it 
has cleared up today. My question is directed to him.
<P>
	He said yesterday that harmonization will lead to a better tax for 
consumers and for small business. How can that be, given that the 
combined tax increases taxes by 8 per cent on goods and services in 
areas that were untaxed before, areas like children's textbooks, 
wheelchairs and medical supplies, just to name a few?
<P>
	The finance minister is willing to spend a billion dollars from the 
federal coffers to compensate three Liberal provinces for any lost 
revenues. Who will compensate the taxpayers of these provinces 
for their extra personal costs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member ought to know that the fundamental problem with 
most of the provincial sales taxes is that they are embedded in the 
price at each successive stage. Therefore the consumer pays a great 
deal more in tax under most provincial sales taxes than under the 
GST. The net result of this will be a lowering of the tax on all of 
those items that are currently taxed under provincial taxes.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if that is 
the case, then why are all the provinces saying there are lost 
revenues?
<P>
	The finance minister is wreaking havoc in the Atlantic provinces 
with his bad harmonization tax. It is putting Prince Edward Island 
at a competitive disadvantage. Conservative provincial 
governments have said no. NDP provincial governments have said 
no. Only three Liberal provincial governments have said yes, 
thanks to a billion dollar bribe just to keep the deputy minister 
around a little longer.
<P>
	Why does the finance minister not do the right thing and for the 
sake of all Canadians get rid of, abolish, kill, eliminate, scrap and 
agree to quit if he does not, this monster he is creating called 
harmonization with compensation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
one of the principles upon which this country has been built is that 
one region of the country helps another whether it be through 
equalization, the social transfer or the way in which stabilization 
payments are made by the federal government to help provincial 
governments that have had difficulty.
<P>
	I find it very difficult to hear members of the opposition, 
whether they be from the Bloc Quebecois or the Reform Party, 
essentially say that certain regions of the country should not help 
the others when there is a process of adjustment. I do not share that 
view. This is one country and one country in a multitude of others.

Fishermen are being told to sell their licences back before the 
government discloses what the fish harvest quota will be.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>

	Fishermen cannot possibly make a rational decision about 
whether to get out of business when they are not being told how 
many fish they will be able to catch. This is more than absurd, it is 
an insult.
<P>
	On behalf of fishermen whose livelihoods are at stake, will the 
minister delay the buy back until the fishermen know the future of 
fish quotas in British Columbia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I could give a short answer but I know the hon. 
member is sensitive to the needs and concerns of commercial 
fishermen.
<P>
	This program is designed to address the very sad state of the 
salmon fishery in British Columbia. I know he is aware of that. It is 
also designed in such a manner that although it is tough medicine 
and a bold program, it has to address in a very specific manner the 
reduction of the capacity, which everybody agrees is the problem in 
the industry.
<P>
	Nobody has been told to return their licences. This is a voluntary 
program which has been championed by the industry. We believe 
the program will work. I certainly would appreciate the hon.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps the 
minister is not aware that there was a delegation of people here 
from British Columbia yesterday representing half a million 
commercial fishermen, people in small communities who do not 
agree with his plan.
<P>
	When I asked him the other day if he would set quotas before 
implementing the buy back he said ``regrettably not.'' What is 
regrettable is the total disregard the government and the minister 
continually show for the fishermen on the west coast.
<P>
	The minister has the power to delay the buy back until the quotas 
are set. Why he is refusing to do so I do not know. Why is he 
refusing to ensure the stability of the industry and the stable 
income of families that depend on the fishery?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, not to set a fine point on this, I want to make sure the 
hon. member knows and the House realizes that it is 500,000 
people in the communities. The number of commercial fishermen, 
including workers in the plants, is 20,000. I am sure he would not 
want to leave that impression.

	The parliamentary secretary met with these concerned groups 
yesterday. It is my intention to meet with them after question 
period to hear their concerns.

minister of fisheries is about to impose.
<P>
	Quebec's Minister of Transportation and the seven mayors of the

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that C-18, an act 
to establish the Department of Health and to amend and repeal 
certain acts, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary had the 
floor and if he wishes he is entitled to speak for another 36 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know why you would want to 
limit me. We are talking about something that is fundamental to the 
Canadian health system. We are talking about responsibility, 
jurisdiction and accountability.
<P>
	To reframe everything for everyone's edification, when the 
debate was interrupted by question period I was talking about 
jurisdiction in the Constitution of Canada. I was looking at why and 
how it was flexible and why and how the role of the federal 
government has evolved and continues to evolve under those 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	When interrupted I was making reference to section 92. 
Canada's Constitution does not begin and end with section 92. That 
is most particularly true in the field of health. Very briefly, let me 
describe what that means.
<P>
	I see my esteemed colleague has joined the ranks of the House. 
He is listening very attentively so that I make all of the appropriate 
references under the Constitution. I refer to the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs who is a constitutional expert. I look 
forward to his applauding my references.
<P>
	Section 91(27) gives the Parliament of Canada exclusive 
jurisdiction over criminal law, the basis for a number of laws 
protecting public health and safety. Section 91(2) assigns 
responsibilities to the federal government for international and 
interprovincial trade. This forms the basis for federal regulations 
on drugs and medical devices, as an example.
<P>
	Section 91(11) gives the federal Parliament explicit power over 
quarantine and marine hospitals, which I would add, reveals a good 
deal of the thinking back in 1867 about where matters cease to be 
local and begin to take on national significance.
<P>
	Section 91(7) concerns military and veterans. Section 91(8) has 
to do with the federal public service and section 91(4) concerns 
aboriginals and lands reserved to aboriginals.
<P>
	Every one of these powers establishes or implies a clear federal 
role in health issues. They account for the considerable array of the 
duties and responsibilities set out in clause 4 of Bill C-18.
<P>
	Moreover, they account for the vast majority of Health Canada's 
operating expenses. Health, when viewed from a perspective of 
federal constitutional responsibilities, is clearly a good deal 
broader than the health care delivered. It is a comprehensive view 
and has been for many years.
<P>
	This is where other federal powers have come into play. Much 
has been made in the course of debate of the federal spending 
power. That is specified in section 91(1A) of the Constitution. 
Much has been made of the power to raise money by any mode of 
taxation for which there is provision in section 91(3).
<P>
	However, do these powers broaden the sphere of federal 
regulation? Do they offer the opportunity for jurisdiction by 
stealth, as it were? The reality is that nothing in the Constitution 
gives the federal Parliament the means to regulate provincial 
matters in the guise of spending powers. I think my hon. colleague 
would agree. It can attach conditions to the funds it makes 
available to the provinces. However, just as it cannot compel the 
provinces to accept the funds it offers, neither does it buy 
jurisdiction when provinces accept those funds.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	Clause 12 of Bill C-18 makes this limitation clear. It continues a 
point that was made in the existing Department of National Health 
and Welfare Act:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>12. Nothing in this Act or the regulations authorizes the Minister or any 
officer or employee of the Department to exercise any jurisdiction or control 
over any health authority operating under the laws of any province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is why the Canada Health Act does not forbid user fees, if I 
can conjure up the term, nor does it require provincial legislatures 
to forbid them. I ask members to take careful note of the language 
being used. It simply makes it clear that any province that decides 
to finance medically necessary health services with user fees can 
expect a corresponding reduction in federal funding. They cannot 
have it both ways. The government is not obliged as a federal entity 
to spend money where it has a fundamental objection. This brings 
me to another myth, that is, the federal government is intruding in 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	It has been a constant theme in opposition commentary at almost 
every stage of the debate so far. Both opposition parties have made 
common cause in their belief that the best government in Ottawa is 
no government in Ottawa.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1718"> 1718 </A></B>
<P>
	That is difficult to understand from members who get 
themselves elected to come to Parliament to represent the national 
interest. The motivation for the federal government's involvement 
in health financing does not  derive from any desire to centralize 
powers. No one here has a wish to invade a field of purely 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The federal role in health has been an exercise of leadership. 
There are those who would hold that leadership is not a word that is 
acceptable. Some of my colleagues opposite might think it is even 
a dirty word today. Some believe it to be a power grab. We should 
never apologize for saying that federal leadership in health is a 
commitment that Canadians expect and want exercised. I dare say 
that examples of that leadership abound.
<P>
	We based our commitments on health to Canadians during the 
1993 election campaign in a belief that when there are national 
needs, we need national action. It was part of our platform as a 
party and part of our platform as a government. It was the basis of 
programs outlined in the red book commitments. It continues to be 
the basis of action since. I would like to cite an example.
<P>
	The Minister of Health has announced a leadership initiative in 
the blood system. A question came up today in question period. 
The government understands that the blood system needs to be 
restructured. Rebuilding the system is appropriate and right for the 
government to pursue in partnership with other systems.
<P>
	When we recognize that, we give ample evidence of the kind of 
leadership role that the government has been exercising. A 
restructured system can only enhance the government's current 
efforts as a regulator to ensure safety and quality of the blood 
supply.
<P>
	It is essential, I might add, as the minister underscored in 
question period, to act now and to begin the process before Justice 
Krever and his inquiry makes the final recommendations. There is 
no need to wait. The final report will not be ignored. It will be 
looked at as a building block of the new system.
<P>
	Let me offer another example, if I may, of the kind of leadership 
Canadians want and support. In July 1994, some 18 months ago, 
the then Minister of Health, announced the Canada prenatal 
nutrition program. The program is helping to support other 
programs for pregnant women who have a high risk of delivering 
low birth weight babies. Members probably want to know why that 
is important. These programs provide food supplementation, 
nutrition, lifestyle counselling and information to such women.
<P>
	The government designed this program to dovetail with existing 
provincial initiatives to encourage them where they do not now 
exist. Much of the program in the red book was based on building 
partnerships, not stimulating competition, at least in the area of 
government services. It was not designed to duplicate good 
programs that were already in place or to override them.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	It should be noted that it could cost up to $60,000 to meet the 
health needs of just one low birth weight baby. That is just the 
immediate financial cost. The price in developmental delays that 
can echo through the lifetime of such an individual, family and 
society are incalculable. These children start life well behind 
others. Many, unfortunately never catch up.
<P>
	When you realize that 21,000 such babies are born each year, 
you begin to get an appreciation of the sheer magnitude of the 
problems being addressed by that program.
<P>
	To hear some during the course of this debate, the federal 
government should just stick to its knitting and stay out of issues 
such as this. They seem to suggest that if there is no need for 
leadership, perhaps some provincial government may take action. 
If less affluent provinces cannot afford to take action, it is just one 
of those things, c'est la vie, as they say en français. That is their 
stand. It is not ours.
<P>
	We have looked at the facts and the needs and we have taken 
action. Canadians will not buy limp excuses for inaction from my 
colleagues opposite, not for one second. They know that leadership 
does not involve the use of the word perhaps or the word may. They 
recognize that leadership is about seeing what needs to be done and 
finding the best way to do it.
<P>
	Of course, the defining example of federal leadership in health 
has been our staunch defence of the principles of the Canada Health 
Act. The Minister of Health has been clear in his stand. He has said 
that he will debate the principles of the Canada Health Act with 
anyone, anywhere, at any time. One thing should be clear to all 
colleagues. Although the five principles may be debatable, they are 
not negotiable.
<P>
	The government has never claimed that it wants to tell the 
provinces how to run their health systems. However, it does claim a 
nation building role of setting values that Canadians share no 
matter where they live.
<P>
	It is equally clear that Canadians trust the government to defend 
those values. Canadians will not support the whittling away of the 
principles of medicare which some provinces have attempted. 
Canadians are clearly supportive of the federal government in its 
resolve to stand by those principles. Clearly, they do not accept 
such thin rationale, including the ones trotted out here by the 
opposition parties which pretend to support the principles of 
medicare while permitting their decline and erosion.
<P>
	Leadership means taking a stand on fundamental issues. 
Medicare is one of those issues. I dare say that Canadians are happy 
of it.
<P>
	Let us put the leadership issue into context. There is a real world 
of relations between the federal government  and the provinces. It 
is not one of differences but one of co-operation. The leadership the 
government exercises in the field of health does not come from the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1719"> 1719 </A></B>
<P>
barricades. It comes from a long tradition of commitment to the 
health of Canadians. That commitment is shared by the provinces 
and the territories.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	It is something that cannot be reflected in a written Constitution. 
It does not appear in the media obsession of conflict and tough 
talking sound bites, in five-second clips; yet it is a reality, day in 
and day out.
<P>
	For us to achieve our health goals for Canadians, the federal 
government needs to work with provincial and territorial 
governments, and so we do. All governments need to work with 
health professionals and administrators, interested organizations 
and others with a contribution toward better health for Canadians. 
Once again, we do.
<P>
	That co-operation takes place in so many ways. For example, we 
have 12 distinct but interlocking systems of health care in Canada. 
At a time when some are questioning the merits of federalism, it 
says a lot that governments have worked together so well that 
Canadians look at twelve systems and see only one.
<P>
	They see medicare as a national program even if it consists of 12 
different provincial and territorial health insurance plans. One 
reason for that almost seamless approach to health in Canada is the 
constant process of consultation and co-ordination that goes on.
<P>
	One of the important vehicles we have is the conference of 
federal, provincial and territorial ministers of health. This forum 
allows governments to work together on research, policy 
development and practical issues.
<P>
	This process of co-ordination allows governments to compare 
notes on the big issues that affect all of them. Consider health 
system renewal. We have clearly moved passed the time when the 
nips and tucks to the status quo will do. The issues are moving too 
fast for us to tinker with old approaches and the old paradigms in 
many cases.
<P>
	Consider the broad issues. We have an aging population, which 
is already creating important implications for how we structure and 
how we deliver care. We have health inequalities that face the poor, 
rural dwellers, aboriginal people and women. We have a group of 
issues which speaks to how the health system works; cost control, 
the supply and distribution of physicians and the respective roles of 
all health professionals and need analysis.
<P>
	The balance between institutional and community based care 
and the appropriateness and intensity of care are significant 
concerns. They all need good answers.
<P>
	Leadership means thinking through these issues and their 
implications for the health of Canadians in a comprehensive and 
intelligent manner. The federal government has taken a leading role 
in these efforts through initiatives such as the national forum on 
health.
<P>
	The federal government has never claimed sole ownership of 
this issue. We have recognized the impressive work of the 
provinces and the territories because they too exercise leadership. 
Within health care every province and territory has taken 
innovative reform and renewal actions. We have made clear our 
belief that we can learn from each other.
<P>
	We can all contribute to addressing common priorities. Some are 
as basic, as the research into clinical practice guidelines. It is hard 
to believe but we have no firm idea how effective some common 
medical practices are in terms of either costs or results. This is an 
affliction for all western societies. Governments are working 
together to address issues such as this, but it is something 
governments alone can do.
<P>
	For example, we worked with health professionals and other 
interested people in organizations. They are experts as well as users 
of the system with a stake in finding the answers. They continue 
this in many other areas of research, health, policy and program 
delivery.
<P>
	Federal leadership in health is not about loud claims of moral 
power or of playing the constitutional trump cards. The legacy of 
leadership is not a hollow relic of the days when government 
coffers were bursting. It is a living tradition of looking out for the 
interests of all Canadians. It is a living tradition of seeing the gaps 
that affect the health of our citizens and in doing something to meet 
the need.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	In a previous item of legislation, the old Bill C-91, there was 
some reaction to whether the Minister of Health would assume the 
responsibilities and would be held accountable for all of his 
responsibilities. Even though there was no question in our minds, 
we had a good representation by the hon. member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury who presented an amendment to 
eliminate all confusions. It was widely received by all members on 
both sides of the House and passed unanimously.
<P>
	That is what we mean by looking at leadership. Leadership can 
mean action by this government alone but so often these days it 
means contributing to shared work. It is a form of leadership the 
government still believes to be absolutely important. It is one that 
Bill C-18 permits us to carry out.
<P>
	I hope all members of the House will reflect on that carefully and 
give it resounding unanimous support.
<P>

<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise in this debate on Bill C-18, given that I am a new member of 
the Standing Committee on Health. I have just come from the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development where, 
today, discussions were continuing on the bill establishing the 
Department of Human Resources Development. In my first speech 
on health, I have to recognize that the debate is of the same type.
<P>
	Unfortunately, Quebecers' health care system is not entirely the 
product of political decisions and choices made in Quebec. The 
federal government has meddled in Quebec's affairs on a number 
of occasions. We must remember that the Constitution establishes 
health as a provincial matter.
<P>
	To begin with, it should be remembered that the Quebec health 
care system existed long before the federal government intervened. 
The Government of Quebec set up the system and has always 
ensured its smooth operation. There are those who will claim that 
socialized health care was developed in Ottawa, but that is not the 
case.
<P>
	The federal government simply passed the legislation justifying 
and providing the means for seizure of provincial jurisdictions. 
Every intrusion by the federal government through its legislation 
has brought a reaffirmation from the Quebec government of its 
control over and desire to exercise its jurisdiction over health care.
<P>
	In 1987, Thomas Dupéré, of the Commission d'enquête sur les 
services de santé et les services sociaux du Québec, wrote that the 
implementation of federal programs had simply moved to the 
federal arena a debate which had begun at the provincial level and 
would have led to the same results in the same time span.
<P>
	Intrusions started in 1943, when the Federal Department of 
Health established a national action plan on medicare. In 1945, it 
even proposed the implementation of a national program under full 
federal jurisdiction. And the federal government had the resources 
to realize its ambitions.
<P>
	I have some difficulty concentrating on my speech because of 
the noise around me. Now, that is better.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	So, from 1942 to 1947, Ottawa received more than $2 billion 
from Quebec which in return got only $100 million, in other words 
a pitance.
<P>
	It is very clear that the federal government wanted to go even 
further in its determination to control and to give back to the 
provinces, not the tax powers they had before the war, but subsidies 
tied to the implementation of programs set up by the Government 
of Canada. That is what happened.
<P>
	This was the beginning of a long centralization campaign by the 
federal government. In reaction, the provincial government of 
Quebec created its own income tax, Ottawa having refused to 
withdraw. Thus was born dual taxation from Quebec and Ottawa.
<P>
	Successive Quebec premiers-among them Maurice Duplessis, 
with his famous slogan ``Give us back our due'', Jean Lesage and 
Daniel Johnson Senior-constantly tried to thwart this intrusion 
from the federal government and this seizure of some of the 
provincial financial powers.
<P>
	This is how the federal government took upon itself the 
responsibility to finance, to some extent, the cost of health care and 
services. In so doing, it also grabbed the power to oversee the 
development and administration of the health care systems 
established by provincial governments.
<P>
	Provinces wanted to improve their systems, but they had to 
organize and finance them at a time when they had just been 
stripped of some tax fields. As a result, they had to beg money from 
Ottawa. It is still the same today. The federal government may 
launch new ideas, but the provinces must find the money to fund 
them.
<P>
	Let us turn to constitutional powers.
<P>
	The federal government has violated the Constitution of Canada 
and still does so today. This is why the Prime Minister does not 
want to discuss the Constitution. He wants to proceed without 
discussing it.
<P>
	However, the government itself admits that health and welfare 
are areas of provincial jurisdiction. Consequently, the ever growing 
federal structures and programs in these fields constitute a form of 
interference which periodically sours federal-provincial relations.
<P>
	More precisely, the Constitution Act of 1867 gives the provinces 
complete authority in matters of health, and section 92.7 gives the 
provinces jurisdiction over the whole field of health and welfare. It 
is in the Constitution.
<P>
	In order to bypass what was perfectly clear in the Constitution, 
the federal government invented a roundabout way to interfere and 
called it its spending power.
<P>
	The federal government cannot interfere directly in areas of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction. So, it uses an indirect 
mechanism. It gives provincial governments grants with strings 
attached; the provinces must abide by certain conditions for fear of 
losing these contributions.
<P>
	Instead of using its lawmaking power, the federal government 
uses its spending power in areas of provincial jurisdiction. In our 
opinion, it amounts to financial blackmail using our own tax 
money.
<P>
	In addition to this manufactured power, the federal government 
is using some legislative powers which should be limited in scope. 
A case in point is legislation  derived from the criminal law such as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1721"> 1721 </A></B>
<P>
the Food and Drugs Act, and the Narcotic Control Act. The 
government provides services to or pays for the medical expenses 
of specific clients such as military personnel, RCMP officers, 
inmates, natives, immigrants and refugees. The federal government 
tries to increase its responsibilities and to look important by 
passing legislation in all these minor areas.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Moreover, the federal government sometimes justifies its 
interference in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, invoking 
an ill-defined concept interpreted in a very broad sense, that of 
national interest.
<P>
	Managing the Department of Health and all the small programs 
we described earlier which come under Ottawa's responsibility 
uses up only a small part of the budget, but constitutes the bulk of 
the administrative activities of the Department of Health. Without 
federal interference in areas of provincial jurisdiction, the 
department would be small and would only manage residual 
federal powers.
<P>
	In fact, the largest part of federal expenditures is comprised of 
amounts paid to provinces through transfer programs. The federal 
government gives back with one hand part of what it took from 
provinces with the other. This is an example of very costly 
duplication which sustains the conflictual situation with the 
provinces and exists only because Ottawa is proud to be the one to 
sign the cheques. Meanwhile, there is less money for health.
<P>
	Let us see how this money is distributed to the provinces. In 
theory, the Canada Health Act passed adopted in 1984 establishes 
the conditions for the allocation of federal grants in the health area. 
In fact though, these contributions are paid pursuant to the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements and Federal 
Post-Secondary Education and Health Contributions Act, what we 
now call established programs financing. Transfers to provinces do 
not come from the health department's budget, they are made by 
the Department of Finance.
<P>
	This creates a bizarre situation where the Department of Health 
establishes national objectives and standards that provinces must 
abide by if they want to receive transfer payments, but the finance 
minister is the one distributing the money and determining the 
amounts. That mechanism makes a financial issue out of one which 
concerns only federal-provincial arrangements in the health area. 
In reality, the health minister is virtually a minister without 
portfolio as for the majority of the federal health budget.
<P>
	This splitting of authority between the establishment of 
standards and financing results in a lack of cohesion between the 
development of the health policy and its implementation. On the 
one hand, the health minister wants to impose higher standards and 
closely monitor  their application, which results in cost increases 
for the provinces, and on the other, the finance minister wants to 
reduce his deficit at the expense of the provinces and thus is cutting 
payments.
<P>
	In the Spring of 1995, the National Council of Welfare, an 
organization whose mandate is to advise the health minister, 
cautioned her to beware of such a situation by saying, and I quote: 
``It would be extremely hypocritical to reduce contributions to the 
provinces -while increasing the requirements they would have to 
meet''.
<P>
	Despite fiscal arrangements, the transfer act is a federal statute 
establishing payments to the provinces unilaterally and without any 
consultation. Since 1977, these amounts have either been reduced, 
frozen or de-indexed. Their evolution no longer follows the real 
costs of provincial programs. In that regard we can say the federal 
government has broken its commitment to health care.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	For over 10 years, the federal government has paid lip service to 
health care while at the same time continuously reducing its 
spending in this area.
<P>
	Through established programs financing or EPF, the federal 
government transfers money to the provinces for health care and 
post-secondary education. The amount given to the provinces 
through EPF is paid partly in cash and partly by transferring tax 
points from the federal government to the provinces.
<P>
	In reality, the federal government only spends the amount in 
cash that is accounted for in budgetary expenditures. Under the tax 
point transfer, a portion of federal taxes goes to the provinces. This 
is a way for the government to give back to the provinces some of 
the taxation powers it took away from them in the 1940s. How 
generous.
<P>
	As a result of repeated cuts, Quebec will soon stop receiving 
cash payments and have to make do with the tax points it already 
has. Paradoxically, the federal government will soon stop spending 
anything out of its own pocket but will continue to impose its own 
standards on Quebec.
<P>
	Since it was put in place in 1977-78, EPF has led to a unilateral 
withdrawal on the part of the federal government. When EPF came 
into effect, federal spending on health care was based partly on the 
national average and partly on the provinces' actual expenditures 
and accounted for some 50 per cent of total health spending.
<P>
	Contributions to EPF were based on spending during the 
1975-76 reference year and indexed to the GNP average per capita 
in the three previous years. This clearly showed a commitment to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1722"> 1722 </A></B>
<P>
ensure a relatively stable  increase in the federal government's 
contribution based on the growth of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	Since 1986, the federal government has made repeated cuts to 
EPF for health care, thus weakening, then severing the agreed upon 
link between the increase in federal contributions and economic 
growth. In fact, Liberals have continued to reduce financing, a 
practice they had vigorously condemned when the Tories were in 
power.
<P>
	In 1986, the federal government announced a 2 per cent 
reduction in the EPF indexing factor, which meant that health 
transfers would follow the increase in the GNP, less 2 per cent.
<P>
	In 1989, the indexing factor was once again reduced by 1 per 
cent, which meant that health transfers would follow the increase in 
the GNP, less 3 per cent.
<P>
	In 1990, per capita allocations were frozen for two years 
supposedly. While health costs kept rising, the federal government 
stopped factoring in inflation. The freeze imposed by the federal 
government did not stop people from falling ill. This is one area 
where magical thinking does not work.
<P>
	In 1991, this so-called temporary freeze was extended until 
1995. In 1995, the current government announced a new program, 
the Canada social transfer, which entailed further cuts totalling 
$4.5 billion over two years. There is no guarantee whatsoever that 
more cuts will not be made in the future.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	As regards the calculation of the federal contribution, the 
National Council of Welfare had this to say in its spring 1995 
report: ``No formula is provided in the budget to calculate the 
amount payable. Based on recent events, the federal government 
should impose a formula or an arbitrary amount''.
<P>
	So, actual health care costs are not taken into account at all when 
calculating federal funding. The government only pays what it is 
willing to pay, depending on its mood and on the amount of its 
deficit. The national council was right in asking for a formula that 
would take into account the actual needs of people, instead of the 
best interests of the federal treasury.
<P>
	As for the Canada social transfer announced in the 1995 budget 
and now in effect since April 1, the National Council of Welfare, 
which is a federal organization whose role is to give advice to the 
Minister of Health, said: ``The main aspect of this financial tool is 
that federal funding for all these programs will undergo major 
cuts''.
<P>
	Prevention programs in the health sector will be the first ones to 
be cut by the provinces, in an effort to solve their immediate 
financial problems. In the long term, this will endanger the health 
of Canadians.
<P>
	All these cuts have already had harmful consequences. It is 
estimated that, between 1982 and 1994, Quebec suffered a shortfall 
of $8 billion because of underindexing, freezes or cuts affecting 
federal contributions. This is a large amount. This shortfall is partly 
responsible for the increase in Quebec's debt and income taxes, 
since the province refused to reduce its health care budget at the 
expense of Quebecers' health.
<P>
	The proportion of Quebec's health care expenditures paid with 
federal transfers went down from 45.9 per cent in 1977-78 to only 
33.7 per cent in 1994-95, a 12.2 per cent drop. Even though the 
federal withdrawal triggered a tax increase at the provincial level, 
the central government still maintained the same taxation level.
<P>
	According to a study conducted by the C.D. Howe Institute, 
while transfer payment expenditures levelled off between 1988 and 
1992, spending related to the other federal programs increased by 
25.5 per cent. Transfers to the provinces for the health sector thus 
absorbed part of the federal deficit. While the federal government 
was spending too much, it was telling the provinces to tighten their 
belts.
<P>
	The federal government could have found and still could find the 
money it needs for the social programs by eliminating or reducing 
its expenditures and closing some tax loopholes. This would make 
for a fairer tax system and would help bring in more money to 
maintain and improve the services and to reduce the debt. 
However, the federal government does not dare to cut the perks 
enjoyed by the good friends of the finance minister, the backers of 
Liberal party and the family of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Based on these figures and on the actions, and not the empty 
promises, of the federal government, we have to realize that the 
only real threat to the health of Quebecers and Canadians stems 
from the irresponsibility shown by the central government.
<P>
	The 1984 Health Act was passed to ensure that the provinces 
affected by the economic recession of the 1980s would not tinker 
with the health system, even if, at the same time, the federal 
government was reducing transfer payments.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	All of the provinces protested against this act, because the 
Canada Health Act contained new conditions above and beyond 
those already in effect. These new added responsibilities contrasted 
with the decrease in federal contributions resulting from the 1977 
financial arrangements.
<P>
	On the use of financial pressure tactics, allow me to make a few 
polite comments about the blackmail used by the federal 
government to force the provinces to totally support the federal 
vision. In 1983, Monique Bégin, the Liberal Minister of Health of 
the day, cautioned us: ``The total amount of the contributions paid 
by the  Government of Canada to the provinces for health services 
is very significant. Any province that constantly refuses to meet the 
conditions will lose the federal cash contribution and will probably 
be hard put to compensate for this loss. If the total contribution 
were to be withheld, health services in that province could have to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1723"> 1723 </A></B>
<P>
be suspended. This is the last thing the Government of Canada 
wants for Canadians. This option could create a situation worse 
than the problem it set out to solve''.
<P>
	What this means is that the confrontation strategy and the will of 
the federal government to control the provinces is, in fact, harmful 
to the health of the citizens themselves.
<P>
	The dual initiative by the federal government, that is the creation 
of a national forum on health care without consulting the provinces 
and the stricter criteria and conditions contained in Bill C-18, has 
drawn a lot of criticism not only from the Government of 
Quebec-and this may be of interest to the new Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs-but from other provincial 
governments as well. He may want to watch this situation closely.
<P>
	Let us see what the federalists have said about that. On 
September 19 of last year, the Conservative health minister of 
Ontario, Jim Wilson, criticized the federal government's lack of 
flexibility. I would like to apologize to the Speaker for my poor 
pronunciation in English, but I will go ahead anyway and do the 
best I can. I would add that I am taking courses to improve my 
English.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``I think it shows inflexibility on behalf of the federal 
government''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	He also stated that we should not let the federal government 
dictate its interpretation of medicare to the provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``The federal government be fought on principle for dictating its 
interpretation of medicare to the provinces''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The same day, Ralph Klein, Conservative premier of Alberta, 
also criticized the federal government's lack of flexibility.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``Marleau does not send a good signal to Quebec. It says there is no 
flexibility within the confederation''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The NDP health minister of British Columbia, Paul Ramsey, 
added that Mrs. Marleau-who held that federal portfolio at the 
time-had to change her approach. He stated that if medicare was 
threatened by the actions of the provinces, it was because of the $7 
billion cuts over  two years made by the federal government in the 
areas of health, welfare and post-secondary education. I will try 
another quotation in English.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``Last February's federal budget, which cut transfers to provinces 
for health, welfare and post-secondary education by $7 billion 
dollars over two years, has forced provinces to look at unpalatable 
cuts that threaten medicare''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In a joint communique issued at a health ministers meeting, the 
provinces stated that the federal government's will to make 
unilateral decisions with regard to the funding of health care, the 
interpretation of standards or the setting of arbitrary deadlines for 
consultation would not help in solving the problem.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``It is not helpful for the federal government to engage in unilateral 
decisions regarding funding or interpretations and arbitrary 
deadlines''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Concluding this section on the forum, it is obvious that reducing 
federal contributions causes a serious problem. Federal 
intervention was justified only by spending power, so any change 
to the federal health legislation without changes to the financial 
aspect runs the risk of having an absurd outcome.
<P>
	Any increased provincial obligation without a corresponding 
increased federal contribution is tantamount, not to the exercise of 
federal spending power, but rather to the creation of a federal 
power to make the provinces spend money for it, and under its 
conditions.
<P>
	In fact, the federal government's main objective is to lessen its 
financial burden related to the huge debt it has accumulated, at the 
cost of the provinces' fiscal health. In other words, the central 
government pushes a portion of its debt off on the provinces. By 
thus increasing the tax burden of the provinces, Ottawa lessens 
their manoeuvrability and forces them to make difficult, agonizing 
choices in its stead.
<P>
	Because the federal government is not capable of respecting its 
commitments and because, all its fine words and the standards it 
claims to be setting unilaterally notwithstanding, it is the one 
threatening the health system with all these cuts. The federal 
government ought to decide to withdraw from the health field, one 
in which it ought never to have set foot to begin with. In this case, it 
ought to assume responsibility for its decisions and transfer tax 
resources to the provinces, in order to allow them to take over.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1724"> 1724 </A></B>
<P>
	I have attempted in these past few minutes to establish this 
position, which in all aspects reflects the position of the various 
governments of Quebec over the years and the constitutional 
demands of the Government of Quebec. As I pointed out just now, 
since the new government has been in place, I have been a member 
of the standing committee on human resources, and in my daily 
work on that committee, particularly as the critic for training and 
post-secondary education, I have seen the same phenomenon at 
work there: an attempt to interfere-more than an attempt, 
constant interference, ongoing, and increasing.
<P>
	Despite the promises of change the Prime Minister made in the 
last referendum campaign, when things were getting close and it 
looked like the referendum might go to the yes side, in the final 
days, he made promises. Before he became prime minister, we 
heard him speak for the no committee, stating time and time again 
during the referendum campaign that the federal government 
should and would agree to change its centralizing attitude so 
frequently criticized by Quebecers. We thought there would be a 
change. No chance.
<P>
	Again yesterday, I spoke on Bill C-11, the old C-96, which 
dragged on at length and is now being re-introduced. Although 
these are old bills in new clothing, there has been no change to the 
federal government's centralizing attitude.
<P>
	An attitude based solely on the government's grasping for 
increased powers.
<P>
	Here is a parallel. We passed a resolution on the distinct society 
and what happened? In all of the government's actions, in matters 
of health and human resources development the government went 
from the notion of distinct society to the simplistic recognition of 
Quebec as the principal homeland of French language in North 
America.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	This is a widely known historical fact, but it adds nothing. I am 
not the only one to say it. So does the leader of the Liberal Party, 
who is a full-fledged partner of the no side and of the present 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. This full-fledged partner 
said that this gives nothing more to Quebec since it cannot lead to a 
transfer of powers, increased responsibilities, further clarification 
nor a greater clarity.
<P>
	There are some grey areas with regard to the government's 
residual powers. We, Quebecers, we, the official opposition, had 
hoped to see the federal governement deal with this aspect in its 
new effort to decentralize. We had hoped it would clarify matters 
and put an end to the remaining grey areas. But on the contrary, it 
perpetuates them.
<P>
	What is worse in the case of the bill making the department of 
Human Resources Development official as in this one, is that we 
can see that the government has  adopted a soft pedal approach, a 
go slow approach, a slow combustion approach. You put a little bit 
of wood in the stove, you let it smoulder all night, and then you add 
a little bit more wood, hoping that Quebec's emotions will simmer 
down, that Quebecers and their national feelings will cool down 
and, with time, journalists and the media will pay less attention to 
the issue, which has been so long on the front page; if there is less 
coverage, people will not hear about is as much. This is the soft 
pedal approach .
<P>
	Yesterday I said Bill C-11 was the law of silence. Today being 
Friday, I will be kinder. I notice a silence which is probably more 
understandable. Yesterday, when the government was passing a bill 
to officialize something that has been in existence for two and a 
half years, a bill creating the Department of Human Resources 
Development, I was explaining that if you exclude the servicing of 
the debt, the budget of that department was the largest item in the 
total federal budget, with more than 40 per cent of all expenditures.
<P>
	At the Department of Health, they tried to reduce the figures by 
every possible means. When you look at the budget allocated to the 
Department of Health this year, you no longer find transfer 
payments for health, because they are listed somewhere else. 
Therefore, the budget of the department is only $1.8 billion. This is 
not much. But most of the spending is elsewhere, in other sections.
<P>
	For example there is some in the Department of National 
Defence. There are many interventions. The federal government is 
there, but trying to hide the fact; it would have us believe it is 
giving way to the provinces, letting them manage their own 
business.
<P>
	The very last amazing brainwave of the federal government is 
the famous Canada social transfer, which has been in existence 
since April 1st, although few people know it. What is it? Let us 
remind people. The Canada social transfer is a merging of all 
federal transfers for health, post-secondary education and welfare.
<P>
	From now on, provinces will supposedly be able to set their own 
priorities. However, all this comes with a $7 billion cut. They are 
transferring to the provinces the cuts the federal government did 
not dare make. And so they should, in a way, but at the same time, 
the federal government is withdrawing from its financial 
commitment. And that is unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	The insult-the parliamentary secretary confirmed it this 
morning-is to attach to health transfers five principles, five 
inescapable conditions with thinly disguised threats. The 
government is saying to the provinces: ``If you do not accept 
national standards, in the Canadian sense of the word, you may be 
penalized by cuts in funds allocated for health or post-secondary 
education, but especially health''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1725"> 1725 </A></B>
<P>
	I heard excellent speeches in which it was said: ``The health 
of Canadians is a concern to us''. The former minister was 
particularly eloquent in the House; every time someone would ask 
her a question, she would start by saying: ``Mr. Speaker, you know 
I am very concerned with the health of Canadians. That is why 
we will intervene here and there''. She was asked why she had 
not consulted with the provinces, like she did with the health 
forum. She would then answer: ``But you know, the health area 
is very important; there are stakeholders in it. We had to know 
their views''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are signalling me my time is up. I will 
conclude with that. I could go on and on. I will have the 
opportunity to come back on the matter since I will now sit on the 
health committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-18. Before I do that, I 
would like to respond to some of the comments made by the 
member for Eglinton-Lawrence earlier in the debate.
<P>
	He started by talking about the leadership this government is 
providing in dealing with the crisis in health care. I suggest that the 
problems we are facing are being magnified. Indeed there is no 
leadership. No direction is being provided by the government to 
deal with the crisis in health care.
<P>
	The member was looking back in his speech, talking about the 
Fathers of Confederation and the Constitution. Those are just 
words to justify the status quo. There were no forward looking 
solutions to deal with the problem. Instead there was a look back to 
justify the status quo.
<P>
	The bottom line is that the federal government, while assuming 
the role of a minor payer, still wants to be the major player. It is not 
in the cards. It is going to change whether members realize it or 
not.
<P>
	As an Ontario MP, as I am, he has to be very aware of the crisis 
in our province, the long waiting lists and the bed closures. It is 
projected that Ontario will spend $17 billion on health care and that 
the federal government will contribute $6 billion toward it. That is 
a far cry from the 50:50 cost sharing that allowed the federal 
government originally to intrude in what is a provincial 
responsibility.
<P>
	The province of Ontario is looking for assistance. It needs help. 
It is not looking for rhetoric. It has a problem and it is looking for 
some help from the federal government in dealing with it.
<P>
	One of the most interesting things that the member said in his 
earlier presentation was that the five principles of health care are 
debatable but not negotiable. Why in the world would anybody 
debate them if there is to be no negotiation? What the government 
is saying is: ``My  mind is made up. Do not in any way confuse me 
with the facts''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Like the Liberal whip.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> That is right. It is debatable but it 
is not negotiable. I seem to recognize that same line in many issues 
we are dealing with in the House. Health care is a great example of 
the problems we are in: It is debatable but in no way is it 
negotiable.
<P>
	One cannot cover, in our health care system, 100 per cent of the 
cost 100 per cent of the time. That never was a reality and it has 
never been more true than it is today. The member alluded to our 
aging population. It is putting tremendous pressure on a system that 
is in dire need of an overhaul. It is not just Ontario that has a health 
care crisis. Every province is looking for negotiation, discussion 
and flexibility in the role of the federal government, a flexibility 
that sadly is not there.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	This is a housekeeping bill. There are really no monetary 
expenditures involved so we have no grounds to oppose it. I should 
not say there is no cost. There is always a cost when we debate a 
bill in the time it takes to debate it. While there is no reason to 
debate the reorganization, there is a very strong reason to discuss 
health care. Reorganization is important. Rethinking health care is 
critical.
<P>
	Everyone agrees that we must change, that we have a serious 
problem. I paraphrase the Prime Minister when he spoke in an 
interview with CBC radio. He said that the system was put in place 
to protect Canadian citizens from catastrophic crises in health and 
the family so they would not lose their homes. He said very clearly 
what we have been saying, that this was never intended to cover 
100 per cent of the problems 100 per cent of the time.
<P>
	He also alluded to the fact that the 10 per cent of GDP spent on 
health care is too high. It is the second highest in the world next to 
the United States and must be reduced. Those are the words, but 
where is the plan to accomplish that? There is nothing. What we 
got in the debate this morning were more words and more rhetoric 
with no plan to deal with health care.
<P>
	Medicare is our most valued social program. Part of the rhetoric 
from the other side is that we are out to savage and destroy 
medicare when the reality is that we are the only party in this House 
that is dedicated to saving medicare for those in our country who 
need it. It needs support. It needs fresh thinking.
<P>
	One of the major threats to medicare, indeed to all our social 
programs, is Canada's deficit and debt. The overspending that has 
taken place over the years has put us into a tremendous debt hole. 
That is the real threat to health care.
<P>
	The finance minister continues day after day when he gets up in 
the House to pat himself on the back for  reaching 3 per cent of 
GDP. He is not eliminating the overspending, he is reducing it. He 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1726"> 1726 </A></B>
<P>
will have it reduced to 3 per cent of GDP. We are still living beyond 
our means.
<P>
	In saying that, the finance minister is not telling the Canadian 
people what is the real danger to our social programs. While he is 
attempting to achieve this very low target, the debt is increasing 
from $400 billion to $500 billion to $600 billion in the term of this 
government, an increase of some $111 billion. Shame. That is what 
is killing health care and the social programs today.
<P>
	The interest payments are going from $30 billion to $40 billion 
to $50 billion to service the debt. That $50 billion does not create 
one hospital bed. It does nothing for health care, yet the 
government is prepared to see that kind of overspending continue, 
to see that kind of debt accumulate and to see that $50 billion go up 
in smoke while not creating one job, not doing one thing to save our 
social programs. That is the real killer and that is the real threat to 
health care.
<P>
	If we do not change we are in danger of losing medicare. If we do 
not start to open up our minds and be prepared to debate and to 
negotiate, we will be in danger of losing health care. Those who 
only talk are the real threat. Action is required. We do not know 
how much time we have to deal with this problem although we 
know it is not unlimited.
<P>
	We want real debate, not cheap shots or rhetoric like ``we are 
going to save medicare and there is the heartless group that will 
not''. We want to have debate about a real plan, a plan to deal with 
the problem we are facing today.
<P>
	There is a plan we should be talking about which has a 
three-pronged approach. The first is the stability of medicare 
funding. Funding for medicare needs to be stabilized so the 
provinces know where they are at. We have to focus our existing 
resources and we have define what the core of our health care is 
going to be. We have to offer choices beyond medicare. We have to 
face the realities of what is out there today.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	In affirming medicare and supporting funding stability we must 
return to the best health care safety net in the world. We must 
remove the existing funding freeze and restore the per capita 
transfers to 1992-93 levels which Liberals continue to cut by 
stealth. The remaining cash transfers should be converted to tax 
points because as far behind as we are falling in the original 50:50 
deal, it is going to be even less of a payer in the future.
<P>
	A better job has to be done in focusing our resources. Canadians 
need to define what constitutes core or essential health care 
services. There needs to be a debate among the people about what 
those core services should be and medicare must be reserved for 
those core services.
<P>
	We should look at the choices and the possibility of choices 
beyond medicare, remove the existing restrictions in law which 
prohibit choices in basic health care beyond publicly funded health 
care. Where medicare does not meet Canadians' needs they should 
have the option to exercise choices beyond medicare. Where 
Canadians exercise choice beyond medicare they will be 
responsible for arranging appropriate private funding on such 
choices, for example, with employers through benefit plans with 
third party insurance and through private resources.
<P>
	Let the debate begin on some real solutions to dealing with the 
crisis in health care. All of the provinces, not just Ontario, are 
looking for that.
<P>
	In closing, medicare is our most valued social program. I 
reinforce the fallacy in saying that only the federal government has 
a heart, only the federal government is concerned about saving 
health care. It belittles the premiers of the provinces to suggest that 
they would in any way be heartless or not be concerned about 
health care in their provinces. They will answer to the voters in 
their provinces for the job that they do in looking after their people 
and not going to the federal government and get into this ``I'm not 
at fault, they're at fault'' argument which has brought us to the 
point we are at today.
<P>
	Talk will not do it. There needs to be a plan. Debate must begin 
on that plan. We must act now. I believe time is limited. Future 
Canadians, our children and our grandchildren, are counting on us 
to do that and Canadians deserve nothing less.

	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-202, an 
act respecting a National Organ Donor Day in Canada, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is ant honour for me to rise today to 
launch the debate-which I hope will be positive-that will among 
other things improve the health and future of many people from 
<P>

<P>
coast to coast, whether they live in Quebec, Ontario, western 
Canada or the maritimes.
<P>
	Bill C-202 would designate a national day to recognize the 
importance of organ donation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My desire to put forward this private member's bill came as a 
result of a very real, very human event that took place in my riding 
on April 21, 1994.
<P>
	A young boy by the name of Stuart Harriott of Whitby, Ontario 
was unfortunately involved in an accident with a vehicle. As the 
young boy was in the last days and hours of life, his parents, his 
aunt and other relatives tried to determine how best to resolve their 
terrible grief. The doctors had told them that the young boy would 
eventually pass away and he did succumb to his injuries.
<P>
	Rather than seeing this tragedy for what it was, Linda Rumble 
and Stuart Harriott's parents decided that they would begin a 
campaign to initiate something that would provide, if there ever is 
one in this world, a silver lining to such a tragic event.
<P>
	At their insistence and the insistence of many organizations I 
have had the privilege of speaking to over the past year, we have 
before us today an opportunity as Parliament to discuss and 
perhaps approve an action Parliament recognizes on a given day, 
April 21, the importance and significance that in giving of one's 
life we may also give life to others.
<P>
	The bill is about public education and awareness. Every year in 
Canada from coast to coast, 2,500 people need the gift of life. 
However, only 300 transplants on average are given. This leaves a 
tremendous shortfall.
<P>
	While many organizations, from the Kidney Foundation to the 
Multiple Organ Retrieval Exchange Group, the Canadian 
Association of Transplant Patients, the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation, the Canadian Liver Foundation, the Heart and Stroke 
and Lung Association, to the Canadian Medical Association and 
many others work to raise the awareness of Canadians of the need 
to sign their donor cards, many may do not enjoy the benefits and 
continue to suffer.
<P>
	The House of Commons has an opportunity to put aside the 
traditional debate and often divisiveness that exists and provide for 
once an opportunity to allow people who are suffering today the 
hope that perhaps down the road they will be able to receive one, 
two or several organs. Some of these young children who received 
the gift of life from Stuart Herriott will also be able to enjoy their 
future.
<P>
	Perhaps this is more important because it is not just that it affects 
and sounds like it is one of those motherhood issues. I think each of 
us in the House knows of constituents and families afflicted and 
affected by a debilitating disease or by accidents or by trauma.
<P>
	I was very surprised to learn that one of our former clerks who 
worked on many committees for years, a well  known individual, 
G.A. Sandy Birch, is a recipient of a heart. I a saw him recently at a 
function held in Ottawa where 35 other individuals had been given 
the gift of life, many of them with our colleague in the other place 
presiding at the transplant, the hon. Dr. Keon.
<P>
	I was quite impressed to see how important and how close to 
home such examples of transplants can be in our own 
neighbourhoods.
<P>
	I believe the public awareness and education programs such a 
bill would bring about would address very firmly some of the 
misapprehensions individuals have about transplants. Some will be 
concerned from a religious point of view, and I will address that.
<P>
	Much of this is based on what some would consider simply 
confusion or ignorance surrounding the religious impact on the 
issue of organ donation. It may surprise many colleagues to learn 
that virtually every major religion in the world permits, and some 
actually encourage, organ donation and transplants.
<P>
	Hindus are not prohibited by religious law from donating organs. 
Muslims support organ transplants and donations as long as they 
are done with respect for the deceased and for the benefit of the 
recipient. Judaism teaches that saving a human life takes 
precedence over maintaining the sanctity of the human body in 
terms of organ donation. Direct transplantation is therefore 
preferred.
<P>
	In Christianity, Protestants respect individual conscience and an 
person's right to make decisions about their body and that 
resurrection does not require making the physical body whole 
again. Catholics view organ donation as an act of charity, fraternal 
love and self-sacrifice.
<P>
	Some are also equally concerned about the question of safety. 
The importance of ensuring the safety of organ transplantation is of 
paramount and absolute concern. Research is being conducted 
examining the issue of reducing the risk of a recipient's contracting 
diseases such as hepatitis B and C and HIV from transplants.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	In October 1995 the national consensus conference on the safety 
of organs and tissues for transplantation brought together a broad 
range of experts in the field of transplantation. The conference was 
successful in achieving a consensus on accepting in principle a 
Canadian general standard on safety of organs and tissues for 
transplantation. At the same time a risk management regulatory 
framework was proposed.
<P>
	I am confident that more attention and study will be given to the 
issue of improving the safety of organ transplants.

<P>
	In the intervening period since I introduced this bill under a 
different name in the previous session I have received a lot of 
correspondence from members of Parliament from across this 
great land.
<P>
	Support for Linda Rumble and her initiatives have been received 
from many members, including the members for Saint John, 
Peterborough, Winnipeg North, London East, Vancouver Centre 
and Saskatoon-Humboldt.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, while we agree to the need for a day when we can 
pay respect to the individuals who have given life, perhaps some 
time down the road your good Chair and office might permit an 
honour role to recognize every year those who in laying down their 
lives have actually provided hope for many others.
<P>
	It is my belief this bill does what other organizations cannot do 
individually. They cannot draw the attention of all Canadian people 
to sign their donor cards and to address the inhibitions of organ 
donation, for it is not something which should be done with 
trepidation, but with honour. When we pass on from this great 
planet, it is my belief there are opportunities for us to know that 
some of us will live in the lives of others.
<P>
	I was also touched by some of the more immediate examples of 
what organ donation has done for many people, even among 
families. Glenn DeMille is a well know heart transplant recipient 
who helped to organize many events in the Ottawa region to draw 
attention to, at least from a local perspective, the need for organ 
donation.
<P>
	Mr. DeMille received a heart transplant several years ago. 
However, most people do not know it is his son's heart which lives 
within him. Glenn DeMille did not know his son had signed a 
donor card. After his operation he was informed of the transplant. 
Mr. DeMille smiles because he feels like and has the energy of a 
25-year old. Mr. DeMille will continue to be a driving force locally.
<P>
	Perhaps we need a national force in which the division which 
often appears in the House of Commons and in committees is put 
aside for one day and parties will actually say there are some issues 
which transcend partisan considerations.
<P>
	I am submitting today that Parliament can do what individual 
organizations cannot do. While it is true some groups and 
organizations designate weeks in which they recognize specific 
causes on a regional, local or provincial basis, we have never been 
able to pinpoint a specific day. In my view it should be April 21.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I ask this House to give my bill serious consideration and to 
support its implementation so that present and future generations 
can receive the gift of life.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Northumberland):</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of 
order, I simply want to confirm to the House that next Tuesday will 
be an allotted day.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> I am 
pleased to participate in this debate today, Mr. Speaker, on the bill 
put forward by the hon. member for Ontario, a bill designating 
April 21 National Organ Donor Day.
<P>
	I will start with a real life story. The story is set in Montreal's 
Sainte-Justine hospital. The year is 1959. It feels almost like 
yesterday. I was about to graduate from nursing school. Pierrette 
was a patient of mine. She was 14 years old and had been suffering 
from kidney failure for several years. Thirty years ago, 
haemodialysis and kidney transplants were still in the realm of 
science fiction. All this to say that Pierrette was dying. All she 
wanted was to sleep through the night but, one night, she went to 
sleep never to wake up again.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	In those days, cases like Pierrette's were hopeless and therefore 
went untreated. The feeling of helplessness was extremely 
frustrating for all of us. Why her and not me? Science has made 
giant strides since. Over the course of almost 30 years of 
professional activity entirely dedicated to paediatric care, I finally 
saw hope rekindled in the hearts and minds of parents and 
caregivers.
<P>
	Today, increasingly sophisticated technologies make heart, liver, 
lung and pancreas transplants possible. What was a virtually 
impossible feat in 1960 has become, today more than ever, a 
challenge to take on.
<P>
	In 1995, in Quebec alone, 375 persons received the invaluable 
gift of life because 117 healthy people like you and me agreed to 
give the gift of life after their own life was over. There are 
nevertheless more than 500 Quebecers who are still waiting for a 
transplant and, across Canada, only 40 per cent of those who need a 
transplant actually undergo the operation. Scientific progress 
notwithstanding, the biggest problem remains the insufficient 
supply of organs to meet the demand.
<P>
	According to Québec-Transplant, one of the factors contributing 
to this shortage is undoubtedly the fact that only an infinitely small 
number of possible donors meet the requirements for organ 
donation. In 1995, among the many donors referred, only 117 could 
be used to meet part of the transplant needs. So, if there are more 
donors, there will also be more people who will benefit from a long 
awaited organ transplant that will improve their quality of life.
<P>
	This is why this bill is so important. One way to increase the 
number of donors is to run public awareness campaigns on the 
importance of organ donation. In that  field, the most sophisticated 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1729"> 1729 </A></B>
<P>
technologies are useless if people refuse or forget to give the gift of 
life.
<P>
	Instituting a national organ donor day would help organizations 
such as Québec-Transplant and the Canadian association of organ 
donors to intensify their campaigns to recruit organ donors and to 
stress the importance of volunteer work in that sector.
<P>
	This issue is very dear to me, partly because for four years now, 
Laval, which is the second largest city in Quebec and which is were 
my riding is located, has been running a campaign in April to 
recruit organ donors. I am proud to participate in that event as 
honourary copresident. I can see the positive impact of such a 
campaign in terms of encouraging people to pledge to donate 
organs, but also on the volunteers working in that sector. The organ 
donor month in Laval also provides an opportunity for various 
interested parties, including volunteers, medical teams and 
organizations, to consult each other to promote organ donation.
<P>
	Police officers are a good example. I would like to take this 
opportunity to express my deep appreciation to police officers in 
Laval, who are serving this cause by transporting organs and thus 
contribute to saving many lives. Since 1993, about 50 police 
officers have been called upon 325 times and have travelled over 
39,000 kilometres to transport donor organs.
<P>
	But the main goal is public awareness, so that people will sign 
they donor card and talk about it with their relatives and friends.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Organ donation is a sign of solidarity with people who need an 
organ transplant to stay alive or get a better quality of life. It can 
also give a meaning to death, because it is a gift of life.
<P>
	Only through sharing and generosity can we solve the shortage 
of organs for transplants. Sooner or later, we all have to come to 
grips with the reality of death, our own or that of a loved one. The 
loss of our loved ones is always a cause for grief, but organ 
donation is a gift of life that can bring hope and peace.
<P>
	However, some elements like the lack of knowledge about the 
organ shortage or the emotional drive to keep the body of the 
deceased intact all hinder an increase in transplants and make it 
crucial, at least for the people waiting for a transplant, that 
information and awareness campaigns be launched.
<P>
	This is why I intend to submit to the health committee an 
amendment to Bill C-202, asking Parliament to recognize April as 
organ donor month, as is the tradition in Laval.
<P>
	I think that, because of the extent of the organ shortage and the 
importance of this issue, we need to set aside a whole month to 
educate the public. Health is not only about science and 
technology. It is also a question of  awareness and reflection and 
caring. Since life gives us all kinds of opportunities, I think we 
should also give life a chance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today in support of Bill C-202 which seeks to 
designate every April 21 as national organ donation day.
<P>
	Oftentimes we are reminded there are only two certainties in this 
life, death and taxes. We can count on this government to ensure 
that we pay more than our fair share of taxes and at the same time 
we have learned that we can postpone death. While we cannot put it 
off indefinitely, it is possible to postpone it.
<P>
	Advances in medical technology have allowed some people to 
do just exactly that through organ transplant surgery. It has given 
Canadians from all walks of life from all across the country a 
second chance at life.
<P>
	Organ donation operations are no longer an experimental 
procedure. They have become so successful that the number of 
people on waiting lists in Canada far exceeds the supply of 
available organs. I commend my friend from Ontario for 
introducing this bill. It increases the awareness of this problem in 
Canada. As has been pointed out by my colleague from the Bloc, it 
is to give the gift of life even though the person is no longer there to 
see that gift being given.
<P>
	Since organ transplants began in Canada, some 18,000 
operations have been performed. In 1984 there were 500 transplant 
operations while 10 years later in 1994 over 1,400 such operations 
took place. That is the good news. The not so good news is that in 
1992 there were over 2,000 people on lists waiting to receive 
organs and by 1995 the number had grown to 2,600.
<P>
	As members of Parliament we should take the initiative to 
promote the benefits of organ donation. There are common 
misconceptions with regard to organ donation which I think we 
have a duty to dispel.
<P>
	For instance, there are those who believe it does little to save 
lives and restore health but the facts indicate the contrary. Organ 
donation is a proven life saver with success rates ranging from 85 
to 95 per cent. That is a pretty good gamble for somebody who 
requires a kidney. It is not what one would call routine surgery but 
it is certainly not experimental either.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Another common misconception is that organ donations and 
transplants are a financial burden on health care, that they are 
costly. Organ donations and transplant operations not only save 
lives but they save dollars as well. The issue of health care dollars, 
as was evidenced by our previous debate, certainly is a timely topic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1730"> 1730 </A></B>
<P>
at the moment. Health care dollars are becoming more and more 
scarce all the time.
<P>
	As an example, for those suffering from kidney disease, a 
transplant operation would cost in the neighbourhood of $20,000 
plus about $5,000 a year for follow-up treatment, whereas renal or 
kidney dialysis for the same person would cost around $50,000 a 
year. Coupled with that, if the person has a functioning kidney their 
quality of life and their productivity is certainly a lot better than it 
would be if they had to rely on a kidney dialysis machine.
<P>
	Another reason I encourage members to support this bill is that it 
will increase public awareness. The government will have to get 
the public thinking about organ donation if the gap between 
availability and demand is to be filled.
<P>
	One of the biggest obstacles is the lack of communication 
between family members. Not that I want to do a commercial for 
Mutual Life Assurance Company of Canada but it did conduct a 
survey which found that only about half of Canadian families have 
ever discussed the issue and the circumstances surrounding organ 
donation. That is to say that only about half of them even discussed 
the matter and very few of those actually took the action of filling 
out a donor card, which is the first step.
<P>
	Even though an individual may have signed the donor card, the 
family of a person who has just expired may express concerns and 
objections about the donation of a loved one's organs. As a matter 
of professional practice, the doctor will defer to the family's 
expressed concern. The result is that the organs will not be donated. 
They will not be used to benefit a waiting recipient.
<P>
	One solution to this quandary is to have both spouses, the 
guardians or people who are indicated as next of kin in the event of 
death sign the organ donation card so that there will be agreement 
on whether or not the organs are to be donated. This will increase 
the timeliness and of course with organ donations timeliness is very 
important.
<P>
	Perhaps there is a need for a national registry of potential organ 
donors. In case of fatal traffic accidents for instance, the personal 
effects including the driver's licence may be separated from the 
victim. If a person has filled out the organ donor card on the back of 
their licence, it does not really solve the problem if the driver's 
licence is in one place and the body is in another. Often too much 
time elapses before this is realized and by that time the organs may 
not be suitable for donation.
<P>
	Another option is to have prospective organ donors registered 
with the Canadian Police Information Centre. There is access to the 
Canadian Police Information Centre all day every day. It is 
registered across the country. All that is needed is the authorization 
of the solicitor general and the police authorities in order to carry 
out this step.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	Such measures would address waiting lists which continue to 
grow and lives that are needlessly lost as a result. In 1995 alone 
1,114 Canadians died because they had not received a suitable 
organ for transplantation, an organ that would have restored their 
health.
<P>
	I was astonished to learn that Canada has one of the lowest organ 
donation rates in the world. In Canada there are only 14 donors per 
million whereas in other countries the average ratio is between 20 
and 30 donors per million. There is a lot of work to be done. As I 
have said before, that is the goal of my colleague from Ontario who 
would like to raise awareness of this problem and increase those 
numbers to make available more and more organs for donation.
<P>
	Earlier I mentioned new initiatives the government should 
consider. In the interim Canadians should be made aware that they 
can do more than sign their driver's licences and register as donors.
<P>
	Mutual Life Assurance Company of Canada sponsored an organ 
donation campaign called ``By Mutual Consent: Breaking Barriers 
to Organ Donation''. A number of non-profit organizations such as 
the British Columbia Transplant Society, the Kidney Foundation of 
Canada, the Canadian Transplant Society, Organ Donors Canada in 
Alberta and the Canadian Association of Transplantation are active 
in promoting and co-ordinating organ donation efforts.
<P>
	Bill C-202 is an example of an effort to do more. It is a 
reasonable and worthy initiative which could complement other 
efforts designed to motivate people to give the gift of life. Along 
with national donor week which we celebrate at this time each year, 
which apparently is not exactly a national donor week but an 
Ontario donor week, the member for Ontario's initiative would 
promote and encourage discussion on the issue surrounding organ 
donation.
<P>
	Reformers are pleased to support this bill as it would contribute 
to efforts to address this need proactively. In doing so it would save 
lives and improve the health and the quality of life of many 
Canadians. It would conserve precious health care dollars and 
encourage the public's awareness and discussion. I urge all 
members to support the bill, consider the issue themselves and 
discuss it in their constituencies.
<P>
	After all, healthy Canadians are more productive Canadians. We 
are very concerned about the quality of life in Canada. If we as 
individuals or as a group want to ensure people will not be on 
waiting lists for organ donation transplants, we should be proactive 
in our approach.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be a part of this debate. 
I compliment my colleague from Ontario  riding for making not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1731"> 1731 </A></B>
<P>
only a very persuasive and compelling dissertation but one that was 
moving as well.
<P>
	It is most unfortunate we have to make reference to such 
personal tragedies as that suffered by the Rumble family. We will 
try to take a positive view, as my colleague from Ontario did, and 
say that perhaps from one human tragedy we can do something that 
is worthwhile for the rest of us.
<P>
	On the question of transplants and organ donations, the House 
may be aware that the kidney transplant is the oldest of the solid 
organ transplant procedures. The first successful kidney transplant 
between identical twins in Boston in 1954 ushered in the new era of 
transplantation.
<P>
	Improved surgical techniques and new drugs to fight rejection 
enabled Montreal surgeons to transplant kidneys between unrelated 
persons in 1963. I mention this because I would hope that all those 
who are interested in the issue, not only from the political realm but 
also in society as a whole, would keep an appreciation of the 
activity of Health Canada and all Canadians working in this area.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	This first transplant was followed in 1967 by a heart transplant 
performed by Dr. Christiaan Barnard of South Africa. A year later, 
in 1968, the first heart transplant was performed at the Montreal 
Heart Institute.
<P>
	The use of the anti-rejection drug cyclosporin in the 1980s 
greatly improved the success of transplantation and contributed 
significantly to the growth of this procedure. Today transplantation 
of both organs and tissues has become an important part of health 
care and has contributed to improving the life expectancy and 
quality of life of thousands of Canadians.
<P>
	One of the key barriers to transplantation remains the 
availability of suitable donor organs and tissues, as other speakers 
have noted. In fact, about 2,200 Canadians are currently waiting to 
receive an organ transplant. Waiting times vary depending on the 
specific organ and tissue required for a transplant.
<P>
	The overall rate of organ donation in Canada is regrettably low: 
about 14.7 per million population as of 1994. Yet that represents 
roughly a 20 per cent increase from the 12.1 per million population 
in 1992.
<P>
	Still, by international standards, as others have indicated, 
Canada could and should do better. While our rates are comparable 
to those of Australia, the United States has a donation rate which is 
about 50 per cent higher and Austria's rate is double that of 
Canada's.
<P>
	According to a 1994 public opinion survey conducted by the 
Angus Reid group, 77 per cent of Canadians indicated a willingness 
to donate organs. Unfortunately, only 58 per cent reported having 
signed a donor card. Still this did represent an increase over the 
1993 and  1992 levels, which were 56 per cent and 53 per cent 
respectively.
<P>
	There is a considerable opportunity gap between those 
expressing a willingness and those who actually act on that 
willingness. However, what is very encouraging is that of those 
who had not signed a donor card, 54 per cent indicated they would 
do so if offered the chance and the opportunity to so sign.
<P>
	That survey, by the way, pointed out some misconceptions about 
organ donations which may be impeding behaviour in this regard. I 
will cite a few examples.
<P>
	Forty-three per cent of Canadians reported assuming that only 
those in excellent health would be able to donate. Thirty-eight per 
cent thought that organ transplants were more costly than keeping a 
patient alive through other means, such as kidney dialysis or drug 
therapy. Twenty-eight per cent thought that the organ donation 
would result in changes to funeral arrangements. Seventeen per 
cent thought that organ transplantation was not the most effective 
medical treatment for organ failure.
<P>
	Despite these misconceptions, concerted efforts are and have 
been under way for some time in Canada to improve the public's 
awareness of and willingness to become organ donors. Among 
those taking a leadership role in this regard have been national and 
non-governmental organizations, such as the Kidney Foundation, 
as my colleague from Ontario pointed out, the Heart and Stroke 
Foundation, the Liver Foundation, the Lung Association and the 
Cystic Fibrosis Association. In addition, several national 
associations, including the Canadian Medical Association and the 
Canadian Nurses Association, promote organ and tissue donor 
awareness through their professional journals.
<P>
	These and other national organizations, including Health 
Canada, are members of the Canadian Coalition for Organ Donor 
Awareness, also known as CCODA.
<P>
	Together, national and provincial governments and 
non-government organizations currently organize various public 
awareness and education seminars during national organ donor 
awareness week, which is the last full week of April.
<P>
	My colleagues on both sides of the House have rightly pointed 
out that so far there has not been the rate of donation that we could 
expect to make such programs completely successful. That having 
been said, local hospitals and community groups have organized 
campaigns to heighten understanding and awareness of the 
importance of organ donation. If the House will permit, I will take 
the opportunity to give an indication of one such organization in the 
immediate vicinity.

	The Ottawa-Carleton chapter of the Canadian Liver Foundation 
will host its seventh annual celebration of life service in 
appreciation of organ donors and their families this Sunday, April 
21, at Christ Church Cathedral on Sparks Street. One should note 
that the church is wheelchair accessible from Queen Street. All are 
welcome.
<P>
	It is organizations like this, activities like this, that give us a 
better appreciation of needs everywhere.
<P>
	Within Canada the public and stakeholders in the organ donation 
programs have accepted the need for specific focus each year on 
efforts to promote public education about organ donation. This is 
an important health care issue for all Canadians and one that many 
national and provincial organizations are actively pursuing. It is 
one that Health Canada has been pursuing for a long time. We will 
continue to pursue it with the support of colleagues on both sides of 
the House and from organizations, provincial, municipal and 
non-governmental, everywhere throughout the land.
<P>
	I thank the House for its attention on this most worthwhile topic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak on private member's bill C-202, an act respecting national 
organ donor day in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member for Ontario riding for 
bringing this private member's bill to the House. I believe it is a 
very worthwhile bill for several reasons.
<P>
	First, there is merit in having recognition of something as 
important as donating an organ. The public becomes more aware of 
the issue, of the shortage of organs and of the long lists of people 
who are waiting to receive an organ so they can have their life 
improved or prolonged. Therefore I would like to congratulate the 
hon. member for Ontario for bringing this motion forward.
<P>
	Any kind of media attention that can be brought to an issue like 
this will help. I seldom would wish this for a Liberal member of 
Parliament, but I wish him all kinds of extremely positive coverage 
on this issue. It can only help to make people aware. Perhaps it will 
encourage some people within their families to talk about the 
possibility of organ donation should one of them die prematurely.
<P>
	As I was coming here on the little green bus from the 
Confederation Building I was thinking about how I would feel. I 
have five children, three boys and two girls. I have identical twin 
sons and also a twin son and daughter. The identical twin sons came 
to mind. If they were, God forbid, in a serious car accident-they 
are 17 years old so I cannot help thinking about that possibility-if 
they were both critically injured and one of them died and could 
through donating an organ prolong the life of the other, I  could not 
help thinking what a terrible loss it would be if the arrangements 
had not been made so that the people who arrived on the scene did 
not know immediately that the intent was that my sons wanted this 
to happen.
<P>
	As well, I could not help thinking of the good feeling and 
possibly the way that this could make it a little easier to suffer 
through the loss of this child, knowing that a part of this child who 
had died could remain alive in the life of the other.
<P>
	Therefore, I congratulate the hon. member opposite for bringing 
this motion forward. I wish him all the media attention that he can 
get on this. Any kind of education and awareness that we can help 
promote on this issue is extremely valuable and will save lives.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	While I congratulate the member for bringing this bill forward, I 
do not think it is enough. What we should do in the House is 
actually draft a bill that will in a far more substantive way allow, 
provide for and encourage more people to donate organs so that 
there is not this long waiting list we have in Canada now.
<P>
	It is important on an issue like this, if we are to debate it in the 
House, that it be done in a non-partisan way. I am talking about a 
bill which will become law and which will provide for a much 
better organ donation system than we have now. It is important for 
that to be done in a non-partisan way.
<P>
	In legislation the Liberal government brought forward in 1994 
there were some changes made to chapter IX of the standing orders. 
One change allows the government to put a bill before committee 
before second reading. This legislation has been used. A change to 
Standing Order 68(4)(b), a provision which has not yet been used, 
allows a private member's motion to be put before committee 
before second reading so that legislation can actually be drafted by 
committee.
<P>
	I am in the process right now of presenting a private member's 
motion to Journals which will ask the House to send a motion 
dealing with organ donations to committee before second reading 
so that the appropriate parliamentary committee can actually draft 
the legislation, which will help take some of the partisanship out of 
the process. This will enable the committee to draft the legislation 
which will help in a very substantive way to make the organs 
needed readily available.
<P>
	I will read this section of the standing orders:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>standing order shall also be taken up as a motion under Private  Members' Business 
pursuant to the aforementioned standing orders in that regard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This section will allow this process. I hope my private member's 
motion, should it come before the House, will add something even 
more substantive to the bill presented by the hon. member for 
Ontario. I am in the process of presenting this motion to Journals. I 
hope it will be unanimously supported when it comes to the House.
<P>
	I will shorten my comments because many people before me 
have talked about statistics and have expressed very well the need 
for an improvement in the mechanism. They have talked about the 
long waiting lists. They have talked about people who have died 
waiting for an organ donation. I believe all of us know someone 
who has died unnecessarily because organs were not available.
<P>
<B>(1415 )</B>
<P>
	I have 295 organ donor cards which have been provided by the 
Kidney Foundation of Canada. I ask for unanimous consent of the 
House to have these organ donor cards transferred to the table so 
that all members of Parliament can show by example the 
importance of everyone who is willing to sign an organ donation 
card. In that way the list of people waiting for organs will be 
shortened substantially and fewer people will while die waiting for 
organs.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, is there unanimous consent 
to allow the member to do as proposed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> So ordered. The cards will be transferred 
to the table.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this 
important issue. I thank my hon. colleague for bringing this 
important issue forward in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Organ donation and transplantation is an essential part of health 
care in Canada. While there have been improvements in the rates of 
organ donation in Canada, we still lag behind other industrialized 
countries including Austria, Spain, Belgium, the United States and 
France.
<P>
	Health professionals are keenly aware of the importance of organ 
transplantation both to save lives and often to reduce ongoing 
expensive treatment costs. Nevertheless, converting potential 
donors into actual donors is a difficult issue for many 
professionals. In some cases medical and surgical residents have 
difficulty in identifying potential donors. As well, a recent 
Canadian study indicated that only 35 per cent of nurses and 55.4 
per cent of physicians knew how to refer organ donors.
<P>
	An important issue for physicians and nurses is the difficulty and 
stress of discussing organ donation with  family members. In the 
same Canadian study it was noted that 83 per cent of nurses and 75 
per cent of physicians reported reluctance in approaching relatives 
of potential organ donors. Professional attitudes toward organ 
donation however are generally positive.
<P>
	Co-operation from health care professionals does not require 
more education but rather more emphasis on the social and 
interpersonal issues. At the same time more efforts with regard to 
professional knowledge and involvement would no doubt be very 
helpful.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that consent to organ donation among 
health professionals themselves does not rank much higher than 
among the general population. As a matter of interest, I, as a past 
health professional for 30 years have made the commitment to 
organ donation.
<P>
	In 1994 a survey of physicians and nurses found that over 90 per 
cent of the nurses and 95 per cent of the physicians supported organ 
donation in principle. However only 61 per cent of the nurses and 
63 per cent of physicians had completed a donor card. This 
compares to a 1994 public opinion survey which indicated that 58 
per cent of Canadians surveyed reported having signed an organ 
donor card.
<P>
	Further many Canadians do not discuss their personal views and 
intentions in this regard with their family members. This is a shame 
because in 1994 only 63 per cent of Canadians reported ever having 
discussed organ donation with a family member and 51 per cent 
indicated that they did not know what the wishes of their family 
members were with respect to organ donations. This adds to the 
difficulty experienced by health professionals in approaching 
family members and potential organ donors. Not only is it 
emotionally stressful to approach the subject but often family 
members are left in a quandary of simply not knowing whether 
their loved ones would want them to consent to organ donation.
<P>
	Furthermore many Canadians know little about the actual 
process of organ donation. For example, 43 per cent still think only 
those in excellent health could do this. A few Canadians report fear, 
mistrust or uncertainty about the extraction process and 13 per cent 
fear AIDS or other infections. Moreover the study showed that 16 
per cent of those not willing to donate expressed fear of maybe not 
receiving the best medical care by signing one of the cards.
<P>
	Also, there may be few incentives for hospitals to become 
involved in organ and tissue procurement. In many provinces no 
funding is offered to hospitals for this procurement and hospitals 
must commit their own funds and resources to maintain potential 
donors until the organs can be recovered. The lack of financial 
compensation for physicians and the amount of time their 
involvement requires may also be further barriers.
<P>
	Cultural barriers as well may be an issue here. And there may be 
an increasing number of important and  difficult ethical issues 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1734"> 1734 </A></B>
<P>
regarding the sanctity of the human body, including the extent to 
which medical technology should be used to delay death.
<P>
	Thus public awareness and education while extremely important 
is only one dimension associated with improving organ donation in 
Canada. Several national and provincial governments and 
non-governmental organizations are already undertaking a variety 
of efforts to improve the level of knowledge of Canadians and of 
health professionals on various aspects of this issue.
<P>
	Federal and provincial ministers of health are currently assessing 
the problems and barriers and we need to work with them. The 
ultimate goal of course is to promote a more concerted, collective 
effort in order to improve overall organ donation rates and enhance 
our ability to respond to the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	All members of Parliament and the government have a 
responsibility in this. In closing I thank my hon. colleague for 
bringing this subject to the floor of the House of Commons. I wish 
it every success.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare the motion carried. Accordingly, 
the bill stands referred to the Standing Committee on Health.
<P>
	Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The House stands adjourned until 
Monday, April 22 at 11 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.24 p.m.)
