	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the

both official languages, the government's response to 15 petitions.

	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 32(2), 
I have the honour to table, in both official languages, copies of the 
annual report on the operation of the Canadian Multiculturalism 
Act for 1995-1996.
<P>
	I will be making a statement shortly outlining my vision and the 
government's new direction for multiculturalism.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MULTICULTURALISM">MULTICULTURALISM</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, millions of Canadians are living 
proof of this nation's commitment to offer opportunity to all of our 
citizens. It is the role of multiculturalism to ensure that all 
Canadians can participate fully and actively in the economic, social 
and political life of this country.
<P>
	It is therefore a pleasant responsibility to place before 
Parliament the annual report of the operation of the Canadian 
Multiculturalism Act.
<P>
	1996 was a milestone for multiculturalism in three ways. First, 
we commemorated the 25th anniversary of Canada becoming the 
first country in the world to  embrace the concept of 
multiculturalism as a national policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That policy is an affirmation of Canadian values and vision, and 
is a guide for pragmatic vision. It is a guide for reaping the social 
and economic benefits offered by our cultural diversity.
<P>
	It is the ability for one people to be formed out of diversity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is the ability to live together, sharing common and 
fundamental values that are inherently Canadian, yet at the same 
time it is also the ability to respect individuals and communities 
which have chosen to maintain their uniqueness that is also 
Canadian.
<P>
	Second, 1996 was the year in which Canada revamped and 
renewed its multiculturalism program to make it more 
contemporary, more focused, more accountable and more open to 
partnership with all Canadians. The renewed program is targeted 
squarely at the objectives of advancing social justice, fostering 
Canadian identity and enhancing civic participation.
<P>
	Without leadership and direction over the past 25 years and into 
the future, we would not have been able to build and maintain this 
open and welcoming society that is a model to the world. We will 
secure these goals by working in partnership across the federal 
government and in harmony with other levels of government, the 
private sector, community groups and Canadians from all walks of 
life.
<P>
	Third, during this year the Government of Canada followed 
through on the Prime Minister's pledge to establish the Canadian 
Race Relations Foundation. Under the leadership of the Hon. 
Lincoln Alexander and a board of distinguished Canadians, the 
foundation will be a linchpin for the sharing of information and 
know-how in promoting even better race relations in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These milestones are markers of a country dedicated to fairness, 
They are also markers of a country determined to use the full range 
of its cultural diversity to tap new markets, build new trade, create 
new jobs, promote new tourism and marshal our competitive 
advantage.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7746"> 7746 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Team Canada works in part because we have citizens with 
knowledge of the different languages, cultures and marketplace of 
trading partners. It works in part because we are widely viewed as a 
society that strives to tap the talents of all Canadians regardless of 
their origins. In the eyes of the world Canada has become a model. 
As we have strived to live together with respect for differences, we 
have honed the skills of accommodation that has made us learn 
how to find a peaceful resolution to conflict.
<P>
	The success of the new direction set for multiculturalism in 1996 
can and will be open for review by Parliament in the years ahead. I 
welcome, and in fact encourage, the ongoing advice of all members 
of Parliament as we continue the work of ensuring that a noble 
Canadian idea provides opportunity for all Canadians and tangible 
benefits for our nation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
closely to the speech made by the Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism as she tabled her annual report of the operation of 
the Canadian Multiculturalism Act.
<P>
	I am pleased that this important position is held by a woman 
from a visible minority. Her multiculturalism policy, however, is a 
complete failure.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	First of all, her government ignores the fact that there is a 
Quebec culture, that there are two founding peoples, two founding 
nations. She referred to tolerance as a basic value. But the fact is 
that, last May, a senior minister of this government suggested that I 
leave Canada and find another place to live because my views 
diverge from those of the government, because I dared criticize its 
immigration policy and because I am a sovereignist member from 
an ethnic community.
<P>
	The secretary of state also spoke of compassion. But in her own 
riding of Vancouver Centre, there is a Salvadoran refugee by the 
name of Maria Barahona who has had to seek refuge in a church 
basement in 1995 and has been living there with her four children 
for more than a year.
<P>
	Neither the secretary of state nor the minister of immigration has 
done a thing to remedy the situation. Racism is on the rise in 
Canada. But there is no word of any specific action, any action plan 
to combat the social scourge of terrorism. There are cutbacks 
everywhere, particularly in the services for which the Secretary of 
State for Multiculturalism is responsible.
<P>
	Ethnic groups are complaining about not getting any subsidies 
any more. This government has stopped advertising in the ethnic 
media, and several papers were forced to close down for lack of 
subsidization and government ads. This is especially true in the 
case of  Latin Americans. This newly established community needs 
the government's support to ensure its harmonious integration into 
the host society.
<P>
	The unemployment rate among visible minorities is alarming. It 
is much higher than the Canadian average. This means there is an 
employment equity act that has not been enforced by the federal 
government. One of the target groups for positive action plans 
should be visible minorities.
<P>
	There is also a need for providing intercultural education to this 
government's officials. Some newcomers to Canada complain 
about abusive or discriminatory behaviour on the part of federal 
officials, particularly citizenship and immigration officials.
<P>
	In a nutshell, equality for all is far from having been achieved in 
Canada in the social, economic, cultural and political areas.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I ask members to put themselves in the position of a 
boatload of German Jewish refugees in June 1939. They were 
turned away from our shores and ended up going back to Europe 
where many died, ending up in the crematoria. At about the same 
time Chinese people were prevented from coming to Canada. We 
acknowledge that our country has not had a particularly welcoming 
attitude to people of other colours, races and backgrounds.
<P>
	If we are ever to be sure to never repeat the errors of the past, it is 
particularly important when discussing and when considering 
multiculturalism to remember the Canada we have today is one of 
which the vast majority of people are very proud. We have a 
deserved reputation around the world for being inviting and 
accommodating.
<P>
	As we use this as an opportunity to consider what 
multiculturalism actually means to our country and its future, 
based on the notion of a multicultural country, it behoves us to bear 
in mind that it is the values we share in common as Canadians that 
are the foundation of our country of the future. And as a rule, all of 
us should live our lives as if we were members of a minority or 
were refugees from some other part of the world.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	Even today there are blemishes on our record. For instance, we 
now have a head tax on immigration, and while that may not be 
very much to some people, for some it is a great deal of money. The 
ability of a person to come to Canada based on their ability to buy 
their way in, even if it is only a bit, is something we should really 
look at and reconsider.
<P>
	In Alberta we had, some time ago, a program of inclusion, to 
make the notion of multiculturalism one of inclusion of all people 
to celebrate it. The key that we had there was one heart, many 
colours. I have yet to hear any description of what multiculturalism 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7747"> 7747 </A></B>
<P>
is about, better  than that, that Canada is a country of people from 
all over the world with one heart of many colours.

	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
petition is signed by many people from my constituency who are 
calling on the House of Commons to ask the government to support 
the immediate initiation and conclusion by the year 2000 of an 
international convention which will set out a binding timetable for 
the abolition of all nuclear weapons.

	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 36, to present in the House 
today some seven petitions from my constituents of 
London-Middlesex and the surrounding area calling on 
Parliament to work closely with the provinces of Canada, in this 
case particularly Ontario, to upgrade the highway system of this 
province and of this country.
<P>
	They note very much the need for such upgrading. They speak to 
the job creation potential of these programs. I am very pleased to 
support these petitions, noting that our infrastructure programs 
should address their concerns.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUNGOFFENDERSACT">YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure pursuant to Standing Order 36 to present four petitions 
today from my riding of Simcoe Centre.
<P>
	The first group of petitioners request that Parliament pass 
legislation to strengthen the Young Offenders Act, including 
publishing the names of young offenders, lowering the age of 
application and transferring serious young offenders to adult court.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CONSENT">CONSENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the second 
petition concerns the age of consent laws. The petitioners ask that 
Parliament set the age of consent at 18 years to protect children 
from sexual exploitation and abuse.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JUSTICE">JUSTICE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the third 
petition concerns violent offenders. The petitioners ask that 
Parliament enact two strikes legislation so that repeat offenders 
will serve life in prison with no chance of parole.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALUNITY">NATIONAL UNITY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the final 
petition concerns national unity. The petitioners ask that 
Parliament declare immediately that Canada is indivisible, except 
if the majority of Canadians agree otherwise in a national 
referendum or unless due to process of an amending formula in our 
Constitution.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HIGHWAYSYSTEM">HIGHWAY SYSTEM</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure today pursuant to Standing Order 36 to 
present a petition to the House of Commons.
<P>
	The petition is signed by residents of my constituency, including 
residents of the town of Cut Knife, the city of North Battleford and 
towns of Wilkie, Unity, Speers, Cando, Chitek Lake, Meota, 
Jackfish Lake and other communities in my riding.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House of Commons 
that 38 per cent of the national highway system is substandard, that 
Mexico and the United States are upgrading their national highway 
system and that the national highway policy study identify job 
creation, economic development, national unity, saving lives and 
avoiding injuries, lower congestion, lower vehicular operating 
costs and better international competitiveness as benefits of the 
proposed national highway program.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to urge the federal 
government to join with provincial governments to make the 
national highway system upgrading possible.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HIGHWAYSYSTEM">HIGHWAY SYSTEM</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Janko Peri</B>G<B> (Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today I have 
the privilege of presenting to the House petitions from concerned 
citizens of my riding of Cambridge and southern Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners wish to draw to the attention of the House that 38 
per cent of the national highway system is substandard. Our 
NAFTA partners are currently upgrading their national highway 
systems. Investment in Canada's national highway system would 
create jobs, spur economic growth, contribute to national unity and 
save lives.
<P>
	For these reasons the petitioners pray and request that the 
Parliament of Canada join with the provincial governments to 
make the upgrading of our national highway system a priority.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MARRIAGE">MARRIAGE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have four 
petitions to present today.
<P>
	The first petition which is signed by 106 people requests that the 
House of Commons enact legislation to amend the existing 
legislation to define marriage as the voluntary union for life of one 
woman and one man to each other, to the exclusion of all others.

Parliament not increase the federal excise tax on gasoline in the 
next federal budget.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HIGHWAYSYSTEM">HIGHWAY SYSTEM</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the last two

make the national highway upgrading system position.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FISHERIES">FISHERIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Labrador, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have two petitions to present. One is from Black Tickle, Labrador 
having to do with the emergency state of the economy.
<P>
	Five years ago Black Tickle had nearly 100 per cent employment 
in the fisheries. Right now it is 6 per cent and the people of 
Labrador and the community of Black Tickle are calling on the 
Government of Canada and particularly the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans to do something about the allocation of 
quotas so the fish plant may be reopened.
<P>
	The second petition I wish to present is again to the department 
of fisheries having to do with the adjacency issue of fisheries, 
signed by hundreds of people of my riding from along the coast of 
Labrador.
<P>
	The petitioners call on the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
and the Government of Canada to consider the adjacency issue and 
give them a fair and decent allocation of fish.

about the labelling practice in the marketing of generic drugs. They 
call on Parliament to regulate the practice of keeping generic drugs 
in the size, shape and colour which is similar to that of the brand

the Prime Minister and Parliament will declare and confirm 
immediately that Canada is indivisible and that the boundaries of 
Canada, its provinces, territories and territorial waters, may be 
modified only by a free vote of all Canadian citizens as guaranteed

second petition is from Brantford, Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the House 
that homosexuals already have the rights, excluding sexual 
orientation, from the human rights act. It is not a question of 
equality. All Canadians have the same legal protection and basic 
rights under existing laws.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners pray that the term sexual orientation 
not be included in the human rights act.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Yesterday 
we indicated that we hoped to wring a concession out of the 
government that if it would not move time allocation we would 
agree to go along with the request not to read this entire set of 
amendments into the record. The government did not give us that 
assurance which is unfortunate because it has moved time 
allocation dozens of times in this House.
<P>
	Having said that, we feel it is not fair to the Speaker or to the 
people of the country who are waiting to hear the debate on this 
bill. If members on the other side and in the Bloc would go along 
with it, we would be happy to give our concurrence to allow the 
Speaker to dispense with the reading of the amendments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois supports the 
proposal made by the Reform Party member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, as much as we are enjoying the 
very fine job you are doing in reading these amendments, it is 
putting a strain on you. I regret that as a result of the wishes of the 
other parties opposite, that is what we had to do last night and this 
morning, riveting  television though it may be. I am sure we would 
also be pleased to begin the debate on this group.
<P>

<B><A NAME="7751"> 7751 </A></B>
<P>
	May I ask my hon. colleagues opposite, does this mean we 
would proceed to debating the motions in this group at this time? 
To clarify, my understanding is that we would take all the motions 
in this group as having been read and proceed to the debate.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, the proposal made by the Reform 
Party member is quite clear. The government was asked, as regards 
the GST, an issue which is not at all to its credit, not to invoke 
closure on Bill C-70 either today or later.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we have nothing against you. We like you, but as 
long as the government does not guarantee that it will not gag us, 
each motion will have to be read.
<P>
	Liberal members across the floor must stop displaying this 
holier-than-thou attitude. After all, they are the ones to blame for 
the many times closure was imposed on us over the last three and a 
half years. This is their way of doing things and it is totally 
undemocratic.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I might ask, colleagues, is it also implied 
in what has been said that we are going to have the questions 
deemed to be put or not deemed to be put on the motions in this 
particular group?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify it. I am 
afraid the hon. member opposite has now changed what I 
understood the member of the third party to have suggested. He 
suggested that in light of the inconvenience of your having to read 
through all of these amendments, we could take them as having 
been read. I am saying on behalf of the government that we would 
be agreeable with that and that is all I am saying.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me see if I can be of assistance to 
my colleagues.
<P>
	I believe the parliamentary secretary is asking the House to 
consider, over and above its co-operation as to the motions having 
been read, that if votes are requested that they would be deemed 
deferred as opposed to having to make the request each and every 
time with the yeas and the nays and so on. I would ask the Chair, 
can that be done?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is much clearer when the 
government whip tells us. Yes, we agree to have the divisions on 
these motions deemed to have been deferred.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I think I get the sense of the 
House that all of the motions in this grouping will be deemed to 
have been moved, seconded and read. If a division is demanded it 
will be deemed deferred. Is that agreeable?

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-70 be amended by deleting Clause 255.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We now proceed to debate on the motions in 
Group No. 2.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a bill which, according to the 
motions tabled, deals with the GST harmonization process in three 
Maritime provinces.
<P>
	Where is the harmonization? What do they mean by 
harmonization? There is no harmonization in this bill, in this 
agreement with the Maritimes. It is a local agreement.
<P>
	When it comes to harmony, we heard from witnesses in the 
finance committee recently that they are far from having harmony 
in the three Maritime provinces. This is particularly true for the 
businessmen who are, at the present time, furious with the 
government because of one of the so-called harmonization clauses, 
which would include in the product price the 15 per cent tax rate 
decreed by the government, which replaces the GST in these three 
provinces and the numerous sales taxes that were in place until 
now.
<P>
	Imagine the terrible headache this represents for businesses 
which distribute their products to other Canadian provinces, or 
have branches in those provinces. It is already difficult for a 
business to manage a price structure when a number of different 
products are involved, so imagine managing not one price structure 
but two, with all that this involves in the way of computer 
programs, stock management plans and so on.
<P>
	Businessmen in these three provinces have asked the 
government to review this section of its bill in order not to include 
the new tax in the price, because they no longer know which side is 
up. This is the first point in  any discussion of harmonization: that 
there is no harmonization.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7753"> 7753 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, when we speak of harmonization, we must speak of true 
harmonization. In 1991, Quebec harmonized its sales tax with the 
federal GST. Quebec even collects the GST on behalf of the federal 
government.
<P>
	Quebec has never demanded, nor has it ever received, 
compensation for losses or costs incurred because of this 
harmonization. The three Maritime provinces have come to the aid 
of the Minister of Finance on the GST, accepting the so-called 
harmonization, which is supposed to serve as a model for all of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	However, this gesture costs $1 billion or thereabouts, $961 
million, if I remember correctly, in compensation. This is nearly $1 
billion our generous Minister of Finance paid, using our money, the 
money of taxpayers who are listening, to compensate the maritimes 
as part of a purely political agreement which does nothing to deal 
with the problem of the GST and especially not the problems 
Canadian Liberals have with the GST.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, his Minister of Finance and the Deputy 
Prime Minister made a solemn commitment in 1993, in 1992 even 
before the election campaign and as far back as 1989, when the 
GST was coming on stream, to scrap this hated tax. That is how the 
Liberals referred to the GST. They ranted and raved. They said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``We will strike the GST''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
Those are the words of the Prime Minister. The Deputy Prime 
Minister said: ``We hate this tax and we will scrap it''. They have 
not scrapped it, and now they want to harmonize it. It will costs us 
$1 billion for a harmonization that in fact does not exist and which 
is not what the Canadian public understood those guys opposite 
would do.
<P>
	They served us up a pack of lies, and they have been doing that 
for three and a half years. A few days ago I was listening to the 
Premier of New Brunswick, Frank McKenna. I must admit I was 
shocked, upset and even insulted by the way he behaved on his trip 
to Asia with Team Canada. I think it is inconscionable that on his 
Asian trip, the Premier of New Brunswick, instead of recruiting 
local companies or attracting potential customers, governments 
and big corporations, was trying to recruit companies from Quebec 
and get them to move to New Brunswick.
<P>
	Do you know what Mr. McKenna's message is when he does this 
kind of recruiting, when he tries to steal from his neighbour on a 
trip intended as an opportunity to find new international markets 
and not to steal companies from Quebec? Do you know what he 
told  those companies? He told them what he told companies from 
Ontario: ``If you move to our province, for the next two or three 
years, your corporate tax burden will be reduced by $400 million''. 
So where will those $400 million come from?
<P>
	What a coincidence: it just happens to be New Brunswick's share 
of the compensation paid by the federal government for 
harmonizing the provincial sales tax with the GST.
<P>
	What this means, and this is absolutely crazy and unfair to boot, 
is that federal money, one quarter of which comes out of the 
pockets of Quebecers, is used to finance a corporate raider, Mr. 
McKenna, so he can attract Quebec companies and in the process 
transfer Quebec jobs to New Brunswick. That is the spirit of 
federalism. Amazing. I never saw anything like it.
<P>
	New Brunswick is no longer the poor little province from the 
maritimes. New Brunswick is building itself an industrial force in 
the high tech sector with our money and, what is more, its premier 
had the gall in Asia to raid our firms in an effort to attract them to 
New Brunswick. This is unacceptable and it is an indirect effect of 
a supposed political harmonization of sales taxes in the maritimes 
that our show off Minister of Finance presented as a revelation he 
received from somewhere or other to get out of the mess the 
government was in with the GST.
<P>
	This minister, who claims to be a strong federalist and who 
would thus normally treat all the provinces in Canada the same way 
and co-operate with them, ends up subsidizing one province to dip 
into another, its neighbour, and draw business away. It makes no 
sense. This kind of behaviour is unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	If the approach used in the case of the famous compensation of 
nearly $1 billion, which comes out of our pockets to buy three 
maritime provinces in the GST-sales tax harmonization process, 
were applied to what Quebec did in 1991, the federal government 
ought to pay Quebec $2 billion.
<P>
	If it insists on paying this compensation of nearly $1 billion, it 
should pay the Quebec government $2 billion. ``Out of the 
question'', say government representatives, ``have you lost your 
marbles?'' We have not lost our marbles. If we used the 
calculations and the logic the Minister of Finance put forward in 
signing the agreement with the maritime provinces, then, if the 
maritime provinces are entitled to nearly $1 billion, Quebec is 
entitled to nearly $2 billion for the harmonization it has done since 
1991. This is in addition to the other bills we have often sent the 
government, but this one, I must admit, is particularly hard to take.
<P>
	In Quebec in 1991, we were good boys and girls. We decided we 
were going to make things easy for our businesses and set an 
example as well by harmonizing  and thus lead a movement in the 
other provinces of Canada toward a harmonized system to facilitate 
interprovincial trade. Billions are involved. Trade between Ontario 
and Quebec in particular represents $36 billion. Our reward for this 
vision is nothing. We are being treated as if we are worth less than 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7754"> 7754 </A></B>
<P>
nothing. The maritimes get $1 billion. We are entitled to $2 billion, 
instead we are sent packing as if our request were unwarranted.
<P>
	So, clearly, in the motions in Group No. 2 on harmonization, we 
totally disagree with the unreasonable, unfair and unacceptable 
scheme in the three maritime provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Normally the members who are opposed 
to the motion explain why and then the parliamentary secretary 
sums up why the government agrees or disagrees. It is the minister 
who has moved the motions and accordingly I will go to the 
Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am under your guidance. When we 
group motions like this, it is a little bit confusing for us. The 
problem arises because within the grouping are some motions put 
forward by the government and some by the opposition. I would 
propose to speak now in favour of the motions we have put forward 
and in that same 10 minute allotment in opposition to some of the 
others, followed by my colleague opposite.
<P>
	There are three things I want to say. First is in response to what 
the hon. Bloc Quebecois member has said with respect to 
adjustment assistance. As he well knows, there is no basis for the 
claim that Quebec would qualify for adjustment assistance based 
on the formula that is being applied for that assistance to the 
maritimes. Quebec simply did not incur any loss of sales tax 
revenue as a result of harmonizing and that is just a fact of life. The 
formula requires adjustment assistance if a province loses 
approximately 5 per cent in sales tax revenue in moving to 
adjustment. In fact Quebec made money. That is the way it was; 
there is no justification for adjustment assistance.
<P>
	Second is with respect to harmonization.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Members of the Bloc oppose harmonization. This is very 
strange, because there is harmonization in Quebec. Is it because 
Quebecers want to keep the benefits and advantages of 
harmonization for themselves, for their businesses and their 
consumers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is no question that harmonization provides a comparative 
advantage. Provinces that are harmonizing will have a more 
efficient business sector and cheaper  prices for consumers than 
ones that are not. I detect underlying this intense opposition to 
harmonization, striking the word throughout the bill as the 
opposition proposes, is an attempt to deny the benefits of 
harmonization to provinces that live right next door to Quebec and 
to preserve those advantages for Quebec. I hope I am not right, but 
I suspect that may underlie some of the opposition.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	The government motions to amend clauses 150, 160, 198, 203, 
204, 241 and 254 are related. They would ensure that the provincial 
component of the HST would apply to Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland offshore areas in relation to activities to which the 
Canada-Newfoundland-Atlantic accord implementation act and the 
Canada-Nova Scotia offshore petroleum resources accord 
implementation act apply.
<P>
	This treatment would be consistent with the terms of the existing 
offshore petroleum resources accord, Canada-Nova Scotia and the 
Canada-Newfoundland-Atlantic accord and the related 
implementation act under which taxes equivalent to retail sales 
taxes in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland currently apply.
<P>
	Further, among the motions, subclause 150(6) of Bill C-70 
enacts a new definition of basic tax content for purposes of part IX 
of the Excise Tax Act.
<P>
	The concept of basic tax content is principally used to determine 
the amount of additional input tax credits that a registrant may 
claim when the registrant increases the extent to which capital 
property is used in commercial activities and the amount of input 
tax credits that are recaptured when the use of the capital property 
and commercial activities are reduced.
<P>
	Generally, the basic tax content of the property is the tax that was 
payable on the acquisition after deducting rebates on certain other 
amounts that the purchaser was entitled to recover and after taking 
into account depreciation of the property.
<P>
	The motion proposes to include in the calculation of a basic tax 
content a tax that would have been payable but for the fact that the 
purchaser acquired the property for use exclusively in commercial 
activities. This change will ensure that the correct result is obtained 
in determining the amount to be remitted or recaptured if there is a 
subsequent change in the use of the property.
<P>
	Government Motion No. 63 proposes to amend clause 204 of 
Bill C-70, which adds new section 220.06 to the Excise Tax Act. 
This section ensures that goods delivered to a purchaser in a 
participating province do not escape the 8 per cent component of 
the HST when they are supplied by an unregistered, non-resident 
person who has not paid the tax on bringing the goods into Canada 
or into the province.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7755"> 7755 </A></B>
<P>
	In this case, as a result of section 220.06, the recipient could 
be assessed a tax. The proposed amendments remove the 
references in the section to a ``specified motor vehicle'' that is 
required to be registered in a participating province. These 
references are inappropriate because a special regime is intended 
to apply to sales of registerable motor vehicles.
<P>
	Where a registerable motor vehicle is sold by a non-registrant, in 
circumstances in which the 7 per cent GST does not apply, as in the 
case covered by section 220.06, neither should the 8 per cent 
component apply. Instead, a special 15 per cent provincial levy will 
apply to the vehicle which will be payable to provincial licensing 
authorities when the vehicle is registered in the province.
<P>
	Therefore, section 220.06 should not apply at all to sales by 
non-registrants of motor vehicles that are required to be registered 
in a participating province. The amendments also clarify when the 
tax under section 220.06 becomes payable.
<P>
	In conclusion, I apologize for that bit of reading into the record 
but it is required in order to adequately explain some technical 
amendments to the act.
<P>
	I would only add that with respect to motor vehicles, yesterday 
we heard some suggestion of an unlevel playing field between 
people who sell vehicles privately and people who purchase used 
vehicles from dealers.
<P>
	If members opposite understood the impact of the harmonization 
legislation, they would understand that in participating provinces 
there will be a level playing field because registrants' provinces, 
when purchasers register a vehicle, will be paying all sales taxes 
applicable. That will alleviate a situation that prevails and will 
continue to prevail in provinces that are declining to harmonize at 
this time.
<P>
	It is a dramatic improvement in those provinces that are 
harmonizing.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak once again to Bill C-70, in particular to this group 
of motions.
<P>
	There seems to be a common theme not only in how the bill 
came into being, but in the whole process that surrounds Bill C-70. 
It really explains why people are so concerned about the 
harmonization legislation. The common theme is a general lack of 
accountability, a lack of being able to hold the government 
accountable, and a series of gaps that have made the GST a real tar 
baby in terms of governments being able to deal with it and not 
draw all kinds of flack.
<P>
	Let me start by going back a bit in time. I want to follow up on 
comments that were made by members of the Bloc Quebecois. 
First, we need to remember how this legislation came about in the 
first place. In 1993 during the election campaign the Prime 
Minister and the current  Deputy Prime Minister said that under a 
Liberal government the GST would be gone, it would be 
eliminated. Of course, that is not the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> I did not say that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> The hon. member across the way says he did not 
say that. The Prime Minister in a town hall meeting denied that he 
said it too. ``I did not say that. Show me where I said it''. 
Unfortunately, for him the public record is very clear because 
minutes later the CBC showed clips of the Prime Minister saying 
on national television: ``We will kill it. We will scrap it''. A clip 
was shown of him in a radio station during the election campaign 
saying that the GST would be gone.
<P>
	I remember very well how the Prime Minister tried to dress 
down the young woman from Montreal for having the audacity to 
try and hold him accountable. What a terrible thing to do. That has 
become a common theme. I will explain a little more about that in 
just a moment.
<P>
	During the months that followed the election, members of the 
government tried to downplay their election promise. They tried to 
say that what they really said was they would replace the GST. 
However, they knew that statement was not resonating very well 
with the public. The opposition was making yards here in the 
House when we kept pointing out that the government made a 
promise and it was not being fulfilled.
<P>
	Finally, the Deputy Prime Minister conducted a poll to see if she 
could resign and still get re-elected in Hamilton East. She did, 
indeed, conduct the poll at great expense to the taxpayers. Then a 
byelection was held that cost a lot of money and, of course, she was 
subsequently re-elected.
<P>
	Canadians were expecting more. When members say they are 
going to resign, it does not mean they are going to resign and run 
again right away. Nevertheless, that points once again to a lack of 
accountability in the House of Commons. People want members of 
Parliament to be responsible for what they say.
<P>
	A little further along we get to the point where we are having 
discussions about the harmonized sales tax because the government 
said: ``To get us out of this, we are going to give Atlantic Canada $1 
billion''. That is what it did. Atlantic Canada had no interest in a 
harmonized sales tax at all until the $1 billion was slapped down on 
the table. To get the government out of this promise it slapped 
down the $1 billion and Atlantic Liberal premiers said: ``Maybe we 
are interested after all''. Just show people the colour of money and 
it is amazing what they will do.
<P>
	We had that incident. What followed? Ultimately legislation 
came down and hearings were held. Were hearings held in Atlantic 
Canada where this was going to affect people? Reform members 
moved an amendment during the hearings and Liberal MPs said: 
``We are not going to extend the hearings. We are not going to have  
hearings in Atlantic Canada,'' despite the hue and cry from people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7756"> 7756 </A></B>
<P>
in Atlantic Canada who were saying there were all kinds of flaws 
with the bill.
<P>
	We heard dozens of witnesses who said: ``We have big problems 
with tax in pricing and big problems with many components of the 
bill''. The fact that people had many problems with the HST and 
the fact that the government acknowledged there were problems 
with it and tried to make some changes along the way, points out 
that Atlantic Canadian MPs were not listening to the people of 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Why were the people of Atlantic Canada not allowed to have 
hearings in Atlantic Canada? This is one of the most fundamental 
tax changes in the history of Atlantic Canada. Certainly it is 
taxation without consultation. I would argue it is taxation without 
representation.
<P>
	Business group after business group, all kinds of people 
representing provincial jurisdictions, came before the finance 
committee and said: ``Here is a problem''. If Liberal MPs in 
Atlantic Canada had been representing their constituents that 
would have never happened because the Liberal MPs would have 
gone to the finance minister and told him that people have raised 
these concerns and they should be dealt with.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, do you know what happened? They did not do that. 
They were mute. That is bad enough, but they allowed businesses 
to close in Atlantic Canada because of this legislation. They said 
nothing and people in Atlantic Canada lost their jobs. They lost 
their livelihood.
<P>
	Debate is ongoing in this country about child poverty. The 
children in the homes of the people who have lost their jobs already 
or who probably will, according to business people who appeared 
before the committee, are going to be in a situation where their 
parents do not have an income. I would argue that is one of the 
biggest reasons why we have child poverty. In this case the 
government is actively encouraging unemployment by not being 
sensible about the tax in pricing component of this bill. The Liberal 
MPs in Atlantic Canada have done a horrible job of representing 
their constituents.
<P>
	Where were they when all the negative aspects of this bill came 
forward? People from around the country were forced to come to 
Ottawa to make their case. That was the job of the Liberal MPs but 
they were silent. They were mute. Some Atlantic Canadian MPs are 
cabinet ministers. They sit around the cabinet table. They did 
nothing: the fisheries minister, the defence minister. Many of them 
sit around the cabinet table and they were absolutely silent.
<P>
	Not only is that regrettable but in a modern democracy that is 
unforgivable. In a modern democracy when people are expected to 
make very difficult decisions every day in their lives, those same 
people certainly have the  ability to be involved in the debate about 
the future of their tax system, something that is a fundamental part 
of everybody's economic well-being. I want to make a strong 
argument that the Liberal government has completely failed the 
people of Atlantic Canada in giving them the type of representation 
that all Canadians deserve.
<P>
	I have one final point because my time is running short. The 
government led physicians and the providers of private ambulance 
services to believe that it was truly interested in restoring tax 
fairness in the taxation system. It led them to believe that perhaps 
under this legislation it would amend the act so that physicians and 
providers of health care would be given equal treatment under the 
taxation system with many others.
<P>
	The problem is that physicians and private ambulance services 
are not allowed to pass on GST costs like other small business 
people are. Therefore, they have to bear those costs themselves. 
For doctors it amounts to something like $1,500 per year per 
physician.
<P>
	I heard the finance minister yesterday say that he is very 
concerned about tax fairness and how the government has closed 
this loophole and that loophole. Is it not interesting that the 
government is only concerned about tax fairness when it means 
more money for the government, when it means taking more 
money out of people's pockets? But when it comes to treating 
people equally and perhaps having to give a little money back, it 
does not want to hear about it. Tax fairness? That is not tax fairness. 
Tax fairness is only when we take money away, and I think that is 
wrong.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I make the point that again that the government has an obligation 
to treat everybody equally under the tax code, including physicians 
and private ambulance services.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to say a few 
words on the report stage motions in Group No. 2 regarding some 
aspects of Bill C-70.
<P>
	Bill C-70 is essentially legislation that gives the government the 
opportunity to enter into agreements with Atlantic provinces to 
harmonize the hated goods and services tax with the provincial 
sales taxes in the provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and 
New Brunswick. It is interesting to note that the province of Prince 
Edward Island is absent from that list. Prince Edward Island has 
just completed a provincial election. Its government changed hands 
and a new government is now in place.
<P>
	There have been a couple of elections in Atlantic Canada since 
this harmonization deal was proposed. The results are certainly 
interesting to look at. The federal Liberal government should pay 
some attention to the results of those elections. I speak of the 
Prince Edward Island election and the provincial byelection in the 
constituency of Halifax Fairview.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7757"> 7757 </A></B>
<P>
	Both election campaigns had tax fairness and harmonization as 
a key component. If the Liberals look at the results of those two 
elections they will see that they have a lot more responsibility yet 
to give to the people they have been elected to represent. With 
the government changing hands after the Prince Edward Island 
election, the former Liberal government was removed and a new 
Conservative government was put in place.
<P>
	New Democrats are very proud that for the first time in the 
history of the province of Prince Edward Island, a New Democrat 
was elected to that provincial chamber; not only a New Democrat 
but the leader of the provincial New Democratic Party, Dr. Herb 
Dickieson, a medical physician, a practitioner who campaigned 
very strongly not only on taxation matters and representation but 
on health care as well. There is certainly a message this 
government should be taking from these results.
<P>
	More important, in the province of Nova Scotia the new leader 
of the federal New Democratic Party, Alexa McDonough, served 
her constituents well in the provincial legislature for 14 years. She 
had to resign that seat in order to take the position as leader of the 
federal New Democratic Party, and we hope very soon to have her 
joining us here in the House of Commons so she can bring the 
views of Nova Scotian New Democrats and of all Canadians to this 
Chamber.
<P>
	When we look at the election that replaced Alexa McDonough in 
Halifax Fairview, the Liberal government in the province of Nova 
Scotia said prior to that byelection that when the byelection was 
called it would put its all into it, that it would campaign on its 
record, that it would campaign on taxation, on how it was dealing 
with harmonizing the provincial tax with the federal GST. The 
people of Halifax responded very clearly to the challenge of the 
premier of Nova Scotia, a challenge that said ``our record on 
taxation is on the line''. Not only did the government get defeated 
in that byelection, but a New Democrat who campaigned on tax 
fairness was elected in that byelection with 65 per cent of the vote.
<P>
	Everyone in Canada seems to think that New Democrats are 
western based, that the New Democratic Party is a party that 
defends western interests via small protest votes in the House of 
Commons. But 65 per cent of the people of Halifax Fairview said to 
the Government of Nova Scotia and to the Liberal members of 
Parliament in this House that this harmonization deal is wrong, 
they do not buy it, they do not accept it and they want a New 
Democrat representing their interests, giving their comments to 
government in this House of Commons. Those two elections in 
Atlantic Canada certainly indicate why it is necessary that more 
New Democrats are elected in the next federal election to this 
House of Commons, more New Democrats who speak clearly on 
behalf of Canadian interests, the middle class and working 
Canadians right across this country from coast to coast.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	We are looking at a harmonization deal in Atlantic Canada and 
that is why I raise those two issues here in the Chamber today. 
There are other issues right across Canada that could come about as 
a result of the acceptance of this harmonization deal for the three 
Atlantic provinces that are signing on. All Canadians have a 
responsibility to examine this deal, check out this legislation and 
see what is happening in the Atlantic provinces so as to avoid 
similar things happening in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Although this is called harmonization there is very little 
harmony in the way in which this legislation is being implemented 
or the way in which the idea is being accepted by people in Atlantic 
Canada. The consumers, retailers, interest groups, the clergy and 
others have not found much harmony in the way in which they 
respond to this legislation.
<P>
	I think this is recognized in the fact that the name has changed 
several times during this process as well. You were in this House, 
Mr. Speaker, when the hated goods and services tax was brought in 
by the previous government. The GST was considered by a lot of 
Canadians, there was great turmoil in this House of Commons and 
elsewhere, and as a result of that turmoil we have a country that is 
divided over sales tax and the implementation of sales tax regimes.
<P>
	Prior to the introduction of the goods and services tax, retail 
taxes were primarily the prerogative of provincial governments. 
Yes, there was a manufacturers sales tax levelled for the federal 
government at the wholesale level, the manufacturers level. But the 
retail prerogative was primarily the responsibility of provincial 
governments.
<P>
	Provincial governments used that prerogative to establish social 
policy within the provinces as well as using the taxes as a source of 
revenue. Many provinces did not tax books. Virtually no province 
in this country taxed labour costs. No province wanted to tax 
children's clothing or food items. With the introduction of the 
goods and services tax there was a tax applied to some of those 
matters that the provinces had chosen not to tax in the interests of 
the consumers and the residents of those provinces. I forgot to 
mention home heating fuel and even the costs of funerals which 
many of our provinces decided should not be taxed.
<P>
	As we move into the harmonization of the GST we are seeing 
that the provinces lose that prerogative to use tax policy for social 
purposes and to exempt certain income levels of people from retail 
taxation and to exempt certain classes of items from retail taxation. 
The GST and now the harmonization system has removed that.
<P>
	It was originally called the manufacturers sales tax, MST. With 
the Conservative government it became the  GST, the goods and 
services tax. The government in changing the system and wanting 
to blend it with the provincial sales taxes began calling it the 
blended sales tax, BST. It did not like the sound of BST so now the 
harmonized tax is called the HST. For those who like to think about 
these things remember the words of Alexa McDonough in a speech 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7758"> 7758 </A></B>
<P>
recently. She said with regard to this new BS tax, now the HST tax 
``what have they got against horses?'' I think this is a very 
interesting situation that we have happening in this country. While 
there are a lot of things to be said on these individual motions and 
on the bill itself, I am sure I will have other things to say on the 
next round of motions.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	I hope to be able to put a few additional comments with respect 
to the motions and the harmonization deal on the record later in the 
day.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to speak at report stage of Bill C-70, an act to amend 
the Excise Tax Act, the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements 
Act, the Income Tax Act, the Debt Servicing and Reduction 
Account Act and related Acts.
<P>
	This bill is a collection of various amendments to the GST, 
which will become the HST, or the harmonized sales tax. Let me 
tell you right now that this tax is very unpopular in my riding of 
Bourassa, in Montreal North, especially among business people. I 
must add that I support the motions put forward by the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, which are included in Group No. 2.
<P>
	This Liberal government is highly embarrassed by the broken 
promise of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage to abolish, scrap, and kill the GST. As we all know, the 
member for York South-Weston even left the Liberal Party over 
this broken promise among other things.
<P>
	The Liberals are bent on reaching an agreement with the 
maritime provinces for harmonizing this tax, which will cost 
Quebecers and Canadians nearly one million dollars. Moreover, the 
government intends to ram this legislation through, which 
undermines the quality of democratic life in Canada.
<P>
	By the way, the Liberals allowed only three days of public 
hearings on this crucial, essential, very important bill. The 
opposition asked that the consultations be extended, but their 
request was rejected by the Liberal majority on the Standing 
Committee on Finance. The government wants to put an end right 
now to this embarrassing issue of the GST, even though Bill C-70 is 
a very bad bill.
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign, the Prime Minister kept 
repeating: ``We will scrap the GST. Nous  allons éliminer la TPS''. 
Later, on May 2, 1994, he said: ``We hate this tax and we are going 
to eliminate it''. This broken promise will be very costly for the 
Liberal Party of Canada in the next election.
<P>
	In a minority report dating back to November 1989, Liberals, 
when they were the opposition, stated: ``The Liberal members of 
the finance committee maintain that the goods and services tax 
proposed by the Tory government is bad and that no ``repair job'' of 
any kind will make it fair for taxpayers''. What the Liberals are 
doing now with Bill C-70 is nothing but a repair job, a cosmetic 
make-over.
<P>
	GST remains as it is, at the same rate, whereas the provincial tax 
is the one doing the harmonizing. There can be no sales tax reform 
without a reform of personal and corporate income taxes nor 
without the involvement of other levels of government. Canada has 
to undertake a tax reform encompassing every form of taxation at 
all levels of government.
<P>
	Like the Bloc Quebecois, I demand for Quebec a $2 billion 
compensation for having harmonized the QST with the GST. It is 
unacceptable that the federal compensation formula should help 
Atlantic provinces compete fiercely with Quebec in the quest for 
new investments. When I see in Quebec newspapers ads by 
maritime provinces seeking to lure away Quebec businesses, to me 
thats provocation.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	The $400 million federal compensation paid to New Brunswick 
will be used to finance the income tax reductions announced in 
December by the finance minister of that province. I condemn the 
raiding campaign launched by Premier McKenna against Quebec.
<P>
	The federal government is showing a lack of openness and 
fairness in that matter. It refuses to communicate detailed data on 
the maritimes. This refusal is unacceptable considering that a $1 
billion compensation will be paid to those provinces from the 
income tax and other taxes paid by all Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	If the federal government really wants to help boost Quebec's 
economy, it will have to give Quebecers the money coming to them 
in all fairness. On May 21, 1996, the Quebec government asked for 
a $1.9 billion compensation under the adjustment assistance 
program. Quebec harmonized its tax with the federal tax and is in 
charge of its administration. It is easy to see that co-operating with 
the federal government is not very profitable.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to mention that yesterday, my party, the 
Bloc Quebecois, has made public an excellent report demanding an 
overhaul of our personal income tax. In 1996, it had a similar report 
on the corporate income tax, a report that drew compliments from 
the finance minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7759"> 7759 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope the federal government will implement recommendations 
and proposals from those two reports in its upcoming budget. It 
should be bringing some order back, and a higher degree of 
fairness, in our tax system. For example, we know that Canadian 
banks do not pay their fair share of taxes when they are hoarding 
staggering profits of over $6 billion. We have the same problem 
with the chairmen of these banks. They are paid huge salaries but 
do not contribute a fair amount to government revenues.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois report contains a number of suggestions to 
make our tax system more stable and fair. Rich taxpayers should 
pay more, and the poor should pay a little less. Taxpayers with big 
salaries could end up paying about $1,500 more each year, and 
those in the middle class as much as $800 less. Extra federal 
revenues would amount to $2.5 billion. This is an remarkable 
proposal by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	We should also be closing loopholes available to the rich. I 
congratulate the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot on the 
excellent job he has done in this matter, and more particularly 
concerning his RRSP-Employment proposal. The Bloc Quebecois 
report suggests something extremely innovative, that is, to create 
an Employment RRSP program, which would allow the 
unemployed to start their own businesses with funds from their 
RRSPs. According to this report, maximum withdrawals of 
$25,000 would be repaid over 13 years. This tax initiative is very 
fair and should create many jobs.
<P>
	I have seen the response of the labour movement, in particular 
the CLC, which is demanding more fairness in tax system. They 
say that the current tax system is not fair, that average income 
earners must bear a disproportionate tax burden. This view is 
shared by the whole labour movement.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	However, the government in its last budget cut part of the tax 
credits for the workers' fund, in particular the Fonds de solidarité 
of the FTQ. As a former unionist, I cannot accept the government 
making cuts in this outstanding job creation tool.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
particularly pleased to participate in the debate with you in the 
Chair. I am sure you remember all too well how you were treated 
by the governing party when you stuck to your principles and was 
kicked out of the party. I commend you for taking that stand.
<P>
	Here we are just four days back sitting in this House and we are 
debating some aspects of the GST. That should be good news to 
Canadians because by now every Canadian must know about all the 
promises government members made, from the Prime Minister to 
all the Liberal candidates who knocked on doors during the last  
election promising voters that if elected they would abolish, kill or 
scrap the GST.
<P>
	Having made all those promises to do away with the GST, the 
government finally got around to legislation to accomplish that. Is 
that what we are debating? Are we debating the government's 
promises? Are we debating a bill that would see the end of the 
GST? After all that is what the promises were. No, that is not the 
debate, not at all.
<P>
	So much for the Liberals' broken promises. Instead of debating a 
bill to end the GST and reduce it to the rubble heap where it 
belongs, we are debating the harmonization of the tax, not reducing 
this most reviled tax to the rubble heap, but how to harmonize the 
tax with the provincial sales taxes in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Let us look for a moment at the word harmonize and then briefly 
examine why the government targeted Atlantic Canada 
specifically. Harmonize is such a nice word. It rings like music to 
the ears and well it should because the word has a soothing, 
musical connotation. But that is not all. It also implies a sense of 
unity, which is not something this government knows too much 
about, a sense of togetherness and co-operation. When applied to 
the GST however, harmonization means the four <I>C's</I>. When applied 
to the GST, harmonization means coercion, confusion, cost and 
cover-up.
<P>
	Why target Atlantic Canada? Probably because it was the most 
vulnerable. Atlantic Canada has been dealt several serious blows 
by the powers residing in Ottawa. The golden triangle interests 
became concerned about the economic muscle and the trade 
activity that characterized Atlantic Canada for decades, possibly 
even centuries. Ottawa effectively wiped out the shipbuilding 
industry, which at one time was a flourishing industry; the fishing 
industry, and we all know about that; the sealing industry, and God 
knows what else. Well, I guess we do know.
<P>
	Eventually Atlantic Canada will have to bear the costs of 
harmonization of the GST, notwithstanding the billion dollar 
incentive to embrace it now. But more about costs a little later if 
time permits.
<P>
	Let us turn to the first <I>C</I>, coercion. Part of the harmonization 
plan would force businesses to hide the new harmonized sales tax, 
the HST, in the price of the product or service being sold. And here 
is the clincher. Businesses in Atlantic Canada had better be aware 
of this and I am sure they are. They should be well aware of this, 
but perhaps there are people across the country who still may not 
know. Here it is: Shopkeepers, businesses, people who make a 
mistake and sell a product without including the tax in the price 
would face fines, jail and hence a criminal record. And that is it. It 
is off to the calaboose, to the gulag for those brave souls who would 
reveal how much tax Canadian consumers are paying. That is right, 
it is off to jail, which is absolutely despicable.
<P>

<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Imagine this happening in a country that boasts about its 
freedoms, liberties and open society. While rapists and robbers can 
be granted absolute discharges by a judge under sections 763 and 
737 of the Criminal Code, Gramps, Pops or Annie down at the 
cornerstore will be excluded under these sections and they will rot, 
will languish in jail for not including the HST in the price of a 
chocolate bar.
<P>
	Will this government reduce our country and subject Canadians 
to this kind of lunacy? It is absolutely unbelievable. This reminds 
me of Bill C-68, the gun control bill. Criminals will possess and 
use their guns but farmer Jones who may forget to register his .22 
or his 12 gauge will be hauled off to jail. If farmer Jones is a grain 
farmer and does the unthinkable, that is, he sells his wheat or barley 
to the Americans, then Mr. Jones faces a double whammy. Mr. 
Jones could be in the same fix as Mr. McMechan.
<P>
	Andy McMechan did what any other owner of a product in 
Canada can rightfully do which is they can sell their product 
abroad. That is what Andy McMechan did. He also did the 
unthinkable. He sold his wheat to the Americans, just like a steel 
maker or any kind of fabricator or a cattleman or someone selling 
any kind of service. These people can sell their goods and services 
abroad, even to the Americans. But farmers cannot sell their wheat 
or barley abroad without first selling it to the Canadian Wheat 
Board and then buying it back at a greatly jacked up price. Then 
with a permit they can sell it abroad, even to the Americans.
<P>
	Andy refused to buy back his own wheat and barley, but he did 
sell to the Americans. Then they came, probably at midnight or 
maybe just before dawn so the neighbours could not see. 
Government officials descended on McMechan's farm to seize his 
farm truck which he would not allow. Then the government 
officials hauled Andy off to jail without his being formally 
charged.
<P>
	Get this. Andy McMechan languished in jail for about six 
months without being formally charged, but they allowed him to 
spend Christmas with his family. He risks losing his farm because 
of the coercion of the government.
<P>
	Did Andy receive an apology from the government for what the 
government subjected him and his family to, like a former Prime 
Minister received? Not that I know of. Andy is an average, hard 
working taxpayer. The former Prime Minister even though he is out 
of office is still a member of this country's political elite. He 
received an apology, plus a cool million dollars or so. What might 
happen to Andy? He just might lose his farm. So much for 
coercion, the way it applies to the HST.
<P>
	I will now speak a bit about the confusion it creates. I have to 
read this because it is confusing even to read about what the HST 
will do to Atlantic Canadians. It is probably confusing enough to 
have a combined provincial and federal sales tax in three of 
Canada's provinces, two separate sales taxes in six provinces, and 
only one sales tax in one province. If we need it to be more 
confounded, how about this.
<P>
	The new HST legislation will exempt some items from the 
hidden tax rule and allow businesses to show both a tax inclusive 
price and a tax exclusive price, as long as the former is displayed. 
Shoppers could conceivably be faced with four different prices for 
the same marked down item: the original price with the tax; the 
original price without the tax; the sale price with the tax; and the 
sale price without the tax. Confusing? I should say so. It seems to 
me that businesses in this country are increasingly being reduced 
mostly as tax collectors for governments.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	There is more about examples of costs. A study by the 
accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young estimated that a mid-sized national 
chain with 50 stores in the Atlantic provinces would put up to $3 
million in one time costs and up to $1.1 million a year to comply 
with a regional tax in price sales system. The Halifax Chamber of 
Commerce predicts that the harmonized sales tax will push up new 
house prices by 5.5 per cent as well as force municipalities to raise 
property taxes.
<P>
	I see my time is up, but I hope I get a chance to talk a little more 
about this particularly agonizing piece of legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a bit embarrassing and even humiliating to have to claim what is 
rightly ours.
<P>
	Once again, the province of Quebec, through Mr. Landry, is 
talking about $2 billion that we now have to claim, compared to the 
maritimes. The GST saga under this Liberal government will go 
down in the history of our Canadian Parliament, and what a tale it 
will be. It will be known as one and even several broken promises.
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign the prime minister and his 
ministers promised during their tour of Canada, especially in 
Quebec, that they would create jobs. ``Jobs, jobs, jobs'', they kept 
saying. The next election will be here soon and they will probably 
use the same slogan and again promise us ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. In my 
riding of Matapédia-Matane, we are still looking for the jobs the 
federal government has supposedly created.
<P>
	There was another promise. First, let me remind the House of the 
promises made in the red book on page 22: ``The GST has 
lengthened and deepened the recession. It is costly for small 
business to administer and very  expensive for the government to 
collect. And the GST has fallen far short of its promised revenue 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7761"> 7761 </A></B>
<P>
potential partly because it has stimulated the underground cash 
economy''.
<P>
	Could it be that once in office federal Liberals realized that the 
commitments they made in the red book did not hold water? Could 
it be that, with the Liberals in office, the GST no longer deepens the 
recession? That it is no longer costly for small business to 
administer and that it is bringing in its promised revenue potential?
<P>
	Moreover, if what is in the red book is true, the GST has now 
suddenly stopped stimulating the underground cash economy. I 
have a hard time believing that a miracle has happened since the 
Liberals, these princes of darkness, took office.
<P>
	Further down on the same page of the red book, we can read: ``A 
Liberal government will replace the GST with a system that 
generates equivalent revenues, is fairer to consumers and to small 
business, minimizes disruption to small business, and promotes 
federal-provincial fiscal co-operation and harmonization''.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	If I understand correctly, the GST is unfair for consumers and 
small businesses. It is also a nightmare for small and medium size 
businesses, and it deters federal and provincial governments from 
co-operating and harmonizing their policies.
<P>
	All those big defects would also have, as if by chance, 
disappeared a few months after the Liberals came to power. Federal 
Liberals, by some sort of magical trick, would have toned down the 
GST's worst effects, and the GST would no longer hurt anyone. On 
the contrary, it would almost be a godsend.
<P>
	After the broken promises of the red book came the promise 
made by the Prime Minister who, like a new messiah, stated that he 
would abolish the tax. Some time later, he said that he had never 
promised such a thing. He only said that the GST would be 
replaced. This is hard to believe for me as well as for my 
constituents and the rest of the country.
<P>
	Can we believe the Prime Minister? Can we have faith in him? 
The Deputy Prime Minister even resigned because she had really 
promised to abolish the GST. But the Prime Minister always 
affirmed the contrary. The Deputy Prime Minister resigned, and it 
cost us half a million dollars to get her re-elected. What a scandal. 
What utter nonsense. It is another episode in the GST saga.
<P>
	As for the Minister of Finance, he admits that he cannot replace 
the GST nor abolish it. At least he admits having made a mistake 
by letting people believe it was possible. The Prime Minister, on 
the other hand, maintains he never said he would abolish the tax.
<P>
	The rest of the story is not really any rosier. Quebec, which is 
administered by a nasty sovereigntist government-according to 
the federalists-decided to harmonize that tax with its own 
taxation system. Aware of the extra red tape that tax represents for 
businesses, the government of Quebec decided to take action to 
help the economy.
<P>
	However, it will not receive any compensation from the federal 
government. The only expression of thank Quebecers will get from 
the Minister of Finance for having saved him money will be the 
obligation to pay a quarter of the compensation of almost one 
billion dollars that was granted to the maritimes. Not only will we 
not receive anything but we will have to help the maritimes. This is 
clearly another example of the inequities of the federal system as 
managed by our friends across the floor.
<P>
	To get out of the mess they put themselves in, the Liberals are 
ready to buy the concurrence by the maritimes. They will buy the 
tax harmonization by making taxpayers in Quebec and Canada 
cough up almost one billion dollars.
<P>
	The Quebec government does not ask for different treatment, but 
only for the same treatment as the maritimes. However, the federal 
government does not want to give compensation because it is 
Quebec.
<P>
	It must be said that we, Quebecers, are unfortunately used to that 
kind of attitude from the federal government. In research and 
development, you know that we never got our fair share. The 
history of the Canadian Confederation is full of examples of that. 
So, you will understand that we have had enough.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	That is why Quebecers want to achieve sovereignty. We no 
longer want to pay federal taxes that will go directly to the 
maritimes. We do not want the government to play that dirty trick 
on us. Mind you it is not the first time.
<P>
	We no longer want to pay for the errors made by the federal 
government, let alone for campaign promises that a party is unable 
to keep. We no longer want policies such as the national energy 
policy which, in the 70s, almost completely destroyed Quebec's 
petrochemical industry without any compensation for Quebec.
<P>
	I am almost tempted to say thank you. Quebecers will remember 
that. They will not be fooled by this government in the next 
election. This time, we do not want to hear about jobs, jobs, jobs. 
Two billion dollars represent 35,000 jobs, which would lower the 
unemployment rate by 1 per cent in Quebec. We need these 35,000 
jobs, especially in my riding of Matapédia-Matane. The 
government owes it to us.
<P>
	We are not asking for a gift, we are simply asking to get back 
what we pay in taxes to the federal government.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not planning to speak 
in this debate today and I will do so for only a few moments.
<P>
	I think when we hear incorrect information we are responsible to 
correct it as soon as possible. The Reform member who spoke 
before the last member opposite, the member for Yellowhead, was 
talking about criminal penalties on pricing. He said that if we do 
not have tax in pricing there would be a criminal penalty. I think 
that is unfortunate because it is misinformation. I want to be very 
clear that this is not a criminal offence. At one point there was 
something in the legislation. However, we all know that in 
Parliament we have a process for bills, a process of working 
through this House and through the committees of Parliament 
legislation so it can be accurate and responsive.
<P>
	There is a ticketing offence, if one wishes to call it an offence, 
under the Contraventions Act. This is similar to a driving fine. 
However, that is a far cry from a criminal offence. Basically that 
section the member was referring to, in the process that finished a 
couple of weeks ago when the finance committee met for a review 
of this bill, that section was taken out of the bill. It will actually end 
up in some regulation.
<P>
	I think it is inappropriate to stand in this House and do some 
scaremongering and fearmongering. Criminal Code offences are a 
far different thing. We do not have Criminal Code situations here. 
This is misinformation. Those are the types of situations, when we 
see a bill and know the work that has gone into it, we know that not 
everybody does the same amount of homework before they stand 
up in this House, so I just wanted to correct the misinformation 
spread.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is amazing, the Liberals stand up here and talk about 
scaremongering and fearmongering but they are the experts at it. 
That is exactly what they are doing right now to the hardworking 
Canadian taxpayers out there who are scared to death of another tax 
coming down the tube from this Liberal government. That is 
scaremongering.
<P>
	Canadians are afraid to plan their futures. They are afraid to plan 
their children's education because they may not be able to afford it. 
They are afraid of losing their job. They are afraid of not being able 
to afford the next tax levy that comes down from this Liberal 
government. They are afraid to make any long term financial 
commitments because of this Liberal government's tax policies. 
That is real fearmongering. That is scaremongering at the highest 
level.
<P>
	There is a whole larger issue at stake here with Bill C-70. This is 
just one small symptom of the big issue. That big issue can be 
addressed by asking when is a  promise made a promise to be kept? 
When is a promise a promise? I would suggest that a promise is a 
promise only when it is not made verbally by a Liberal candidate in 
a federal election. That is the root of this issue.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	Verbal promises have been tested in the highest courts of this 
land and have been found to be legally binding. But that does not 
matter to Liberal candidates who campaigned door to door in the 
1993 election. They went door to door, meeting to meeting and 
verbally-they are very careful-said to the Canadian people ``We 
hate the GST, we will scrap it, we will abolish it. We have always 
said that we hated the GST and when we get to be government, it 
will be gone. We will kill it''.
<P>
	That is what they said as they went from door to door, house to 
house, meeting to meeting, coffee party to coffee party. They made 
that verbal promise to the Canadian people, a type of promise 
which they do not recognize as being legally binding as it has been 
legally binding for decades in the highest courts of this land.
<P>
	By contrast, when Reformers went from door to door, coffee 
party to coffee party, house to house, meeting to meeting, we 
promised the Canadian people that we would do our utmost to 
protect them from the Liberal tax and spend policies, and that is 
exactly what we do in this House on a daily basis. That is a promise 
kept. We made it verbally, we put it in writing and we are keeping 
that promise. We have the guts to do that, unlike this Liberal Party, 
which will say one thing from the mouth and put another thing on 
paper. That is the big issue here, integrity and honesty in this 
government, of which there is none.
<P>
	When the government members sat in the benches over here as 
opposition to the Tory Party, which brought in this hated tax in the 
first place, they railed against it: ``How could you do this to the 
Canadian people?'' They called the Mulroney government every 
name in the book for bringing in this regressive and devastating 
tax. They were very vocal against it.
<P>
	When they campaigned in 1993, the Liberals said to the 
Canadian people ``Trust us, we're not like the Tories. First, we are 
telling you the truth and you must trust us. We will kill, scrap, 
abolish this dreaded Tory GST''. That is what they said.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said ``we hate it and we will kill it''. He said 
it on a radio program which he conveniently forgot, just as he 
completely forgot his imaginary friend. He said that he would kill 
the GST and when he was questioned by a member of the audience 
he asked ``what radio station, where did I say it, come on?''
<P>
	Fortunately the CBC was mad at the government at that time 
about the cuts to the CBC, which is another promise that was talked 
about by the minister of heritage. So the CBC decided to run some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7763"> 7763 </A></B>
<P>
tape which would show  the Prime Minister for what he is, a person 
who does not believe a verbal promise is legally binding.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance said ``I would abolish the GST'', which 
does not sound anything like ``I would harmonize the GST. I would 
bury it in with some other tax''. The minister of defence said ``the 
GST is a regressive tax; it has to be scrapped and when we get to be 
government we will scrap it''. That is what he said.
<P>
	The bottom line is that the Liberals misled Canadians on their 
GST promise. To them a promise is not a promise. They misled 
Atlantic Canadians. Taxpayers across the country are going to pay 
for that broken promise and they are going to pay over and over 
again. It will hurt every taxpayer because in order to get the 
Atlantic provinces to agree to this harmonization scam, the 
Liberals are going to give them a cash payment to make up for the 
shortfall. Talk about a buyout. Talk about a buyout to try to 
somehow justify this Liberal broken promise once again.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	This payment is estimated to be as high as $1 billion to Atlantic 
Canada and taxpayers in every other region of Canada are going to 
pay it. Tax relief is important but it has to be across the board if it is 
going to be tax relief. Canadians in certain regions of the country 
should not be asked to subsidize a tax cut for the maritimes. In all it 
is not a tax cut really.
<P>
	The Liberals are using $1 billion from taxpayer money to buy a 
buried GST in Atlantic Canada so they can say their election 
promise slate is not as dirty as it has proven to be. This is truly 
despicable and Canadians are not missing this one. Believe me, 
they are not missing this Liberal broken promise.
<P>
	They did not miss it on the national town hall meeting where the 
Prime Minister was caught red handed in a Liberal broken promise, 
a promise that his candidates from the Liberal Party told hundreds 
of thousands of Canadians, millions of Canadians in the 1993 
election. He was caught in his own broken promise on videotape. 
Tapes do not lie. Videotapes do not lie.
<P>
	It is interesting that Atlantic Canadians will also suffer because 
while they pay a lower tax rate, they will pay taxes on a larger 
variety of goods and services. In fact, a seemingly lower tax rate 
really does not mean necessarily a lower tax rate because you will 
be paying a seemingly lower rate but on a huge variety of goods 
and services. The tax base has been expanded. A neat Liberal trick.
<P>
	It is nice that the government talks about child poverty. The 
harmonized tax will apply to children's clothing. Does that figure 
somewhere in child poverty? I understand children who are living 
in poverty do need cloths. They probably do not need a tax on those 
clothes.
<P>
	It will apply to books. I understand that education helps to get 
children into a position where they will not have to live in poverty 
anymore. It will apply to haircuts. Even poor kids need a haircut.
<P>
	It will apply to funeral services and heating oil. Heating oil is a 
major expenditure to families that live at the poverty level. Now 
the government is going to put a tax on heating oil. So much for its 
concern about the poorer Canadians of our society.
<P>
	It will apply to gasoline. Poor Canadians in our society still have 
to go out and try to look for a job or ways to increase and improve 
their lot in life. Now the government is going to charge more 
gasoline taxes. And it will apply to new homes.
<P>
	By the way, where have all the MPs from Atlantic Canada been 
in this debate? Where are all the MPs sent here from Atlantic 
Canada to protect the interests of the Atlantic Canadians, the 
maritimes? Where are they? They are sitting in their seats silent 
because they have been told to do so. ``Don't you stand up and 
defend your constituents. This is a government bill and, by golly, if 
you dare speak against it you are going to be disciplined''.
<P>
	Where is the member from the Conservative Party? Where is she 
speaking on this? She is from Atlantic Canada, the maritimes.
<P>
	This is a regressive tax. It is going to hurt Canadians. It is going 
to hurt the poorest of Canadians. How on earth could a Liberal 
government that promises to have the best interests of Canadians, 
the best interests of the poorest people in our society at heart, even 
conceive of putting such a regressive and hurtful tax on Canadians 
in this country?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise on Bill C-70. I say this for the 
benefit of our viewers, this bill is a collection of amendments to the 
GST.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The group of motions we are dealing with contains among other 
things amendments aimed at harmonizing the GST with the sales 
tax in three maritime provinces. The amendments brought forward 
by the Bloc with regard to those motions are basically aimed at 
withdrawing any legislation on harmonization and compensation. 
There are several reasons for this.
<P>
	This bill is flawed, based exclusively on political and electoral 
considerations, since everything suggests that we are about to have 
an election. It is poorly drafted and flawed.
<P>
	What is more, in order to convince the three maritime provinces, 
which did not expect it, the federal government had to promise 
political compensation of close to one billion dollars, while it has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7764"> 7764 </A></B>
<P>
systematically refused to pay Quebec the two billion dollars it lost 
by harmonizing its provincial sales tax with the GST in 1991.
<P>
	Quebec is often pictured as the black sheep or the spoilsport of 
the system. We have here the best example of this. Quebec was the 
first province to support harmonization with the federal tax and 
now they are going to make the province pay for that.
<P>
	My colleagues will further develop each and every point I have 
raised,to put them in their proper perspective. They have already 
begun. Several have already spoken and they will be followed by 
others. For my part, I would like to underscore the fact that this bill 
is first and foremost a symbol.
<P>
	It is a symbol that makes three things very clear. First, it shows 
the present government's lack of transparency. Second, it points to 
the fact that, in the Canadian Confederation, Quebec constantly 
ends up on the losing side, economically speaking. I should use the 
term ``federation'', because Canada stopped being a confederation 
long ago. In fact, Quebec does not receive its fair share of spinoffs 
from its investments in Canada, amounting to 25 per cent of 
Canada's revenues. Third, this bill also shows that any member 
from Quebec elected in Ottawa as a Liberal or a Conservative 
always ends up taking Ottawa's side against Quebec.
<P>
	The government's lack of transparency has been plain to see 
throughout its mandate, during this legislature, since 1993. This 
bill is in keeping with this lack of transparency. It is the last chapter 
before the election, it is the icing on the cake.
<P>
	Some recent events are clear indications of the government's 
lack of transparency. I will try to go fast, but there are many of 
them. There is the tainted blood issue. While the Prime Minister 
claims to want the entire situation brought to light-that is what he 
says all the time-he refuses to initiate the process of giving Mr. 
Justice Krever access to the documents that would allow him to get 
at the truth. This morning, we learned that the RCMP was looking 
for related documents that are said to have disappeared. Where is 
the transparency?
<P>
	There is also the Somalia inquiry. While promising once again to 
get at the truth, the Prime Minister has refused the extension 
requested by the inquiry and its chairman. We know for a fact that, 
if this commission needs a extension, it is only because the 
Canadian army hid documents. Months were lost tracking them 
down.
<P>
	The Airbus affair was another example of lack of transparency. 
The previous Prime Minister, Mr. Mulroney, was pronounced 
guilty in advance, almost under criminal charges. We know full 
well that this is contrary to Canadian law and yet nobody is 
responsible.
<P>
	Etymologically the word responsible refers to the person who is 
able to provide a response. When we ask questions in the House, 
we never get any response, which means that nobody is 
responsible. Somebody else is, the system is or some other thing. 
There is not one minister who is responsible.
<P>
	Here are a few blatant examples of broken promises and lack of 
transparency on the part of the government: it promised to tear up 
the free trade agreement, and yet it signed it; it promised to 
deprivatize the Pearson airport, but the issue has not been settled 
yet and has been handled in such a way that it might cost taxpayers 
tens of millions of dollars.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Remember the commitment to Quebec during the referendum to 
recognize the concept of distinct society and give Quebec its veto 
back? Another broken promise. Every Quebecer remembers it. 
Remember the promise to create jobs, jobs, jobs?
<P>
	In his last budget, not the forthcoming one, the one he tabled 
before, the finance minister told us: ``The government's role is not 
to create jobs, we are going to create the right environment for 
corporations to create jobs''. When we look at major corporations 
posting record breaking profits, starting with the banks, we see that 
they are all laying off people.
<P>
	One has to wonder who in Canada is creating jobs these days, but 
not why 1.5 million Canadians are unemployed. ``Jobs, jobs, jobs'', 
another broken promise. And now the ultimate one, the one that 
tops them all, the one we are dealing with today. They were going 
to scrap the GST. Instead they are talking about changing the GST 
harmonization standards.
<P>
	This promise was heard on every radio and TV station, and the 
Prime Minister told us on May 2, 1994: ``We hate this tax, we will 
do away with it''. The hated tax did not disappear, so they are 
trying to hide it. The finance minister apologized, saying that they 
should not have made such a promise. The Deputy Prime Minister 
resigned, and the Prime Minister still insists he never said anything 
of the kind.
<P>
	I am sure you have read the Toronto newspapers; they were hard 
enough on the Prime Minister. I will not repeat in the House what 
the journalists wrote because it would be unparliamentary. It is 
easy to see there is no transparency there.
<P>
	Secondly, as this bill shows clearly, Quebec is always the loser 
within the Canadian Confederation because it never receives its fair 
share. Since we have been here, we have held numerous debates in 
the House to explain how Quebec never gets its share of structuring 
expenditures, of job creating expenditures. We have often given the 
example of research and development as an area where Quebec 
gets nothing, where it never gets its share of expenditures.
<P>
	This GST case is just one more example. The maritimes will 
receive a billion dollars for the  harmonization whereas Quebec got 
absolutely nothing for harmonizing its QST with the GST. What 
does this mean? Since Quebecers make up one quarter of Canada's 
revenues, it means that the federal government is taking $250 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7765"> 7765 </A></B>
<P>
million away from Quebecers to send it to the maritimes while 
Quebec is receiving nothing at all.
<P>
	We all know what the people over there will do with that money. 
Mr. McKenna for one is raiding Quebec to attract Quebec 
businesses. We are paying people for them to come here and 
compete with us. That is the kind of system we live in. The GST 
situation shows that clearly.
<P>
	Finally, the third point this bill proves is that a liberal member 
from Quebec, when he is in Ottawa, will always take Ottawa's side 
against Quebec.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, your are telling me I have only one minute left, so I 
will try to conclude swiftly. Where are the Quebec members when 
the government refuses to pay Quebec and takes $250 million from 
Quebecers to send it to the maritimes, with nothing in return? 
Liberal members from Quebec are saying nothing and are nowhere 
to be seen.
<P>
	Where were the Liberal members from Quebec when the 
government seized from the unemployment insurance fund $5 
billion that collectively belonged to the workers? Mum was the 
word. They were nowhere to be seen. Where were the Liberal 
members from Quebec when family trusts moved to the United 
States without paying some $500 million in taxes? They were 
nowhere to be seen and did not say a word.
<P>
	To conclude, Quebecers now know, thanks to this bill, that is no 
use sending a René Lévesque to Quebec City and a Pierre Trudeau 
to Ottawa, a Lucien Bouchard to Quebec City and a little guy from 
Shawinigan to Ottawa. Quebecers now know that Canada is not, as 
the Deputy Prime Minister was saying, a tower of Babel that works. 
It is a tower of Pisa, a tower that leans to one side: Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-70 which harmonizes 
the sales taxes in the maritimes.
<P>
	The object of the bill is an attempt to create jobs, to simplify the 
tax system and to stimulate the economy. This attempt by the 
government to harmonize the sales tax will do exactly the opposite. 
It is an example of an ill-advised taxation initiative which will put 
people out of work, increase the underground economy, drive 
companies into bankruptcy. Let me give some examples.
<P>
	The business community has cried out against the present form 
of this tax. The Retail Council of Canada said that it will cost 
retailers at least $100 million per year. It will not only cost the 
retailers, obviously it will  cost those who pay for it in the end, the 
taxpayers. The Halifax Chamber of Commerce said that the sales 
tax will push up the cost of new houses by 5.5 per cent. This is in an 
area of the country where people are finding it increasingly 
difficult to purchase homes.
<P>
	Consumers are going to pay more for children's clothing, books, 
gasoline, heating fuel: the essentials. In fact, it will hurt those who 
are least able to afford it. The government should be embarrassed 
about doing that to the people of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The intent, though, is sensible. Having a harmonized sales tax is 
actually a good thing but it has to occur in a different number of 
ways. It has to be one tax for the entire country applied across the 
board. The rate has to be lower than what it is now. We need one 
auditing procedure and it has to be simpler and easier to 
understand. It has to have one single remittance and one set of 
rules.
<P>
	The system that is proposed by the government does not do that 
at all. It just increases the complexity. Furthermore, it asks 
Canadians outside the provinces in the maritimes to fund this 
project by shunting money from the west to the maritimes. For the 
moment, the west does not mind providing for provinces that are 
less able to afford things. However, to ingrain this harmonized 
sales is doing a disservice to all Canadians. This tax will affect over 
50 per cent of businesses in the maritimes in a massively negative 
way. This is information from the business community in the 
maritimes.
<P>
	There are ways to get around this. There are ways to provide a 
sales tax that will be better and therefore stimulate the economy. 
There are ways to get people back to work but the government has 
just nibbled around the edges for the last three years that we have 
been here. It has done very little to help the 10 per cent of 
Canadians who are unemployed and the nearly 20 per cent of 
Canadians who are under employed.
<P>
	Here are a few constructive suggestions that I challenge the 
government to take up. First, the debt and the deficit. Get the 
deficit down to zero and decrease the debt. Second, instead of 
having the HST that the government is proposing, let us have a 
sensible harmonized sales tax that has one tax, a lower rate 
applicable across the country, that is simpler, with one reporting 
procedure per year, one auditing procedure that is easier to 
understand.
<P>
	Better, of course, would be to scrap the tax altogether. A few 
years ago when the government of the day decided to lower taxes, 
what happened? More money came into the government coffers, 
more money was in the pockets of Canadians and the economy was 
stimulated. What did that government do? The Conservative 
government of the day started to tax wildly. That did the exact 
opposite of stimulating the economy and revenues to the public 
purse went down.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7766"> 7766 </A></B>
<P>
	We need to flatten the tax system. My colleagues in the Reform 
Party have proposed some sensible solutions for flattening the tax 
procedure for all Canadians. It is a simple tax that does not defeat 
the intent of working harder to earn more for ourselves and our 
families. It provides for a greater minimum exclusion for those 
in the lower socioeconomic groups so those who are poor in our 
society pay little or no tax at all. It is a win-win situation.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Interprovincial trade barriers have to go. I do not know if the 
Canadian public realizes it but there are more barriers to trade 
east-west across our country than there are north-south. That is an 
embarrassment. The government has had opportunity after 
opportunity to deal with this but it has not.
<P>
	We have serious problems in education in our country. There is a 
dislocation between the needs of the private sector and the 
initiatives of the education system. If we want to build a stronger 
Canada, if we want to build a nation where we can compete with 
countries from around the world, if we want to become one of the 
new tigers in the economy of the Asia-Pacific countries, then we 
have to invest in education.
<P>
	We have to determine what will be the needs of the private sector 
in the 21st century. We have develop co-operative initiatives 
between the education system and the private sector to enable the 
students of today and tomorrow to develop the skills that will 
enable them to become employable in the future. That is not 
happening right now. I challenge the government to work with their 
provincial counterparts to do just that.
<P>
	Number four is skills training. It is an embarrassment to us that 
we are one of the nations of the world with the lowest investment in 
skills and labour training in the developing world. How can we be 
competitive in the global economy if we do not invest in skills and 
labour training for our workers? That is absolutely essential if we 
are going to compete in the future.
<P>
	We also need to reinvest in research and technology. The 
government is pulling money out of research and technology. It is 
doing the same thing with education. The government ripped some 
$7 billion from transfer payments for education, health and welfare 
and claimed it was balancing the budget. All the government is 
doing is balancing its budget on the backs of taxpayers. At the end 
of the day it is the taxpayer who pays for everything.
<P>
	We have to capitalize on foreign markets. We heard that we 
should be reinvesting in north-south trade. Thirty years ago trade in 
Asia represented 5 per cent of the world's gross national product. 
Today it is 30 per cent and growing. We are uniquely positioned to 
take advantage of this in my province of British Columbia. We 
have the geography, we have the people, we have the opportunity 
for skills development, not only for points  east in Asia-Pacific but 
also as a conduit and as a channel for points in Europe and points 
south. Very few nations, in fact no nation, can boast the ideal 
position that we have today.
<P>
	I challenge the people of Canada to realize that our system of 
governance today is not a democracy at all. It operates more like a 
fiefdom. Democracy has very little to do with what takes place 
within our nation today. In fact, most of the important decisions 
made are made by a group of non-elected, unaccountable officials 
that the public never sees. That is where the legislative initiatives 
occur. They are made not to make this country a better place, but 
purely for the maintenance and acquisition of power.
<P>
	If the Canadian public wants to see radical, fundamental, 
positive social and economic change, then they will have to get 
angry and put pressure on all of their elected officials to demand 
the changes in governance that we will require if we are going to be 
an aggressive player in the economy of the 21st century.
<P>
	We also need strong leadership that demonstrates and expresses 
a vision of the country that is going to lead us into the 21st century 
where we will be able to demonstrate strength and compassion. 
Right now, that does not occur.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	We need to build a nation where all able-bodied individuals can 
develop the skills training they require. And it is an obligation for 
all able-bodied individuals to capitalize on those opportunities. We 
also need to fulfil our obligation to those individuals who cannot 
take care of themselves and ensure that our social programs are 
placed on a sustainable footing.
<P>
	If we can see that leadership in this nation, we will be able to 
lead our people into a stronger and brighter future in the 21st 
century. Failure to do that will mean terrible social and economic 
consequences in the future and we will only be a shadow of what 
we can be in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am also 
pleased to speak today to Bill C-70, which, among other things, 
makes some amendments on harmonization of the GST with the tax 
in the three maritimes provinces.
<P>
	It will be remembered that, just before Christmas, the official 
opposition deplored the way in which the finance minister had 
tabled the documents relating to this bill. The opposition had less 
than 24 hours to examine a very technical bill, in which this whole 
reform was set out in 300 pages, without any explanatory notes.
<P>
	However, in January of this year, we witnessed an even more 
revolting spectacle for anybody who believes in the quality of 
democratic life in Canada. First, the Liberals allowed only three 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7767"> 7767 </A></B>
<P>
days of public hearings for such an important bill. And we know 
this bill is very important to the maritime provinces.
<P>
	The opposition tabled a motion calling for an extension to 
consultations, and even for the committee to travel to the maritimes 
to listen to the people. The government wanted none of this. It is 
clear, therefore, that this government has no regard for democracy.
<P>
	With three days of public hearings, under the pretext that 
complaints were made, the government moved 13 amendments. 
Imagine how many amendments could have been made if, for once, 
the government had been listening to what people had to say. The 
whole bill would then have ended up in the waste paper basket. It 
must also be said that this bill is a great source of embarrassment 
for the government. That is why it wants to have it rammed 
through.
<P>
	In December, someone came to call in my region. The Prime 
Minister came to my riding to tell us that we had misunderstood 
what he had said about the GST. Millions of us were under the 
impression that the GST would be abolished. Do these words have 
a different meaning? I would like to hear the members opposite on 
this. What this bill does is show that promises were not kept, 
whether they were made in the red book, by the Prime Minister 
himself, by the Minister of Finance, by the Deputy Prime Minister 
and heritage minister or by any past or present Liberal candidate or 
member. Clearly, the Liberal government has lost sight of the 
people on behalf of whom it is supposed to govern.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	During the 1993 campaign, countless statements were made 
about scrapping the GST entirely. The Prime Minister himself used 
the word ``scrap''. In 1994, he said the Liberals hated this tax and 
would kill it. A byelection was even run at taxpayers' expense on 
this issue. That was not so long ago. We all remember. Eliminating 
the GST was an election promise. But instead of being eliminated, 
it is being disguised, hidden. This leads us to say that, through this 
bill, the Liberals are doing exactly the opposite, what they had 
criticized.
<P>
	The new GST is a hypocritical tax; from now on, it will be 
hidden in the cost of goods and services. However, in a report of the 
Standing Committee on Finance dating back to 1994, the Liberal 
majority said that it would be improper to hide from Canadians the 
amounts they paid in taxes to their governments and that making it 
a hidden tax undermined their ability to make the government 
accountable for the way these taxes were collected and, to a lesser 
extent, for the way moneys were spent.
<P>
	The position of the Liberals on hiding the GST in the sales price 
used to be that, if the GST was hidden in the sales price, it would be 
much easier for the government to increase it later on. Yet, we 
know that 76 per cent of Canadian businesses are opposed to hiding 
the GST in  the sale price of goods and services. Personally, when I 
pay my bills, I want to know where my money goes. I want to know 
how much I am paying for the goods or services, and how much I 
am paying to the government. And I am sure my constituents feel 
the same way. I sincerely believe that some members opposite 
should go back to their riding and talk to those who elected them.
<P>
	I want to discuss another aspect of this most undemocratic bill, 
that is yet another infringement of the rights of Quebecers. During 
the referendum campaign, and even after, we were constantly told 
that all Canadians were equal. Why is it then that, under this bill, 
Quebecers are being refused the compensation awarded to the 
maritime provinces? Such is the kind of equality that prevails 
under our federal system.
<P>
	Yes, Quebec did harmonize its tax with the federal one; Quebec 
administers that tax. Quebec acted very responsibly. So why should 
Quebecers not be entitled to the same compensation that the federal 
government is giving the maritime provinces?
<P>
	The maritimes may be facing additional costs to harmonize their 
tax with the federal one, but so does Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	If the maritimes are entitled to $1 billion in compensation, 
Quebec should also be entitled to a compensation. The Minister of 
Finance must act in a fair manner. The term ``harmonization'' 
implies that the parties get together and are, for all intents and 
purposes, in agreement. However, it seems that this concept takes 
on a different meaning with this Liberal government.
<P>
	I would have liked to discuss the tax on books, but I will 
conclude by simply saying this: in Quebec, the provincial sales tax 
does not apply to books. In Quebec, we realized a long time ago 
that taxing books means taxing knowledge.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to this group of amendments to Bill C-70, the 
so-called harmonization bill.
<P>
	Those who have been listening to the debate over the last couple 
of days will know that this bill will not lead to harmonization at all. 
It will mean that three provinces will live under a completely 
different set of rules than the rest of the country. Part of the reason 
for that is that the other provinces do not think it is the right thing to 
do and will not give the federal government their approval. We 
have anything but harmonization. What we have is more disunity 
and more divisiveness in the country as a result of this legislation.
<P>
	Any amount of amendment to the bill will not fix it. The fact is 
that the bill will not make things better. It will not harmonize the 
tax across the country, it will lead to a split. It will not fulfil the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7768"> 7768 </A></B>
<P>
Liberal promise to get rid of  the GST. Those who have been 
listening to the debate over the last few days will know that.
<P>
	Leading up to the last election campaign, during the election 
campaign and since the election, many Liberal MPs and the Prime 
Minister have very clearly promised to abolish, kill, scrap the GST. 
There is no doubt about that.
<P>
	This harmonization bill is not a well thought out piece of 
legislation. It is a smoke screen so the Liberals can say on the 
campaign trail that they kept their promise to scrap the GST, but it 
will not sell. Those 10, 20, 30 or 40 Liberal MPs who were elected 
on the promise of getting rid of the GST are in danger of losing 
their seats on that one issue alone. No amount of amendment and 
certainly not the amendments in this group will solve the problem.
<P>
	I want to speak to these amendments and to the so-called 
harmonization of the GST from another point of view. As the 
Reform Party critic for interprovincial trade, I want to deal with 
that issue and explain how this legislation clearly violates the 
government's agreement on internal trade. That agreement does not 
allow legislation such as this to apply to one part of the country and 
not another. This bill clearly violates the agreement. I will speak to 
the bill from that point of view.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	Some people may not be surprised that this piece of legislation 
or one piece of legislation would clearly contradict legislation that 
was presented earlier by this government, but that does not mean it 
is right.
<P>
	I suppose I should not be surprised that the government would 
break its own law, a law it has put in place, the agreement on 
internal trade, through the introduction of another piece of 
legislation. That is what it has done. I should not be surprised but I 
do not accept it. Many other Canadians do not accept it. Canadians 
expect government to honour the laws it puts in place just as they 
expect everyone to honour the laws that are put in place. This 
legislation clearly violates the government's own law.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade is falling apart. The agreement 
was put in place after the negotiations between the provinces and 
the federal government throughout 1994. After it was signed in 
1995, I thought the government had made some progress on this 
issue. It had reached an agreement in some areas on removing 
barriers to interprovincial trade. In other areas it set a framework 
and a timeframe for removing further barriers to internal trade and 
the provinces had agreed in principle to removing the barriers to 
internal trade. I thought progress had been made.
<P>
	Unfortunately very little progress has been proven over time. 
The set deadlines have been broken one after another to the point 
that British Columbia is saying that it will not even take part in the 
negotiations on the so-called MUSH sector, the sector that deals 
with procurement for municipalities, universities, schools and 
hospitals. British Columbia announced earlier this week that it will 
not even take part in negotiations to try to finish this agreement.
<P>
	Deadlines have passed. The agreement never had a mechanism 
to ensure that the provinces and the federal government would 
abide by the rules of the agreement. With the formula for approving 
changes to the agreement, being unanimous consent, it was clear 
from the start that it would be very difficult to complete the 
agreement. And that has proven to be the case.
<P>
	There are several reasons this is such an important issue, why it 
is so important to Canadians that these barriers to interprovincial 
trade be removed. First, according to the Fraser Institute, it costs 
the average Canadian family $3,500 a year just having these 
barriers to trade in place. We have a situation in Canada where it is 
actually more difficult for a company based in one province to do 
business the other provinces than it is for a company in the United 
States to do business with all Canadian provinces.
<P>
	The barriers have created an incentive for Canadian companies 
to relocate into the United States so they can have open access to all 
Canadian provinces. This drives jobs out of the country. The 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce stated in a report before 
Christmas that just reducing internal trade barriers or increasing 
internal trade by 10 per cent will create 200,000 jobs in this 
country. That is a lot of jobs.
<P>
	For a government that was elected on the promise to get rid of 
the GST and partly on the promise to create jobs, you would think it 
would be enticing to make relatively simple changes compared to 
some of the other changes that would have to be made to create 
jobs. Just increasing trade between provinces by 10 per cent would 
create 200,000 jobs, but the government does not seem committed 
to this idea.
<P>
	Now with British Columbia saying that it will not even 
negotiate, we are left to ask whether this 1995 agreement, which I 
said at the time was real progress, is really going to accomplish a 
thing.
<P>
	We have a problem that needs to be dealt with with urgency. This 
harmonization bill and these amendments we are debating in this 
House are not going to solve a problem. They are not good for 
business in Atlantic Canada. They are not good for the people of 
Atlantic Canada, as jobs will be lost because of this deal. Many 
businesses involved have stated this clearly.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	There is a further aspect to this agreement on internal trade and 
the importance of the trade between provinces that has not been 
talked about very much. We have put the Canadian economy at 
risk, a risk we have put in place unnecessarily by coming to depend 
more and more on international trade before we have done the work 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7769"> 7769 </A></B>
<P>
to encourage trade between provinces and to make it easier for 
businesses to trade between provinces. There is an increased risk.
<P>
	If we have a substantial increase in our dollar we are going to 
have a dramatic reduction in trade and this government and this 
country have come to depend on trade for jobs. Any new jobs that 
have been created have been pretty much due to international trade. 
We have an increase in the dollar, our trade surplus has decreased, 
which happened in the third quarter of last year. Our economy goes 
in the tank, unemployment increases. That is why it is so important 
to deal with this issue.
<P>
	I will certainly continue on this topic relating it to the debate in 
future groups of amendments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
House of Commons is dealing with a crucial bill for the province of 
Quebec, Bill C-70, an act to harmonize the infamous GST with the 
provincial sales tax in three Canadian provinces, namely New 
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.
<P>
	This harmonization is another example of discrimination against 
the province of Quebec, which is nothing new. As early as 
1841-and this is making the members opposite smile-the union 
of Lower and Upper Canada brought about the harmonization of 
the debts of the two territories. Lower Canada, that is the province 
of Quebec, French Canada if you prefer, was not heavily in debt at 
the time, but did not have a lot of infrastructures in place. On the 
other hand, Upper Canada was 12 times deeper in debt, but had a 
lot of roads, harbours, railroads, et cetera. After the union, 
Quebecers had to pay for the debts of English Canada. That is how 
our marriage to English Canada started. The majority at the time 
decided to split the debts equally between the two founding 
nations.
<P>
	In 1997 as in 1841, we have the same remedy, the same type of 
discrimination. Given how the GST is being harmonized in three 
maritime provinces, according to a simple rule of three, Quebec 
should get nothing less than $2 billion in compensation.
<P>
	What did the federal government offer Robert Bourassa, a 
Liberal from Quebec, when he agreed to harmonize with Brian 
Mulroney's Conservative government?
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Quebec was the first province in Canada to harmonize its 
provincial sales tax with the GST, but it did not get anything in 
return, except, of course, the sharing on a fifty-fifty basis of the 
costs associated with collecting the GST and the QST. Quebec 
taxpayers were even proud of this harmonization. As a farmer, I 
was happy too because instead of filling two forms, one for Ottawa 
and one for Quebec, I would have to fill only one form. So,  
personally, I was proud of the Quebec government at that time, 
even though it was headed by a Liberal, namely Robert Bourassa.
<P>
	What I am driving at, Mr. Speaker, and your smile tells me you 
already know, is that Ottawa did not pay Quebec any 
compensation, and it is now ready to give these three small Atlantic 
provinces nothing less than a billion dollars. That is a flagrant case 
of injustice.
<P>
	The same thing happened in 1996 when this government 
abolished the Western Grain Transportation Act. It released $3 
billion to compensate three western provinces. It gave them $3 
billion.
<P>
	Last year, in 1996, as the member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot 
knows, the same government decided to abolish subsidies to 
industrial milk producers. What did Quebec producers get as 
compensation? Nothing. That is the kind of equality that exists in 
our country. That is the kind of medicine Quebecers get from this 
Liberal government. It is not surprising, my friends, that the 
Liberal Party is so low in the polls in Quebec.
<P>
	We cannot wait to see the result of the next election. The Prime 
Minister himself, in his own riding of Saint-Maurice, will-to use 
his own expression-take a beating. That is what he was telling us 
before the referendum. Well, he is the one who is going to take a 
beating.
<P>
	It takes nothing more than the rule of three to demonstrate that 
this government is cheating Quebecers out of $2 billion in this 
harmonization deal with the maritimes.
<P>
	There is another example of discrimination, this time against 
Quebec and Ontario. You certainly know that, in recovering the 
costs associated with the RCMP, the federal government recovers 
only 70 per cent of the real costs. Quebec and Ontario each have 
their own provincial police force, namely the Sûreté du Québec and 
the OPP.
<P>
	We pay 100 per cent of the costs associated with these police 
services. We pay whatever these services cost. But the other 
provinces pay only 70 per cent of the real cost of their police 
services. So Quebec and Ontario both are paying 30 per cent of the 
costs of the police forces in the maritimes and in most of the 
western provinces. Where is the equity? Where is the fairness in 
this country? As far back as 1841 it has been the same thing, year 
after year.
<P>
	I would like to come back to the GST. Since October 1993, or let 
us say November 1993, the Liberal government has been turning in 
an amateur performance. It has improvised every last step of the 
way. First of all, think back to the 1993 election campaign, in 
September and October. The Deputy Prime Minister, the member 
for Hamilton East, made a solemn promise to step down if they had 
not abolished the GST in the first 12 months of their mandate.

remind you that, just like a mother bird pushes her chick out of the 
nest to teach it to fly, the opposition members had to give her a 
shove to get her to resign. The Deputy Prime Minister's blunder 
cost Canadian taxpayers no less than $500,000.
<P>
	When they are reminded of these mistakes and of the fact that 
this government improvised and behaved like a rookie, it hurts, of 
course. It hurts the Liberal members.
<P>
	In 1993, all members heard the Prime Minister say in caucus that 
he was going to abolish the GST, to scrap it. One of their own dared 
to vote against the finance minister's budget last year. Like a good 
father, the Prime Minister kicked him out. As you know, I am 
talking about the member for York South-Weston. In December, 
during a question here, he reminded the Prime Minister that on at 
least three occasions he had promised to abolish the GST and had 
not kept his promise.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to remind you of the credibility we 
politicians have with our electorate. Yesterday, in the House, we 
were once again treated to the sad display of two members 
removing their jackets and preparing to fight it out in the House of 
Commons, the people's Chamber. This makes us look ridiculous.
<P>
	The Liberal member from British Columbia, the member for 
Okanagan-Shuswap, and the Liberal member for Scarborough 
Centre took off their jackets, undid their shirts and got ready to 
fight it out-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I am sorry, but the 
member's time is up. It is too bad, because as usual his remarks are 
very interesting.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise again to speak on Bill C-70, the harmonized sales 
tax, the HST or, as a friend of mine, Mr. Mike Jenkinson from the 
<I>Alberta Report</I> referred to it, the helter-skelter tax. I thought the 
name that he applied to it was quite appropriate in so far as we have 
rules that apply to eastern Canada we have different rules that apply 
to western Canada and we have the Minister of Finance trying to 
bring Ontario on side. We have, more or less, harmonization with 
the GST in the province of Quebec. Right across the country it 
appears that there are different rules in different places. Therefore 
the helter-skelter tax perhaps is not that inappropriate.
<P>
	I want to again focus on the concept of the Liberal Party which is 
tax and spend at all costs. If there is an opportunity to raise taxes, it 
will leave no stone unturned in order to find that extra dollar which 
it is always looking for in order that it can develop a new program 
to give to Canadians in order to buy their votes. When I say  give to 
Canadians, it seems that the government always wants to break 
society into its different classifications.
<P>
	I happened to see in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> today an article 
regarding youth jobs plan and some side steps training, how they 
are moving their focus away from training to a youth jobs plan and 
how they are perhaps going to focus several hundred million 
dollars into this program.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	Youth training and youth jobs are vitally important. We have 
here the tax and spend philosophy of the Liberal government which 
taxes Canadians right across the board, the GST in this case, and 
harmonize sales tax in Atlantic Canada. Collect all these taxes and 
try to provide jobs for youth and job training for youth.
<P>
	I cannot speak for my friends in the Bloc who introduced some 
tax increase concepts yesterday, but we in the Reform Party would 
like to point out clearly and definitively that if we can reduce 
taxation, especially for employers, it is surely better than the tax 
and spend philosophy of a government that takes it from employers 
and gives it back to a few.
<P>
	We heard at the last election about the jobs, jobs strategy of the 
federal government where it was going to spend $6 billion to renew 
our infrastructure. We all know how much actually went into 
infrastructure renewal, not an awful lot. But that is another issue.
<P>
	The point we are trying to make is that while the Liberals made a 
great issue of spending $6 billion to revitalize the economy and 
restart the economy to create jobs, we have heard nothing about the 
deliberate policy of the Minister of Finance of maintaining 
employment insurance premiums far higher than we need in order 
to cover the cost of payouts. He has therefore built up a surplus of 
$5 billion, all paid for by employers and employees. It is a payroll 
tax that the Minister of Finance has siphoned out of the business 
community in the last two years and therefore has recovered every 
penny of his $6 billion tax and spend program which did very little 
to create jobs in the first place.
<P>
	The myth I want to point out is that tax and spend programs do 
not work and tax and spend programs allow the Minister of Finance 
to hide these payroll taxes that are inequitable and damaging to the 
economy. They destroy jobs but yet provide the federal government 
with the excuse to come up with a youth jobs plan to put this money 
back into the economy. Surely it makes imminent sense to leave the 
money in the hands of the employers in the first instance who can 
decide where best that money is to be spent.
<P>
	I think of the state of the union address by the President of the 
United States the other day. He challenged every employer in the 
country to create one new position; through their own efforts to 
build a business and create another job. That I think is a wonderful 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7771"> 7771 </A></B>
<P>
challenge. Too bad the Minister of Finance did not think about it. 
Too bad the Liberals did not think about it. They are totally focused 
on taxing more money out of employers in order for them to come 
up with what they consider to be vote buying programs as they 
spend it back in the economy. There is a fundamental difference.
<P>
	Let us look at this helter-skelter tax and at some of the rules they 
are going to ask business to administer. Do not tell me that they are 
not going to have extra costs. What about travel agents? I live in 
Alberta and I travel across the country as part of my position as a 
member of Parliament. Let us say I buy a ticket from Edmonton to 
Halifax. The travel agent has to charge me only the GST because 
the province of Alberta has no provincial sales tax, the only 
fortunate province in the country that gets by without one. If I ask 
the same travel agent in Alberta to provide me with a ticket from 
Halifax to Ottawa, the travel agent in Alberta has to charge the 
harmonized sales tax.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	How is a travel agent supposed to accommodate that complexity 
of rules? As far as tickets are concerned the GST or the HST will 
apply based on the point of departure, not on the point of purchase.
<P>
	The same applies to trucking and shipping goods across the 
country. Therefore who is going to set up a warehouse distribution 
system in Atlantic Canada where every shipment out of a 
warehouse will have a harmonized sales tax of 15 per cent when 
they can locate that warehouse in a different province and pay a 
lower GST and provincial sales tax?
<P>
	These are job killing programs and the government comes out 
with this vote buying program such as job plans which is in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> today. That is an inequity on the taxation side. It is 
an inequity on the government spending side. That is why we say 
surely it makes a lot more sense to leave the money in the hands of 
the employer and give him the challenge of creating another job.
<P>
	We hear about discrimination at every turn. We hear about 
discrimination about older people who find it so dreadfully 
difficult to get back into the workforce. Right now it is more 
appealing for this government to focus on the youth and it ignores 
the older people who want to return to the workforce.
<P>
	I can expect on February 18 we are going to see some kind of 
program focused at them as well when surely it would have been so 
much better had the government lived up to its first election 
promise to axe, scrap and abolish the entire thing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac)):</B> Resuming 
debate, the hon. member for Calgary North.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
must say you are much better looking than I expected to see in the 
chair.
<P>
	I am really happy to speak on this bill. The bill we are debating is 
Bill C-70. Bill C-70 is a very clumsy attempt by this Liberal 
government to harmonize the goods and services tax with the 
provincial sales taxes in three Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	Another little wrinkle now which the Liberals have thrown into 
this mess is to hide the new harmonized sales tax from consumers 
by requiring the sticker price to include tax. In addition to some of 
the objections that I mentioned to this bill when I spoke on it 
before, we now have a situation where it is even worse than it was 
when I last spoke. Perhaps if I point out some of the difficulties to 
this government it will pay close attention and it will be happy to 
change the parts of the bill that are inadequate and inappropriate.
<P>
	This tax inclusive pricing should be changed, should be 
abandoned, should be scrapped, a good Liberal word. for four 
reasons. One is that tax inclusive pricing kills jobs, the jobs, jobs, 
jobs that the Liberals promised us faithfully in the last election that 
they were going to create. It kills jobs because it hits business right 
between the eyes and takes away profits and resources that could 
have been used to expand business and hire more people.
<P>
	The second reason this tax inclusive pricing is bad is it makes us 
pay more for what we buy. Goodness knows, with this 
government's sucking $24 billion more out of our pockets every 
year than it did when it took office, we can ill afford to have 
increased costs.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	The third reason tax inclusive pricing should be scrapped is that 
it is clearly nothing more than a clumsy, shoddy attempt to hide the 
fact that the Liberals have broken another key election promise, 
which was to get rid of the GST.
<P>
	The fourth reason to get rid of tax inclusive pricing is that it is a 
big example of how we are losing democracy in this country, how 
we are losing the ability of the people to have a say in things that 
affect them. That is perhaps the most serious problem of all.
<P>
	I want the Liberals to know that I am going to agree with the 
Liberal finance minister, Paul Martin. The Liberal finance minister, 
Paul Martin, said on November 28, 1989: ``The goods and services 
tax is a stupid, inept and incompetent tax''. I agree with that 
statement. I agree that it is a tax which has caused nothing but 
headaches and grief to Canadians. I am sure all members of the 
House have had constituents in their offices who were absolutely 
beside themselves because the way the tax is administered, it is 
nearly impossible for them to know what the expectations are, what 
kind of rules and regulations they have to meet and what the true 
impact on their businesses will be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7772"> 7772 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberal finance minister, Paul Martin, said-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. I know that the 
Minister of Finance would appreciate the hon. member's 
agreement, but she must know that under the rules of the House she 
may not refer to him by name but only by his title. I would invite 
her to restrain herself in that regard.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will certainly respect 
that direction from the Chair.
<P>
	In April 1990 the Liberal finance minister, whose name is well 
known to all Canadians, said this: ``I would abolish the GST. The 
manufacturers sales tax is a bad tax and there is no excuse to repeal 
one bad thing by bringing in another one''. I consider those words 
to be words of wisdom. One has to question why a bad tax like the 
GST is now being replaced by another even worse tax, the HST, in 
three of our provinces.
<P>
	Those two statements by the Liberal finance minister were made 
while he was in opposition. Here is a statement which he made 
while he was the finance minister on June 21, 1994. Again this is a 
statement which I would agree with very strongly: ``It is almost 
impossible to design a tax that is more costly and more inefficient 
than the GST''.
<P>
	The finance minister has certainly outdone himself. He has now 
brought in the HST with TIP, which is more costly and more 
inefficient, if that is possible, than the GST.
<P>
	This is not just something for political rhetoric and political 
points. These taxes affect things which are very important to 
Canadians. In particular they affect jobs.
<P>
	Bill C-70 as now constituted will increase costs to retail business 
and result in a net loss of jobs, particularly in Atlantic Canada. 
Perhaps I should repeat that for the benefit of members who 
represent Canadians in the three Atlantic provinces. They are 
supposed to be their voice but we have heard precious little from 
the members of Parliament from the Atlantic region. They should 
be sticking up and standing up for the interests of their constituents. 
For their benefit, perhaps they need to be reminded that Bill C-70 
in its present form will increase the cost of doing business in the 
three Atlantic provinces. It will create confusion among consumers 
when shopping. It will decrease retail sales and will cost many, 
many Atlantic Canadians their jobs.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I know that many others who have spoken on this bill have been 
very clear about the concerns that have been raised by retailers who 
do business in the Atlantic provinces. The bottom line is that these 
business people, these job creators, these people who pay the wages 
of real Canadians in those three Atlantic provinces estimate that 
they will lose at least $100 million because of this foolish proposal 
by the Liberal government to hide its tax in the sticker price in 
those three Atlantic provinces only.
<P>
	When these things happen, the bottom line is that Canadians 
themselves have to pay the costs which costs Canadians more 
money. In addition to the fact that our taxes have been increased by 
this government by at least $24 billion every single year since it 
took over our affairs, it is now increasing costs by attempting to 
pretend it has kept a key election promise.
<P>
	It is important to emphasize that democracy itself is at stake 
when we talk about the way our taxes are structured. There are two 
elements in the way the provisions of this bill have been brought 
forward which I think Canadians, particularly Canadians in the 
affected Atlantic provinces, should be concerned about.
<P>
	One is that I did not see one single member from those provinces 
who represent thousands of Canadians whose jobs, incomes and 
spending discretion is going to be affected. I would also say that 
with closure being brought in, the concerns that they have are being 
stifled and cut off in this House.
<P>
	I see I am also being cut off because my time is finished. Thank 
you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to make these 
remarks on this bill. I urge this House to reject it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I believe I 
heard the hon. member opposite say that this government has 
imposed closure. That is untrue. Nothing of the sort has been done. 
I would like the record to be corrected.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I think that is a matter for 
debate. I do not think it is a point of order. The hon. member in her 
remarks did not say that it had been applied on this bill. She was 
careful to avoid suggesting any such thing. She said that the 
government has used closure. Clearly members disagree but I think 
the record is clear.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the third group 
of motions regarding Bill C-70 and the so-called harmonization 
agreement between the federal government and three Maritime 
provinces, and I am referring to the harmonization of federal and 
provincial sales tax.
<P>
	When we talk about harmonization, the subject of this third 
group of motions, we think about harmony, which means 
everything is all right and unfolding as it should. It ``flies through 
the air with the greatest of ease'', but that is certainly not the case 
with this bill.
<P>
	In January, when many of my Liberal colleagues were still on the 
slopes, the finance committee was sitting, and for three days, only 
three days, it invited representatives from the Maritimes to appear 
before Liberal, Bloc and Reform members. The government 
wanted to rush this bill through. It wanted to silence the opposition. 
I must say that in three days we got a very interesting sample of 
opposition, even from the Maritimes, to the proposed 
harmonization of the GST.
<P>
	One major witness, the Retail Council of Canada, whose 
members are responsible for 65 per cent of the retail trade, told us 
that this policy, this Bill C-70, should be scrapped.
<P>
	They were not against harmonization, far from it. In Quebec, we 
saw the advantages as far back as 1991, when we harmonized the 
sales tax with the federal GST, and since Quebec administers the 
GST on behalf of the federal government, we can hardly be against 
harmonization. We are in favour. However, the bill before the 
House today creates almost insurmountable problems for business.
<P>
	One of those problems is including the tax in the price of the 
product. The provisions of the bill allow merchants some latitude 
on whether they want to include the tax or indicate it separately, 
include it directly or only on certain products, and there are any 
number of exceptions.
<P>
	According to the Retail Council of Canada, we could have a 
situation where we would have four different ways of labelling the 
same product. How is the consumer supposed to find his way 
through this maze?
<P>
	Furthermore, people may be completely confused as to the 
actual price of a product while the new system is being phased in 
by the three Maritime provinces, where merchants will have four 
months to comply with the new sales tax legislation.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	I think that anyone would be foolish to include the tax in his 
prices, because these prices will not look very competitive. There 
are quite a few problems here.
<P>
	According to the Retail Council of Canada, phasing in the new 
system will cost about $100 million. That is not exactly peanuts for 
merchants in the three Maritime provinces. It will cost merchants 
$100 million for additional adjustments and $90 million annually 
to administer the new price structure, the new system that will be 
applied in these three provinces.
<P>
	During those three days, we heard some highly interesting 
testimony from representatives of companies, not small ones, but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7774"> 7774 </A></B>
<P>
very big Canadian companies which  do business in all of the 
provinces. Sears Canada, for example, made the following 
comment on this bill: ``The use of prices which incorporate the tax 
in a partially harmonized system will mean higher costs and more 
complex systems for Canadian retailers''.
<P>
	Sears has a catalogue shopping system, as you probably know. It 
will produce 52 million catalogues in 1997. The production of 
``harmonized'' catalogues, to fit in with the so-called harmonized 
system in the Maritimes, will cost Sears a fortune.
<P>
	We heard from other witnesses such as Canadian Tire, and I shall 
take the liberty of quoting their opposition to the government's 
plan and to the terrible complications imposed on them when it 
comes to pricing and stock management. To quote Canadian Tire:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``We are opposed to the piecemeal approach to the application of 
tax included pricing as part of the introduction of the new HST. 
This would create very significant ongoing costs as well as extreme 
confusion to our customers. There are no savings. In fact, there are 
increased costs''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is a quote from Canadian Tire's brief. There are companies 
like Canadian Tire and Sears Canada, and other major companies, 
which do business everywhere in Canada and have to prepare 
shipments of products to branch stores from a centralized product 
source. They will have terrible problems in managing various 
products that will then need to be shipped out to branches.
<P>
	Canadian Tire, for example, will be forced to divide its huge 
central warehouse into two parts: one for the products destined for 
the three Maritime provinces where harmonization is planned and 
one for those destined for the rest of Canada, as the price labels will 
be different. Products will have to be stocked specifically for the 
three Maritime provinces, where an agreement has been signed 
which makes no sense.
<P>
	Imagine, companies already find it complicated and expensive 
enough to handle their stocks, and now they are going to have a 
dual stock system imposed upon them, for goods to be shipped to 
the Maritimes and goods shipped to other provinces, a dual pricing 
and labelling system and, what is more, the three Maritime 
provinces will have complete leeway in the way they do their price 
labelling. Let me tell you, we are not out of the woods yet.
<P>
	That is why these major companies have made representations to 
the finance committee. Others could have as well, but could not 
afford to come to Ottawa. There are other small businesses opposed 
to this bill. They have asked that application of the bill be deferred, 
because it is not manageable, is more costly to businesses, and is a 
complex system such as has never been seen  anywhere else in the 
world. What is more, instead of making consumers' lives easier, it 
makes the system more confusing. We are no longer in the good old 
days at the beginning of this century.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Why do the members of the government not recognize that to err 
is human and that they may have made a mistake in this agreement 
with the maritimes? When they realize they made a mistake-this 
is what we teach young children when they start to understand 
common sense-we are prepared to forgive them. But they have to 
take the agreement, tear it up and stop muddling things up with 
their total incompetence. It makes no sense.
<P>
	Even in the maritimes, even with a gift of $1 billion, they oppose 
it. They totally disagree with this way of handling the GST where 
$1 billion of their tax money is spent to compensate the 
governments of the three maritime provinces in order to make the 
Minister of Finance look good and to get the government out of a 
mess. When we get to the point where, even with a gift like this, the 
people in the maritimes are saying that the bill is stupid, we have to 
listen to them.
<P>
	It is not only the nasty separatists, as the slugs opposite keep 
saying daily, it is a matter of common sense and good economic 
management, of giving business every opportunity to perform in an 
increasingly competitive world and, above all, of making 
consumers' lives easier. Although this bill is supposed to simplify 
their lives, it shamelessly complicates them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise once again and speak to Bill C-70. We continue to 
have grave concerns about Bill C-70, and I, once again, will run 
through some of those major concerns.
<P>
	The reason it is important that the Reform Party take time to run 
through some of the great concerns Canadians have about Bill C-70 
is because the Liberal Party representatives from Atlantic Canada 
have failed to rise to their feet to defend the people of Atlantic 
Canada. As I pointed out before, this whole thing came about with 
the understanding that the GST would be eliminated, that we would 
not have a GST once the Liberals came to power.
<P>
	Although the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister 
denied it after they made the promises, unfortunately for them, 
television cameras do not lie, videotape does not lie and they were 
found out. They were revealed to have made promises to get rid of 
the GST. They had to concoct a wild scheme to try to convince 
Canadians that the GST was going to disappear. All they did, as 
members well know, is come up with a billion dollars to bribe 
Liberal Atlantic Canadian premiers to come on board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7775"> 7775 </A></B>
<P>
	From that sorry beginning, we are once again in a situation 
where the people of Atlantic Canada are being denied the chance 
to hold Liberal members of Parliament accountable for a promise. 
I want to touch on that in a little more detail.
<P>
	During the finance committee hearings, witnesses came from 
across the country but in particular from Atlantic Canada. Those 
witnesses asked why the hearings could not be held in Atlantic 
Canada. As this legislation has such a profound effect on Atlantic 
Canada, why did the finance committee not take the time to go to 
Atlantic Canada to hear from real live Atlantic Canadians?
<P>
	A handful of people did come from Atlantic Canada, but not 
everybody can give up a day to come to Ottawa to tell the 
government their story. These people made the point rather well 
that in a democracy, people should have the right to representation 
before taxation, at least the right to consultation before the 
government bulldozes ahead and implements a taxation system that 
nobody asked for and nobody wanted. That is a basic right.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	It was not very long ago that all kinds of GST rallies were held 
across the country, where people were protesting the imposition of 
the GST. Maybe Mr. Speaker was involved in them at one time. I 
have no idea. People across the country were very upset and 
protested what the Tories were doing. Indeed, the Liberals made 
tremendous gains by saying that they would never, ever bring in a 
tax of that kind that nobody wants. And the people said with one 
voice: ``Don't you dare do that''.
<P>
	Part of the reason that the Tories disappeared off the political 
landscape was because they brought in a tax that nobody wanted, 
that people did not ask for. The people felt they were not being 
represented. Consequently, the Tories were reduced to a mere two 
seats in the House of Commons.
<P>
	As Yogi Berra would say: ``It is deja vu all over again''. The 
Liberals are bringing in a tax they said they hated, that they would 
scrap and kill. They have thrown $1 billion at the problem to try 
and fix it. That did not work. Now we are in a situation where they 
are denying the people of Atlantic Canada the right to have a say on 
a tax that will fundamentally affect them.
<P>
	During the hearings a number of provincial politicians appeared 
before us. Members would acknowledge that it is really quite 
unusual to have a number of provincial politicians appear before a 
committee to protest something that is going to take place in their 
regions. They had to come to Ottawa was because the Liberals 
would not allow hearings in Atlantic Canada on a tax that is going 
to affect those people. The fact that these prominent citizens took 
the time and effort to come to Atlantic Canada speaks volumes. It 
says something about the lack of representation that the people of 
Atlantic Canada are getting from their Liberal MPs. They would  
not be forced to send provincial representatives to Ottawa if the 
MPs in Ottawa would stand up for them. But they are completely 
silent.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada where unemployment is a curse that has 
plagued that region for a generation, we heard witness after witness 
say that the new harmonization legislation was going force 
businesses to close.
<P>
	One gentleman came before us and said that he had already 
closed eight or nine stores in New Brunswick at a cost of 
approximately 72 jobs. A witness representing Carleton Cards said 
19 stores would be closed. He did not put any caveat on it. If this 
legislation came in, 19 stores would be closed, again affecting a 
number of jobs.
<P>
	We heard from a gentleman from Woolworths Canada that has 
125 stores in Atlantic Canada who told us Woolworths could 
possibly close as many as 30 stores in Atlantic Canada if the 
legislation came in.
<P>
	Unbelievably, these people had to come to Ottawa. They could 
not talk to their local representatives. They could not talk to the 
Liberal MPs because the MPs could not talk to the finance minister. 
They could not get their message across. In other words, they were 
not doing their jobs. To date I have yet to hear one Liberal MP from 
Atlantic Canada stand and list the concerns of Atlantic Canadians 
with respect to the harmonization legislation.
<P>
	If anyone had sat in on the meetings of the finance committee 
two weeks ago they would know that there are tremendous 
concerns with this legislation. People are concerned it will kill 
jobs, close down businesses, create higher prices, less selection for 
the people of Atlantic Canada. This legislation will have a 
profound impact on people with low or fixed incomes.
<P>
	A great debate is raging in the country about child poverty and 
the government is proposing to put through legislation that will 
drive up costs on items like gasoline, home heating fuel and 
utilities. The poorest people in Atlantic Canada simply cannot 
afford to bear the disproportionate burden that the HST will mean 
to them when the legislation is implemented.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	The point again is that there has been a profound lack of 
representation from Liberal MPs for people in Atlantic Canada. It 
has been a dereliction of duty. There have been a number of 
editorials written in Atlantic Canadian newspapers about the fact 
that there were not hearings there and that Atlantic Canadian MPs 
have not been standing up for their constituents.
<P>
	I just hope that over the course of this debate Liberal MPs across 
the way have gotten the point, that when they come to Ottawa they 
are not given their $63,000 so they can sit across the way and shout 
names, but that they have a job to do. They have a job to do in terms 
of representing their constituents, to go out and hear what they have 
to say in the first place and to encourage the  finance committee 
and other committees to visit there when there are bills which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7776"> 7776 </A></B>
<P>
concern that area, and finally to deliver the message to their own 
government.
<P>
	We do not come to this place just to collect our salaries, or in the 
case of the Liberals their MP pensions. We come to the House of 
Commons to represent our constituents, something the Liberal MPs 
have completely failed to do with respect to the harmonization 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this debate, 
which has not surprisingly attracted a great deal of interest. I would 
first like to address a very important aspect of wanting to bring in 
the sort of reform being proposed in Bill C-70, the bill dealing with 
the GST. I want to talk about the confidence the public must have in 
our institutions if the decisions the government takes are to become 
reality.
<P>
	As I have said, this element of trust is a basic principle in many 
of our institutions, particularly in the area of taxation. We know 
that it is a basic principle of tax law that a citizen must file his tax 
return, and it is presumed that this return is accurate until proven 
otherwise.
<P>
	The same is true in the justice system. A person is considered 
innocent until proven guilty. This principle also applies here in the 
House, where our rules of procedure prevent us from calling a 
colleague a liar, and require us to presume, particularly during oral 
question period, that when a minister gives a reply, he is telling the 
truth.
<P>
	Clearly, this element of trust is a fundamental part of our 
institutions. Unfortunately, when it comes to this extremely 
important bill, the element of trust is missing. It is missing, and this 
will have enormous consequences, because members of the public, 
who are watching us and who must suffer the terrible effects of this 
bill, will quite rightly rebel, because they do not have confidence in 
our institutions or in the elected officials who must make decisions.
<P>
	They have many reasons for expressing this lack of trust. I will 
give a few well known examples still in the public eye right now. 
There is the Airbus affair, which has shown us the Minister of 
Justice tangled up in something that looks more like a settling of 
political accounts than a real case that supposedly needed 
clarification.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The reputation of former Prime Minister Mulroney was attacked. 
The current Prime Minister and Minister of Justice got so deep into 
trouble that, on the advice of their own solicitors, they eventually 
made amends and apologized. After dickering for months and 
wasting millions of taxpayers' dollars in legal fees, they ended up 
apologizing, saying that a mistake had been made in the Airbus 
affair and that former Prime Minister Mulroney not only had done 
nothing wrong but that his conduct should never have been called 
into question.
<P>
	The same thing is happening in the tainted blood scandal, with 
the Krever commission. Documents were destroyed. Obviously, 
the commission can no longer have access to these documents and 
use them to make recommendations in its upcoming report.
<P>
	The same thing is also happening with the Somalia inquiry. The 
defence minister has just put an end to the mandate of the 
Létourneau commission, in a highhanded way, in my opinion. He 
has just decided that the hearings would have to be completed by 
the end of March and that the commission would have to submit its 
report by the end of June. However, several witnesses have yet to 
be heard, and the public is convinced that more remains unknown 
than known.
<P>
	These examples show the impact of trust in our institutions, or 
the lack of it. This is why Canadians no longer believe in their 
representatives and, more often than not, are cynical about the 
electoral and political processes. This threatens the future of our 
institutions.
<P>
	Bill C-70 is a case in point. During the last election campaign, 
the Prime Minister himself, the Deputy Prime Minister and all the 
Liberal candidates kept repeating that they would scrap the GST. 
Not only was the GST not scrapped, but it was maintained and, 
through Bill C-70, it will be made even worse. The bill establishes 
two tax systems: one for the maritime provinces and one for the 
rest of Canada. This is unbelievable.
<P>
	This will destroy the confidence that is so necessary for our 
institutions. Mr. Speaker, you are impartial, but I am convinced 
that your Liberal colleagues think this is all a figment of my 
imagination. They think I am making these comments just because 
I belong to the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, and must 
therefore criticize the government. They say we are trying to 
destroy the Liberal government's good image every chance we get.
<P>
	Be that as it may, yesterday, a Gallup poll showed that 29 per 
cent of Quebecers believe the Prime Minister of Canada and 
member for Saint-Maurice is doing a good job. Merely 29 per cent 
of the people in Quebec believe he is doing a good job. This means 
that 71 per cent believe he is not doing a good job. Therefore, the 
people do not have confidence in the Prime Minister and his 
government. In Quebec, in the upcoming election, once again, the 
people will express this lack of confidence in the Liberal 
government by re-electing members of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Hopefully the Bloc Quebecois' performance will reflect the 
people's lack of confidence in the government expressed in this 
poll. I have no doubt that the people of Quebec are fully aware of 
the bad, unfortunate decisions  made by this government, which 
will adversely affect our fellow citizens in their daily lives. Just 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7777"> 7777 </A></B>
<P>
think of the unemployed, whose benefits have been cut every year 
since the Liberals came to office, just to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	I will close by saying that, these past few years, not only did the 
Bloc Quebecois denounce bad decisions-and we will keep doing 
so for the rest of this government's mandate-but we also proposed 
major changes which, if implemented, would improve our tax 
system.
<P>
	Lastly, I would like to acknowledge the outstanding work done 
by our colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, 
with the help of the hon. member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies 
and the hon. member for La Prairie, so they could table a second 
report this week. This is unprecedented in Canadian history. I see 
that Liberal members agree. This is a precedent; the official 
opposition tabled a realistic, practical tax reform proposal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I am going to recognize the member 
for Prince George-Bulkley Valley. You, sir, will have the floor 
when we return after question period. Rather than interrupt your no 
doubt formidable speech, with your permission I will go to 
statements by members.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr.

British Columbia hospital's experience with the Liberals' version 
of publicly funded health care.
<P>
	It is February 4 and as usual there are no beds available in the 
hospital. Eight out of 13 emergency room bays are occupied by 
seriously injured people. The hospital's response: cut 10 more beds 
because there is no funding.
<P>
	There are 12 male and female patients in one room separated just 
by sheets with one bathroom. There is no funding for staff. A 
quadriplegic has to be turned, cannot be, develops bed sores, 
becomes septic and dies.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	A sixty-year old patient has a heart attack and needs urgent 
transfer to Vancouver. There are no beds because there is no money 
and the patient dies.
<P>
	A young woman needs urgent dialysis. There is no funding for 
any staff, the patient has a cardiac arrest and almost dies.
<P>
	This is the Liberal government's version of publicly funded, 
accessible health care. Shame on this government for deceiving the 
Canadian public and playing political football with the health care 
of Canadians.

<P>
	Networks of Centres of Excellence have won an international

The networks have been praised in Europe and the United States as 
areas in which Canada has excelled by getting university

Mr. Speaker, one of Canada's major banks recently announced a 
great new way to encourage job creation.
<P>
	CIBC has agreed to lend money to small businesses at reduced 
interest rates if they promise to create jobs. A business that borrows 
the maximum of $100,000 will save $3,000 in the first year.
<P>
	The bank will advance loans at one percentage point below 
prime to small firms that promise to use the money to expand and 
create at least one full time job or three part time jobs in the first 
year of the loan.

government intervened to enable Canadian Airline employees to 
vote on issues affecting their future but now denies Pacific 
fishermen the same right on licence stacking.
<P>
	In January, when the minister lifted the moratorium on licence 
stacking, he stacked the deck to favour large fishery operations 
with deep pockets. They can afford to buy the additional licences, 
assuring themselves the lion's share of the catch.
<P>
	At the same time, the minister denied small fishermen and 
communities their right to stay in business and keep their jobs.
<P>
	By delaying the vote on stacking until November, the minister 
assures himself an affirmative response because only those who 
buy into this expensive plan will be eligible to vote.
<P>
	Reducing the size of the fleet does not address the survival of the 
salmon because the smaller fleet still has more catch capacity than 
the resource can withstand.
<P>
	There are avenues readily available and easily instituted to limit 
the efficiency of the fleet, spread the wealth and protect the 
resource but the minister ignores this option.

Columbians as opposed to just another Liberal hack appointed by 
the Prime Minister whose only loyalty is to the Liberal Party.
<P>
	B.C. already has a law on the books which allows for British 
Columbians to elect their next senator. Before the last election, the 
current Prime Minister promised that the Liberal Party would 
establish an elected Senate within two years of its forming 
government.
<P>
	Yet in the last three years, the Prime Minister has appointed 
more political hacks to the Upper House than Mulroney did in nine 
years in Parliament. So much for Liberal integrity.
<P>
	Now is the time for the Prime Minister to put the democratic 
rights of the people ahead of the political interests of their party 
and allow British Columbians to elect their next senator.

GST itself and both the previous Tory and the present Liberal

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is pre-budget time, of course, and I imagine the 
Minister of Finance is working very hard on his budget. When he 
read the documents the Bloc contributed to the process, he must 
have realized that the Canadian tax system needed reform. 
Unfortunately, the minister has never been very forthcoming about 
tax reform. He does not seem interested.
<P>
	Today, as budget day draws nearer, I want to ask him and I have 
not yet given up on convincing him, if he agrees that the Canadian 
personal and corporate tax system needs a thorough review, and 
whether he intends to proceed accordingly in his next budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the whole tax system must be modernized, because the economy 
evolves, because the ability of taxpayers to consider their financial 
situation evolves, because of the way corporations are able to find 
tax havens, or simply because of the globalization of our economy.
<P>
	That is why, since we came to power, we proceeded with 
thorough reforms as each budget was brought down, and we 
certainly intend to keep modernizing our tax system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all socio-economic partners agree it is important for the 
government not only to modernize the tax system but also to bring 
about thorough changes that will make it fairer, more equitable, 
more productive and will help stimulate the economy.
<P>
	In November we tabled proposals suggesting that the minister 
eliminate tax spending on companies that are not productive. In the 
process, the government would recover $3 billion and use the 
money to stimulate job creation by introducing appropriate fiscal 
measures that are attractive and provide an incentive for business.
<P>
	Does the minister intend to include this suggestion in his next 
budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Absolutely, Mr. 
Speaker. I have already said that I read the Bloc Quebecois report 
on corporations with great interest.
<P>
	I think the federal government's situation was accurately 
described by Quebec's Minister of Finance, Bernard Landry. In 
referring to his own situation, he was actually answering the Bloc's 
question, and I quote what he said: ``Regarding the tax burdens on 
corporations'', because that is what the Leader of the Opposition 
referred to, ``these tend to diminish the yield on their investments. 
Companies lose the incentive to invest, which means fewer jobs. 
Furthermore, as the tax burden in Quebec increases, foreign 
companies are less likely to invest here and create jobs. It is clear 
that higher tax levels kill jobs''.
<P>
	That is what Bernard Landry had to say, and I think the Quebec 
Minister of Finance is right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is rather frustrating. The Minister of Finance did not 
understand the question at all.
<P>
	We are not asking the Minister of Finance to increase the tax 
burden on corporations. This is about eliminating unproductive 
fiscal spending deductions that do not stimulate job creation and 
instead make these deductions contingent on the number of jobs 
created.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois never asked the government to increase the 
taxes of these corporations. We simply asked the government to 
redirect its tax spending. The minister does not understand tax 
reform. That is the problem. And he is the Minister of Finance. I do 
not have much of a problem with the federal tax system, because 
pretty soon we will no longer be affected by it.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	I wish the Minister of Finance would realize that by refusing to 
make thorough changes in the federal tax system, he is also 
preventing such changes from taking place in the provinces, 
because the two are closely related. He takes the lead, so he should 
know.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, we are always prepared to co-operate with the 
provinces. In fact, we have taken the lead in many areas, and 
Quebec has followed suit.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition is asking us what we have done. I 
will tell you what we have done. We put in place new rules for 
declaring foreign assets if the value of these assets exceeds a 
certain amount. We added a temporary surtax on banks. We 
scrapped a tax return for businesses that are not incorporated. I 
could go on. As I said, we have done a great deal and we intend to 
continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance was to table his three pages. We 
are still 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7782"> 7782 </A></B>
<P>
waiting for him to table them in the  House. For his three pages, we 
could give him three hundred pages of analyses of corporate and 
individual taxes.
<P>
	The government often says that job creation is its primary goal. 
The Minister of Finance has said that ``every effort of government, 
including the tax system, must be directed toward that end''.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. If the Minister of 
Finance thinks that taxes can play a determining role in creating 
jobs, would it not make sense to immediately implement the Bloc 
Quebecois' suggestion of creating an employment RRSP program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first, the member asked me if I am prepared to table the document. 
The three pages I have are a summary. If all the measures were to 
be included, the document would be longer.
<P>
	Do you want me to table the document? No? When you are 
ready, Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to do so.
<P>
	As regards the employment RRSP program suggested by the 
member, this is not the first time such a suggestion has been made. 
I am prepared to examine the program. However, as the member 
must know, there is another angle, that is, RRSPs exist to protect 
the retirement system, that is, seniors' pensions. We have to ask 
ourselves the following question: Should we change the function of 
RRSPs, that is, put the retirement system at risk? We should debate 
this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the Minister of Finance's answer to this question, 
because it was a question.
<P>
	At the moment, we have the home buyers' plan. It enables 
people to draw on their RRSP in order to purchase their first home. 
Four years later, they have to start repaying what they borrowed at 
the rate of one thirteenth of the total amount a year over the next 
thirteen years.
<P>
	In other words, taxpayers borrow from themselves. We are 
proposing exactly the same thing. Under an employment RRSP 
program, an unemployed taxpayer could create his own job with a 
start-up fund where he could take-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This is novel: I have the question here and the 
answer there. Please continue with your question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Since this would have no effect on the 
preparations for the taxpayer's retirement, is he prepared to 
implement an employment RRSP program, which could give a 
boost to over two thirds of the jobs created annually, which qualify 
as self-employment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
two or three years ago, at the very start of our mandate, we looked 
at exactly seven options.
<P>
	The vast majority of experts in the field, including most 
representatives of small and medium sized businesses in Canada, 
told us that it was more important to protect rather than risk the 
retirement system of these people. That would be the end result of 
the member's suggestion, in that it would put their retirement at 
risk by asking them to invest in businesses which could very well 
go bankrupt.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Dr. Jo Hauser of the health department shredded some 
documents in 1989. They included documents going back to 1982 
when the Liberals were in power. Those documents could have 
explained why the blood system became tainted.
<P>
	In 1993 Bob Fowler and John Anderson shredded memos that 
might have pointed to a high level cover-up at the defence 
department. In 1994 more key documents that could have shed 
light on the Somalia scandal were shredded, altered or hidden.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. It is a very simple 
one. Is the shredding, hiding, altering or destruction of public 
documents such as these right or wrong?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government certainly 
does not support the shredding of any such documents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Therefore I 
assume the Deputy Prime Minister is saying that such activity is 
wrong, Mr. Speaker. If that is the case, then surely the Deputy 
Prime Minister also agrees that people who are guilty of such 
wrongdoing should be held accountable. The information 
commissioner thinks so, but he says that he has not been given the 
power to hold public servants accountable for improperly 
destroying public documents or records.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Is the government 
willing to give the information commissioner the power to hold 
people who destroy evidence required by public inquiries, people 
like Jo Hauser, Bob Fowler and John Anderson, accountable for 
their actions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, any illegal shredding of 
documents should most properly be handled by the organization 
responsible for those kinds of criminal activities, the RCMP.

Speaker, the government's handling of evidence shredders and the

<P>
Deputy Prime Minister's answer is another indication of the 
government's double standard when it comes to ethics.
<P>
	The RCMP have been called in to investigate Jo Hauser's 
destruction of the Canadian blood committee files, but it is unlikely 
that the RCMP will be able to get anywhere near the Prime 
Minister's friend Bob Fowler. What is more, the RCMP said 
yesterday that destroying such documents may not even be a 
clearly established offence under the Canadian Criminal Code.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. What concrete 
action will the government take to ensure that people who destroy 
evidence required by public inquiries are held accountable for their 
actions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I most strongly object to 
the claim of the hon. member that somehow the RCMP would be 
precluded from doing its work because of the ``friendship'' 
between the Prime Minister and anyone. It is a very serious 
allegation to make against the RCMP.
<P>
	I would hope that the member, along with all members of the 
House, will respect the fact that the RCMP is impartial and 
completely capable of carrying out its responsibilities.

aspects of the tobacco legislation.
<P>
	Given that the Minister of Health does not share the view of his

overwhelming from all regions of the country.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
RCMP is investigating the destruction of the Canadian blood 
committee documents, files and tapes from 1982 to 1989. They 
would have explained why thousands of Canadians were infected 
with tainted blood. The shredding of public documents is 
extremely serious and all evidence shredders should be held 
accountable for their actions.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister just said she thinks it is a serious 
matter. She also said, let the RCMP do their work. That is exactly 
what we want.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Will the RCMP be 
called in to investigate the alleged evidence shredding of Bob 
Fowler and John Anderson?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very 
interesting to hear the hon. member discuss alleged shredding.
<P>
	For all of us to understand what has gone on in a number offices 
and a number of departments, perhaps what the hon. member is 
proposing is that RCMP operate the shredders right across the 
country, including perhaps the one in her office.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
not sure what to thank the hon. member for.
<P>
	Senior aides to former defence minister Kim Campbell have 
sworn affidavits that Bob Fowler and John Anderson shredded 
important memos that pointed to a high level cover-up in the 
department of defence. If these serious allegations are true, then 
Fowler and Anderson must be held accountable.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unless I am mistaken, the minister is upset.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Prime Minister remained silent on the issue of 
culture. Yet, his cabinet is divided on this most important issue for 
Canadian and Quebec cultures.
<P>
	Last week, the Minister for International Trade said that 
NAFTA's cultural exemption was a myth, while the heritage

development.
<P>

is the real spokesperson on this issue? Who is stating the 
government's position: Is it the Deputy Prime Minister when she 
says she is trying to get culture excluded from WTO agreements, or 
is it her colleague who has no intention of defending this cause at 
the international level?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely vital that 
the Government of Canada take a unanimous stand on an issue that 
concerns us all. I am just as concerned that, when the Prime 
Minister put me in charge of the heritage department, he asked me 
to fight hard for Canadian culture because it must be done.
<P>

for our culture is concerned, I am in complete agreement with all of 
my cabinet colleagues, including the Minister for International 
Trade.

am asking the Deputy Prime Minister to confirm that she is the 
government's official spokesperson.
<P>
	I am asking her why, yesterday, she said she would wait for the 
WTO decision concerning <I>Sports Illustrated</I> before deciding 
whether to appeal. I would remind her of the very clear conclusions 
stated in the 1994 Tassé report regarding this magazine, and I 
would also remind her that 80 per cent of magazines bought at 
newsstands in Canada come from abroad.
<P>
	In making her statement yesterday, the minister contradicted the 
comments she made last week when she said she would definitely 
appeal the decision. What made the minister back down?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, last week I said the same 
thing I am saying today. The decision has not yet been made. It is 
impossible to confirm that we will appeal, given that the decision 
has not even been made.
<P>
	The ruling that was made is a provisional decision. We will wait 
for the final decision, which should come at the end of this month. I 
can assure the hon. member that once a final decision is made, we 
will use every available means, including our right to appeal this 
unacceptable demand by the Americans.

because I don't want to be seen as a person in military uniform''.

	Deputy Minister Fowler visited Somalia between February 5 and 
9, 1993 and Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Anderson was in 
Somalia on March 6, just two days after two Somalis were shot. Yet 
the muzzling of the inquiry precludes either Fowler or Anderson 
appearing. The commission says they simply do not have enough 
time.

Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to say to 
my hon. friend that under no circumstances at any time have we 
ever attempted to influence the choice of witnesses who should be 
heard before the inquiry.
<P>
	The Somalia inquiry was extended now on three occasions. 
Upon the last request made by the commissioners, the government 
determined that we would extend the period of the inquiry until the 
end of June allowing for hearings to be held until the end of March.

	There is absolutely no reason why the commissioners cannot ask 
the people to whom my hon. friend has just referred to appear

not able to hear them over the last nearly two years now that this

	I undertake to provide this information to my hon. colleague. 
Just so I am clear, I would appreciate it if he could let me know 
exactly what details he is looking for concerning the funding of the 
military college in Kingston. We could also provide him with 
figures to enable him to make a comparison with the military 
college in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, according to 
our sources, the astronomical costs at Kingston prove only one 
thing: it was a mistake to close down the military college in 
Saint-Jean, where military training was provided to officer cadets 
at a much lower cost.
<P>
	Are we to understand that, once again, the government is unable 
to admit it made a mistake, to the point where it would rather just 
keep spending and spending, while French-speaking members of 
the armed forces suffer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as far as the 
French-speaking military or young people looking to train and 
carve out a career in the Canadian Forces are concerned, we will do 
everything we can to make sure they get the best possible training.
<P>
	Regarding the other part of the question, where the hon. member 
implied that we tend to spend recklessly, I must say I gave that up 
long ago.

<P>
	The evidence that has been provided to me as minister is that I 
have a fiduciary obligation as well as a legal obligation to comply

<P>
	I want to say to my colleague opposite that information was 
provided to me in a preliminary report on December 3, as I believe 
he made reference to yesterday, which is a standard procedure 
under the access to information provisions. Thereafter the 
department responds. It is concluded by the information 
commissioner making a final report, which I believe he did on 
January 21. Thereafter that report was made public immediately, 
forwarded to Justice Krever and thereafter forwarded to the 
solicitor general for the purposes of an RCMP investigation if they 
deem it appropriate.

pursuing and promoting the interests of rural Canada as have a 
great many members of the caucus on the government side.

	The throne speech last year indicated the general nature of the

improving access to information technology and improving the 
quality of information available to rural Canadians about the

development fund which among other things will pump in excess

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The Department of National Defence is the subject of an 
unprecedented application to the Federal Court by the 
commissioner of official languages, who is accusing it of systemic 
discrimination against members of francophone soldiers' families. 
This is especially the case in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, where 
several francophone families have been the victims of this 
disgraceful and generalized discrimination.
<P>
	How can the defence minister tolerate the systemic 
discrimination practised by his department for over 26 years 
against members of francophone soldiers' families on Canadian 
army bases?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have already 
had an opportunity to meet with the official languages 
commissioner for the very purpose of discussing the problem in 
Moose Jaw that the hon. member is refering to. There were also 
other situations that I thought were unacceptable in other regions of 
the country.
<P>
	Following these meetings, I asked my department to report to me 
as quickly as possible on what can be done to correct circumstances 
which, I am in agreement with my hon. colleague, were 
unacceptable.
<P>
	We will try to move ahead as quickly as possible, and I hope to 
be able to get back to her in the near future about concrete action 
taken in this regard.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to a degree I find the minister's reply reassuring or 
encouraging. But according to our information, and the minister is 
well placed to tell us if it is incorrect, the department is getting 
ready to try and have the court disallow the official language 
commissioner's application.
<P>
	Why has the minister decided to take the same approach as his 
predecessors who, for 26 years, have  refused to allow 
francophones on military bases access to services in French, 
although it

could come before the courts or be litigious. I am, however, very 
aware of the need of men and women in the Canadian Forces to 
have services available to them in the language of their choice.
<P>
	In the cases referred to by the hon. member, it is clear to us that 
the situation was unacceptable, and we are going to look into it.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
saw on the CBC town hall that the Prime Minister believes that one 
of the best job strategies is to rely on blind luck. If that fails, the 
second best job strategy is apparently to try to steal jobs from 
somebody else if you cannot get your own.
<P>
	In a crass political move, apparently the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs has decided to steal the 900 jobs that are currently in place 
at NORAD in North Bay and move them to Winnipeg. That will 
cost about $15 million. Even the Liberal MP from Nipissing has 
publicly voiced his opposition to this job stealing by the minister.
<P>
	Will the minister reverse his decision and keep the NORAD jobs 
in North Bay?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that the 
hon. member probably is very familiar with what is described as 
the hole at North Bay. But in fact, if he was aware of what is going 
on in the restructuring of the command control and other aspects of 
the air force activity in the Canadian forces he would know, 
because I said yesterday in response to a question outside the 
House of Commons, by people who are familiar with this subject, 
that absolutely no decision has been made with respect to the 
location of these centres and no decision is imminent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the newspaper reports, the premier of Ontario is not 
buying that and neither is the member from Nipissing. Both have 
publicly voiced their opposition and both say that apparently this 
decision has already been made.
<P>
	Will the minister reassure these people that the decision has not 
been made and in fact that air command will stay in North Bay and 
will not be moved to Winnipeg?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, air command is 
in Winnipeg. General de Quetteville is in Winnipeg. That was a 
thing that was decided some time ago.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr.

government to intervene in the disastrous grain movement situation

million in lost revenues and demurrage costs. We agree with the 
Canadian Wheat Board and would add that government policies 
such as privatizing CN Rail, deregulating the rail industry, 
changing the car allocation policy, allowing the abandonment of 
rail lines and condoning inappropriate downsizing within the 
railways have all contributed to this problem that keeps grain from 
moving to the ports.

Does he not agree that the federal government has a responsibility

and the authority that is required to get the railways to make grain a 
priority, and that he should use the full extent of his authority to get

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

the hon. gentleman refers is, he will agree, rather limited.
<P>
	In terms of the nature of the problem, it would appear that the 
difficulty this season does not relate to rolling stock or to delivery 
of supplies in the country or to port operations. Rather, it is a 
combination of severe weather conditions coupled with a shortage 
of locomotive power.
<P>
	I am advised by both railways that in the course of the last 
number of days, particular efforts have been made to augment the 
locomotive power to catch up on the existing backlog. It is also fair 
to observe that it is cold every January, it snows every January and 
the railways should do better.

now to Group No. 3.
<P>
	In introducing my presentation to Group No. 2, I wanted to point 
out that these particular amendments to this bill are about a whole 
larger picture than simply the GST. I wanted to bring it to the 
attention of Liberal members opposite so that they might be able to 
recognize some of their past deeds that they committed during the 
1993 election.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7790"> 7790 </A></B>
<P>
	I talked about when is a promise not really a promise. It was 
clear that in that case it would not really be a  promise if it was a 
verbal promise made by the Liberal Party even though, as I pointed 
out, the highest courts in the land have recognized that a verbal 
promise is and can be and has been deemed to be legally binding. 
But not to the Liberal government.
<P>
	I would like to use another phrase now to introduce my 
comments on Group No. 3 of the amendments. I am drawing a line 
from an old move called ``Love Story'' many years ago. The line is 
``being in love means never having to say you're sorry''. I would 
like to revamp that line and say this to the Liberal members, that 
telling the truth first means never having to say you're sorry. They 
might consider that in the next election campaign as they go door to 
door, coffee shop to coffee shop, meeting to meeting, verbally 
making election promises to the people of Canada that they know 
they are not able to keep and will not keep.
<P>
	This is the very thing that has created the cynicism, the mistrust, 
the attitude that politicians rank lower on the acceptability scale 
than the lowest form of occupation we can find in this country 
because politicians like these people across the House here have 
partaken in a deception of the Canadian people in the 1993 
election. They have verbally promised the Canadian people that 
they would kill, scrap and abolish the GST. Yes, they did. Evidence 
shows it over and over again that is exactly what they did and they 
have the gall to sit here and deny that they did not say it when they 
have been caught in their own lies.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, the word ``deception'' was 
borderline. The word ``lies'' is not acceptable in this House. I 
would ask the hon. member to withdraw that immediately.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, of course I withdraw the word 
``lies''.
<P>
	This party, these members have been caught in their own 
misrepresentation when they went door to door all across this 
country and told the people of Canada, rank and file hardworking 
Canadian taxpayers that they were going to give them some tax 
relief by killing the GST.
<P>
	I said earlier telling the truth first means never having to say you 
are sorry. The minister of heritage had to say she was sorry about 
her promises on the GST. She had to resign and seek election again 
in her riding. The Minister of Finance on record has said: ``I'm 
sorry. We promised to kill the GST. It was a mistake and we 
apologize for it''.
<P>
	It is absolutely unbelievable that two ministers in this Liberal 
government have come forth and said they were sorry, not having 
to do so, not willingly. They were dragged kicking and screaming 
to that apology, kicking and screaming by the mounting pressure 
from the Canadian people and the Reform Party, which led the 
charge. While these two ministers have come forward and made 
public apologies about their GST  misrepresentations, the Prime 
Minister of this country, the person who has been elected to the 
highest office in this country, who is supposed to display the 
highest form of integrity and honesty, has not come forward even 
though the Prime Minister has been shown several times on video 
tapes from the 1993 election to be saying: ``We will scrap, kill and 
abolish the GST. I promise you that''.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	He has said that many times and he does not have the integrity to 
come forward and say ``I am sorry, we made a mistake. I got caught 
up in the election furore of 1993 and I said some things that perhaps 
we could not keep, some promises we could not keep''. He does not 
have the integrity to do that.
<P>
	This is the Prime Minister of Canada we are talking about. What 
kind of an example does that send to the Canadian people when the 
Prime Minister of Canada cannot stand up and say ``I was wrong, 
we were wrong, we should not have done it, we should not have 
said it''? What kind of an example does that send to Canadians? 
What kind of an example does that send to the Canadian youth who 
look to their parliamentarians for direction? They are told that the 
parliamentarians in this House of Commons are people of integrity 
and honesty. What kind of an example does that send?
<P>
	Be sure about this fact. The Reform Party will stand here day 
after day and we will hold the feet of the Prime Minister of Canada 
to the fire on the GST misrepresentation, as we have done to all the 
members here; as we did to force the minister of heritage to say she 
was sorry and resign from her seat; as we did to force the Minister 
of Finance to say ``I'm sorry it was a mistake''; and as we will 
continue to do into this next election. Hopefully the Prime Minister 
will show some integrity and take his position at the apology table 
and tell the Canadian people ``I'm sorry, we should not have said 
that''.
<P>
	The provinces across Canada recognize exactly what kind of a 
scam is going on in this House, what kind of a scam is going on in 
this GST harmonization. Ontario has said that the plan would cost 
its consumers between $2 billion and $3 billion extra per year in 
their purchases. Ontario's premier has gone so far as to say that the 
subsidization package given to the maritimes was in fact a bribe. 
Alberta's premier has said the compensation component was a 
bribe put forward to get Liberal premiers in Atlantic Canada to sign 
on to the deal, and sign on they did. Why? Because their Liberal 
premiers-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. It is clear that the 
member who is speaking now is carrying with him a degree of 
frustration for whatever reason. He has alleged in this House within 
the last 60 seconds that what is happening in this House is a scam.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7791"> 7791 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I suggest to you to consider whether that may be 
unparliamentary. He has also used the word ``bribe'' and I ask you 
to consider whether that may be unparliamentary. He has also 
alleged that I as a member of my party did or said things in the 
last election campaign which I know not to be accurate. I know 
this is a point of debate but I would ask you, Mr. Speaker, to call 
on the member to use parliamentary terms.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, there is no need for me to recall to 
your memory that we have had a pretty rough couple of days here. 
Yes, our emotions are right here on our sleeve. I would prefer that 
words like ``bribe'' not be used. We have used words like ``scam'' 
before, possibly in the context of the last few days.
<P>
	It might be advisable if all members would lower the tone a bit 
of their rhetoric. I do not mean in their voices but I mean in their 
choice of words.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	I would appeal not only to the hon. member speaking now but to 
all hon. members to keep this in mind. We are all a little bit caught 
up in the whole thing. I do not judge the words that were used to be 
unparliamentary under normal circumstances. The hon. member 
used the word ``misrepresentation''. We have used that word and I 
find it to be in its context acceptable. I believe he was quoting 
someone else when he used the word ``bribe''. I would remind the 
hon. member that he cannot quote someone from outside the House 
and use words we are not allowed to use in the House.
<P>
	The point has been brought up and I am sure all hon. members 
will want to adhere to this request. The hon. member still has about 
two minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Saskatchewan's minister 
of finance has said the plan would need a massive shift on to the 
province's consumers. Manitoba has also said that the cost to 
consumers would be too high and they declined to sign on to this 
harmonization deal.
<P>
	It is not surprising, but there has not been one call of outrage 
from the Liberal premiers of the maritime provinces that have 
signed on to this deal. They are part of the Liberal Party, I suppose, 
and this is probably status quo, I would assume.
<P>
	However, the most amazing thing is that the people who 
contribute most to the economy of the maritimes, the retailers, the 
manufacturers, the farmers and the consumers, have all said that 
this is going to be a hurtful tax. Where is the representation from 
the maritime members of Parliament? Not one word has been heard 
from the people who were sent to Ottawa to represent the best 
interests of maritime Canada, because they are not permitted to 
utter one word in opposition to this harmonized sales tax.
<P>
	We are talking about the extra costs associated with the closures 
of five Greenberg stores in the maritimes. This is a loss of 79 jobs. 
Seventy-nine jobs in the maritimes is big stuff. Greenberg's 
management says that there is a chance that all their other stores 
may be closing in other areas of Atlantic Canada as a result of 
harmonization.
<P>
	Bill C-70 is just a symptom of a whole bigger picture and that 
bigger picture is honesty and integrity. As I said at the beginning of 
my presentation, if politicians would tell the truth the first time, 
they would never have to say they are sorry. That is something that 
every Reformer in this House knows. That is something that every 
Reform candidate who goes out in the next election knows. 
Members can bet that in contrast to the other candidates from the 
other parties, every Reform candidate in the next election will 
know that if they tell the truth first they never have to say they are 
sorry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on behalf of the 
government on these Group No. 3 motions.
<P>
	Unlike some of my colleagues, I am going to try to stick as much 
as I can to the actual motions before us and talk about what they are 
rather than talking about everything else.
<P>
	First, government Motion. No. 120 deals with clause 262. Clause 
262 of Bill C-70 adds new provisions to the Federal-Provincial 
Fiscal Arrangements Act that set out the statutory authority for the 
federal government to make payments to the participating 
provinces equal to their respective share of the provincial 
component of the HST determined in accordance with the 
harmonization agreements. This motion amends new section 8.4 
and 8.5 of that act to provide that, for government accounting 
purposes, the revenues from the HST shall be recorded net of these 
amounts payable to the participating provinces. I point that out in 
support of the government's motion.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	I will respond to some of the remarks that have been made in the 
debate on this group of motions. I oppose the opposition motions 
that are a part of this group. My first comment is with respect to 
some comments made earlier this morning by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I said this morning in English, Bloc members are opposed to 
harmonization and this is very odd. It is odd indeed, since there is 
already harmonization in Quebec. Could it be that opposition 
members want to keep the benefits of harmonization all to 
themselves, their businesses and consumers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The reality is that members of the Bloc Quebecois know the 
value and merits of harmonization. They are  not suggesting that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7792"> 7792 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec cease, unravel and turn back the clock on harmonization in 
Quebec. They are not saying that at all. However, they are saying to 
the maritimes: ``Don't harmonize, this is a terrible thing''.
<P>
	I wonder whether they want to preserve the advantages of 
harmonization for the businesses of Quebec, particularly because 
they border on other provinces, while they would deny those 
advantages of lower prices to consumers and the simplicity to 
retailers that would come from harmonization in provinces 
contiguous with Quebec. It is a little surprising to see the Bloc 
stand up hour after hour and attack harmonization.
<P>
	I will turn to members from the third party and the spectacle we 
have seen in the House. They are from one regions of the country 
and they are once again saying to another region: ``You don't want 
this. We know better. Don't do this. This would be terrible for 
you,'' while consumers are telling us overwhelmingly, ``this is 
what we want,'' and the provincial governments agree.
<P>
	We hear a great deal from members of the third party about 
respecting local governments and regional decision making. When 
regional governments have made a decision it is only okay if that 
decision agrees with the views of the members of the third party, 
but if they take a decision in the interests of Atlantic Canada, in the 
interests of business and principally consumers, that is not good 
enough for the third party.
<P>
	I really do not want to get into this debate. I want to speak 
precisely to the motions before us. It is really incredible that they 
keep speaking about retailers but I have not heard them speaking 
for the consumers. This harmonization measure will benefit 
consumers immeasurably and enormously. People in those 
provinces know that, which is why they are going down this route.
<P>
	No doubt this is a complex bill. There are adjustments in any tax 
legislation. That is why we are debating these motions, why we had 
very good and effective amendments at the finance committee and 
why we are debating a number of government motions again, to 
make the bill work better.
<P>
	I welcome this opportunity to speak to this. This is a big and 
complex country. It is possible that one region of the country might 
decide for the moment that one course of action is more in the 
interests of their people than another. It is unfortunate when 
members from one region presume to tell the people of another 
region what is good for them. They are perfectly capable of making 
up their minds, and they have done so in Newfoundland, New 
Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-70. Before addressing the subject matter 
of the bill, I would like to respond, if I may, to something that was 
said by the hon. member who spoke before me.
<P>
	He accused the Bloc Quebecois of being against harmonizing the 
GST. Either he misunderstood what we said or he got it wrong. 
Quebec was the first province to harmonize its sales tax with the 
GST, and we did it at our own expense. What we disagree with is 
the fact that, months before an election, the government is 
considering spending $1.3 billion to help eastern provinces 
harmonize their taxes, while we did it at our own expense. That is 
what we object to.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Allow me to say a few words today about Bill C-70. First of all, I 
wonder about the democratic values underlying this Liberal 
government's actions. The public is shocked by the way this 
government operates, which is hardly transparent.
<P>
	I told you yesterday how difficult it was to obtain information 
from Heritage Canada on the cost of the <I>Take it to Heart</I> program, 
an initiative to promote Canadian citizenship. The Liberal 
government is taking a hard line on more serious and complex 
issues. There are countless examples. Just think of the Somalia 
inquiry, the Krever Commission, the Airbus affair, the Pearson 
Airport deal. The Liberals are camouflaging the facts and hindering 
the proper functioning of our democratic institutions.
<P>
	If we had to find a three-letter word that best sums up the image, 
the weakness, the incompetence of this government, the one that 
would immediately come to mind is ``GST'', because it represents 
unkept promises, mismanagement, improvisation, arrogance, lack 
of accountability, deceit.
<P>
	That same undemocratic attitude motivates the government in 
connection with the GST. They are rushing this bill through, 
systematically concealing the facts from Quebecers and Canadians, 
so as to clear the way for the next election campaign.
<P>
	What they will not be able to conceal, however, is the 
embarrassment of the Prime Minister and the Heritage Minister 
over their failure to keep their promise to scrap the GST, to kill it. It 
is clear that the Prime Minister does not want to have to apologize 
again, as he had to after his appearance on the CBC on December 
12, when Johanne Savoie, a Montreal waitress, backed him into a 
corner by asking him about his campaign promise on the abolition, 
pure and simple, of the unpopular goods and services tax. Let us 
recall the <I>Globe and Mail </I>editorial headed ``The Prime Minister is 
lying'', where it states, and I quote: ``The Prime Minister told a lie. 
Not a fib, not a prevarication, not a disingenuous remark-''
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Dear colleague, we cannot use the words of 
someone else when these words cannot be used here in the House. I 
would, therefore, ask you to withdraw the word ``lying'' because it 
is neither parliamentary nor acceptable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7793"> 7793 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin: </B>Mr. Speaker, I withdraw these words because I was 
quoting a text, not making an accusation.
<P>
	That is what Quebecers and Canadians will remember-in any 
case, they heard it on television and they read about it in the 
media-when they mark their ballots in the next general election.
<P>
	I deplore the attitude of a government that tries to prevent us 
from doing our job as parliamentarians. As a member of the official 
opposition, I may remind this House that we had less than 24 hours 
to examine a very technical bill more than 300 pages long, before 
proceeding with second reading.
<P>
	This week, the opposition had not yet received the printed 
version of Bill C-70 as amended in committee, and this was 24 
hours before resuming debate on third reading. How can we 
possibly do our job as parliamentarians under those conditions? 
Either the Liberal government is terribly inefficient or it is 
deliberately engaging in obstruction. Hon. members may draw 
their own conclusions.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	This has been said before but it bears repeating: the Liberals do 
not keep their promises and have a very selective memory.
<P>
	Not so long ago when they were in opposition, in November 
1989, the Liberal members of the Standing Committee on Finance 
maintained that the goods and services tax proposed by the 
Conservative government was not a good proposal and that no 
amount of tinkering would make it fair to the taxpayer.
<P>
	But what are that same party's representatives proposing today, 
if not tinkering? It makes no sense. Hiding the tax in the price does 
not change anything. The GST stays the same, at the same rate, and 
the provincial tax will harmonize accordingly. This tax will be just 
as bad and just as unfair to the taxpayer.
<P>
	By hiding the GST in the sales price, the government is opening 
the door wide to a possible increase in the GST in the days to come. 
And do not tell us that consumers want this. Consumers want the 
Liberal government to keep its promises, including scrapping the 
GST.
<P>
	The official opposition believes there can be no sales tax reform 
without a tax reform that covers all forms of taxation at all levels of 
government. For more than three years, the Bloc Quebecois has 
been asking the Minister of Finance about this, but the minister and 
his government prefer to cut transfers to the provinces, and the 
Prime Minister prefers to choke the unemployed.
<P>
	There was the survey by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in 
1994, in which 70 per cent of Canadian businesses said they were 
opposed to hiding the tax. In February 1996, the same survey 
reconfirmed this point, with not 70 per cent but 76 per cent of 
Canadian  businesses opposed to harmonizing the tax. That is 
revealing.
<P>
	Another major problem is the political gift to the maritime 
provinces of some $1 billion in tax money paid by Canadians. The 
official opposition thinks all provinces should also benefit from 
agreements relating to harmonization, including compensation. 
Why should there be a double standard on the issue of 
compensation?
<P>
	As my time is up, I will conclude by saying that Quebecers will 
see once again it does not pay to work with the federal government. 
They will see that the approach of this government has not 
changed. It is plan B, and we will continue to oppose it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-70 today. We are talking about an act to 
amend the Excise Tax Act, the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act, the Income Tax Act, the Debt Servicing and 
Reduction Account Act and related acts. Among all that verbiage 
comes the GST and the blended sales tax.
<P>
	While I am doing walking tours in my constituency, whether it is 
in Leduc, Ponoka, Wetaskiwin, Lacombe, Bentley or elsewhere, I 
ask the shop owners and the people in their employ what is their 
biggest problem or what it is they would like to discuss. I tell them 
they have their MP before them. It is an opportunity for them to tell 
me what it is they like about the way the country is run or more 
likely, what it is they do not like about the way the country is run.
<P>
	The most often mentioned thing about how they do not like the 
way the country is run has to do with the GST. The GST makes 
reluctant tax collectors out of shop owners, business people, people 
who have concerns about paying their staff, about paying for their 
lights and their heating. People have concerns about keeping their 
shop open, keeping their staff on payroll and making a living for 
themselves and their families.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Not only do they become reluctant tax collectors, but if for some 
unknown reason they do not follow the collection of the tax or the 
filing of the papers to the exact degree the bureaucrats insist on, 
then they are subjected to all sorts of harassment, penalties, interest 
and audits. An army of people rain down around their necks and tell 
them that this voluntary job, this job they took on under great 
duress, is not being done properly and if they do not do it properly 
they can face all sorts of penalties and interest charges.
<P>
	More specifically we should be talking about the blended sales 
tax or the harmonized sales tax, the BST or the HST. Those 
acronyms conjure up some great possibilities, but I guess I will not 
allow myself to go in that particular direction at the moment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7794"> 7794 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the things that is particularly grating to general members 
of society in the province of Alberta is that even though we do 
not have a provincial sales tax, we are now compelled to pay a 
sort of surreptitious provincial sales tax in order to help fund this 
$1 billion fund. This $1 billion fund has been called all kinds of 
things. I know that Mr. Speaker has advised us to be very judicious 
in our choice of words, so I have chosen the term persuasion fund, 
which I hope will pass the parliamentary committee.
<P>
	Residents of Alberta are going to have to pay into this $1 billion 
persuasion fund whether they like it or not. Residents of Alberta are 
quite proud of the fact that they do not have to pay a provincial 
sales tax. Now of course it looks as though they do.
<P>
	When the GST came about, we all remember the events which 
led up to the imposition of the GST. It was first talked about as 
having to be a 9 per cent tax. I remember very well. I was on county 
council in those days and we all agreed that if we had to pay some 
kind of a consumption tax in order to ever see our way clear of this 
deficit and debt that we would wind up having to pay for, that yes 
we could see ourselves paying some kind of a tax, provided that all 
of the revenues from that tax went toward debt reduction and 
deficit reduction.
<P>
	As a matter of fact we even went so far as to say-and this was 
just brainstorming, it was nothing official or in the minutes of the 
meetings-we were talking among ourselves. We decided that if 
the government of the day were to say there would be no 
exemptions, there would be no kickbacks, there would be no partial 
exemptions-well, kickbacks perhaps, partial exemptions shall I 
say.
<P>
	I will use the municipalities in Alberta as an example. They were 
exempt for I believe it was 57 per cent of the GST. I believe that is 
the correct amount. That necessitated the employees of the county 
of Ponoka to fill out a GST form to apply for this rebate on goods 
that they bought. They paid the full 7 per cent up front and then 
they were allowed to recover I believe it was 57 per cent of that by 
remitting the form.
<P>
	We said that it was too complicated. Immediately we could see 
that it was going to require extra bureaucracy and extra help in 
order to figure out who was eligible and who was going to get the 
rebate and who was going to pay the full shot and so on.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	We said that if it was something that was going to go straight 
toward the debt to reduce the debt and improve our lot in the days 
and years to come, then we could probably live with it if it was 
around 3 per cent and was applied to everything: toothpaste, 
diapers, bread. We said that we could handle that because we could 
see ourselves working toward a goal.
<P>
	I believe the thinking of the government of the day was that if it 
started off at 9 per cent and wound up with 7 per cent, then the 
people of Canada would say: ``Whew, at least it is not 9 per cent'', 
and perhaps they would accept it.
<P>
	The people of the constituency of Wetaskiwin told their sitting 
member, who was a government member at the time: ``We will not 
support you. We do not want the GST. If you vote in favour of the 
GST we will not support you''. The member said he heard what 
they were saying but the government of the day voted in the GST.
<P>
	During that time the Liberals sat in opposition. There was a great 
hue and cry against the inequities and the unfairness of the GST. 
We could see during the election campaign how the Liberals 
promised to scrap, kill, abolish and otherwise do away with the 
GST.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> And replace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> The member opposite says ``replace''. Yes of 
course it was written as replace in the red book, a very limited 
production paper that was only available to certain people in 
Canada. At the town hall meeting the Prime Minister admonished 
the lady who asked him about his GST promise. He said: 
``Obviously you did not read the red book''. She probably did not 
but I would suggest she is in good company. There are millions of 
other Canadians who never had an opportunity to read the infamous 
red book because as you know, Mr. Speaker, it was not made 
available to everybody in Canada.
<P>
	The bottom line is that the GST was something about which the 
opposition parties said: ``No, we will not accept that. This is a 
matter of fact if we are in power''. It is almost as though they 
thought there was not a ghost of a chance of their getting into 
power so they could promise the moon. As it turned out they did get 
into power. People put their trust in them that they would live up to 
their word and do away with the GST but they did not do that.
<P>
	This is a little bit like the NAFTA agreement. In opposition the 
Liberals said over and over how unfair the agreement was, how 
they would abolish it, do away with it, scrap it and get rid of it. 
History has shown and will show that it was hardly amended and 
was accepted almost holus-bolus by the Liberal government once it 
came into power.
<P>
	For the many merchants in my constituency who put up with this 
GST nightmare daily, and I hasten to say that of the problems that 
come to my constituency office, the GST and problems with the 
GST are number one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate of Bill C-70, particularly the 
Group No. 3 report stage motions. The parliamentary secretary has 
nicely laid out the rationale for those particular motions. As a result 
of where we have gone with this debate I would like to recap a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7795"> 7795 </A></B>
<P>
couple of the things we are talking about with regard to the 
so-called harmonized sales tax.
<P>
	Members will know that before the goods and services tax, there 
was a federal sales tax which was included in the pricing of 
manufactured goods. It generated some $18 billion in revenue for 
the government in its last year of operation.
<P>
	The Mulroney government made some changes and introduced 
the goods and services tax. Interestingly enough, in the first year of 
operation the goods and services tax generated for the government 
some $16 billion in revenue, which was actually $2 billion less.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In essence, what happened is that Canadians got a $2 billion tax 
break right off the bat because of the introduction of the GST, but 
they were angry about it. They were angry about the GST. It really 
is ironic that Canadians were given a $2 billion tax break about 
which they were angry.
<P>
	Canadians were justified in a sense because it was a change. It 
was visible. Not only that, it was visible on each and every 
purchase that Canadians made.
<P>
	When I went to the shelf I saw an item and the price was there. I 
made a purchase decision and I went to the cash register, but at the 
cash register the price I had to pay was different. It was more. It 
was significantly more. That, I believe, is the reason Canadians do 
not like the goods and services tax. It was a change. It was visible 
to them at the cash register but not when they made their purchase 
decision. There is a bit of irony in that.
<P>
	Then came the election. Before the election the Liberal Party 
was in opposition. The role of the opposition is to be the opposition 
and to deliver blows that would tenderize a turtle, as someone once 
said. Liberals in opposition said ``we do not like this tax because 
Canadians said they did not like the tax''. They did not like the 
optics of it. However, after a number of years there was not much to 
be done about it. All of a sudden it was generating $18 billion in 
revenue to the government.
<P>
	The question becomes is there anybody who supports a policy, as 
the Reform Party has been outlining, that would simply eliminate 
the tax. Is there someone who would say let us have no more GST 
ever again, it is over, gone and done? That is what the Reform Party 
has been suggesting that the government promised in the last 
election campaign. Just get rid of it. Add the $18 billion to the 
deficit.
<P>
	Nobody in this place would want to do that if they were the 
government of the day. We cannot afford to add $18 billion to the 
deficit. That is clear to all Canadians. All Canadians know that it 
was not just to get rid of the GST, it was to replace it with a revenue 
neutral system. That means that we will have to collect the same 
dollars,  but we will look to see if there is a better way to do it. In 
fact, the red book said, as well as many of us in our speeches and 
literature, we will, through the finance committee, with all parties, 
have an opportunity to look and see what is the best way to deal 
with this.
<P>
	As it turns out, the best replacement for the GST is the GST. That 
is what it really comes down to. It is unfortunate in a political 
sense, but in a fiscally responsible sense we have to do the right 
thing.
<P>
	The finance committee studied the issue. During its 35 days of 
hearings I was there. I heard what business and industry were 
saying to the finance committee. They did not want two systems of 
consumption tax at both the federal and provincial levels. They did 
not want to have two sets of forms. They did not want to have two 
different bases. If the tax was going to be kept in its general form as 
a consumption tax, what they wanted was to have the federal and 
provincial taxes harmonized. They wanted to have it applied to the 
same base. They wanted one return. That would be more efficient 
and more cost effective for business.
<P>
	In fact, if we bring the provincial component into the GST 
system, that means that provincial taxes will be eligible for an 
input tax credit the same as the GST. Members will know that 
provincial taxes which are charged on top of each other through the 
process of production, et cetera, account for about 30 per cent of 
provincial revenues. That means that Canadians have been paying 
tax on tax. In fact, harmonizing the taxes will save businesses 30 
per cent of the provincial taxes which they would otherwise have to 
pay. That money will be available for businesses to pass on to 
consumers through lower pricing. That is extremely important.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The proof is in Quebec. Quebec has had the best of all worlds. It 
did not wait for the federal government to harmonize and to come 
forward with this bill. It made its own deal and harmonized itself.
<P>
	There is a harmonized tax system in Quebec and it is taking 
advantage of a lower tax base, of lower pricing so that its exports 
have out performed other competitors in Canada.
<P>
	Its exports have performed much better. Even though Canadian 
exports are at record levels, Quebec exports have been much better. 
Quebec is a model to follow. It has proved it. The consumers have 
accepted it and the system has worked. That is what we really have 
to look at.
<P>
	One final point I would like to make has to do with the 
underground economy. Everyone knows that whenever a tax is 
introduced into a purchase scheme, there will be people who say 
``Gee, 7 per cent GST. If I don't do this, if I do this economic 
activity under the table, I can reduce my price to the consumers by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7796"> 7796 </A></B>
<P>
7 per cent. I won't  remit it to the government''. We have 
underground economic activity.
<P>
	Ontario, for example, where the tax is 8 per cent, has 15 per cent 
combined cost. Businesses looking at this will not forego the 
opportunity to recover 15 cents on the dollar by doing its business 
under the table. In fact, by streamlining the system, by 
harmonizing those taxes, there will be a major disincentive to 
operate underground. These are other benefits that will come.
<P>
	I would simply like to raise that we have, with the three 
provinces in the maritimes which have combined rates of some 17, 
18, and 19 per cent, will have real rate reductions, will have price 
reductions and will have a more efficient tax mechanism to operate 
with, which will be in the best interests of consumers in the 
maritimes.
<P>
	I am sure when the other provinces come on side with the HST 
that Canadians will all benefit from the initiatives that this 
government has brought forth in Bill C-70.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words on Bill 
C-70, the Group No. 3 debate.
<P>
	Earlier today I had the opportunity to speak on motions in Group 
No. 2. As members will recall, I had spoken a lot about the political 
side of imposing the GST and now the harmonized sales tax in the 
Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	I mentioned at the time that the public has had an opportunity to 
speak at the polls in Atlantic Canada on two occasions and the 
public has had the opportunity to speak to the government through 
the standing committee and through members of Parliament.
<P>
	As was indicated by other speakers today, the public in Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland in particular, because 
the committee did not travel to Atlantic Canada, did not have a 
direct opportunity to address the bill as it appears today.
<P>
	I was impressed with the results of the two election polls that 
were taken with regard to this. To reiterate quickly my remark from 
this morning, in Prince Edward Island where the government had 
chosen not to harmonize but where the threat to harmonize 
remains, the public spoke loud and clear, defeated the Liberal 
government and elected a Conservative government in an election 
in which the harmonization was an issue on the doorstep.
<P>
	In Nova Scotia in a riding known as Halifax Fairview where the 
people had a chance to put the harmonization effort to the supreme 
test, at the polls, not only did the government lose that but it lost it 
very soundly. New Democrats won that seat by 65 per cent of the 
vote.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	As other members in the Chamber have indicated, Liberal 
members from Atlantic Canada have not been  very vocal in this 
debate in the House on the harmonization matter. I think it is very 
clear that had New Democrats been sent to Ottawa from the 
Atlantic provinces the voices of those people would be heard in this 
Chamber. Never has there been a better example of how New 
Democrat representation is representation of the people. There is 
no question that the people of Halifax Fairview are being heard 
through the New Democrats in this House today because of the 
representation we are able to make.
<P>
	On the matter presented here in the bill and through these 
amendments I have a number of additional remarks to make, 
including ones relating to some of the matters that were raised by 
the Liberal speaking prior to me. I think he is going to hear himself 
quoted back to him on many occasions. I was astounded to hear 
him say the best replacement for the GST is the GST itself.
<P>
	Certainly the Prime Minister and other members of the Liberal 
Party have not used that kind of a representation of what it is that 
they are doing with harmonization, but certainly the GST and the 
HST in the public view are not the kind of promises that it thought 
it was getting in the last election when it chose the Liberals over the 
Conservatives at the national level. The public wanted to get rid of 
the GST, not to get it back renamed.
<P>
	The member also talked about the benefit to business that the 
harmonization effort brings. There is no question about it. If we 
want to look at it from the banks' and the multinationals' point of 
view, the HST is a windfall for them. In fact, we have calculated 
that if the HST were applied across Canada, it would be a $6 billion 
windfall for business in this country, a transfer of money from the 
consumer to the corporations. That means absolutely nothing to 
this government, it seems, that the transfer is just a natural state of 
affairs.
<P>
	We in the New Democratic Party reject that notion very strongly 
and we reject the harmonized sales tax because it threatens to 
transfer more funds from the already overtaxed consumer to the 
much undertaxed multinational corporate sector.
<P>
	I think that instead of harmonization, which is the key word in 
the debate today, we should be talking about national standards and 
we should be talking about national standards not just in taxation 
matters, fair taxation right across the board for all Canadians, but 
also national standards in all the matters that fall under federal 
jurisdiction and within federal responsibilities.
<P>
	During question period today I raised the issue of grain cars not 
moving from the prairies to the ports because the railroads have 
failed to live up to their commitments under the grain car allocation 
policy. The federal minister of agriculture refuses to accept his 
responsibility, even his authority in this regard.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7797"> 7797 </A></B>
<P>
	It is time the federal government accepted its full responsibility 
on matters within its jurisdiction and started to move and set 
national standards.
<P>
	In this regard, fair taxation or grain movement, we have to find 
ways to ensure that not only in the design and funding of programs 
but in maintaining and enhancing our standards of living right 
across Canada we have to develop and follow these national 
standards within the federal authority.
<P>
	What about in the environment? It is something I have been very 
active in and I have done a lot of work here in the House of 
Commons and outside the House of Commons and is something 
Mr. Speaker is very interested in I know. Environment is an area 
where we are devolving power to the provinces and neglecting a 
strong national standard across the country, in transportation and 
the grain car situation I mentioned earlier and also a national 
railway policy, a national highway policy, a national airline policy, 
which gets us away from the deregulation and devolution powers 
that have made our country now a patchwork of poor transportation 
systems. We need national standards across the country which will 
serve to help eliminate poverty in all provinces of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I could speak about literacy and education, training and tuition 
fees. Just yesterday the province of Ontario announced another 
increase in tuition fees. They increased 20 per cent last year and 
will increase 10 per cent this year. These are massive increases for 
young people who want to pursue post-secondary education in the 
province of Ontario.
<P>
	British Columbia, which recognizes the value of education to 
young people, froze tuition fees two years ago to ensure that every 
student that passes grade 12 or meets other eligibility requirements 
to attend post-secondary education has an opportunity to achieve 
that higher education.
<P>
	Affordability is very important in education. We need national 
standards in that regard.
<P>
	We need national standards for health care, as opposed to 
harmonized standards across the country. The national health 
forum this week talked about a national prescription drug program. 
It is very important not to devolve that or harmonize it with the 
provinces. We must have national standards.
<P>
	We need national standards for child care. We need youth dental 
programs. We need home care programs. These all require a very 
strong national presence to ensure that the services are delivered 
effectively. We must ensure that all Canadians, whether in 
Newfoundland, Quebec, Saskatchewan or British Columbia, have 
equal access to the same care, programs and services.
<P>
	There is a lot which should be said about these types of things. I 
am sorry there is not enough time to deal with them. I hope I will 
have an opportunity to continue my remarks when the next group 
of motions comes up for debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is almost imperative that every member rise in this 
House to speak on this bill because, of all the bills and issues 
examined during the 35th Parliament, the GST will no doubt have 
been the most momentous.
<P>
	This government got elected under false pretences and it is a 
shame that no court exists where ordinary citizens could sue the 
government for broken promises, failing to keep its word or getting 
elected under false pretences.
<P>
	Any which way you read the red book and understand the words 
written in this magnificent book, one fact cannot be misinterpreted: 
in the minds of almost every citizen of this country, it was quite 
clear that this government, which ran under the Liberal banner, was 
going to rid us of the GST. There was absolutely no doubt about 
that. Witness how baffled everyone was to hear the Prime Minister 
say that everyone but him was mistaken and that he had never made 
such a promise.
<P>
	Earlier, I heard our colleague from Mississauga South say 
nobody in this place could consider getting rid of the GST because 
it generates $18 billion in revenues for the government. I think that, 
when it was in opposition, there were people with enough sense in 
the Liberal Party to realize that, once in power, they could not do 
without $18 billion in revenues.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	So, and this would appear to be a conscious process, given what 
we heard during the election campaign and what was written in the 
red book, once the Liberal Party took office, it did say: ``We will do 
as always. We fooled Canadians. They were dumb enough to vote 
for us. Too bad. We will not abolish the GST, because we cannot 
afford to lose $18 billion in revenues''.
<P>
	I think Canadians are fed up with traditional parties that promise 
the world but cannot honour their promises once they take office.
<P>
	People are beginning to understand. This is a very dense bill-I 
do not want to insult those who wrote it because they are eminent 
jurists, but I will admit to not having read it through since it is 
rather dull. One quickly gets bored, unless one is paid to read it, or 
sits on a committee that will be taking an in-depth look at it. 
Because it is dense, perhaps even in more ways than one.
<P>
	This bill was thrown together. One can tell there is an election in 
the offing, and the government does not want to be reminded, all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7798"> 7798 </A></B>
<P>
through the election campaign, from coast to coast to coast, that it 
did not fulfil its promise on  the GST. So, the government is in a 
hurry and it has hastily thrown together a bill that has 272 clauses. 
Over 100 amendments were tabled at second reading. Even on the 
last day of consultations, that very evening, 13 new amendments 
were presented.
<P>
	On February 3, even the French CBC news bulletin-but the 
Prime Minister does not listen to it, so he may not have been aware 
that his bill was so hastily thrown together-mentioned the need to 
make amendments, adding that the government might back down 
on one major issue, that of hiding the GST in the price.
<P>
	I clearly remember the statements made by members of this 
government, when they formed the official opposition and the 
Mulroney government introduced the GST. They were adamantly 
opposed to the GST being included in the sales price. The main 
argument of the Liberal opposition back then was: ``We will never 
let this tax be included in the price, because the government would 
then be able to increase it without anyone really knowing about it''.
<P>
	However, once in office, the same Liberal Party decided that the 
tax would be hidden, that it would be included in the price. Today, 
that tax stands at 7 per cent, but it could go up to 8 or 9 per cent in 
the next budget and nobody would notice. It would then be reported 
in newscasts or in the newspapers, for about 24 hours, and the 
Minister of Finance would say that his document was misread. 
Indeed, government members often tell people and journalists that 
they misunderstood a statement or that they misread a document. 
Liberal members are the only ones who can read. But the fact is 
that, after about a day, people will forget that the GST actually went 
up.
<P>
	One major difficulty with respect to this bill is the following: 
when the government was in opposition, one of the things it said 
was that the Conservative government's plan to tax goods and 
services was a bad one and that no amount of fixing would make it 
fair to taxpayers.
<P>
	Here we have their own first fix-up attempt, which has not been 
too successful because, as I was mentioning earlier, there have been 
several amendments. It will complicate people's lives 
considerably. Imagine it is the morning of April 1, the agreement 
has been signed, the tax is coming into effect, some merchants have 
done all their work and will display their prices with the tax 
included, but the merchant next door has not included his tax. He 
has not harmonized as quickly as his neighbour, so his merchandise 
will show a lower price. In the opinion of those who are looking at 
the question of how this wonderful harmonized tax will be 
implemented, there will be chaos in the maritimes for several 
months.
<P>
	The Retail Council of Canada has also condemned inclusion of 
this tax in the sales price as a policy that will drive up costs and add 
to confusion among consumers.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Several businesses have appeared before the committee and 
pointed out that-without wanting to give any of them 
publicity-companies like Canadian Tire, Sears, and many others 
with stores in every province in Canada, will have to have separate 
prices and labelling for the province of Quebec, for the maritimes 
and for the other provinces, because things are different, the 
regulations are different.
<P>
	We were even informed that, in certain cases, there could be a 
product requiring four labels. One would include the sales tax in 
the price; another would display the price without the tax; another, 
the sale price including the tax; and the last, the sale price without 
the tax. It will be a real headache for consumers.
<P>
	Our colleague, the member for Mississauga South, said that 
Quebec was an example to follow. I hope he realized that it is an 
example to follow across the board, and that, in his province, he 
will work for the sovereignty of Ontario. It is not enough to 
harmonize the tax. If we are a model to follow, then he should also 
work for the sovereignty of Ontario.
<P>
	At the time of the ``beau risque'', Quebec agreed to harmonize 
its tax. In good faith, it sat down with government representatives 
and organized the thing. This was a deal worked out between 
Robert Bourassa and Brian Mulroney. In the end, we realized that 
we had been taken to the cleaners. Two years later, the new 
government harmonized the tax along the lines of the Quebec 
model, but handed over one billion in compensation to the 
maritimes. The Premier of New Brunswick is using $400 million of 
this compensation to come to Quebec and engage in what I would 
call an almost obscene recruitment of companies to his province, to 
the detriment of the Quebec economy.
<P>
	I hope that we will one day follow Quebec's example throughout 
Canada and reorganize this country, with its unharmonious tax.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me pleasure to once again speak on Bill C-70, a bill which 
obviously is being pushed and driven by the Liberal government to 
become law, irrespective of a lot of things.
<P>
	I was looking at a list of items that have been submitted 
regarding this bill from people who have some expertise and have 
studied this matter. The Retail Council of Canada said that by 
forcing stores to bury the new tax in prices, the harmonized tax 
regime will cost retailers at least $100 million. If that is true, why 
would a government impose it on businesses that are there to 
provide jobs?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7799"> 7799 </A></B>
<P>
	Another study by the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young said that a 
mid-sized national chain with 50 stores in the  Atlantic provinces 
would pay up to $3 million in one-time costs and up to $1.1 million 
a year to comply with a regional tax in price sales system.
<P>
	A tax is being imposed on a chain of 50 stores and it will take 
millions of dollars to implement the program. The Halifax 
Chamber of Commerce predicts that the harmonized sales tax will 
push up new house prices by 5.5 per cent and as well will force 
municipalities to raise property taxes. The Canadian Real Estate 
Association says harmonization will increase the cost of a new 
house by $4,000 in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and $3,374 in 
New Brunswick.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	There is the chain Greenberg Stores. Five of them are closing 
and jobs are being lost. The GST harmonization is responsible for 
the closure of those stores. One of the Liberal government 
members said earlier that those stores were in trouble anyway, that 
it was not the GST harmonization. Part of the reason so many retail 
stores are in trouble across this land is because of the tax laws we 
have and this was probably the icing on the cake. There have been 
so many bankruptcies throughout the country, even in my riding. A 
lot of them are because of tax laws and tax problems. The GST is 
certainly one of them. The management of this chain said there was 
a 50-50 chance that further stores will be closed and that there will 
be more job losses.
<P>
	What I cannot understand is that sitting in this House are 
members of Parliament from the Liberal Party from the Atlantic 
provinces. They represent those provinces and they sit silently. 
There is no outcry from them whatsoever. Nothing is being said. I 
would like to know why. The provinces are speaking. The province 
of P.E.I. evidently is not very supportive of this idea. Nova Scotia 
and New Brunswick have spoken loud and clear.
<P>
	I look at the number of names on petitions. I am talking about 
thousands of names of individuals, consumers from these 
provinces. And the government still insists that this is really an 
acceptable way of dealing with the GST, that harmonization is 
really acceptable. I have to wonder.
<P>
	Looking further into this whole idea we see that consumers will 
pay more for certain things, like children's clothing, books, auto 
repairs, electricity, gasoline, home heating fuel, and haircuts 
among other things. Liberal Party members will get up and say that 
when averaged out over the whole spectrum, consumers will find 
that they are actually saving money. That is not so.
<P>
	Most of the items, which were GST exempt at one time, are the 
types of items used by young families who are struggling and 
trying to make ends meet, trying to keep the heat on in their homes, 
trying to pay their rent. They are the ones who all of a sudden will 
be paying this additional money on different items that never were  
taxed before. I do not see any benefit in taking more money from 
those who need it the most.
<P>
	We must ask, what in the world are we doing? Businesses are 
closing and there is a good prospect that others will be closing. 
There are thousands of signatures on petitions by people who are 
absolutely opposed to this whole thing, and I am talking about 
petitions from the Atlantic provinces. Yet the government 
continues to push because this is the way it is going to do it. Why? 
Do we not believe in listening to the people in this place?
<P>
	I only have to back up a few years. Mr. Speaker, you will well 
remember when the GST was brought in what would happen to 
those who dared to speak the voice of the people.
<P>
	When someone does speak for the people, when someone goes 
against the party, they are out. They will be kicked out. They will 
be punished. They will wish they had not done it, et cetera.
<P>
	Now we have Bill C-70 and I see the same thing happening on 
that side of the House. The finance minister, the Prime Minister 
and all the rest of the chief executive in the dictatorship that exists 
said to the members of the Liberal Party: ``This will be passed. You 
will vote yes. If you do not, you will be booted out. You will be 
punished. You will be sorry''.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	It is a shame. We live in a democracy, but a person from Prince 
Edward Island or Nova Scotia or New Brunswick cannot stand in 
his place with a petition that has been signed by thousands of 
people and say: ``I am going to represent my people in my riding in 
the Atlantic provinces and vote against this bill''. They will not do 
it and it is an absolute shame.
<P>
	However, we are carrying on. Is this thing going to be 
implemented simply to cover the backsides of members of the 
Liberal government when they reneged on killing or scrapping the 
GST which they campaigned on so vigorously in the last election? 
Is that what it is for? Is it simply to implement page 22 of the dead 
book which most of the members obviously were not aware of, not 
in the way they campaigned? It certainly was not harmonization 
they were campaigning on. It certainly was not a replacement they 
were campaigning on. It was scrapping it. That is what they were 
campaigning on and they were doing it vigorously. Looking at this 
whole bill, I suggest the real reason is it is another way to get more 
revenue to spend because spending is a favourite pastime of this 
government.
<P>
	Spending for such things as all these patronage appointments. 
Commissioner of the National Film Board. Boy, what a salary. He 
must work twice as hard as any member of Parliament because he 
makes twice as much money. Then there is the Canadian Labour 
Relations Board, other commissioners, and the Immigration and 
Refugee Board. They have to keep top dollars up there.  We have to 
really pay out on these patronage appointment positions, plus we 
have to give them a tax free allowance. Judging from what I see 
from the public accounts, with these kinds of salaries, members of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7800"> 7800 </A></B>
<P>
Parliament had better not stand in line at the bank with any of these 
fellows because we will look like we are on welfare.
<P>
	We go through this list and here is Health Canada spending a 
whole bunch of money on age and opportunity. Oh yes, here is 
another thing we are spending it on: lunchtime radio planning 
committee by Health Canada. A network of older women. Positive 
straight men, we will spend $47,000 for this. I have no idea what 
that is about. Listen to this one: seniors and sexuality, $116,000. 
Boy, am I glad I turned 60. Now that I am 60 years old I bet I can 
really benefit from that $116,000.
<P>
	It is absolutely ridiculous when we go through this entire list of 
spending. If that is what it is all about, then this government needs 
to be doubly ashamed of itself for trying to bring this kind of 
legislation forward. It ought to be ashamed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Group No. 3 of motions concerning the fiscal 
arrangements between the federal government and the maritimes, 
specifically Motions Nos. 118 to 124, which are of interest to us at 
this time.
<P>
	There can be no sales tax reform without personal income tax 
reform, corporate tax reform, social security reform, nor without 
the participation of other levels of government.
<P>
	Canada must undertake a tax reform which encompasses all 
forms of taxation and all the levels of government involved. Why, 
then, have the Liberals systematically refused, since they have 
formed the government, to carry out such a total reform of the 
Canadian taxation system, despite the numerous suggestions from 
the Bloc Quebecois which has just tabled a second document on tax 
reform, via my Bloc Quebecois colleague, the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot? That document was tabled this week and 
addresses personal income tax in particular.
<P>
	Quebec harmonized its own sales tax alone and without financial 
assistance. The costs of this reform were assumed by Quebec 
businesses.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Quebec companies have yet to benefit from all the advantages of 
a fully harmonized sales tax. It is intolerable that the federal 
compensation formula should help the Atlantic provinces to 
compete fiercely with Quebec for new investment. The Maritime 
provinces are advertising in newspapers in Quebec and the other  
provinces that are not harmonized in order to attract companies 
from those provinces.
<P>
	Furthermore, the $400 million in federal compensation paid to 
New Brunswick will be used to finance the tax cuts announced last 
December by the province's Minister of Finance.
<P>
	If the federal government is really serious about wanting to boost 
Quebec's economy, it could put its money where its mouth is by 
giving Quebecers the amounts to which they are entitled. 
According to information provided by the federal government, 
Quebec would be entitled to compensation worth not $1.9 billion 
but $2 billion. And even if we apply the more restrictive federal 
formula to the data currently available, Quebec would be entitled to 
$1 billion in compensation.
<P>
	Harmonization is costly for businesses in Quebec. At this time, 
the QST is not refunded on certain inputs of large companies, and it 
was necessary to increase corporate taxes in order to finance this 
reform. Harmonization will not cost Maritime companies a penny. 
They are entitled to a full tax refund on inputs, without any increase 
in income tax, since the federal government compensates these 
provinces through the harmonization agreement.
<P>
	This may be a political ploy to make unemployment insurance 
reform as it applies to seasonal workers in these provinces more 
palatable to the Maritimes. Otherwise, why would Ontario, Quebec 
and the other provinces not be entitled to compensation?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is against the GST harmonization plan in 
the Maritimes. This bill was rushed through. It is based only on 
political and electoral considerations. It is poorly drafted, and is 
not the model of harmonization that citizens of the Maritimes 
deserve and asked for from the federal government.
<P>
	If the federal government can come up with $1 billion for the 
maritimes, let it also find the $2 billion Quebec is entitled to. All 
the provinces must be treated fairly, and the federal government 
must stop funding New Brunswick's zealous raiding in Quebec 
with the tax money of Quebecers.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois is asking the 
government to redo its homework and this time take the time it 
needs to introduce a responsible bill and especially to listen to what 
people have to say on harmonizing the GST with provincial sales 
tax.
<P>
	We are talking about an agreement between the federal 
government and the three maritime provinces, which account for 
some 15 per cent of Canada's population. This is the model they 
say they want to apply to all provinces in Canada.
<P>
	Right now in Canada, most people oppose the minister's 
proposal and the establishment of a single 15 per cent tax, which 
would be managed by the Canada  revenue commission the 
government intends to set up and which would result in an 
increased tax burden for Ontario, Alberta and Quebec. Everyone 
agrees that the Minister 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7801"> 7801 </A></B>
<P>
of Finance is mistaken in thinking that all the provinces will agree 
to his harmonization proposal.
<P>
	Knowing the history of Quebec and of its struggle for 
independence in tax matters, especially since the 1960s with Jean 
Lesage, I know Quebec will never agree to be part of a federal plan 
of this sort.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-70, the 
harmonized sales tax for Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to speak at second reading prior to the 
Christmas break. It is a pleasure for me to speak again to the 
legislation because the real problem with the legislation is not so 
much what it is trying to accomplish, it is that it points out to 
Canadians what happens when a government does not keep a 
promise. That is the underlying message people are getting from 
this legislation.
<P>
	A number of previous speakers have noted that it is certainly 
viewed with a lot of concern by Canadians. I have enjoyed listening 
to their interventions this afternoon, particularly those of my 
colleagues from Wild Rose and Prince George-Bulkley Valley 
who made some excellent points about the legislation.
<P>
	I want to pick up the focus of the speech of the member for Wild 
Rose which was that there is an underlying issue here. Are MPs 
allowed to vote the wishes of their constituents or not? Are they 
allowed to get input from their constituents, especially on the 
government side of the House?
<P>
	He remarked that we are only too well aware of what happens 
when someone dares to counter their party line under the old party 
system in this place. MPs who dare to stand with their constituents 
on important issues are turfed out of their party and have to sit as 
independents. Of course, the member for York South-Weston and 
his riding executive, I might add, are very well aware of the 
ramifications of being a Liberal member of Parliament who would 
dare to vote with their constituents against legislation when it is so 
obviously not supported by those constituents back home.
<P>
	I would like to delve a little deeper into the whole issue of 
integrity and promises. When I had the opportunity to speak the 
last time on this legislation, I spoke about a promise made being a 
promise kept. As I travel across my riding of Prince 
George-Peace River, and I have spoken to a number of my 
colleagues who represent other ridings, they hear the same message 
I hear: Canadians have never been so cynical about politicians, 
political parties and the political system as they are today. That is  
certainly a sad reflection on this institution and the whole system of 
government.
<P>
	It is important when leaders of political parties and individual 
candidates are running that they are held accountable for the 
promises and the statements they make on the hustings trying to 
garner votes from the Canadian public. It is well known that there 
is an election on the way.
<P>
	In the few minutes available to me, I want to reflect on the now 
infamous red book, or as my hon. colleague for Wild Rose just 
called it, the dead book, and look briefly through it because it is 
quite a voluminous document. I want to pick out a few of the 
promises that were made in that document. I will quote from the 
document.
<P>
	On page 20 of the Liberal red book, their manifesto from the 
1993 election, they make the following statement.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To achieve such economic growth and job creation, a Liberal government will 
introduce a series of measures described in this plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Then they go on to name some. One thing that is noted is 
reducing grants to businesses. I wonder how that relates to the 
recent announcement of an $87 million grant to Bombardier, $50 
million in loans and grants to Pratt &amp; Whitney. I am told that the 
total amount the government has either loaned in zero interest 
loans or forgivable grants to that company is somewhere in the 
neighbourhood of $1.2 billion over the last several years. How do 
the Canadian people, the voting public, relate this to the promise 
made in the red book? I would certainly question that.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The red book states on page 22 concerning the GST:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But instead of introducing fairness and simplicity into the tax system, the 
Conservative government not only imposed the greatest tax increases in our history, 
but compounded unfairness and complexity by introducing the GST. In addition to 
the difficulties that it has caused to federal-provincial fiscal relations, the GST has 
undermined public confidence in the fairness of the tax system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The GST has lengthened and deepened the recession. It is costly for small 
business to administer and very expensive for the government to collect. The GST 
has fallen far short of its promised revenue potential, partly because it has stimulated 
the underground cash economy where no tax can be collected.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Rather than scrap, abolish, get rid of or whatever other term was 
used by a number of Liberal MPs during the 1993 election 
campaign, today we are debating the harmonization or the blending 
of the sales tax in the Atlantic region.
<P>
	On page 24 of the red book it states: ``The Canada-United States 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) are flawed. A Liberal government will 
renegotiate them''. On page 24 in the red book it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7802"> 7802 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will review the side agreements to ensure that they are in 
Canada's best interests. A Liberal government will renegotiate both the FTA and 
NAFTA to obtain:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>a subsidies code;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>an anti-dumping code;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>a more effective dispute resolution mechanism;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are promises that Reformers clearly remember debating 
the Liberal members opposite during the campaign in 1993. The 
free trade agreement was a hot topic back then.
<P>
	On all three of those points the Liberal working groups failed. 
They failed to produce a subsidies code. They could not reach a 
consensus with the United States. Canada and the U.S. were not 
able to agree on an anti-dumping code and were not able to achieve 
a more effective dispute resolution mechanism. The side 
agreements they did obtain consensus on, the labour and 
environment concerns, were not binding on either side.
<P>
	Let us look at the promise that was made in the context of what it 
accomplished. I would submit that it accomplished nothing. I 
would further suggest that in all likelihood the Liberals knew it was 
going to accomplish nothing when they made the promise. That is 
probably the most horrendous part of it all. They made the promise 
and included it in their now infamous red book.
<P>
	On page 30 it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In our federal system, education is in provincial jurisdiction. The Liberal Party 
believes that Canadians in every province should actively support the efforts of their 
provincial governments to meet the difficult challenge of equipping our children for 
the future. The federal government, however, can and should support and facilitate 
the national effort to equip Canadians to compete in the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	With regard to health care, on page 80 it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Without doubt, part of the immediate pressure on the program has arisen from the 
decision of the Conservative government to steadily withdraw from health care 
funding, thus passing costs on to the provinces. Economic conditions may change 
but the health care requirements of Canadians will continue. It is essential to provide 
financial certainty and predictability for our health care planning.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are fine words and great rhetoric. What actually took 
place? There was about a 40 per cent cut downloading on to the 
provinces. This Liberal government has slashed $7.2 billion out of 
the Canadian health and social transfer since it came to power. That 
is the reality, that is the promise and that is what was delivered.
<P>
	A chapter I particularly enjoy reading was ``Governing with 
Integrity''. On page 91 it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If government is to play a positive role in society, as it must, honesty and integrity 
in our political institutions must be restored.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	Page 92: ``Open government will be the watchword of the 
Liberal program''. Yesterday when the leader of the Reform Party 
asked the Prime Minister to explain and table the documents 
outlining the ethics guidelines which he has said he has given to his 
ministers to hold them accountable, the Prime Minister turned 
around and made some ludicrous attacks on the Reform Party. He 
did not even try to address the question.
<P>
	Have there been any open hearings on the HST in Atlantic 
Canada, which is what we are discussing today? People certainly 
wanted to be heard in Atlantic Canada. They have some grave 
concerns about this legislation.
<P>
	What has the Liberal government done? How has it backed up its 
fine rhetoric from 1993 which is found on page 92? I submit that 
the government has not done it. Canadians are watching and 
listening and they are fed up with this nonsense. They are fed up 
with a government that promises one thing in its documents and 
fails to deliver time and time again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak to the motions in Group No. 3. Naturally, I support the 
amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois to Bill C-70, an act to 
amend the Excise Tax Act and the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act.
<P>
	In my earlier speech, I have already criticized the agreement 
between the federal government and the Atlantic provinces, which 
cost Canadian and Quebec taxpayers close to $1 billion. I also 
asked a bit earlier for the government to pay Quebec $1.9 billion, 
since that province has already harmonized its tax with the federal 
tax.
<P>
	Under this bill, the GST will become the HST, the harmonized 
sales tax. But, despite its name, it is the same GST that the Liberals 
fought so hard against when they were in opposition. The Liberals, 
and in particular the current Prime Minister, promised to abolish 
the GST. They made this promise on television, with great 
enthusiasm, although recently, he tried to say that he had never 
promised to eliminate the GST. What is certain, because we saw it 
on television, is that in 1993 the Prime Minister said that he would 
indeed scrap the GST, that they would eliminate it. His colleagues, 
when they were in opposition, said the same. I have here a few 
examples.
<P>
	On November 7, 1990, on page 15245 of <I>Hansard</I>, the member 
for Windsor, now the Solicitor General of Canada, said, in response 
to a question: ``Mr. Speaker, the Liberals are speaking for 
Canadians when they say the GST has to be stopped. If the Minister 
is interested in listening to Canadians, he will listen to the Liberals 
who are saying in this House, across the country and in the Senate 
that the GST must be stopped''. He added: ``Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the Liberal senators, in accordance with policies 
announced by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7803"> 7803 </A></B>
<P>
the Liberals, voted in favour  of an amendment that would exempt 
books and periodicals from the goods and services tax. However, 
the Conservative senators rejected this amendment''. Then he 
asked his question: ``My question for the Prime Minister is this: 
why does he claim to be listening to the country when he refuses to 
withdraw his GST and has the nerve to tax books? Why does he 
want to impose his GST? Why does he want to impose ignorance 
on this country?''
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Now we know that the Liberals do not want to lift the GST 
except from certain books, not all books and periodicals, as the 
Bloc Quebecois has always requested, even when it did not 
constitute a party, and as is done in Quebec. Books and culture 
cannot be taxed.
<P>
	To continue, on March 25, 1991, on page 18931 of <I>Hansard</I>, the 
same member for Windsor, now the Solicitor General of Canada, 
asked a question, using the following words: ``Will the Deputy 
Prime Minister admit that the government was wrong in applying 
the GST on books and on the economy, and set up this task force 
today?'' What a difference between that and what the Liberals are 
saying today.
<P>
	Another well-known member at the time, now Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, said on March 25, 1991, at page 18927 in 
<I>Hansard</I>: ``Mr. Speaker, a tax on books is not going to do much for 
Canadian unity and Canadian identity''.
<P>
	On December 13, 1990, at page 16668 in <I>Hansard</I>, another 
well-known member, now Minister of Health, said: ``They are 
signed by residents from the province of Nova Scotia, namely, the 
city of Halifax and surrounding areas. These residents petition the 
Government of Canada in their opposition to the goods and 
services tax, in particular as that tax applies to books, magazines 
and newspapers. All petitioners on these three petitions call upon 
the Government of Canada to withdraw the goods and services tax 
as it is an impediment to small business as well as to Canadian 
consumers''.
<P>
	On December 4, 1990, at page 16171 in <I>Hansard</I>, another 
member, the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, now 
Minister for International Co-operation, said during tabling of 
petitions: ``Mr. Speaker, I have a petition which I would like to 
present pursuant to Standing Order 36. It is against the taxing of 
books and urges the government to abandon the GST, at least with 
regard to books, but preferably to abandon the GST altogether. 
Why stop there? Let us go all the way.''
<P>
	Another well-known member, now Minister of Public Works, the 
hon. member for Sudbury, said that she wanted the government to 
carefully reconsider its position and at least change the goods and 
services tax if it was not prepared to scrap it.
<P>
	The Liberals have always spoken out against the GST, especially 
to request that books, magazines and newspapers be exempt from 
this unfair tax. In the few minutes remaining, I would like to 
mention the concerns and disappointment of many Canadian 
citizens of various ethnocultural origins regarding changes in the 
tax treatment of Canadian pensions as they affect non-residents.
<P>
	I was approached on the subject by representatives of various 
ethnocultural communities, and especially by the Portuguese and 
Greek communities. They wrote to the minister and met with 
officials of the Department of Finance to try and deal with the 
problem, so far without success. A 25 per cent tax on pensions is 
too much for elderly people on low incomes.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	We all agree that we need a fair tax system. Major reforms are 
needed. However, compulsory and uniform taxation of the often 
very modest pensions paid to Canadians living their last years 
abroad is unacceptable. These elderly people are often subject to 
double taxation: by Canada and by their country of residence. This 
situation is becoming increasingly widespread, since a growing 
number of immigrants who are retired go back to their country of 
birth to live there.
<P>
	From a strictly economic viewpoint, the return of an elderly 
person to the country of birth is a major benefit for Canada. In fact, 
after working and contributing to Canadian and Quebec society for 
many years, sometimes for most of their lives, these immigrants 
leave Canada and no longer depend on Canada but on their country 
of origin for medical care, social services, recreation, public 
services, etc.
<P>
	On the other hand, it seems that more money comes into Canada 
in the form of pensions paid by other countries than leaves Canada 
in the form of Canadian pensions paid to non-residents. That is why 
we must deal with this problem as soon as possible. I urge the 
government to find a solution that is equitable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
we are debating Bill C-70, the harmonized sales tax bill or, as many 
have called it, the blended sales tax bill. I gather that is what the 
Liberals were going to call it, but shortened down it became the BS 
tax as opposed to the harmonized sales tax. I believe the term BS 
tax came a little close to the truth, so the Liberals decided to call it 
the harmonized tax instead. However, the BS tax is how Atlantic 
Canadians and many other Canadians are beginning to view this 
tax.
<P>
	I would like to examine where this tax came from. It came from 
the GST. The government lacked the ability to deal with and deliver 
on its GST promise. The GST is the most hated tax the country has 
ever seen.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7804"> 7804 </A></B>
<P>
	The Mulroney government pushed through the GST. We can 
recall the days when the Conservatives dragged forward an 
obscure part of the Constitution in order to stack the Senate to 
get the GST through. What about all the Liberal senators? What 
did the Liberal senators do at that time? They screamed that the 
bill proposing the GST was horrible and had to be axed.
<P>
	It will be most interesting to see what those same Liberal 
senators do when the HST goes to the Senate. It is a very similar tax 
in that it is hated. I hope the Liberal senators will examine the HST 
and deal with the terrible parts of the bill, parts which Atlantic 
Canadians are saying will not fly.
<P>
	What happened to the Mulroney government over the GST? It 
went from being a majority government to a party which can hold a 
caucus in the front seat of an imported pick-up truck. That is what 
happens to a government which does not listen to the people.
<P>
	The Liberals promised to kill, abolish, eliminate the GST, not 
blend it. They promised to get rid of it. The Prime Minister said it 
on television, as well as the Deputy Prime Minister and the finance 
minister. They are all on tape and on film saying that is what they 
would do. Where are we today? We are dealing with the HST, the 
BS tax, and trying to fulfil a Liberal promise and what is it going to 
do?
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	It establishes a 15 per cent tax in the Atlantic provinces. To some 
of the Atlantic provinces this is just fine because they take the 7 per 
cent general sales tax and the federal tax and add that to the 
provincial tax. In most cases in the Atlantic provinces it is over 15 
per cent, so this is a deal. This is a deal because Atlantic Canadians 
can now say this is a lower tax than they would be paying 
originally. In some cases it was 17 or 18 per cent, so they dropped it 
to 15 per cent. This is just fine. The administration of it is a 
horrendous nightmare, but from a political point of view this was 
just fine and the Atlantic premiers bought into it.
<P>
	However, there is a loss in revenue. Where is this revenue going 
to come from? Naturally it comes from the rest of Canada. Alberta 
will not buy into it. B.C. will not buy into it. Ontario will not buy 
into it. They have categorically said there was no way that these 
provinces were going to buy into a blended sales tax. If we look at 
Alberta, that is the classic example. It does not have a provincial 
sales tax but it has the 7 per cent GST. Why in the world would it 
possibly settle for a 15 per cent tax? It would be ludicrous. B.C. is 
the same and Ontario is the same, only to a lesser degree. It is 
absolutely a no sell for the rest of the country.
<P>
	The Ontario finance minister has said ``just blending in Ontario 
would cost the province of Ontario $3 billion''. That is the type of 
lunacy that we are talking about in this bill to try to sell it to the rest 
of the country.
<P>
	What does this do? It is a transfer of wealth. It is a transfer of 
money from the rest of Canada into Atlantic Canada. If this were 
for a good reason nobody would complain. However, the ludicrous 
reason we have here is it is a political sell-off to Atlantic Canada. It 
is the way the Liberals are trying to say this is the way they will 
solve the problem. Again, here they go manipulating Canadians.
<P>
	Besides transferring this wealth around, the administration is a 
nightmare. All the businesses and consumers are up in arms saying 
good lord, this will not work. Where are the Liberals? We have 
about 28 Liberals from the Atlantic provinces but they would not 
even allow open hearings with Atlantic Canadians. They are saying 
``you cannot do that, why would we want to have people in front of 
us telling us what might be wrong with this bill?''
<P>
	This is the type of legislation that the Liberals are forcing 
through that is simply not going to fly.
<P>
	However, there is a bigger picture. This bill deals with what this 
government has or has not dealt with and where it is not going. The 
bigger issue is integrity. Where is the integrity of a Prime Minister 
who, on national television, said one thing about a tax and then said 
``I didn't say that'', when in fact he lied to Canadians? He is just 
saying that the integrity of the whole government is okay. It is not 
okay. What about trust? Canadians want to trust their politicians. 
They want to be able to trust their politicians. This is just another 
example of Liberal lunacy.
<P>
	What about truth? What about representing constituents? What 
about those Liberals MPs who are out on the east coast? They do 
not represent their constituents. We are going into an election that 
is going to be very much about the integrity of politicians 
representing their constituents. When they go to their federal 
ridings representing the issues and the people who sent them there, 
obviously the members from Atlantic Canada who are in this place 
are not representing their people. What is more, they refuse to 
listen to those constituents to tell them what is wrong with this bill.
<P>
	In summary, I would say that this bill will not fly. There are huge 
holes in it. It is a transfer of wealth. It is about the integrity or lack 
of integrity of this government and the leaders of this government. 
I believe that the very short part of the deal is that Canadians are 
going to go to polls and say that this is not what they want in the 
form of a government. They want integrity, truth and 
representation. That is what we are going to see when we go to the 
polls shortly.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my first reaction when I read the bill on the GST was to 
say: ``What a fine gift the government has made to the Quebec 
sovereignists''.
<P>
	Here we have a demonstration, in a new instance, of how the 
federal system unfairly treats one or another part of Canada, 
especially Quebec, which is of concern to me, at a given point in 
time.
<P>
	Let us think about it: the federal government signed an 
agreement with the maritime provinces giving them $2 billion in 
compensation, that is, it will pay the maritime provinces $2 billion 
in compensation. So, we can say that some $500 million comes 
from Quebec taxes-that is, about one quarter of the taxes from 
one quarter of Canada's population.
<P>
	This is $500 million that Quebecers will give to the governments 
in the maritimes through the federal government. In the end, this 
will mean that New Brunswick, for example, will receive 
compensation of $400 million, and the provincial government will 
be able to boast: ``Taxes have been lowered here. Move here. We 
are the best spot in Canada''.
<P>
	Obviously, they are not going to boast that part of the reduction 
in taxes comes from compensation for the harmonization of the 
GST. Some of the money even comes from Quebecers. This is why 
I say it is a great argument for the sovereignists. As former Quebec 
premier Mr. Duplessis said: ``Donnez-nous notre butin''. There 
was also ``Maîtres chez nous'', because you can be sure that, if we 
had control over all of Quebec's taxes, no other province would get 
a gift of this sort. In today's world and with today's competition, 
this sort of situation is completely unacceptable.
<P>
	To add insult to injury, Quebec's sales tax has been harmonized 
with the federal tax for several years now. Quebec was the first 
province in Canada to harmonize in good faith. It even repatriated 
federal officials. It got no financial compensation for doing so. It 
simply considered it a worthwhile administrative move that would 
produce interesting results and reduce paperwork and bureaucracy.
<P>
	So there was no compensation. Why does the federal 
government now think it would be worth paying up to $2 billion in 
compensation? That is the political price it must pay for its promise 
on the GST. It is trying to hide  as best it can the fact that it has 
failed to keep its promise.
<P>
	In fact, this seems to be the norm with this government. 
Whenever they make a blunder, they fork out compensation. The 
fact that the money comes out of taxpayers' pockets does not seem 
to matter too much. It was the same thing in the Mulroney affair. 
They forked out millions of dollars to cover the mistake made by 
officials at the justice department. Same thing with the GST. A 
promise is a promise. Election promises must be kept at all cost. 
They just spend as much as they need to disguise the facts and 
avoid embarrassment.
<P>
	But the voters will not be fooled. What is more, it is becoming 
obvious that there may be justice after all. The confusion created 
by the new legislation may well backfire on the government, and it 
will have to shoulder the responsibility for it.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	At a time when disparities are to be eliminated and national 
standards imposed across the country, there will now be a place in 
Canada where the tax will be incorporated in the sales price, while 
that will not be the case in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Companies that do business nationwide will find themselves in a 
very complicated situation, having to live with two different 
systems for registering the tax. This is absurd.
<P>
	This is not a bill we as parliamentarians should be proud of. We 
still have the chance to make it right. I do hope the federal 
government will find a way to deal with the inequities and other 
problems caused by their legislation. This bill is quite thick. The 
government is trying to ram it though. The goal is to make sure 
that, during the election campaign, the government can claim to 
have reached its stated objective regarding the sales tax. The GST 
did not disappear, but another solution was found: it was 
harmonized. But at what cost? Who cares?
<P>
	Two billion dollars in compensation: Was this the price to keep 
Liberals from Atlantic Canada from speaking out on the 
employment insurance reform? I do not know. It maybe that the 
enormous amount of money involved has something to do with 
this. Maybe it was thought that this amount would make up for the 
shortfalls suffered by the seasonal economies of these provinces, 
following the implementation of the employment insurance 
reform.
<P>
	There is nothing wrong with helping regional economies make 
adjustments. The problem is that the government chose specific 
regions but ignored other ones, such as Quebec, and particularly its 
eastern part, which I represent and which is in direct competition 
with the maritimes.
<P>
	There are businesspeople in my region who wonder whether 
there is a balance, a fairness in how businesses are treated by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7806"> 7806 </A></B>
<P>
two provincial governments. These  people wonder if they are 
treated properly, if their business benefits from a favourable bias. 
When they assess the situation, they might think that the tax 
reductions in New Brunswick, as well as certain dynamic factors 
and the lack of environmental constraints make that province very 
appealing from a business standpoint.
<P>
	Why is that? One explanation is the $2 billion that will be given 
to the maritimes to compensate them for harmonizing their tax. 
New Brunswick will receive $400 million. Therefore, for a region 
like Madawaska, on the border of the area I represent, the 
economic fallout from this compensation will give a competitive 
edge that is unacceptable, even a bit upsetting for Quebecers. This 
is money from the federal government, so one quarter of it is 
coming out of our own pockets to help our neighbours compete 
against us. This raises some serious questions.
<P>
	In a region like Témiscouata, people wondered whether to vote 
yes or no in the fall of 1995. It is not hard to understand that they 
are now leaning toward yes. In a situation like the present one, we 
realize that, once again, we are being penalized by federal 
management and that this will have a direct and serious economic 
impact.
<P>
	How could the present government correct this situation? It 
should go ahead and agree to sit down with Quebec and negotiate 
the compensation that Quebec should receive for the trouble-free 
harmonization in that province. Harmonization was implemented a 
few years ago. It is working very well. The civil servants have all 
been absorbed into one government, the Quebec government. The 
results are interesting. The experience was probably even used by 
the federal government to persuade the maritimes of the feasibility 
of harmonization.
<P>
	There is a price to pay, and if this government has a sense of 
fairness, if it hopes to show Quebecers that they are part of the 
Canadian federation, this is an example of something concrete they 
can do.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	It is rather frustrating to have to keep defending ourselves, as if 
we were being forced to beg. Similarly, we had to keep on asking 
questions in the House for a month or two, to ensure that the federal 
government would pay its share of the bill for the Charlottetown 
referendum. In the end, we won our point. The Bloc Quebecois is a 
very tenacious party. We are able to sustain our points of view for a 
long time, and to support them with solid arguments, but in so 
doing it becomes obvious that the federal system will never offer 
Quebec a way to succeed in achieving equality. The solution lies in 
being fully responsible for our own decisions so we do not find 
ourselves in a situation where a majority, to which we do not 
belong, decides to take our money and to give it to another part of 
Canada, by creating undue competition.
<P>
	This is a very clear example, a very obvious example, of 
something that is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	Why has this bill been rushed through, without all of the proper 
consultations? Undoubtedly because the bill contains many 
problems, but mainly because it is inequitable. I hope that the 
government will listen to our arguments, because I am certain that 
all Quebecers will be attuned to them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I have consulted 
with the other parties and I think if you seek it you will find that 
there is unanimous consent to have private members' motion 
M-259 in the name of the member for Calgary Southwest 
withdrawn from the order of precedence.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member has indicated there is 
unanimous consent to have the private members' bill in the name 
of the member for Calgary Southwest withdrawn. Is there 
unanimous consent to do that?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No. In light of the denial of unanimous 
consent I will go to the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is almost a necessity for a member of Parliament to 
wade into this GST harmonization debate. This is an issue that 
brought many people in the House to the political process in the 
first place.
<P>
	It seems particularly ironic that the government that ran on a 
pledge to abolish the GST finds itself in a position of trying to 
squirm out from between a rock and a hard place, finding itself 
inexorably smashed by the fact it had made a commitment all over 
the country, in every single constituency saying: ``Elect us and we 
will get rid of the GST''. The Liberal lexicon of getting rid of the 
GST is to try to disguise it by harmonizing it.
<P>
	Because the package would not sell across the country, it was 
necessary for the government to then try and involve as many 
provinces as possible in a nefarious scheme to slide out from under 
its responsibility for a campaign promise clearly made across the 
country.
<P>
	The only provinces that the federal government was able to 
induce to going along with its nefarious scheme were the maritime 
provinces, all of whom in one degree or another have consistently 
been recipients of largesse from the federal treasury for many 
years.
<P>
	In fairness, I would expect that many of the premiers thought 
this would not be a bad deal. It is not a bad deal for the four Atlantic 
premiers who signed on to this nefarious scheme because the rest 
of the country was going to have to finance it, top it up a little bit to 
the tune of almost a billion dollars. That billion dollars comes from 
the other provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7807"> 7807 </A></B>
<P>
	Because the government is in a majority position it has the 
power and the authority, although it does not have the moral 
authority, to do pretty much as it sees fit, provided it can get the 
provinces to go along.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	As members know, I represent a riding in Alberta. In Alberta we 
do not have a provincial sales tax, so harmonization to Alberta 
would be a particularly bitter pill to swallow. It is interesting that as 
of March 1996 provincial retail sales taxes varied across the 
country. The federal government wanted to somehow harmonize 
everything across the country so that everybody would have the 
same sales tax, thereby removing the competitive advantage of a 
lower tax or no tax at all from any part of the country that was able 
to do so.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that as we go from east to west in 1996 
Newfoundland had the highest retail sales tax at 12 per cent, Prince 
Edward Island at 10 per cent, Nova Scotia at 11 per cent and New 
Brunswick at 11 per cent. So a harmonized tax at 15 per cent is 
really a significant reduction on their tax rates but it represents a 
significant tax increase based on the fact that it will be applied over 
a much broader range of products.
<P>
	As we continue from east to west we find that the tax rates come 
down significantly. In March 1996 Quebec was at 6.5 per cent, 
Ontario was at 8 per cent, Manitoba was a 7 per cent, Saskatchewan 
was at 9 per cent, Alberta was at zero per cent and British Columbia 
was at 7 per cent. That means some of the provinces raised more 
money, perhaps through gasoline taxes or other excise taxes or had 
a higher rate of surcharge on personal income taxes.
<P>
	However, the province and the people of Alberta have made the 
conscious decision that we do not want higher retail taxes. When 
the idea of applying a harmonized tax to Alberta was floated 
recently, the University of Alberta in the Western Centre for 
Economic Research led by senior research analyst Karen S. Davis 
put together a study on what would happen in Alberta if a 
harmonized sales tax were applied in Alberta. The study has 
revealed some interesting statistics and conclusions, some of which 
I will read into the record. In fairness to Karen Davis and her 
research I am reading very selectively into the record from this 
report.
<P>
	She makes the case, as was made early on, that if given the 
choice between having two very different taxes at different rates 
that cover different bases, that is they apply to different products 
differently or some not at all, obviously for the ease of everyone 
concerned it would make sense not to have these differences. Then 
the decision would be on what products should the tax be applied 
to, should the tax be applied broadly or narrowly, and should the 
tax be high or low. It makes sense that the broader the application, 
the lower the rate; the more narrow and focused the application, the 
higher the rate would be. It is plain common sense.
<P>
	But even in a situation like Alberta's where we have a zero rate 
of provincial tax and with the commitment from the federal 
government that any taxes raised by this harmonized tax in Alberta 
would come into the federal treasury and then be refunded to 
Alberta, even with that undertaking, if it could be believed, try to 
find 10 people who would say with any degree of confidence they 
will give the government the opportunity to get its hands on <I>x</I> 
amount of money and expect to get it all back. I have a bridge to 
sell you in Brooklyn.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to give credit to the research done by the University 
of Alberta. I would like to read into the record the financial impact 
a harmonized tax of 12 per cent would have in Alberta. It reads: 
``We conclude that harmonization at a 12 per cent rate across 
Canada will cause real gross domestic product in Alberta to fall by 
up to one-half of a per cent in the short term, and as many as 10,000 
jobs would be lost. The impact on GDP is lessened if wages also 
fall to mitigate the effects on employment. Real wages can be 
expected to decline by 1 per cent to 2 per cent depending upon their 
flexibility''.
<P>
	The authors of the report have clearly stated that there are two 
effects, the short term effect and the long term effect. Their 
conclusion is also that in the long term it is possible, but not 
necessarily probable, that the negative effects could be mitigated 
over the long term. However, in the short term it is most likely 
there would be serious economic damage done to Alberta.
<P>
	The authors also point out that there are two aspects to 
harmonization. This is something that is often overlooked. During 
the debate in the House today it was mentioned very rarely, if at all. 
There are two aspects to harmonization, that of the tax base and 
that of the tax rate. A key issue is the need to weigh the incremental 
benefits to Canada of a harmonized rate against the adverse short 
term adjustments imposed on Alberta by a sudden increase in sales 
taxation. Based on the premise that if we are in the boat together, 
the better the boat is doing, we are going to do better incrementally. 
Unfortunately these are theories, they are not proven in fact. The 
one thing that we do know is that the short term damage would be 
significant.
<P>
	From the Alberta perspective, the finance committee's 1994 
recommendations are more attractive than the finance minister's 
plan to move to a uniform rate. Even with the abatement of the 
incremental revenues collected from Alberta in its June 1994 
recommendations to government, the finance committee stressed 
the benefits of adoption of a consistent broad base and gave 
suggestions on how to do it, but it was not accepted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I have consulted 
again with the other parties and I believe that if you seek it you will 
find that there is unanimous consent to have the member for 
Calgary Southwest become sponsor for private member's Bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7808"> 7808 </A></B>
<P>
C-341 in the place of  the former member for Calgary West, and 
that Motion No. 259 be withdrawn from the order of precedence.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise again to speak to this grouping of amendments. 
Before I talk about the amendments in detail, I would like to 
comment on some things which happened earlier in this debate.
<P>
	The hon. parliamentary secretary to the finance minister 
chastised both the Bloc members and the Reform members for not 
speaking directly to the amendments that were in the grouping. He 
went on to indicate that it was unfortunate the debate had not 
focused on those particular amendments.
<P>
	I would say that no amount of amendment to this legislation 
would make it suitable. This legislation is being referred to as the 
harmonization of the GST, but harmonization is really not a good 
description of the legislation.
<P>
	In the latest issue of ``Let's Talk Taxes'', put out by the Canadian 
Taxpayers Federation, the author of the article described 
harmonization in this way: ``Harmonize is such a nice word. Aside 
from its soothing musical connotations, it implies a sense of unity, 
togetherness and co-operation. When applied to the GST, however, 
it means coercion, confusion, cost and cover-up''. The author of 
this report went on to explain what he meant with regard to those 
issues.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Clearly this bill does not harmonize. What we have are three 
provinces in Atlantic Canada that have signed on to this legislation. 
We have other province that have said that they will not sign on. 
They will not do it. They think it is wrong.
<P>
	Of course the price that taxpayers pay for this, and this issue is 
an issue that should be talked about by taxpayers and taxpayer 
advocates, is about $1 billion. Taxpayers from the other provinces, 
other than those three that are taking part, will pay $1 billion to put 
this so-called harmonized tax in place in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	It is a lot of money. It is a lot of money to cover for a broken 
election promise. We know of course that many Liberal members 
were elected on that promise to get rid of the GST, to abolish the 
GST. How many? Who knows, 10, 20, 30 members elected because 
of that promise? It is hard to know but it was a lot.
<P>
	The Prime Minister before the election campaign, during the 
campaign and since the election has said ``We are going to get rid 
of the GST. We are going to abolish. We are going to kill the GST''. 
It has not happened and this legislation is an attempt to cover up. It 
is an attempt that is costing taxpayers from the other  provinces $1 
billion. That is an awful expensive cover-up.
<P>
	I really take exception to the parliamentary secretary to the 
finance minister's chastising Reformers and Bloc members for 
talking about the broader issue, the fact that this harmonization is 
not harmonization at all and that it is going to cost taxpayers almost 
$1 billion.
<P>
	The member for Mississauga South has taken on in an admirable 
way many causes, especially on family issues. I commend him for 
that. However, I was absolutely saddened from what I heard from 
him today. This member stood up in the House and said to 
Canadians, through their televisions, that the Liberals never 
promised to get rid of the GST when the television tapes that have 
been shown across the country, especially since the town hall 
meeting, have show the Prime Minister promising on at least three 
occasions to get rid of the GST. I do not understand how the 
member can say that.
<P>
	Then he went on to say, as unbelievable as this sounds, that what 
they did say is they would replace the GST. Then he said: ``When 
we looked at replacing the GST, what we found is'', and this is the 
member for Mississauga South speaking earlier in debate today, 
``the best replacement for the GST is the GST''. By his own 
admission the member for Mississauga South admits they have not 
even replaced the GST with this new so-called harmonized GST.
<P>
	Canadians are not going to be fooled by what is going on here. It 
is a cover-up and it is an unacceptable cover-up. I find it so sad that 
the member for Mississauga South would get involved in this kind 
of activity.
<P>
	Just as I speak about this it leads me to reflect on the great need 
we have in this country for a recall of members of Parliament. It 
makes it so clear that we have to have tools to put in the hands of 
the voters and the taxpayers to keep their members of Parliament 
accountable. Those tools have to be given to the people so that 
politicians who run for office and who do not deliver on their 
promises can be held accountable.
<P>
	If the people in Mississauga South could see and could hear what 
their member said regarding this harmonization legislation, 
absolutely outright denying that they ever said they would get rid 
of the GST, saying they promised to replace it but when they really 
looked at things they found the best replacement for the GST was 
in fact the GST, I suggest there could well have been a recall 
petition started against that member.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	To explain for those who may not understand when I talk about 
recall, I am talking about putting in the hands of the people the 
ability to fire their member of Parliament, not only at election time 
when some of the main issues are being deflected from, but also 
between elections. Recall comes into play between elections.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7809"> 7809 </A></B>
<P>
	When a basic promise which played such a great role in getting 
many of those members across the floor elected is broken, that 
is the time recall should be implemented. That is why the Reform 
member for Beaver River sponsored a recall bill. Had it passed, 
it would have put into the hands of the people a tool which would 
allow them to fire their member of Parliament between elections 
when they felt that their MP was not honouring a commitment 
made at election time.
<P>
	The member for Beaver River sponsored legislation which came 
before the House. Had it passed, it would have been law. Why do 
we not have the right of recall, the right given to the people to fire 
their members of Parliament between elections? Why do we not 
have that legislation in place? The answer is that it was shot down. 
It was voted against by members of the Liberal Party and by 
members of the Bloc Quebecois. They refused to put this important 
tool which would hold members of Parliament accountable into the 
hands of the people.
<P>
	I would suggest that those 10, 20, 30, 40 members of Parliament 
from the governing party who campaigned on getting rid of the 
GST will be held accountable at the next election. Many of them 
will not be re-elected. That is accountability. The voters will 
exercise their right in this case. It is unfortunate the voters do not 
have recall, the tool that would allow them to do it now rather than 
waiting for the next election.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me somewhat of a pleasure to speak on 
this legislation.
<P>
	All Canadians realize that a promise was made to them prior to 
the 1993 election. It was very clear from candidates going door to 
door, from candidates meetings and also from the Prime Minister's 
statements to the public via TV and radio that the promise to the 
electorate was that the Liberal government was going to scrap the 
GST.
<P>
	I do not and I am sure most Canadians do not recall the word 
harmonization being used. It brings distress to most Canadians that 
we are now looking at a government which has decided it will 
harmonize the GST with the provincial sales tax. The government 
has started in the maritime provinces. It bribed those provinces. It 
did not follow the initiative of the provinces asking for it. It just 
bribed those provinces with $1 billion of borrowed dollars to the 
Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	It should also be noted that three provinces have said they will 
not even contemplate this issue. They will not contemplate entering 
any negotiations or proposals with the federal government. The 
three provinces that have said they will not contemplate it are the 
three have provinces, those that seem always to be paying up front 
for federal government programs.
<P>
	The Ontario Minister of Finance has even stated that a blended 
sales tax using the GST base would cost Ontarians over $3 billion 
in extra taxes.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	This government has managed to reduce its deficit not by 
substantially cutting government spending, but by raising fees and 
taxes to the Canadian people. This is one more example where the 
Liberal government thinks that if any Canadian has any money in 
his or her pocket, it is fair grab.
<P>
	The finance minister also plans to force federally regulated 
industries, including airlines and banks, to bury the GST in their 
prices. Canadians need to know just how much money their federal 
government is taking out of their pockets above and beyond their 
income tax contributions. I do not think Canadians appreciate the 
underhanded methods this government has used to get more money 
out of their pockets.
<P>
	One of the most frightening aspects of this harmonization plan is 
the cost in jobs. Three major retailers in Atlantic Canada have 
stated that the net annual retail deficit will total $27 million once 
harmonization is implemented. The Retail Council of Canada has 
said that by forcing stores to bury the new tax in prices, the 
harmonized tax regime will cost retailers at least $100 million a 
year.
<P>
	The tax included pricing hits retailers in four areas. One is the 
duplication of the information systems and the rewriting of 
software. Another is in the re-pricing of pre-priced goods: books, 
greeting cards, magazines, et cetera. The third one is in the 
duplication of advertising costs in flyers and catalogues; one set for 
the Atlantic provinces and another set for those areas where there is 
no harmonization. The fourth is in the warehousing and 
distribution costs; sorting out which ones have the tax included for 
the maritimes and which ones do not.
<P>
	The Halifax Chamber of Commerce predicts that the harmonized 
sales tax will push up new housing prices by 5.5 per cent, as well as 
force municipalities to raise their property taxes. The Canadian 
Real Estate Association says that the harmonization of the GST and 
PST will increase the cost of a new house by $4,000 in Nova Scotia 
and Newfoundland, and by $3,374 in New Brunswick.
<P>
	What is happening here is that the taxpayer is having to pick up 
the extra tax burden.
<P>
	GST harmonization is responsible for the closure of five 
Greenberg stores and the loss of 79 jobs. Woolworth Canada states 
that due to the tax inclusive pricing it is considering closing a 
quarter of the 126 stores in the Atlantic region meaning a loss of 
over 300 jobs. Carleton Cards predicts that it will close 19 of its 39 
stores in the region, throwing 116 people out of work.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7810"> 7810 </A></B>
<P>
	I find it an outrage that this government can talk about job 
creation and about using the infrastructure to create part time, 
temporary jobs yet it stands by and watches permanent, full time 
jobs disappearing, particularly in a region like Atlantic Canada 
which, Lord knows, has few enough jobs for its people. How can 
this government deliberately be putting together a proposal and 
putting legislation in place that is a detriment to jobs for the 
Atlantic people?
<P>
	Consumers, the ones who will have jobs and might have some 
money in their pockets, will be paying more for funeral services, 
children's clothing and books. What happened to the promise of 
this government to remove the GST from books? Auto repairs, 
electricity, gasoline, home heating fuel and haircuts. Not only are 
we taking away their jobs, we are raising the cost of living. They 
are going to be hard pressed to provide their children with proper 
clothing and to heat their homes, and that is anticipating they can 
even afford to buy homes with the rising costs this implementation 
is going to create.
<P>
	One of the more irresponsible results of this is that the Liberal 
government defeated a Reform motion to hold hearings in Atlantic 
Canada on GST harmonization which would have allowed the 
people of Atlantic Canada to participate in deciding on whether or 
not GST harmonization was something they wanted and they felt 
they could support. Refusing to allow the people in Atlantic 
Canada to exercise their right to participate in the discussion, in 
essence is the same as having taxation without consultation or 
without representation. That should not be allowed in this country.
<P>
	If this government is under any misconception that the people of 
Canada support it in retaining the GST instead of scrapping it, 
removing it or abolishing it and if government members feel that 
Canadians support them in their efforts to hide the GST through 
harmonization, let me read a couple of comments made by 
constituents of mine on their householder returns.
<P>
	One response says: ``Get rid of all the governors general. It will 
save billions of dollars no doubt as we do not need the Queen''. He 
goes on to say: ``When will they abolish the GST? Prime Minister 
Chrétien promised. You can see it on the old tapes when he made 
this promise-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 5.41 p.m., the House will now 
proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business as 
listed on today's Order Paper.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> On a point of order and I thank you, Mr. 
Speaker, in view of the hour.
<P>
	On several occasions today you, Mr. Speaker, and others who 
have occupied the Chair have pointed out to members that the use 
of certain words in this House is unacceptable. If I heard correctly, 
what I heard was an attempt to use the same word by spelling it out 
rather  than saying it. It amounts to the same word with respect to 
the Prime Minister of this country.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Beaver River and I 
were talking. I did not hear the latter part of the hon. member's 
remarks. Perhaps she would indicate what was said and if 
something unparliamentary was said I know she will want to 
withdraw it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not name any word. What I 
was doing to avoid the circumstances was I said that it was a four 
letter word starting with <I>l</I>. I did not say any word at all.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We always accept a member's word in 
this place and accordingly it must have been a misunderstanding.

	The House resumed from November 26, 1996 consideration of 
the motion that, in the opinion of this House, the government 
should return the word ``Canadian'' among questions of ethnic 
origin on the Canadian Census; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Motion M-277 concerning a 
proposed change to the next Canadian census.
<P>
	The member for Beaver River moved: ``That, in the opinion of 
this House, the government should return the word ``Canadian'' 
among questions of ethnic origin on the Canadian Census''. And 
my colleague, the member for Bellechasse, moved an amendment 
to this motion asking that it ``include ``Canadian'', ``Quebecker'', 
``English-Canadian'', ``French-Canadian'' and ``Acadian'' among 
questions of ethnic origin on the Canadian Census''.
<P>
	This goes back to the last Canadian census. It is truly astonishing 
that an agency as reliable as Statistics Canada, whose competence 
is recognized worldwide, produced such erroneous questions.
<P>
	One of them, question 17, asks to which ethnic or cultural group 
the respondent's ancestors belong. The choices are: French, 
English, German, Canadian, Scottish, Jewish, Haitian, Jamaican, 
Vietnamese, and so on.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Question 19 reads as follows: ``Is this person-and here comes 
the problematical point- white, Chinese, South Asian (for 
example, Indian, Pakistani, Punjabi, Sri Lankan)-here nations and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7811"> 7811 </A></B>
<P>
regions are being confused, since the Punjab is a region and not a 
country-black (for example, African, Haitian, Jamaican and 
Somali)-as if a  person could not be white and be born in 
Africa-Arab, West Asian (for example, Armenian, Egyptian, 
Iranian, Lebanese, Moroccan), Filipino, Southeast Asian, Latin 
American, Japanese, Korean or other?''.
<P>
	It is, I imagine, in this list that the member for Beaver River 
would like to see the word ``Canadian'' added.
<P>
	There is a very definite confusion between race, ethnic group, 
nationality, language, region and country. Yet these words do have 
definitions, and there is a capability at Statistics Canada, with all 
the scientific knowledge possessed by its employees and 
professionals, to define those concepts very well. There are ways to 
not confuse the concept of race, a concept that is becoming more 
and more obsolete anyway, we must admit.
<P>
	As for ethnicity, this is an item of no scientific value, since the 
majority of people forget their ethnic group of origin. When I 
myself answered the questionnaire, I did not say I was French in 
origin, since my ancestors came to the country in 1657. I have more 
or less loss sight of that. I am Canadian in origin, born in Canada. 
For me, that presents no problem.
<P>
	Except that if someone wants to ask me something more 
specific, to find out what group I really identify with in Canada, I 
cannot identify myself with a Canadian; there is no such thing as a 
Canadian. It is all very fine to spend a lot of money to try and make 
one exist, but a Canadian does not exist as such, in my opinion. At 
least not yet. I am of Canadian origin, of course, but I belong to the 
Quebec nation. My origin is the one I have in common with people 
who live in the same area and have the same common 
characteristics.
<P>
	We are aware of a certain unity that exists among people who 
live in Quebec and increasingly, ``Canadians'' are defining 
themselves as Ontarians, Manitobans or Newfoundlanders. Many 
people from Newfoundland do not feel any more Canadian than 
Quebecers do. They are from Newfoundland first. Of course they 
will say they are from Canada, although they were the last to join 
Confederation.
<P>
	So there are certain feelings, a certain commonality that unite us, 
through history, society, culture and above all through a desire to 
live together. I think that if they decide to keep this question in the 
next census questionnaire, it should be clarified to reflect the kind 
of answer that is desired.
<P>
	It would be interesting to know with what kind of nationalism we 
can identify, because as we know each other better, we are more 
likely to accept each other as we are and understand each other, as 
long as we live in the same country or when we will live together as 
good neighbours. So we will know where we are from.
<P>
	The important thing is that we can talk about our ethnic origin, 
without mixing up all these concepts as they were in question 19.
<P>
	Now we can assume that all these people who work at Statistics 
Canada, with all their knowledge and skills, have a reason for 
asking the question the way they did. Strictly speaking, both 
Question No. 17 and question 19 are not a matter of census data or 
statistics but, in my opinion, purely political questions.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	What is the point of these questions? The responses will be 
tallied, the number of people from France, Germany, Italy, China 
will be identified-as the questionnaire asks: Are you white, 
Chinese-you can be Chinese without ever setting foot in China. If 
you live in Hong Kong, Singapore or Taiwan, you are Chinese, but 
you can be Chinese without ever going to China.
<P>
	A lot more precision is required. You can also be Canadian and 
not identify with English Canada at all. You can be a Canadian of 
francophone origin, but, because of your family history, be part of 
another segment of the population or the minority in Quebec. There 
are francophones, even Tremblays, whose name is given an English 
pronunciation and who do not speak a word of French anymore, 
because they belong to the anglophone minority in Quebec.
<P>
	Perhaps these people do not see themselves as Quebecers 
anymore. They are more English Canadian, and we must respect 
their choice.
<P>
	Why make the question unclear? No doubt in order to emphasize 
Canada's multiculturalism policy and convince us that Canada 
exists, that it is the most beautiful country in the world and that 
ours is a mosaic comprising every country. People are Ukrainian 
Canadians, Italian Canadians, Chinese Canadians-I could name 
all of the 200 countries in the world. We probably have people from 
all these places.
<P>
	I have no objection to that, but it is the source of Canada's 
problem. And it is: a lack of Canadian identity. Maintaining 
multiculturalism within the country means that no one wants to 
become Canadian and so we end up not defining what it means to 
be Canadian. In my opinion, if Canada wants to progress and better 
understand itself-it will be doubtless very useful to us as 
neighbours some day-there is no reason to be afraid of identifying 
what one considers one's nationality.
<P>
	The question must be clarified. There are Acadians in the 
country, there are French Canadians, there are Quebecers and there 
are Ontarians. It is vital to know what people consider to be their 
nationality.
<P>
	We must open our eyes. We must look at the reality of our 
differences, learn to live together and respect one another, whether 
it be within a single country or as good neighbours.

	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada  Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to Motion No. 277, 
which calls for the government to include the words ``Canadian'', 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7812"> 7812 </A></B>
<P>
``Quebecois'', ``English Canadian'', ``French Canadian'' and 
``Acadian'' on the question concerning ethnic origin in the census.
<P>
	First I would point out that, for a number of censuses, 
respondents have been able to respond ``Canadian'' as well as 
``Quebecer''-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The clerk has indicated to me that the 
hon. member has already spoken on the amendment and, 
accordingly, he knows that he is not eligible to speak again.
<P>
	I see him shaking his head. Perhaps he would stand down for a 
moment and we will check to see whether an error has been made 
on the record.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, I spoke for part of my time when the 
hour elapsed the last time and I had not completed my speech.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member may not realize it, but if the 
member does not show up the next time and another member 
speaks, then the member who did not appear for the debate is taken 
to have abandoned his right to speak. Accordingly, in light of what 
the member has said, he is not entitled to speak on the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, may I rise on a point of order on this?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will listen to the hon. member, but I 
hope it is something he has not already said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is difficult for me to stand to speak 
first when you recognized the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata before the clerk even read the order of the 
day.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will not get into a debate with the 
member on that. It was the Bloc Quebecois' turn to speak. If the 
member wishes to consult the Table he will see that.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker it is 
a pleasure for me to speak on Motion No. 277 which has been 
introduced in the House by my colleague from Beaver River.
<P>
	The motion reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should return the word 
``Canadian'' among questions of ethnic origin on the Canadian census.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There has been some interesting debate on this. I was very 
interested to listen to the previous speaker, my colleague from the 
Bloc, who said it was a shame there was no discernible Canadian 
culture, that our culture had been fractured into hyphenated 
Canadianism, recognizing all kinds of hyphenated Canadians but 
not  working to make sure we affirm and encourage Canadian unity 
and identity. She makes a very excellent point. We need to stop 
doing exactly what question 19 does, which is divide and fracture 
and hyphenate Canadians based on ethnicity.
<P>
	The Liberals make a big thing of a pejorative word called racism. 
Yet here the Liberals, in a brand new question conceived and 
written by a Liberal government, does exactly that, differentiates 
Canadians on the basis of race. If that is not racism I would like to 
know what it is. Perhaps when the Liberals use the word ``racist'' 
and ``racism'' as loosely as they do, they would bear in mind that 
their actions do not always match their deeds.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, there has been some hot debate and 
some concern that Canadian is not one of the categories of ethnicity 
or race or background that is a choice on the census form in 
question 19 which is kind of interesting.
<P>
	I have a very interesting and helpful letter from the chief 
statistician commenting on Motion No. 277. It very helpfully sets 
out this information. I am sure Canadians will be very interested in 
this information because it sheds a new light on concerns that 
Canadian is not one of the categories listed in question 19.
<P>
	The chief statistician states: ``I would like to emphasize that a 
person answering Canadian for question 19 would not be 
prosecuted''. That is good news. We can be Canadians. We can 
identify ourselves as Canadians even on census forms and not be 
prosecuted. We should stand up and cheer about that. That is very 
reassuring to me.
<P>
	The letter goes on to state: ``Individuals who felt that Canadian 
was the most appropriate response to the question and who wrote in 
this answer in the space provided are considered to have complied 
with the requirements of the Statistics Act''. This is once again 
affirming if you identify yourself as a Canadian in the census form 
you will not be prosecuted. It is very nice to have that freedom. I 
am sure most Canadians will feel very happy.
<P>
	The letter goes on to say this. ``Statistics are needed by both 
governments and employers to administer and assess the impact of 
the employment equity legislation passed by Parliament in 1986''. 
Two interesting points come out of this letter, in addition to the 
relief we call feel knowing that we can in fact identify ourselves as 
Canadians. One is that Canadian is not an obvious and clear choice. 
In fact, the only way that one can identify oneself as a Canadian in 
question 19 is if one writes it in the blank.
<P>
	Canadian is kind of an afterthought in this question. It is a fill in 
the blank kind of thing and not a natural and normal designation for 
Canadians. A person may be designated as almost anything else, 
but only if they really  feel strongly about it and decide to fill in the 
blank can they really be a Canadian in that question.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7813"> 7813 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	The second piece of information in this letter, which I believe is 
accurate, is that the purpose of question 19, which asks for the 
ethnicity of respondents, is for the purpose of administering the 
employment equity legislation passed by the government.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, did you indicate I have only one minute left? Oh, I 
am finished.
<P>
	That is a little background to support this motion. I am pleased to 
put that forward. I suggest this motion be passed and that 
Canadians be free to designate themselves as Canadians on our 
census forms in any manner that they choose.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> On a point of order, the hon. member for 
Calgary North.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I know time flies 
when you are having fun, but that did not seem to have been 10 
minutes. Could you consult with the Table to make sure I got all my 
purple prose in?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member may well have an 
excellent point. We have a new technology in the House now which 
actually times everybody down to 10 minutes. There may have 
been an error in the technology but never by anyone at the Table or 
in the Chair. I will check that matter.
<P>
	The fault is no doubt with the technology. The hon. member for 
Calgary North still has five minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you. I know other members 
may have wished that the technology was correct in this case but I 
did have a couple of more points that might throw some light on 
our consideration of this motion.
<P>
	I refer back to the point that the purpose of question 19 was 
simply and solely for the administration of the employment equity 
legislation. I had some very interesting feedback in my office 
following the circulation of the census. I am sure almost every 
member in the House did and that other colleagues of mine, even 
from other parties, would be able to give examples of this.
<P>
	From my own files, a woman named Krishna called and said: 
``Census question number 19: East Indian would cover Punjabis. 
The category of Punjabi should not be there. I refuse to answer and 
will not send my application back to Stats Canada. This creates 
division between India and Punjabi and should be removed''.
<P>
	Esther phoned in and said: ``I am livid and upset and hurt about 
the census forms. When I received my Canadian citizenship, the 
adjudicator told me that I would never again be asked what my 
ethnicity was or what my background was. Stats Canada already 
has my  records. Why does it need to ask me again? I thought I was 
a Canadian''.
<P>
	Since time is short I have provided just those two short examples 
of some of the difficulties, the divisions and the upset that 
Canadians feel when they are subjected to this kind of 
discrimination and differentiation.
<P>
	Over the past two decades, Liberal and Conservative 
governments have tried to achieve equality, a very laudatory goal. 
But they have tried to achieve equality among Canadians by 
passing legislation that treats different groups of Canadians 
differently under the law based on race and other characteristics. 
Reform believes this special status approach is divisive and leads 
to intolerance and inequality. We believe in true equality which 
allows diversity and promotes tolerance.
<P>
	A Reform government would ensure that Canadians are 
protected against discrimination on the basis of equality of 
individuals before the law rather than on the basis of special rights 
based on group characteristics. A Reform government would 
protect all individuals from rights infringements and 
discriminatory actions by the state, particularly in the area of 
employment which the Employment Equity Act is supposed to 
address.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	We would discontinue federal affirmative action and 
employment equity programs because unlike the other parties, we 
believe that even discrimination practised for ``affirmative 
reasons'' is harmful because it is fundamentally unjust.
<P>
	Question 19 on the census form gets us more to the point where 
we discriminate, differentiate Canadians, the people in this country 
on the basis of ethnicity. We think it is wrong. We think it is 
harmful to Canadian society. We think it is divisive and we think it 
should be stopped and reversed and that Canadians should be 
affirmed as Canadians, treated equally, given equal opportunity 
before the law and move on to build their lives as individual 
Canadians, not as members of a special, different group based on 
individual characteristics.
<P>
	Once again, I urge my colleagues to support the motion which 
again affirms the fact that we should be proud to be Canadian, 
encouraged to be proud Canadians and should be proud to be 
identified as Canadians in very way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
you should visit us sometime. I think you might enjoy it. Although 
we had some snow over the winter, we now have daffodils poking 
their noses up.
<P>
	I am a Canadian and what is more I am proud to be a Canadian. 
As a matter of fact for over 41 years I wore the word Canada on my 
shoulder flash in the air force.
<P>
	It has been my good fortune to have travelled most of the world, 
usually as a private citizen, but for three years as a Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7814"> 7814 </A></B>
<P>
diplomat. It did not matter what my status  was, my Canadian 
passport gained me a warm welcome no matter where I went. The 
people I met did not care about my ethnic origin. It was the fact that 
I was from Canada that mattered.
<P>
	During the 1996 census one in every five Canadian households 
was asked: ``Is this person white, Chinese, South Asian, black, 
Arab, West Asian, Filipino, Southeast Asian, Latin American, 
Japanese, Korean or other?''
<P>
	For the first time in our history Canadians were required to 
define and identify themselves by race. Many Canadians view the 
omission of the term Canadian in question 19 of the census as a 
denial of their heritage. This omission has prompted my colleague 
from Beaver River to introduce Motion No. 277, and I welcome 
this opportunity to address the important issues prompted by the 
motion.
<P>
	It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should return the word 
``Canadian'' among questions of ethnic origin on the Canadian census.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Stats Canada readily acknowledges that they excluded the term 
Canadian from the list because including it would make it 
impossible for them to determine the numbers and characteristics 
of the visible minority population in Canada. This was the essential 
purpose of that question. Why must visible minorities be defined? 
Why do we have to segment, to separate Canadians into racial 
groups? Why simply, Mr. Speaker, to enable the employment 
equity act to be implemented.
<P>
	Let us have a look at what is accomplished by employment 
equity. Thomas Sowell, a well respected African-American 
economist has written extensively on preferential hiring programs 
around the world and observes that preferential hiring policies 
invariably expand, often hurting the very people they are designed 
to help. They create tensions among winners and losers and are 
invariably associated with heavy costs because they invite large 
numbers of fraudulent claims from those who do not belong to a 
minority group but wish to obtain the advantages.
<P>
	In <I>Democracy on Trial</I>, Jean Bethke Elshtain writes of the 
condescending paternalism experienced by scholarship recipient 
Richard Rodriguez, the son of Mexican immigrants to California. 
Although he had personally received an excellent parochial 
education he was treated as a victim of cultural deprivation. He 
noticed that many of his peers who were both poor and poorly 
educated received all sorts of allowances and were pushed 
``through the system under the assumption that standards of merit 
and achievement are themselves unfair impositions by an anglo 
majority on any and all minorities''.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	In Rodriguez's own words: ``The conspiracy of kindness became 
a conspiracy of uncaring. Cruelly,  callously, admissions 
committees agreed to overlook serious academic deficiency. I 
knew students in college then barely able to read, students unable 
to grasp the function of a sentence. I knew non-white graduate 
students who were bewildered by the requirement to compose a 
term paper and who each day were humiliated when they couldn't 
compete with other students in seminars.
<P>
	Not surprisingly, among those students with very poor academic 
preparation, few complete their course of study. Many drop out 
blaming themselves for their failure. One fall, six non-white 
students I knew suffered severe mental collapse. None of the 
professors who had welcomed them to graduate school were 
around when it came time to take them to the infirmary or to the 
airport.
<P>
	The university officials, who so diligently took note of those 
students in their self-serving totals of entering minority students, 
finally took no note of them when they left''.
<P>
	I can speak personally on this practice as it is applied in the 
Canadian Armed Forces where a conscious effort is made to 
achieve the correct ethnic ratio in the rank structure.
<P>
	Francophone officers were often given priority on promotion 
lists, sometimes bypassing 10, 20, 30 or even 40 anglophone 
officers who had been more highly rated.
<P>
	Unhappily, in the system's effort to achieve the correct ratio, 
some very good francophone officers' careers were curtailed. They 
had been advanced too quickly, spent too little time in each rank 
which in turn denied them the experience they would have acquired 
if they had followed a more normal pattern. Some wound up in 
positions of responsibility for which they were not adequately 
qualified and this caused them to fail to fulfil their duties as well as 
expected. The result: people who had the potential to progress 
much further wound up limited in their advancement because they 
had been pushed too fast and too hard.
<P>
	Merit is the primary criterion on which selection or advancement 
should be based. Any interference with this principle is demeaning 
to the individuals to whom it is applied. It says to them: ``You are 
not good enough to make it on your own so we will deny others to 
help you''.
<P>
	It is ironic that employment equity programs designed to create 
equality in fact divide and create disparities. Yet the word Canadian 
unites us, while recognizing and accepting our individual 
distinctions, heritage and ancestral roots.
<P>
	As people from Quebec are proud to be Quebecois, I am proud to 
be a British Columbian. My roots are tied to this beautiful land: the 
sea, the mountains, the uniqueness of our Pacific culture and, most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7815"> 7815 </A></B>
<P>
of all, family. It is the place of my birth, my home as a youth, now 
again, by choice, my home and the place where my  children and 
grandchildren have made their homes. It is a place of the heart.
<P>
	I am a fourth generation Canadian. My ancestors were Scottish 
and, I suppose, if I go back far enough, French. However, I do not 
wish to be known or considered a Scottish-Canadian or an 
anglo-Canadian or any sort of a hyphenated Canadian. I reject this 
divisive principle and have received much input from constituents 
who also reject hyphenated Canadianism.
<P>
	For this reason, I cannot accept the census question asking us to 
become hyphenated Canadians. Nor am I able to support the Bloc 
amendment by the member for Bellechasse, seconded by the 
member for Saint-Hubert, which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by replacing all the words after the word ``should'' 
with the following: ``include Canadian, Quebecer, English-Canadian, 
French-Canadian and Acadian among questions of ethnic origin on the Canadian 
census.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Section 15(1) of the charter states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to equal 
protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, 
without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, 
age or mental or physical disability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Section 15(1), standing alone, affords protection of all civil rights.
<P>
	Section 15(2) of the charter goes on to state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subsection 1 does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object 
the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups, including 
those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, 
religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Section 15(2) of the charter is equating equality with sameness. 
The very heart of section 15(1) has thus been stripped away. It now 
rings hollow.
<P>
	This coming August my wife Jean and I are going to Aberdeen in 
Scotland to attend the 800th anniversary of the formation of the 
Frazer clan. At that gathering we expect to meet Frazers from many 
parts of the world, from Canada, United States, Australia, New 
Zealand, Norway, France, India, other countries and, of course, 
Scotland.
<P>
	We will be joined together by our common name or connection 
to that name, but that will not take away the fact that we will still be 
Canadian, American, Scottish or whatever. Our nationality and 
pride in our individual countries is in no way diminished by our 
common name connection.
<P>
	There is something drastically wrong if the Canadian census 
form does not allow Canadians to identify themselves as Canadian. 
I hope members of this House will agree and support MotionNo. 277 proposed by the member for Beaver River.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, imagine someone coming from another planet, sitting 
down right here in Canada and finding that they were being asked 
some questions on a census. People came around and the person 
who came from outer space to Canada was answering the questions 
in a census and thought ``I better find out where I am''.
<P>
	He got an atlas that said Canada. He checked around and found a 
hockey team called the Montreal Canadiens. He was watching TV 
and saw an advertisement for a beer that was called ``Canadian'' 
and thought ``Canada, hmm''.
<P>
	When it came time to answer the census, the person from outer 
space looked for the slot that said Canadian and much to that 
person's chagrin he could not find it.
<P>
	Imagine the same person sitting down anywhere else in the 
world. I suppose in England, English would not be there. It would 
have to be something else; American would not be there.
<P>
	From time to time we ordinary Canadians sometimes wonder if 
there is a lack of oxygen in the air in Ottawa. God knows there has 
to be something that causes this. What other explanation could 
there be for such a bone headed decision to say in Canada we will 
have a census form and the person cannot be a Canadian?
<P>
	It does not matter whether the person has been here for a week, 
whether they have been a citizen of this great country for a week, a 
day or whether we go back 10 generations, we are Canadians. Is 
that not what it is all about? Is that not what being part of the 
mosiac, of this family from a host of different countries around the 
world is?
<P>
	Do members suppose that people came here from Rwanda to be 
Rwandans forever? Do members think perhaps that our forefathers 
came from wherever they came from to be where they were? What 
do they suppose it was that brought them to this magic land 
Canada? It was the values we have of inclusiveness. It was that in 
Canada it is possible to be equal before the law, no matter their 
station in life, whether high born or low born.
<P>
	There are situations where that is not always the case. We can 
speak to that tomorrow when we talk about Bob Fowler and Kyle 
Brown and the difference between those two people who should be 
equal before the law but who are not.
<P>
	Generally speaking, one of the magic, marvellous things about 
Canada is that we are equal before the law. It does not matter what 
colour our skin is. We are a nation of values. What could possibly 
be the motivating factor? What could motivate these people at 
Census Canada who are known around the world for the fact that 
we really have a good census?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7816"> 7816 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	The census information that is compiled is good for the country. 
It gives us statistical factual information from which we can have a 
foundation for a whole host of different things, like how the 
economy is going, the number of children there are, what we 
should plan for, the number of schools we are going to need, the 
number of senior citizen retirement homes we are going to need 
and what happens demographically in a community in response to a 
particular initiative, financial or otherwise.
<P>
	The census is good and the census takers are recognized around 
the world as being first rate. Therefore it does not seem logical for 
them to say ``how can we screw up this census and enrage half the 
population?'' Do we suppose they get up in the morning and say ``It 
is just too easy. Why do we not do something to drive everybody 
crazy and knock our phones off the hook so that people think that 
we are the crazy ones, not the people in the House of Commons 
who represent us''?
<P>
	If we scratch the surface we will find that there is a method to the 
madness. There is a reason. The employment equity affirmative 
action legislation passed by the Liberal government is not worth 
the powder to blow it to hell, which is where it should be blown to, 
unless we have the data base from which to explore and make 
comparisons.
<P>
	I had the privilege to respond on behalf of our party to the 
multiculturalism report on the 25th anniversary of the new wave of 
multiculturalism in Canada. At that time I was proud to say that our 
country is one heart and many colours. That is what we are. 
However, when we set up a country based upon division, based 
upon our ancestry, then we are going directly counter to everything 
we have tried to do to make our nation inclusive.
<P>
	We are Canadians because we share common values. Canadians 
understand that there are some of us who are less able to carry the 
load and we help them. We measure the quality of our community 
not by the highest but by the lowest among us; not by the most 
privileged but by the least privileged. These are the values that 
make a nation. They are fairness and equality. All people are 
measured equally, based on merit, and those who need help can 
depend on that help.
<P>
	The minute we introduce into our culture the notion that people 
should have or be declined benefit because of their race, we are 
introducing sand into the foundation of our nation that we will 
come to regret.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the only country that has ever, to my 
knowledge and to the knowledge of my researchers, asked for the 
racial determination of persons in a census was Germany during 
the horror of the Nazi times. I am not suggesting for a moment that 
these two are equal. I am not suggesting that the motivation is the 
same. That would be ludicrous. We all know it is not.  However, the 
fact remains that the racial background of people in this country is 
nobody's business, period. We are Canadians because we are 
human beings and that is where our equality comes in.
<P>
	Everything we do in our country should be based on merit and 
the values that we share as human beings, and not for any other 
reason; not because of the colour of our skin, our religion, our sex 
or our sexual orientation. It should be based strictly on merit.
<P>
	Introducing this innocuous little change has the potential to take 
us down further on a path that many Canadians already see as being 
divisive and harmful to our nation in the long run.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	I would ask all hon. members to consider the fact that by putting 
Canada back into the census we will be helping to build and to 
mould an inclusive country where we do not look at each other and 
see the colour of each other's skin, or our sex, but that we look at 
each other and see who we are as human beings, sharing a common 
value system, a common destiny, all of us as Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be speaking on Motion No. 277 which is sponsored by 
the hon. member for Beaver River. It is an important motion 
because it deals with an issue which was brought to my attention by 
many people in my constituency during the time of the last census.
<P>
	The people who came to me were concerned that they were not 
given a choice on the long census form when they were asked about 
background. They were not given the chance to choose Canadian. 
Many of these people who contacted me, in fact all of them, were 
upset because Canadian is what they are and is what they consider 
themselves to be.
<P>
	Why was Canadian not given as a choice? It has been talked 
about by some of the hon. members who have spoken on this issue 
before me. One of the reasons of course is that if that choice is 
given it is too difficult, you do not get accurate information for 
employment equity legislation. That is certainly one of the key 
reasons.
<P>
	Employment equity legislation insists that in government 
agencies and agencies regulated by the federal government people 
be hired based on quotas. Many provinces of course have 
employment equity legislation as well.
<P>
	Many of the people who support the idea of employment equity 
argue that we are not talking about quotas at all. All we are talking 
about is giving everybody a fair chance and a fair shot at things. 
Clearly some groups, in particular some visible minorities or 
gender or someone with a certain sexual orientation have not been 
given a fair chance. We only want to make that fair but we are not 
talking about quotas.
<P>

<P>
	A young fellow, the son of a person I have come to know 
through Reform, came home when I was with his parents. I asked 
this young fellow what he was working on. He said he worked 
with computers. This was a job during the summer. I knew he was 
in university and would be going back. I asked him what kind of 
work he did. He said he was doing a project for the Ontario 
government with regard to employment equity. I said that is 
interesting and asked what the program is for.
<P>
	He said it is to determine how many people should be hired by 
chartered banks. Actually the work he was doing was going to be 
sold to chartered banks so that the banks know how many people to 
hire from each group. I said: ``Do you think that is right, that you 
would hire based on quota?'' He said: ``It is not about quota at all. 
It is just information for the banks so they can determine how many 
people they should hire''.
<P>
	After we pursued this a little the young man came to realize this 
is quota, and that is what we are talking about here, quota. He did 
acknowledge this after a bit of discussion. I found it really 
surprising that this young fellow had been so brainwashed by the 
people who were promoting this employment program he was 
working for never to refer to this as quota when clearly that is what 
is was.
<P>
	What does this have to do with this motion sponsored by the hon. 
member for Beaver River? The connection is that the reason 
StatsCan is getting these numbers and is not including Canadian as 
one of the groups to choose is that the numbers are needed for 
employment equity. That is one of the reasons. It has everything to 
do with quotas.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	When the statistics are collected and it is found out how many 
people there are in each of the visible minority groups, in the other 
categories, the different colour groups, once that information is 
obtained, that information is applied directly to government hiring 
and to hiring by agencies that are regulated by the federal 
government, such as banks. They will be used in the provincial 
employment equity programs where they are in place. That is 
without a doubt the most important reason these statistics are 
collected.
<P>
	When these people came to me during the last census and after 
the last census that is why they were so upset. They knew the 
reason this information was being collected. They knew it had 
everything to do with employment equity, that it had everything to 
do with quotas. It upset these people.
<P>
	Many of these people had immigrated to this country themselves 
from some other part of the world or their parents had emigrated 
from some other part of the world. They did not want to be referred 
to by their ethnic background. They did not want to be categorized 
based on ethnic background or skin colour or any other visible  
characteristic. They wanted to be referred to as Canadians. That is 
why this motion has come forth. It would give Canadians a chance 
again, no matter what ethnic background, what skin colour to just 
be Canadians.
<P>
	It certainly is one reason this information is being collected. 
There are other possibilities. One of course is to determine how 
much funding should go to different multicultural groups, 
multicultural spending. Polls have shown and certainly people who 
talk to other people in large numbers would know that Canadians 
do not accept spending taxpayers' money on promoting certain 
cultures. The general principle that people believe should guide 
spending on culture is that the money should come from the people 
who are interested in preserving that culture.
<P>
	Certain groups have done this extremely well. They have 
protected their culture. They have promoted their culture. They 
have put their culture to others in the neighbourhood in a way that 
has fascinated people. It has not caused resentment because they 
know it is not taxpayers' money that is doing this.
<P>
	One group I can think of is the Ukrainian group. In my 
constituency there is a large group of people who emigrated or their 
parents emigrated from Ukraine. Long before multicultural grants 
were available they did a super job through the church and through 
work in the community of keeping their culture for themselves, for 
their children and for the interest of others in the community. 
Because people knew that they were doing it with their own money, 
there certainly was not any resentment.
<P>
	Now that there are multiculturalism programs a resentment has 
built toward the people from visible minority groups themselves 
who are funded with taxpayers' money, who are promoting their 
culture with the use of taxpayers' money. That is what causes the 
resentment.
<P>
	There are some other possible reasons for wanting these 
numbers. I wonder. Leading up to the last election the Liberal Party 
chose women candidates, it just chose them. The Liberals did not 
allow the proper nomination process to take place because there 
were not enough women to become members of Parliament who 
were going to be running for the Liberals.
<P>
	I am wondering if part of the intent of getting these numbers is 
that the Liberals are now going to appoint candidates for the next 
election based on the numbers obtained in the census. I say that 
kind of tongue in cheek but I am not so sure it would not happen. 
Let us all hope it would not. Let us let the best person for the job get 
the job.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Beaver River who 
will no doubt be speaking only to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. As 
you know Motion No. M-277 is my motion. I spoke earlier in the 
debate on November 26, 1996 when my colleague from the Bloc, 
the member for Bellechasse, brought forward the amendment.
<P>
	If we could look at a snapshot of what is wrong with this country, 
it is somebody from a group who is going to add to the list rather 
than make the list smaller. That probably sums up so clearly the 
main reason I brought this motion forward in the first place. We 
need to be recognized as Canadians and Canadians period. Yet here 
is somebody in the Chamber who wants to make the list longer 
rather than shorter.
<P>
	I know it has been quoted here several times today by my 
colleagues who have spoken on this but let me in disbelief read one 
more time what the actual amendment states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by replacing all the words after the word ``should'' 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``include ``Canadian'', ``Quebecker'', ``English-Canadian'', ``French-Canadian'' 
and ``Acadian'' among the questions of ethnic origin on the Canadian Census.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is not derogatory toward any of these groups. Every one of 
these groups is to be celebrated. In Beaver River I have an 
enormous francophone population and we celebrate that. It truly is 
a multicultural microcosm of this country. Not only do we have a 
huge francophone population, the second largest in Alberta, but we 
have an enormous Lebanese community up in the Lac La Biche 
area. There were fur traders there in the twenties. We have a large 
German population, a large Ukrainian population and on and on it 
goes.
<P>
	There is one common denominator of those people in Beaver 
River. They would jump to their feet in a moment if they could be 
here today, if we could transport them, to say: ``I am a Canadian, 
you bet''. It is as simple as that. They would say: ``I am a Canadian 
period''. And they would leave off all this nonsense after all these 
commas.
<P>
	I had a number of calls in my constituency office and here in 
Ottawa from people who were among the unlucky one out of five to 
fill out the long census form. It upset me more than anything that I 
got a short one. I was just waiting. When my husband phoned me 
from home to tell me we got our census form, I asked him to rip it 
open to find out if it was the short one or the long one. Mr. Speaker, 
you know Lew and you know he was just as anxious as I was to get 
the long form and he was pretty upset. I think he was ready to drive 
around the countryside to find a neighbour he could swap with, but 
it did not happen and we had to fill out the short one.
<P>
	It is for this very reason that Lew, who just happens to be my 
husband and I think the greatest guy in the world, as a regular 
Canadian said: ``Let me get my hands on this so I can tell this 
government exactly what I think about this kind of list making and 
categorization of people as if we were just a bunch of so many 
pigeons''.
<P>
	It is wrong. Mr. Speaker, you know it is wrong and I think many 
people in this Chamber feel it is wrong. I know how important it is 
for the people my colleagues have alluded to this afternoon to say 
wait a minute here, there is something wrong because there is an 
underlying motive, which is wrong, for asking these questions. 
That of course is: ``We will attempt some social engineering. We 
know what is best for you''.
<P>
	The census people from Stats Canada did not dream up these 
questions. They were told, they were ordered, they were 
commanded by the people who are obsessed with employment 
equity and government grant giving because they think that will 
help unify the country. Nothing could be further from the truth. I 
am so sad that some colleagues across the way did not even stand 
up on behalf of this motion today.
<P>
	When are we going to stand up in this Chamber and say: ``I am a 
Canadian and I am proud to be a Canadian''? When am I going to 
be able to count on folks on the other side of the House who may 
disagree with me politically on all kinds of things, which I respect, 
but for goodness sake, it took us a year and a half to sing ``O 
Canada'' in this place after I tabled a motion on that. Is it too 
radical to sing our national anthem in the national Parliament? Is it 
going to be too much to ask people to say: ``Let us say we are 
Canadians on the census''? I could understand it from the Bloc 
Quebecois. But for the life of me I cannot understand it from 
people on the other side of the House who are proud and passionate 
Canadians. We should be able to say ``I am a Canadian'' on 
question 19. By jingles, the next time that census comes around, I 
will put Canadian no matter what, because that it what should make 
us proud.
<P>
	Let me just close by asking the Speaker to put the question now 
on the amendment by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time for debate has expired. If the 
hon. member wishes to speak further on the amendment the next 
time, she will have four and a half minutes to do so.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> I know the time has expired. I am asking you to put 
the question now on the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time for adjournment has passed, so 
there would have to be unanimous agreement from all members in 
the House to put the question on the amendment.
<P>
	Is there unanimous agreement to put the question on the 
amendment?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7819"> 7819 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I hear a no. Therefore, the debate will 
continue the next time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Dear colleagues, the hour provided for the consideration of 
Private Members' Business has now expired and the order is 
dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order 
Paper.

<P>
	It being 6.41 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m.
