let me begin by welcoming you to your new position.  I know that 
you will bring distinction to the Chair as you have as a critic 
for your party in the past.  As I recall, part of the time you

constructive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the 
constituents of my riding of Ottawa South for re-electing me for 
a third term. It is a great honour to be able to represent them 
again here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also grateful to the Prime Minister for giving me the 
opportunity to continue as Minister of Industry.  In fulfilling 
this role over the last four years, I have had the opportunity to 
meet with business people across Canada in all sectors of 
industry.  I have had a unique opportunity to see firsthand the 
entrepreneurship and dynamism of Canadians at work from coast to 
coast.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My objective today, in setting out the government's program to 
this House, is to explain our vision of Canada's economic and 
social development in a global knowledge-based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What our government set out in the Speech from the Throne is 
nothing more and nothing less than a new economic framework for 
Canada, a framework based on one idea: seizing the opportunities 
presented by the global knowledge economy in order to create jobs 
and wealth in all economic sectors, ranging from high technology to 
services and primary resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With our vision we will bring into the XXI century a Canada 
that is united and built on solid economic and social foundations. 
Our vision will bring Canadians, ourselves included, face to face 
with the challenge of being the best in the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new global economy based on knowledge, technology and 
innovation is rapidly emerging.  Led by dramatic improvements in 
computing and communications, this knowledge based economy is 
changing the determinants of success for individuals, companies, 
regions and countries. It is breaking the barriers of time and 
distance, and it is magnifying the role international 
developments play in our prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes are allowing individuals and businesses to operate 
across borders, around the world, at the speed of light: sharing 
knowledge, trading in goods, services and capital 24 hours a 
days, 7 days a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this emerging new economy, more than ever people and 
innovations are the keys to growth and wealth creation.  The 
knowledge economy is transforming all industrial sectors from 
agriculture and natural resources through manufacturing to retail 
and services. As we move into the new century the new economy 
will affect the life and work of every person, every business, 
every community and every organization in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that change goes hand and hand with 
uncertainty.  The changing world of work and the introduction of 
new technologies have left many wondering whether they and their 
children will occupy a productive and rewarding place in the new 
economy.  But change goes hand in hand with new opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an economy based on knowledge and innovation, many 
Canadians see outlets for their ideas and new horizons for their 
children.  They see new ways of communicating with others 
throughout the entire world as well as right next door, and new 
ways of improving their community and enriching their lives. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key objective of our economic agenda must be to ease the 
uncertainty of those Canadians who need to adjust to the changing 
economy and, at the same time, to help every Canadian take 
advantage of emerging opportunities and realize their full 
potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a solid foundation to build on.  We are, as we often 
repeat, according to the United Nations development index, the 
best country in the world in which to live.  With the help of all 
Canadians our economic fundamentals are now the best they have 
been in 35 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our focus now must be to construct real opportunities on the 
foundations already laid.  We are already positioned to be a 
world leader in the global knowledge economy of the 21st century. 
We have the people, we have the resources, we have the technology 
and we have the infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But having such assets is not enough.  We have to mobilize our 
resources toward a clear objective of being the best. Looking 
ahead to the millennium, we have an opportunity to explore new 
horizons, set new goals for our country and work together to 
reach those goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's agenda as outlined in the Speech from the 
Throne sets out clearly the actions that we will take and the 
partnerships we will forge to ensure that Canada realizes its 
potential in the new economy of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are implementing an innovative strategy built on four themes. 
The first is that of connecting Canadians.  Our goal is to make 
Canada the most connected country in the world, making sure that 
all Canadians can have access to the electronic highway and 
information economy by the year 2000. This is perhaps the single 
most important action that government can take to ensure success 
in the knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through a national strategy designed to provide access to the 
information and knowledge infrastructure we can enable 
individuals, rural communities, aboriginal communities, small and 
large businesses alike to find new opportunities for learning, 
interacting, transacting and developing their economic and social 
potential.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By connecting rural and remote communities through public access 
sites across Canada, we are giving these communities the tools to 
help further their economic and social development and make the 
most of their existing resources to tap new markets and create 
new job opportunities for their citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By connecting all of Canada's 22,000 schools, libraries and 
learning institutions, we will make life-long learning an 
affordable reality for Canadians while Canada becomes a 
laboratory for the creation of interactive, multimedia learning 
software and networks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By creating the best environment for electronic commerce, Canada 
can become a world leader in this emerging field, leading to 
increased investment in electronic networks and growth in areas 
such as electronic transactions, multimedia products and on-line 
services. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By connecting Canadians to the information highway, we will 
create a demand for digital content, which could strengthen 
Canada's cultural identity and create new economic opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By putting government services on-line, we can facilitate 
communications between government and the people like never before. 
Government services will be available to Canadians wherever they 
are 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By connecting Canadians to each other, to their institutions 
and governments and to the rest of the world, we will all better 
understand who we are and Canadians will have the tools they need 
to maximize their potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are only some of the many advantages we will enjoy when 
we link up with the new economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second theme is realizing our international potential. 
Increasingly our prosperity is dependent on making the most of 
our international opportunities.  One in three Canadian jobs 
depends on trade and every $1 billion increase in exports 
generates 8,000 new jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With team Canada we have improved our trade and investment 
performance but there is still much more that we must do to 
secure Canada's place in the global economy.  Building on the 
team Canada success, we will consult with our industrial partners 
to further broaden our trading base outward in the world.  We are 
already extending our team Canada approach to help Canadian 
businesses prepare at home to compete and win in international 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Investment Partnerships Canada, we are working with 
industry on a focused marketing campaign in priority markets to 
attract investment to Canada by multinational firms because 
investment equal jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third theme is investing in innovation and knowledge.  Last 
year 12 of Canada's top thinkers on science and technology were 
appointed to the Prime Minister's Advisory Council on Science and 
Technology.  Part of their advice was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A high level of investment, excellence in education, accelerated 
innovation through science and technology and an increased 
emphasis on the commercialization of science and technology, will 
spur job creation and generate increases in the standard of 
living for Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are taking this advice to heart. We must promote those 
knowledge intensive sectors where we are already strong, where 
the opportunity for growth and global leadership is highest, and 
where the opportunities for young Canadians are the greatest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has winning sectors, sectors on which we can build and 
grow to world leadership, for example, aerospace, environmental 
technologies, biotechnology and telecommunications and 
information technologies. Together with industry we will set 
goals and targets to improve Canada's global ranking in these and 
other sectors. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe there is enormous growth potential for 
traditional sectors such as forestry, mining and agriculture to 
innovate and adapt information technology and biotechnology to 
improve productivity, to reach new markets and to develop new 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By investing in Canada's research facilities and government and 
university laboratories we will maintain one of the best research 
and development infrastructures in the world.  We will also 
improve and expand the knowledge base that individuals and 
businesses need in order to succeed. We will see our $800 million 
investment in the Canada foundation for innovation used to 
leverage additional private and public sector investments to 
renew and expand the research infrastructure at Canadian 
universities and teaching hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the government established technology partnerships 
Canada to make fully repayable investments in innovative firms 
that are developing leading edge knowledge based technologies. We 
need to continue to use the leverage of this successful program 
to ensure that more products with high growth potential in key 
sectors reach the world marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will build on the National Research Council's highly 
respected industrial research assistance program, winner of the 
prestigious Ernest C. Manning award, to help small and medium 
size businesses to develop and commercialize new technologies. We 
will increase the participation of Canadians in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supporting innovative companies and building knowledge 
infrastucture is not enough in itself.  True competitive 
advantage in the knowledge economy is achieved only through 
developing the brains and skills of our people.  The transition 
to the new economy is not automatic.  Some Canadians will be 
better prepared than others to take advantage of these 
opportunities, and some Canadians will need help to rise to the 
challenges.  The government is committed to making a difference 
so that all Canadians can participate fully in and benefit from 
the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are among the most well educated people in the world 
but the knowledge economy both challenges us and offers 
opportunity to ensure that quality education is accessible and 
affordable to every Canadian.  The prime minister announced a key 
part of our response to this challenge last week.  The Canada 
millennium endowment fund will invest in academic excellence and 
will provide thousands of scholarships each year to help give 
Canadians access to universities and colleges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also develop new programs to help young Canadians 
acquire the experience and marketable skills to take advantage of 
the opportunities in today's job market.  We will focus 
aboriginal business investment programs on more long term 
strategic investment opportunities for all aboriginal peoples. 
This will help to develop and strong and resilient economic base 
and foster partnerships among federal, provincial and aboriginal 
governments and the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will help rural communities diversify their economies and 
capitalize on new business opportunities by supporting their 
efforts to identify and build on their strengths to acquire and 
use new technology and to strengthen small and medium size 
businesses to create new jobs for rural Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will prosper in the global knowledge based economy.  We 
will have the opportunity to enrich our lives, create jobs, promote 
prosperity and ensure a future for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look toward the future, we see a Canada in which the 
harsh reality of economic change gives way to new opportunities, a 
Canada where jobs and growth support a stronger society, a stronger 
nation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see Canadians connected to other Canadians.  We see a Canada 
where children in an Inuit community in Nunavut can interact over 
the Internet with children in a First Nations school in Ontario, 
a Canada where an electronic trade information service connects a 
Nova Scotia telecommunications business with an Alberta partner 
to bring its product to market in South America, and a Canada 
where citizens in the Saguenay use their website to connect with 
fellow citizens in Manitoba on the challenges of rebuilding a 
community.  We see a Canada where more and more Canadians can 
maximize their potential and realize their dreams.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether they live in rural Canada, in a city, on the east coast, 
on the west coast or anywhere in between, Canadians deserve a 
government that is innovative, ready to lead and ready to advance 
new efforts to secure their future in a new economy.  By 
connecting Canadians, by realizing our international potential, 
by investing in innovation and knowledge, and by increasing the 
participation of Canadians in the new economy we are acting to 
turn the promise of a new century into new opportunity for all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was interested in listening to the minister as he was speaking 
about advantages and the various things that the government is 
trying to bring into play.  With his ministry being responsible 
for the CRTC, I find it somewhat incongruous that he would be 
speaking this way.  Many of the people who try to bring new 
technology to the area of communications are thwarted time and 
time again by the CRTC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will know that there are a number of cases which 
are before the courts, some of which have been appealed directly 
to cabinet.  He will also know, as industry minister in the last 
Parliament, that during the time that cabinet sat there were 
probably in the neighbourhood of half a dozen serious decisions 
involving the CRTC which cabinet looked at, many of which were 
overturned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is his government going to do?  What is he going to do? 
What is the Minister of Canadian Heritage going to do to 
straighten out the CRTC, to get rid of the incestuous 
relationships which there appear to be between some people who 
have been in the CRTC, who are now out with companies which are 
presently applying to the CRTC or vice versa?  What will he and 
his government do to make it workable so that the CRTC will be 
able to do what it should be doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Better yet, the CRTC should be completely revised from the 
bottom up so that we can get on with the business of building 
Canada as it should be built, as the technological centre that it 
could be in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is a broad range of 
issues in the question on which we could have quite a long 
discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say first that I do not share the hon. member's pessimism 
about the state of the CRTC as it currently exists.  In fact, we 
are a party to the World Trade Organization's recent agreement on 
telecommunications.  I will advise the member that there will be 
a bill coming to the House shortly to implement our obligations 
under the WTO with respect to the telecommunications agreement. 
Perhaps we can have some good debate at that time on some of 
these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC, as an independent body with a transparent process, 
separate from the political process, is a model which we could 
only wish all of our trading partners had fully implemented.  He 
will know that many Canadian companies find themselves thwarted 
in their attempts to obtain licensing in other countries by a 
process which is neither transparent nor subject to any appeal or 
judicial review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will know that I have participated in giving 
direction to the CRTC in certain cases and in changing its 
decisions where I had the jurisdiction to do so. In Canada it is 
still a better process than that which exists, I would say, in 
virtually every other developed country. I am not quite as 
pessimistic as he. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have certainly experienced quite a few difficulties 
over a period of time. We have tried very hard to make wise 
appointments to the CRTC. Over the last year and a half we have 
seen in my view the effect of that.  We will always have unhappy 
participants before the CRTC because somebody wins and somebody 
loses.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to him that really key to the process is that we have 
a system in which the decisions are made by an independent body 
whose decisions are subject to judicial review and policy appeal 
to cabinet.  It is not done behind closed doors by politicians, 
and I think that is a desirable way to adjudicate these issues. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
through you I would like to point out right off that the Minister 
of Industry recently aroused my sympathy and that of a number of my 
colleagues when he said the monarchy should be abolished.  I 
congratulate him because he was involved in the same struggle as 
that fought by our forebears.  He expressed his pride in being a 
member of the Canadian people.  We support his cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask him to arouse our sympathy a little more.  I have 
two questions for him. 
First, could he say he also believes in the existence of a Quebec 
people.  Second, could he say this people has the right to be free, 
as he put it so well in the case of the Canadian people being free 
of the monarchy?  The Quebec people therefore have the right to be 
free of the tutelage of a majority that is not of its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Hon. John Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say to the hon. member 
that, as industry minister, I had the opportunity to travel 
around the world; I have seen for myself that, as far as the 
quality of products, services or technology is concerned, 
Canadian entrepreneurs and businesses are recognized all over the 
world.  The maple leaf is a well-known trademark.  It is a great 
asset in international trade in every part of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why a country like Canada which has 
benefited so much from its diversity of cultures and languages 
would even discuss a change which could weaken the partners of a 
country that is such a global success story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will add that, in the areas we are trying to help, that is to say 
international trade and technology, a third company like Bombardier 
would benefit Quebec far more than a third referendum. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the minister's outline this morning on the 
strength of our economy and the position that we are in to take 
full advantage of the opportunities of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think he embellishes the picture.  Shining through 
all of this is the fact that 50 cents of every dollar that 
Canadians earn goes to taxes in one form or another.  This 
perhaps has contributed to the fact that the report is that one 
child in every five is living in poverty, that we have an 
aboriginal lady who has to live in a van in Alberta on one of the 
richest reserves in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister comment with regard to his glowing picture of 
the position that our economy is in and our society is in with 
regard to these particular issues?  There are other issues but I 
see I do not have time to touch on them.  Could the minister 
address those two issues, the rate of child poverty in this 
country and the fact that we have aboriginal people living in 
worse than third world conditions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member 
puts his finger on two of the big problems that we have to 
address in Canada.  No one would seek to describe a picture in 
which everything is perfect or all the work is done. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that in relative terms compared to anywhere else in the 
world, where would the hon. member prefer to live?  Where are the 
problems more manageable than they are in Canada at a time when 
we have our economic fundamentals finally improved to the point 
of being the best in 35 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not disagree with him that the mountain of debt which 
was accumulated over 20 years is one of the causes of the 
problems that he has identified.  It is the cause of the level of 
taxation which he knows is still lower in Canada than in most 
other developed countries other than the United States.  But at 
the same time, what we know and what the theme of the remarks was 
meant to point out is that we are at a point in time where the 
global economy is changing.  It is changing for Canada and for 
all other nations of the world.  We are positioned to not only 
succeed but to succeed beyond the possibility for anybody else to 
succeed. Let us seize that opportunity.  It will undoubtedly hold 
the key to reducing child poverty and aboriginal isolation in 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I intend to share my 
time with my colleague, the hon. member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, in congratulating you and the other Speakers, I 
want to thank first the voters of Palliser for the confidence 
that they extended to me on June 2.  Without offending the Bloc 
members, it was a unique experience to enter the House of Commons 
for the first time a week ago today.  It is an honour not only to 
represent them but also to work hard on their behalf over the 
life of this 36th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the members on the opposite side I would like to take a few 
minutes to explain the riding of Palliser, which is in south 
central Saskatchewan. Palliser is a riding that is centred around 
the city of Moose Jaw and includes small towns, farm lands, 
ranches as well as the southwest quadrant of Regina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was ever a riding that the Liberal Party should have 
won on June 2 in the province of Saskatchewan, surely it was the 
riding of Palliser.  Since the Saskatchewan voters are at least 
as sophisticated as those in the rest of the country, I want to 
take a few minutes to explain why it did not win in Palliser. 
Some of the answers are contained in what is and is not in the 
throne speech of last Tuesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is for example nothing on national transportation and only 
the barest of references to agriculture.  On social policies 
there is a very thin veneer but almost without any substance to 
it. This is particularly surprising especially because the 
government has 65 percent of its members from one province.  I would 
have thought the government would have recognized this deficiency 
and have begun to address it in the initial throne speech but 
that was not to be. The government quickly needs to get out of 
the Quebec City to Windsor corridor so it can hear from the 
people in the rest of the country and begin to address their 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of transportation it is ironic to have heard in the 
last week so many references to Sir John A. Macdonald and his 
vision for building a new country and note there was absolutely 
no reference in the throne speech to the matter of 
transportation. On that point I would like to read a part of a 
letter which came to me from a Saskatchewan person following the 
throne speech: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one item that intrigues me about the Speech from the Throne 
was the fact that 130 years ago the leaders of this country saw 
the necessity of a national transportation link. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that transportation was entirely ignored in the throne 
speech would indicate to me that instead of preparing for the 
21st century the Liberals aren't even up to speed with 19th 
century leaders. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see this through the dismantling of so much of our 
transportation system, whether it is the privatization of air and 
sea ports, the privatization of the CNR, the abandoning of branch 
lines in western Canada or the doubling of freight rates in the 
post Crow era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also no commitment to a national highway system despite 
the fact that this government enjoys $5 billion per annum from 
gasoline taxes.  Canada is the only OECD country which does not 
have a national highway system.  That makes it harder for our 
companies and our workers to compete in the global market.

good transportation is absolutely essential to move our products 
to port, to create and retain satisfied customers and to feed a 
hungry world.  I would have thought that in all the talk about 
partnerships in last week's throne speech, this is one way to 
work with the provinces and territories to develop a true 
national transportation policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of agriculture, it is one of Canada's best export 
earners.  Here again a national strategy is required. We need to 
build for the future through trade expansion and value added 
products.  At the same time we note that R and D in agriculture 
has been cut by billions of dollars in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to sincerely extend best wishes to the new minister of 
agriculture who was here a little bit earlier and his elevation 
to cabinet.  Our hope is that he will work with the opposition 
parties to help farmers and rural Canadians across the country. 
On a personal note may I say that I know the area of the country 
that the minister comes from and I am sure he will be 
conscientious of working with all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn quickly to the social safety net and particularly 
the subject of intergenerational transfers and what it has meant 
in the past to be a Canadian.  It was an unwritten agreement 
which stated “as a young person let me pay a reasonable tuition 
fee and I will help you in your retirement”.  Certainly that was 
there when I was at university but now the social safety net is 
being torn apart.  It began under the Tories and has been 
continued by the Liberals.  The result is that tuition fees are 
going through the roof and nobody in their right mind is going to 
come out of university with a $35,000 or $40,000 bill for his or 
her education and say “Sure, I will pay that off and then I will 
be glad to help you with your pension”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successive governments have tinkered and cut social programs 
under the rubric of a user pay mentality with the result that 
they are breaking social contracts between generations.  We can 
all cite examples, the CHST, employment insurance, CPP, and that 
contradiction in terms called the seniors benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going backwards in our quest for social justice and 
fairness.  This regression is aided and abetted by the false 
start program of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week there were lots of tributes paid to Stanley Knowles, 
the late member of Parliament for Winnipeg North Centre.  If 
Stanley had been around he would probably have had another 
arrowroot biscuit and a cup of tea in quiet celebration of the 
fact.  We could honour his memory better by introducing 
progressive changes like affordable tuition, a decent pension 
plan and a fair and equitable tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley's lifelong friend Tommy Douglas said it very well a 
number of years ago, “The measure of a nation's greatness does 
not lie in its conquests, its GNP, its gold reserves or its 
skyscrapers.  The real measure is what it does for the least 
fortunate and the opportunities it provides for its youth to lead 
useful and meaningful lives”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally let me try to encourage the government House leader and 
the members opposite to do the job that all of us were elected to 
do in this Parliament.  Regardless of our political affiliations, 
we are all here to represent our constituencies to the very best 
of our abilities.  I would say to the government House leader and 
the government, do not frustrate but rather ensure that standing 
and select committees have sufficient powers and are vested with 
sufficient authority to carry out the work ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have five recognized parties in the House and that means we 
require a mature and modern approach to deal with it.  It is the 
first time that we have ever had five parties.  If the government 
follows that advice, it will be very good for this 36th 
Parliament, it will be good for Canadians and it will be good for 
the future of parliamentary democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by moving our party's subamendment in this throne 
speech debate.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK9">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment be modified by adding after the words 
“legislative program that”, the following:  “in failing to set 
targets and timetables to reduce unemployment and in failing to 
strengthen national programs such as medicare which promote the 
equality of all Canadians and the unity of the country is an 
affront to fundamental Canadian values”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to know if the New Democratic Party agrees that this 
government should send a team Canada group into the Atlantic 
region so that there will be a better understanding of the needs 
of our people in the Atlantic region, and find a way to create 
the jobs for all those mature people who are out of work, the 
moms and dads who want to work, who want to feed their families 
and pay for the education of their children and get back their 
dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if they agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think this caucus 
would oppose that in any way.  I would also want to acknowledge 
the fact that the people from that region sent a number of 
opposition members, including eight from this caucus, to Ottawa 
to voice their concerns about what was not happening in that part 
of the world. I appreciate that there is a reasonable delegation 
from the member's party also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point that I was trying to make at the outset was that I 
would hope this government would be listening to people who live 
beyond the Quebec City-Windsor corridor and reaching out so that 
we can move this country ahead into the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does his Party recognize the existence of a Quebec people? 
I would really like him to give us a clear answer because this 
question is closely linked to the Speech from the Throne, when it comes 
to national unity and the unique character of Quebec society. We in 
Quebec believe this is not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even some federalist Liberal organizers say it is an empty shell.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to take part in this debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I thank the people of Beauséjour—Petitcodiac for electing 
me to represent them.  It is certainly a great honour. I want to 
talk a bit about the throne speech and what was in it for the 
people of Beauséjour—Petitcodiac. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here today as a member of Parliament representing people 
who felt it was time to put a stop to the painful cuts caused by 
the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was time to elect someone they called one of their own:  one 
who knows what having to borrow money for post-secondary 
education is; one who knows what poverty is; one who knows what 
having to look for a job means; one who knows what it is to be a 
single mom; one who knows what fishing lobster is all about; one 
who knows what wood cutters do; one who knows how people survive 
on social assistance because some of them are my friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe some time we should stop and think about how they live. 
Many of my friends on social assistance do not know what it is to 
have gifts under the tree at Christmastime.  Many of us here have 
never been in that situation.  Many of my friends do not know how 
they will feed their children or where they will be tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some know what it is like not to wonder if they will be able to 
feed their children or be able to pay the $100 registration fee 
for a six year old to join hockey.  Some know what it is like to 
live in shelters for battered women.  There are many of us out 
there and no facilities to accommodate the need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some know what impact sun and rain has on tourism in the 
Atlantic.  Does everyone understand the impact a rainy summer on 
the Atlantic region when the tourists do not come?  Not only does 
it affect workers.  It also affects businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one who knows the impact of government cuts on small and 
medium size business.  When people do not have money to spend 
businesses do not sell.  I am one who knows what it is to be a 
seasonal worker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to stand before the House on behalf of the people of 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac and on behalf of seasonal workers. 
Seasonal work is important in Atlantic Canada but misunderstood 
by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers have been called every name in the book by the 
Liberal government, from being dependent on the UI system to 
being lazy and drunk in taverns and not wanting to look for work. 
This is from the ex MP for Beauséjour, the prime minister 
himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting when we think about it that they are the same 
so-called lazy people he so proudly came to beg for support to 
get his one way ticket to Ottawa.  I take part of the blame for 
his being prime minister; the people of Beauséjour elected him 
and gave him that opportunity. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may be wondering today what the riding of 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac got from the Prime Minister in return for 
electing someone who is not from the area. It gives me great 
pleasure to tell you all about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we got cuts in health care, which have resulted in an 
unacceptable situation for our seniors. We all heard about the two 
employees who spoke up against the unacceptable situation in nursing 
homes caused by the cuts in transfer payments to the provinces. I must 
denounce the disciplinary measures taken by the management of the 
Providence home in Shediac against two employees who tried to pressure 
the federal and provincial ministers into putting more money in health 
care so that they could properly care for our seniors. 
These are the people who fought for our country during the Second World 
War. The present government shows absolutely no respect for our senior 
citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also saw cuts in unemployment insurance, now called employment 
insurance, a name I do not agree with at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the Prime Minister had promised during the 1991 
election campaign to shorten the qualifying period, today we find 
ourselves with a system that no longer meets the needs of the 
unemployed. People call us in our riding offices crying and saying their 
employment insurance benefits have run out and their seasonal work is 
not due to start for another two or three months. There are also people 
who do not qualify at all for employment insurance, such as part time 
workers in hospitals, schools, plants, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They even closed employment centres like the one in Bouctouche. 
Instead of helping rural communities overcome the lack of jobs, the 
federal government is taking away from the unemployed the necessary 
tools that could help them rejoin the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also cut the staff of other employment centres, like the ones 
in Shediac, Sackville and Richibuctou, at a time when there is a surplus 
in the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cutting jobs in our rural communities does not only translates into 
lost services. It has a disastrous economic impact on these communities 
because these jobs are the only ones that pay reasonably well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must start trying to understand the situation in which rural 
communities find themselves. In our region, jobs are not found on every 
street corner. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see what Sackville received from the Liberals.  We no 
longer have an animal pathology lab.  Approximately 60 employees 
lost their jobs at Maritime Atlantic.  The armouries is on the 
way out.  Can we imagine that in a town of 5,400 residents 
Sackville is fighting to keep its post office open?  After going 
door to door during the campaign I call Albert County the 
forgotten land. It has been absolutely ignored in every way 
imaginable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget jobs, jobs, jobs.  The Liberal government 
forgot a word in its promise of jobs, jobs, jobs, and that word 
is cut.  The Liberals meant job cuts, 45,000 federal jobs.  Not 
only were the jobs gone but the service with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In New Brunswick we are getting job creation at $6.25 an hour. 
Has anyone calculated how much money a person makes at $6.25 an 
hour for 35 hours a week and how much that person is paying for 
child care?  I have talked to those people.  I have had single 
mothers around me crying because they just do not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $6.25 an hour jobs are for a maximum of 26 weeks so they can 
go back on EI.  It is a vicious circle.  They end up poorer in 
the end than when they started working.  Now the Liberals are 
wondering why there are so many poor families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I look across the floor I can see who is responsible for the 
increase in poverty.  It is the Liberal government.  While it 
caters to the bank, families are suffering.  This is not 
acceptable.  Liberals should be ashamed.  They should be setting 
targets for the reduction of unemployment just as they have set 
targets for deficit reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the GST.  We are rid of the GST in New Brunswick. 
We have the HST instead.  We now pay 15 per cent tax on 
children's clothing, electricity, heating, and it goes on and on. 
Again it attacks low income families.  When will it stop?  The 
young people graduating from high school have lost all hope in 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the cuts came with an extremely high price.  Poverty has 
increased.  Businesses are closing.  People are losing their 
jobs.  Families cannot take that stress any longer.  Many 
families depend on the fishing industry as a way of life.  The 
failures of past and present government policies have driven them 
to complete despair and destroyed their proud and historical way 
of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech mentioned a deep concern for aboriginal 
issues. If the government were so concerned about the first 
nations, why is the Big Cove Reserve suicide situation not 
recognized as a crisis?  Two more young first nations people have 
died over the last three months since the help line was cut due 
to insufficient funding.  Unfortunately there was nothing in the 
throne speech to give hope to the elderly, the students, the 
sick, the unemployed and the small and medium businesses of 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac.  Let us not forget we got one thing:  we 
got a senator.

abuse, but if the Liberals starve a million children it is called

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to begin by thanking the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac 
for her excellent speech.  It was her maiden speech in the House of 
Commons and I congratulate her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac a few years back, when 
the Standing Committee on Finance was travelling across the country. 
She always represented the most disadvantaged members of society with 
dignity and in her speech today she is once again standing up for those 
who do not have a voice in this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member for Beauséjour-Petitcodiac is not 
about her undeniable social commitment, but about the existence 
of a Quebec people in Canada.  Does the member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac share the point of view of her colleague, 
who just replied that the New Democratic Party had voted against 
the amendment proposed by the Bloc Quebecois—that the existence 
of the people of Quebec be recognized—and that it had nothing 
else to say, given the vote?  Does the member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, in her great wisdom and as an Acadian 
representative, share her colleague's opinion, or does she 
recognize the existence of a Quebec people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true that we voted against 
the motion because we have a great belief in national programs.  But we 
most certainly recognize Quebec as a unique people.  You have your 
language and culture, in your country, as do we Acadians.  But that does 
not mean that we want to drop our national programs.  That is why I 
believe strongly that we should keep our country together. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I also add 
my congratulations to the NDP member on her first speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very short and succinct question to ask.  She mentioned 
in her speech the little phrase “paying off the deficit”.  That 
is a total misnomer.  There is no such thing as paying off the 
deficit.  The deficit is an amount of money that one borrows.  At 
best one can reduce the amount that one is borrowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increased spending promoted by the member, and I presume her 
party, would require additional borrowing.  Thereby more and more 
taxpayers' dollars would be sent to the financial organizations 
of the world instead of financing and paying for needed social 
programs.  There is a tremendous contradiction in the NDP 
platform.  The more borrowed money we spend on social programs, 
in the long run the more money we send to financial institutions 
and deprive it from being available for social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess the member is 
not understanding that we have a problem and that is who pays 
that deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said it is the unemployed.  It is the sick.  It is the 
elderly. Did any banks pay on that deficit?  Did any of the very 
wealthy pay on that deficit?  He should check with the people who 
cannot feed their children any more.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member should understand is who is suffering today 
because of deficit reduction.  We have no problem with deficit 
reduction, but why should everyone not pay their fair share?  We 
have not seen that from the Liberal government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I reiterate 
that we have not paid off the deficit because that is a physical 
impossibility.  The deficit is the amount of money which is being 
borrowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is confusing it with the reference to debt.  The fact 
is as long as there is any deficit the debt will increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, try to explain that to a 
mother who cannot feed her children or to the person who just 
lost his or her job.  Believe me, at this point no one is worried 
about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to address my colleagues in the highest forum in our 
country and in so doing I acknowledge with considerable humility 
the great honour and privilege which has been bestowed on me by 
the people of Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate you on your 
appointment and offer you my best wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister pointed out in his speech in reply to the 
Speech from the Throne, this Parliament will be the last one of this 
century and the first one of the new millennium. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, the opportunity to participate in this Parliament is an 
historic occasion.  I will spare no effort to meet the challenges 
it will present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here today by the grace of God, by the support of my 
husband and family, and the commitment and hard work of many 
volunteers and friends.  I am most grateful to them, as I am to 
all the citizens of Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford for their trust and 
their support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is balanced, with the city of Barrie to the north, 
Bradford West Gwillimburyberry to the south and the towns and 
farms of Innisfil in between. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The northern portion of Barrie and Innisfil have not sent a 
Liberal member to Parliament since Duncan F. McCuaig, the father 
of our current mayor in Barrie, Janice Laking.  He represented 
the riding from 1935 to 1945.  It is an honour and a great 
privilege to bring this part of Ontario back to the Liberal fold 
after some 52 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The city of Barrie is an exciting phenomena of explosive growth, 
combined with a superb geographical location that affords its 
citizens an enviable quality of life.  It is situated on the 
shores of Lake Simcoe and enjoys all the amenities that top 
recreational facilities and dynamic economic growth provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While its early settlers hailed mainly from Britain and northern 
Europe, including such historic figures as Lord John Graves 
Simcoe and the legendary Sam Steele of the Northwest Mounted 
Police, Barrie now joins other cities in reflecting the 
multicultural diversity of Canada today. Indeed, one of the 
country's fastest growing cities, Barrie will double its 
population by the year 2001, largely due to many of Toronto's 
immigrant families moving north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The workforce in Barrie is well educated, highly skilled and 
diversified.  The city has a strong automotive manufacturing 
sector, plastics manufacturing and a strong industrial automation 
sector. The city is well represented internationally by companies 
like Albarrie, Yachiyo, Canplas and Alloy Wheels.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bradford West Gwillimbury in the south of my riding has a 
population of 17,000 and has outpaced Barrie in developing a 
strong, multicultural mosaic.  The municipality is home to 450 
businesses and is impacted greatly by the Holland Marsh, the 
heart of Canada's vegetable industry, the salad bowl of Ontario. 
Over 90 percent of the produce of the Marsh is processed and 
packaged in Bradford West Gwillimbury where the agri-industry is 
a major contributor to the local economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The town of Innisfil is a mixed urban-rural community in south 
Simcoe.  Last year the celebration of Yonge Street as 200 years 
old held special significance for Innisfil as much of its history 
was impacted by the development of what was known as 
Penetanguishene Road and later Yonge Street.  This was the route

develop their farms.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is then with great pride that I come to Ottawa to represent 
this diverse yet typically Canadian part of Ontario.  The 
citizens of Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford supported my election to the 
House of Commons because they strongly endorsed the government's 
track record on reducing the deficit and moving the country into 
the requisite of fiscal responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everywhere I went during the June election I was told that the 
pain had been real but worthwhile since the strategy of achieving 
a balanced budget had been successful.  This was what my 
constituents had accepted as a very real priority.  I was told by 
many that to fail to continue along the road to debt reduction 
following the elimination of the deficit would be very erroneous 
indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The businesses in my riding count heavily on the government to 
stay the course and provide the stability that allows for 
reinvestment in the economy that will contribute in the long run 
to the long term creation of jobs.  While I agree with that plan, 
I also believe it is very much incumbent on business, large and 
small, to partner with us in the creation of these jobs by 
providing internships, providing youth with the skills and 
mentoring that gives them the experience and life skills to help 
them obtain gainful employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth and adult unemployment are not the responsibility of 
governments alone.  They are the responsibility as well of 
business and industry that are able to grow and prosper in an 
economy turned around by the courage of this Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford also believe that the 
reinforcement of our social programs is a major goal for the 
government and it is one that I heartily endorse.  The delivery 
of the Canada Health Act is vital.  Addressing the causes and 
cures of child poverty are also vital. The willingness and 
flexibility to work with the provincial governments as our 
partners to achieve these goals is very much a part of the 
government's approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reconcile the dilemma that the continued support in Quebec 
for sovereignty, however diminished as the polls suggest, is a 
personal goal and one that contributed greatly to my decision to 
run for Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new member of Parliament, the walls of my office are bare 
except for one framed poster I brought with me.  The poster reads 
“If you want peace, work for justice”—“si on veut la paix, il 
faut travailler pour la justice”.  It is an activist slogan but 
then we are all activists or we would not be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed we want peace, the peace that results from a resolution 
to the current dilemma that some Quebecois are unconvinced that 
their future is best realized within the framework of the 
Canadian Confederation.

Liberal government and that is why I am a member of that government.

Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford. In 1994, the then leader of the opposition 
said, in a speech to the Association canadienne-française de l'Ontario, 
that the Bloc Quebecois was the voice of francophones outside Quebec in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, in an interview with the daily <I>Le Droit</I>, the Bloc 
Quebecois critic on official languages said that the Bloc would always 
defend francophones outside Quebec. This is why I am very surprised by 
the events that took place in recent days. I am surprised that the Bloc 
Quebecois did not make mention of its support for francophone and 
Acadian communities in its action plan for the year 2000, which was 
tabled last week— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

others, of saving this great country. This is fine rhetoric, but nothing 
concrete is ever done. Still, Quebecers are patient as they approach the 
new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member, who is a government member, told us she shares our 
history. If, indeed, she knows Quebec's history—not the one told in 
Ontario schools, but Quebec's true history—if she knows about the 
traditional claims made by Quebec premiers since the fifties, will she 
tell this House whether or not her government does recognize the 
existence of the people of Quebec?

from my friend on the opposite side of the House.  I listened 
carefully and found it a little meandering.  I hope to conclude 
that I do not have to defend people, other than the government, 
in their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Mr. Harris may have made that comment I have not heard 
it.  I believe that Mr. Harris has participated in Calgary with 
other premiers who have moved forward in their attempts to 
achieve the just resolution which I spoke of earlier in 
recognizing a uniqueness in the province of Quebec and a 
uniqueness in its society.  They have been joined by our 
government in moving forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great optimism and I believe there has been a variety of 
versions of history frequently dependent on the author.  We have 
to reach across those perhaps slanted views. It is difficult 
today to get across the media of each language and speak with one 
another, but we have this forum to come together and resolve 
perhaps what has not yet been resolved.  In this Parliament over 
the next few years we will resolve it.

Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford for sharing her time this morning and I 
would like to thank my constituents for re-electing me to serve 
another term in the 36th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1929 I was born in the Dominican Republic to British parents. 
After a short return to England my parents emigrated with our 
small family to Canada.  Like millions of other immigrants who 
have built our great country, my parents came to Canada in search 
of a better life for themselves and their children.  They watched 
as my brother became a successful lawyer in Vancouver, while I 
spent my career in education in Oxford Country, retired and was 
first elected to the House in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to put into words my feelings as I was recently 
sworn in, for the second time, as a member of this esteemed 
Chamber. In addition to constituents, present at the ceremony was 
my father, age 94, who resides in a retirement home here in 
Ottawa.  No matter how old we get we each want to gain the 
approval of our parents.  My presence here as the member of 
Parliament for Oxford is an incredible honour for me but it has 
made my father, who came to this country so many years before 
with a wife an two young sons in tow, a very proud man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Family ties are precious things, whether it be in our families 
at home where parents and children work together for the common 
good or in our Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne talks of building a stronger Canada 
for all Canadians.  It states that the overriding goal of our 
government is to strengthen and unite this country by joining in 
the common purpose of keeping Canada one of the best places in 
the world in which to live.  I think this is a goal of most of 
here in the House on both sides.  While we may disagree on the 
process we all want to effect change that will improve the lives 
of all Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my first term as the member of Parliament for Oxford I asked 
myself what I could do to assist in unifying our nation.  To me 
one of our biggest problems is a lack of understanding between 
various regions of our country.  In other words, it seems that 
the “two solitudes” of Hugh McLellen are still evident.  Our 
young people, the next generation of Canadian leaders, need to 
increase their knowledge of the different regions of Canada. This 
is especially true of our linguistic and cultural differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt that we could make a difference if our young people were 
given an opportunity to spend some time in Quebec improving their 
French and getting to know the people of Quebec.  I approached 
the member for Brome—Missisquoi about beginning a student 
exchange in which five students from my riding of Oxford would 
spend their summer in Magog, Quebec in his riding, and Oxford 
would host five students in return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to say that after two summer exchanges with the 
assistance of the Canada employment centres in both ridings, VIA 
Rail and Heritage Canada, this project can be termed a success. 
In fact, the member for Brome—Missisquoi took the initiative to 
organize exchanges between ridings from across Canada and towns 
and villages in his riding. Students from all regions of the 
country were able to visit Quebec, while Quebec students were 
able to increase their awareness of Canada outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past summer the Department of Canadian Heritage was more 
heavily involved and over 200 students were able to take part in 
similar exchanges between Quebec and the rest of the country.  It 
is my hope that young Canadians will be able to benefit from this 
type of program for many years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this program alone solve our unity problems?  No, it will 
not, but it can increase the understanding Canadians have for 
each other and work together with other initiatives at local, 
provincial and national levels to keep our country united.  As 
the throne speech stated, we would all be forever diminished, 
forever changed, should we fail to maintain the example Canada 
provides to the world.  Our future as a country is too precious 
for us to risk losing it through misunderstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was relieved to hear that the provincial premiers have agreed 
on certain principles to recognize the uniqueness of Quebec.  I 
point out to my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois that in English, 
unique and distinct are synonyms.  It is a relief also to hear 
that the people of Quebec have shown in most recent polls they 
would rather accept the declaration worked out in Calgary than 
separate. It is now incumbent on us to work together as a 
Canadian family to build a better and stronger Canada for our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How else can the federal government bring Canadians together? It 
can ensure that future generations are not burdened by 
overzealous spending by our generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have, of course, seen the Liberal government take firm action 
to ensure that the federal government spends within its means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sound economic management and the best federal finance minister 
in Canadian history are restoring balance to the nation's 
finances.  In the very near future the government of Canada will 
not have to deal with a crushing deficit. With a common sense of 
purpose we as legislators can begin the process of paying off the 
national debt while making strategic investments in our children 
and our youth, our health, our communities and our knowledge and 
creativity.  We must ensure that all Canadians can benefit from 
this economic success.  We must not leave anyone behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government must give all Canadians access to the tools of 
economic growth, as the Minister of Industry said earlier this 
morning in the House. We cannot allow rural regions of the 
country to suffer from a lack of technology while urban regions 
prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member of Parliament for a rural country in southwestern 
Ontario, I have told my constituents that I will strive to ensure 
that the rural way of life is protected and that they will 
continue to have access to the tools they need to be competitive 
in this global economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community access program, CAP, is connecting rural areas in 
this country to the information superhighway.  By putting 
Internet access points in rural communities we are giving rural 
citizens the same opportunities to access information and 
resources that urban Canadians enjoy.  We are also giving our 
students in places like Knowlton, Otterville or Cambridge Bay 
the same advantages provided by the computer age as students who 
may be studying in Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Oxford are taking full advantage of the CAP 
program.  When Industry Canada made its first round of approvals 
for this program, 15 of the 271 winning bids across Canada were 
in Oxford County.  To understand the magnitude of this we must 
consider that the approvals within Oxford represented nearly 25 
percent of the total approvals within the province of Ontario. 
This success is a testament to the commitment of Oxford's 
citizens to take advantage of the programs that can benefit them 
as we prepare to enter the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also pledged to my constituents that I will fight for a 
strong, influential department of agriculture.  Canadian farmers 
need to know that their interests are being considered when 
decisions are being made by the federal government.  I am 
confident that our new minister of agriculture from Ontario will 
serve Canadian agriculture with the same level of distinction as 
did his predecessor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oxford County has been my home for over 40 years.  It is where I 
worked as a teacher, principal and superintendent of education. 
It is where I helped raise a family and where my heart is. You 
cannot visit Oxford without being struck by the beauty of its 
farmland and the generous hospitality of its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was re-elected this past June 2, I was mindful of the 
responsibility that the people of Oxford had once again given me. 
Each day I serve on Parliament Hill and in this magnificent 
Chamber I seek to ensure that their voices are heard, that their 
views are known and that their values are represented.  The 
people of Oxford have sent me here as their representative, a 
responsibility I do not take lightly.  I will do my best to 
ensure their trust in me has been well placed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our work in this place over the next four years will be 
difficult.  At times tempers will flare but we must always 
remember that together we are representatives of the Canadian 
family. Canadians, regardless of their political persuasion, want 
us to work constructively and co-operatively to solve the 
problems of our nation.  Let us get on with the business at hand 
so that we can enter the 21st century confident and united.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened with great interest to my colleague, the hon. member for 
Oxford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of his speech was about the Calgary proposal and national 
unity. Members will recall that, when Canadians and Quebecers were asked 
to vote on the Charlottetown accord in 1992, Quebecers rejected the 
accord as clearly not enough, while the rest of Canada rejected it 
because, in their estimation, it was giving far too much to the people 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this morning, it was reported in <I>Le Journal de Montréal</I>, <I>Le 
Journal de Québec</I> and <I>The Globe and Mail</I> that a poll by Léger & Léger 
indicated that 45 percent of Quebecers said the Calgary proposal was clearly 
not enough, while another 35 percent could live with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, this morning's press summary shows that there are already 
people in English Canada who are openly saying that too much is being 
offered in the Calgary proposal.

reached? English Canada will say it is far too much. French 
Canada, Quebec will say it is clearly not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again this past weekend—and I will conclude on that—former 
Liberal Party leader Claude Ryan raised serious doubts. André Tremblay, 
who was former premier Bourassa's adviser for several years, said there 
was too little in there to say it was not enough. There is also Senator 
Rivest, who was also an adviser to Robert Bourassa, who said that the 
Quebec Liberal Party should distance itself from its friends in the 
Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member for Oxford tell us, as the representative of 
the views of the people of Oxford, whether his constituents feel that 
what was offered to Quebec in the Calgary declaration was enough or not? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments 
and the question from my colleague from Frontenac—Mégantic whom 
I worked with for some years on the environment committee in the 
last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simplification and oversimplification are things we have to 
guard against.  I am quite aware of the results of the Léger 
poll.  I think it shows some way to the future that my hon. 
friend has ignored.  It said that 44.4% of the people who 
responded said the two phrases are equivalent.  He is quite 
right.  About one-third of those who would vote yes for 
separation thought they were equivalent, whereas 55% of 
those who would vote no said they were equivalent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to continue to work toward a solution, a compromise, 
something that will work in this country.  I supported it as a 
member of the yes committee in the last attempt in Oxford county. 
It was not overwhelmingly defeated by everyone outside Quebec. It 
was a very narrow defeat.  People can change.  People learn. 
People develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I would encourage the hon. member not to take it as 
the final word.  That is what we are here to do, to work toward a 
solution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to 
share my time.  I will be splitting my time with the hon. member 
for Burin—St. George's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on your 
position as Acting Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great pleasure that I join in the debate on the Speech 
from the Throne, representing my electorate of Markham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe and I am sure many members of this House will agree 
that the government's plan is an attempt to move forward to the 
past. This government through the 29 spending proposals outlined 
last Tuesday is seeking to take Canada back 20 some years to the 
period of tax and spend Liberalism, a time of ballooning 
deficits, the Trudeau years, a time our current Prime Minister 
remembers with great fondness.  Why then is this government 
willing to throw away all the sacrifices made to eliminate the 
deficit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a free market system like Canada, the private sector has 
always operated under budget constraints.  It is a fact of life, 
a reality that forces companies to make tough choices, choices 
that are both efficient and effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1984 the federal government accepted budget constraints 
and in turn made tough choices, choices that have led us to the 
other end of the deficit tunnel.  Budget constraints force us as 
a nation to set priorities and find efficiencies. This is clearly 
difficult for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The continued effort however has been that our nation is moving 
from intrusive big government to one that supports individual 
aspirations of our citizens. Today we see provinces like Ontario 
having to make similar tough choices in the face of intense 
budget constraints, choices affecting health care and education, 
tough but necessary choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech of last week says to Canadians that the future 
will mean new spending, new programs and by that, sabotaging what 
we have been doing for over a decade. 
By telling Canadians that the federal government no longer has to 
make tough decisions, we risk going back to the welfare state 
where entrepreneurs who brought about innovation will become 
lobbyists in search of government goodies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that in a world of inflation, individuals find it 
profitable to enter financial professions that benefit from 
inflation rather than technological and scientific ones that 
promote growth.  Why then would the government encourage the 
practice of making new promises of dispensing taxpayers' dollars 
which gives an incentive for individuals and companies to invest 
in seeking those dollars rather than in technological innovation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all intents and purposes we have achieved a national 
consensus on the need to rethink the role of government, to set 
priorities in support of economic growth in employment through 
innovation.  The Speech from the Throne threatens this consensus 
and risks all that has been achieved.  We cannot allow the 
government to go back to the tax and spend seventies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks a lot about the new economy but understands 
little of it.  The new economy is about innovation which in turn 
is dependent on a stock of highly skilled workers, workers who 
are as mobile as the companies in which they operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we encourage these domestic and foreign workers to choose 
Canada?  With attributes such as low taxes, quality education and 
health care and a safe and clean environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to research economic theory to know that broadly 
based rather than targeted government programs provide the bigger 
bang for the buck.  This is common sense yet it escapes the 
thinking of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that taxes are too high in this country.  While progress 
has been made in lowering the deficit, it has come at the expense 
of jobs through higher taxes.  Since 1993 this government has 
increased taxes no less than 40 times:  12 hikes in the 1994 
budget, 11 hikes in the 1995 budget, 10 in the 1996 budget and 
more in the budget of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The widening tax gap between Canada and the U.S. continues to 
damage our standard of living.  Taxes in Canada now account for 
almost 40 percent of GDP.  The outlook is not encouraging given the CPP 
hikes proposed by the government without corresponding cuts in EI 
premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, the proposed CPP premiums will hit 
self-employed workers hardest, those workers of the new economy, 
yet will do nothing to address the unfounded liability facing 
younger generations. Together the CPP and EI premiums will 
reduce, not create jobs in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI account is expected to reach $16 billion this fiscal 
year.  This is far from the $3 billion to $5 billion EI surplus 
the Minister of Finance talked about in 1995.  To put this in 
perspective, working Canadians will have contributed over 
$110,000 to the EI surplus during the short 10 minutes it takes 
me to debate the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To justify the current surplus the Minister of Finance must be 
forecasting future unemployment in the 10 percent to 15 percent range, 
requiring a recession of immense proportion.  The reality however 
is that the most pervasive tax, the tax on jobs, has less to do 
with being prudent and more to do with eliminating the deficit by 
taxing jobs directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now as we approach the other end of the deficit tunnel, this 
government chooses to continue to forgo jobs and tax jobs at a 
rate of $2.80 per $100 of insurable earnings, nearly 30% higher 
than necessary.  Members should ask how much more employment is 
this government willing to forgo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mandate holds little hope for tax relief.  Furthermore only 
the party to which I belong is calling for immediate tax cuts. 
Now unshackled by deficit, the Liberals talk of new spending 
while other parties speak of debt reduction before tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the other hand choose to speak about priorities.  By 
legislating balanced budgets, by holding the line on spending, by 
directing surplus to tax cuts, the debt will fall to 45 percent of GDP 
within 10 years as a result of the growth in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other parties are wrong when they say that tax cuts can only 
come at the expense of the debt.  This is why the PC party is 
calling on the government to reward Canadians for enduring years 
of high taxes by reducing income taxes immediately.  Only then 
can we increase our competitive edge with our trading partners, 
notably the U.S., having economic growth and employment growth in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne does little to promote growth in 
employment.  The government pays lip service to promoting jobs 
for young people but its actions do not support its promises.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see examples of this government's hypocrisy every day in my 
riding of Markham.  As the government calls on small business to 
generate jobs for young people, small businesses will see their 
tax bill increase by about $7,000 under the proposed CPP plan for 
a company of 10.  This represents about the same cost as one or 
two summer jobs for youth in my riding.  This is typical of the 
hypocrisy of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Innovation and the economic growth that it generates is not 
produced by any particular program but by fostering a society 
that encourages innovation and change. Government programs and 
government money do not do this. Putting computers in schools and 
hooking them up to the Internet does not do this.  Creating 
economic incentives and opening up markets while eliminating 
regulations, monopolies and protected markets helps to foster a 
new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the 29 proposals found in the throne speech, these are 
changes that do not cost the government money.  In other words, 
growth-promoting economic policies can in many instances be 
implemented independently of the fiscal position of the 
government. The federal government however chooses to view 
everything in terms of revenue and expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move into the next millennium, profound changes will 
continue to take place in the economy.  This government had the 
opportunity in last week's Speech from the Throne to choose one 
of two paths:  move forward to the future using the tools of 
tomorrow, low taxes, a government that encourages innovation and 
economic growth; or move forward to the past using the tools of 
yesterday, high taxes, interventionist government. Unfortunately, 
the government chose the latter and missed the opportunity to 
offer Canadians real leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to leave members with one thought.  We must 
spend all our energies planning the future because that is where 
we are going to live the rest of our lives. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as a 
new member to this House, my colleague from Markham, my next door 
neighbour, offers me an example to clearly and loudly say in this 
House how different our views of the world are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully as he talked about the tough choices 
the government had to make.  He used as an example of his and his 
party's policy the Government of Ontario.  I would say to him 
that the deep cuts to health, education and the important 
programs that people care about are directly a result of the 
commitment that the Government of Ontario made to cut personal 
income taxes by some 30% before the budget was balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that is a similar policy to the Conservative Party as 
the member has just outlined.  However, it is in stark contrast 
to the balanced and fiscally responsible approach of the previous 
Liberal government which made a commitment to first balance the 
budget, protect important social programs and then in a climate 
of fiscal prudence look at the balance between enhancement and 
maintenance of the programs that we value in our society and 
those which have made us number one in the world and a 50% 
approach to using surpluses for the purposes of debt and tax 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should note a study which was just done for the Bank 
of Nova Scotia, certainly not a partisan institution in this 
country.  The study was done by the Boston Consulting Group.  The 
study states that quality of life issues are extremely important 
in the greater Toronto area and metropolitan Toronto in 
particular to attracting jobs and growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member for the reason that his party is the 
fifth party in this House.  Perhaps it is because the voters of 
this country have recognized the result of having an 
irresponsible tax cut before the books are balanced and before 
the country is in a state where we can then see tax cuts 
implemented in a way which will still protect those valued 
programs and the quality of life that we have come to expect in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member sticks to the rhetoric of the campaign, and as my 
neighbour we share such different views, would he acknowledge 
that perhaps the reason his party is in fifth position is because 
Canadians have seen the dramatic results of irresponsible tax 
cuts that have taken place in Ontario and have resulted in 
dramatic and drastic cuts to programs which impact on the quality 
of life.

from my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we all realise we are in a very competitive world 
today.  We are in the global economy and in order for us to 
create jobs and be competitive against the rest of the world we 
cannot afford to continue with high costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody knows in this House that some of the reasons why the 
provinces had to make very drastic cuts in the last three or four 
years to health care and education are the reductions in transfer 
payments the federal Liberals gave to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I am not here to defend the Ontario government but the 
Ontario government, with its tax cuts, is creating 30,000 to 
40,000 jobs a month in the last four to six months. It goes to 
prove that low taxes create jobs and high taxes cost jobs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to congratulate the member for Markham on his maiden speech 
here in the House, and I would also like to congratulate him on 
his victory at Markham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken in his riding several times, supporting the Reform 
candidate there.  Unfortunately the Reform candidate did not make 
it this time around, but the next time is going to be another 
story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find interesting some of the statements the member for Markham 
made.  I also find very interesting the comments of the member 
for Thornhill on the first question. The member for Markham 
indicates that sacrifices have been made to eliminate the 
deficit.  He is referring to the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat in this House for four years listening to the rhetoric of 
the other side of the House, the government side, and really when 
it comes down to it I never noticed too many sacrifices being 
made at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the sacrifices made were by those that the load of debt 
or spending was dumped on through the different provinces, 
transfer payments and the like.  The member for Markham made 
reference to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the government has failed to transfer money to 
the provinces and again the provinces have to pick up the 
slack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time for questions and comments 
has expired.  I wonder if the hon. member could put his question 
very briefly, and we will allow the hon. member to reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am wondering if he would 
like to reflect on what his party views as sacrifice.  I know the 
leader of his party does not really accept the general premise 
that their membership may want at an assembly.  It is open for 
debate and discussion. What does the member for Markham really 
consider to be a sacrifice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I was alluding to here 
is that the public has made a lot of sacrifices as we have 
balanced the budget, or we are close to balancing the budget. 
There has been a benefit of $17 billion in taxes from free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people have had to cut costs. Corporations have had to cut 
costs. If I said the government has made sacrifices, I am really 
saying that the public has made sacrifices within the last four 
to five years to help the government balance its budget. I am not 
so sure that the government has made the same type of sacrifices 
that private enterprises made.  There are two things that we can 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can try to grow revenue, and that is what this government is 
relying on, growing revenue.  The other side of the coin is that 
we have to continue to reduce costs and find better ways of doing 
the job.  I am not so sure that the government has done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying that the public has made the sacrifices, that the 
public will continue to make the sacrifices and it is the 
government that has to make the sacrifices on its spending 
habits.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I congratulate you on your appointment and all other members who 
have been appointed to similar positions.  I also congratulate 
the Speaker on his re-election as Speaker of the House of Commons 
for the 36th Parliament.  I would also like to congratulate all 
members of the House of Commons who have been elected for the 
first time and those who have been re-elected and are back for 
the second or consecutive times to this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having served in a provincial legislature for a number of years, 
I can say that coming to the House of Commons in this 36th 
Parliament is certainly a very special feeling.  I thank the 
people of Burin—St. George's for electing me and shouldering me 
with the enormous responsibility of representing them here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne so I 
will try to make my remarks pertinent to the throne speech 
itself.  Over the last few days I have listened intently to the 
various speakers and to the questions and comments that have been 
put in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the comment in the throne speech on the child tax 
benefit increase that the government is proposing to bring into 
effect on July 1, 1998.  It is good to see that there will be an 
increase in the child tax benefit allowance.  However, I take 
exception to what I have found out during that past couple of 
days.  The federal government has entered into agreements with 
the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador and other provincial 
governments that families that are receiving social assistance 
will not see any of the child tax benefit increase at all.  Their 
incomes will not be increased by one cent.  A clawback agreement 
has been entered into by the federal government and certain 
provincial governments that will keep the poor in essence poorer 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have stood in provincial legislatures and now in this federal 
Parliament where I have heard people talk about child poverty, 
the need to address this very important issue and the impact of 
hunger on education and learning levels.  Yet I now find out that 
this very federal government and provincial governments have 
entered into agreements which in essence will see hungry children 
remain hungry.  I take exception to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to see a reference to home care in the throne 
speech.  The government is taking measures to support Canadians 
in responding to the expanding needs for home care.  I am sure 
all hon. members on a daily basis receive representation from 
families that have aging parents or grandparents, that have a 
legitimate need for home care.  There are aging people who want 
to be looked after in their homes.  With the cutbacks to health 
care budgets from the federal government to the provinces, more 
and more aging people are receiving inadequate home care.  They 
are just not getting enough hours of home care.  In today's 
society where most families have both spouses out working, it is 
more and more difficult for families to contribute to the home 
care of their loved ones.  I was glad to see a reference to that 
in the throne speech and I look forward very much to seeing the 
specifics of the anticipated support mechanism for improved home 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often over the last fours years we saw this government make 
reference to initiatives it was considering.  Too often it has 
only been that, empty rhetoric.  It has been something written on 
paper, but government has not shown us the meat after the 
promise.  I look forward to that.  I am encouraged that at least 
there is a reference in the throne speech to the issue of home 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech states that government will continue to 
address the serious problem of international foreign overfishing. 
I come from Atlantic Canada.  Atlantic Canadians sent this 
government a very strong message on June 2, that the Liberal 
federal policies are not working for Atlantic Canadians.  They 
wanted to show the prime minister and the government how poorly 
they are working on behalf of Atlantic Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really not sure that the prime minister received the 
message.  If he did, he is ignoring the message. We need quick 
action in Atlantic Canada.  We need job creation initiatives, we 
need lower taxes, we need to get people back to work. The people 
of Atlantic Canada are suffering from a crisis which for the most 
part was imposed by mismanagement by successive federal 
governments.  Successive federal governments have mismanaged our 
most important resource in Atlantic Canada, our fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government said it would continue to address the problem of 
foreign overfishing.  Let me say that as we sit here today there 
are still foreigners who are flagrantly overfishing on the nose 
and tail of the Grand Banks. The government in the last couple of 
weeks has entered into agreements with those who have violated 
our fishing treaties and contracts to give those violators more 
fishing inside of the 200-mile limit. It says it will continue to 
deal with foreign overfishing when those very people are again 
abusing the situation and the government obviously is rewarding 
them for taking our fish inside of 200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another fishery situation in the country which is very volatile 
surrounds the Pacific salmon treaty.  I have been monitoring the 
situation over the last couple of months and what really jumps 
out at me in this situation is that in essence the government is 
treating the people of British Columbia and Premier Glen Clark 
and his government as the villains in this situation.  The 
government has decided to stay friendly with the Americans and in 
essence take it out on British Columbia.  From everything I have 
heard from the debates and in following the situation over the 
last few weeks, it seems to me that it is the Alaskans 
particularly who are at fault in the salmon dispute in the 
province with this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing worth pointing out in the debate today is that 
each year there is supposed to be a fishing plan agreed to by the 
U.S. and Canada.  In the last four years there has not been a 
fish plan, the only four years when there has not been a fish 
plan agreed to by Canada and the United States. Guess who has 
been the government for the last four years—the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the prime minister and to the minister of fisheries 
that they should really get involved in this B.C. situation and 
try to resolve it.  There are many fishers in British Columbia 
on the brink of bankruptcy, many who need some 
flexibility in the area licensing plan they were promised but 
have not been given, flexibility that would give them viability 
and sustainability in their fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the prime minister and the minister of fisheries seem to 
be so caught up in remaining very friendly with the Americans, 
our own people are entering financial crisis.  Many of them will 
go out of business if something is not done very soon.  Therefore 
I ask the minister of fisheries, the prime minister and the 
parliamentary secretary to the minister of fisheries to please 
move quickly on this very volatile situation which needs their 
immediate attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the the prime minister was calling on President Clinton to 
get involved in the problem, President Clinton wrote to the 
Alaskans saying that he would not tolerate any more actions such 
as the blockade of the ferry we saw in B.C.  It shows how 
seriously President Clinton takes the prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure and an honour to be here in the House of 
Commons. There are some very serious problems that need to be 
addressed.  I am pleased to take part in the address in reply to 
the Speech from the Throne and I look forward to spending another 
few years representing the people of Burin—St. George's.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the hon. member for Burin—St. George's, a 
Newfoundland riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very well the important role that Newfoundland played in 
the aborted Meech Lake accord, which mentioned that Quebec was a 
distinct society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the Speech from the Throne mentions the unique character 
alluded to in the Calgary declaration, I would like the hon. member from 
Newfoundland—and I am sure he knows what happened, he knows the role 
played by Clyde Wells in the failure of Meech Lake—to tell us 
whether, in his opinion and the opinion of his party, the expression 
unique character of Quebec society as used in the meaningless Calgary 
declaration has the same meaning as the expression distinct society had 
in the Meech Lake accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a simple question to which I would appreciate a simple and 
clear answer from the Conservative member. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember Meech Lake very well.  I remember Clyde Wells very 
well, sometimes with pride and sometimes with not so much pride. 
I sat in the provincial legislature with the former premier for a 
number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My thoughts on Meech Lake are well known. We took opposing 
positions in the Meech Lake debate.  We had a very thorough 
debate in the Newfoundland legislature at the time, as did most 
if not all legislatures across the country. To me the result was 
devastating.  We are still reeling from the effects of the demise 
of Meech Lake throughout the country.  I really believe that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asks a question about unique character and 
distinct society.  I have listened to the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs a number of times through the media. 
My belief is if distinct society is the same as unique character, 
then why are we changing the wording? That is the question I ask 
myself.  If both are the same, then why are we changing the 
wording?  That is my own personal thoughts on it.  I thank the 
hon. member for his question and that is my answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I reflected and watched the hon. minister on the news a 
number of times that was my first question.  Why are we changing 
it to unique character from distinct society if both mean the 
same thing? 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member for Burin—St. 
Georges this.  I know that in the Conservative platform on which 
he ran in the last election two promises were made on agriculture 
that disturbed me a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first was that they promised to destroy the marketing boards 
for the farmers.  The second promise was to do away with the 
department of agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would talk a bit more about those 
Conservative promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If she is disturbed with a couple of the promises that we made 
in our election platform, can she imagine how disturbed we are 
with most that they made in theirs? If she can only take 
exception with a couple of ours, I can assure her we can take 
exception with dozens of hers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know her question is a serious one on agriculture.  She has 
the same concern with agriculture as I have about fish.  I can 
only go on record and say in this Chamber what I have said 
publicly, that I personally did not support a proposal in the 
policy platform for a department of sustainable development.  I 
supported it at the time and said publicly during the election 
campaign that my preference was for a separate truly Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans and I still stand by that.  I am sure she 
probably feels the same about agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only answer here what I said in the campaign.  I will not 
say one thing in the campaign and then come here and say 
something different, as many on the other side cannot stand in 
their place and say.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to congratulate our Speaker. As a career educator and 
seasoned parliamentarian he earned our trust through an election process 
I particularly appreciated not only as a newcomer in this House, but 
also as a former member of the Quebec National Assembly. I will always 
remember that the first thing I was asked to do when I arrived in Ottawa 
was to vote rather than having a decision imposed on me from above, 
which had been my experience in the past. This augurs well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to salute voters in Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies 
and thank them for the mandate they gave me last June when they sent me 
here to represent them and serve them in co-operation with my team of 
assistants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies is located in the 
northeastern part of Montreal island. It comprises the city of Anjou and 
several areas of Montreal, including the fast growing district of 
Rivière-des-Prairies. It is a riding where the business community is 
very vibrant, where businesses are increasing in number, creating more 
jobs, upgrading their facilities and exporting more and more. My riding 
is home to dozens of volunteer organizations serving our young people, 
the elderly, our families, and providing recreational activities, as 
well as various cultural communities, which by the way are increasingly 
diverse and numerous since 32 percent of my constituents are not of francophone 
origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore an honour and a great privilege to be able to 
represent and to serve that population, one with a rather 
exceptional voter turnout of 78 percent, 47 percent of whom voted for me as the 
candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I would also like to thank the active Liberal party 
members in my riding, and the party executive, for their warm 
support of my nomination as a candidate. I wish to send particular 
greetings to the more than 3,000 members in good standing of our 
riding association who supported my progress to this seat right 
from the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened attentively to the throne speech, the Prime 
Minister's address and those by the four leaders of the opposition 
parties. 
I must say that I am very pleased to be sitting on this side of the 
House at this time, and I am very proud to have heard the message 
from the government and the Prime Minister, for a number of 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the Prime Minister has clearly explained the 
direction he plans to set for our team now and during the next 
mandate. In setting a path toward a more humane and more just 
society, he is adhering to the most profound and the most permanent 
Liberal values. This I find fitting, because it corresponds to the 
expectations of the people of Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, whom I 
represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, tough decisions have had to be made, ones 
that have been both hard to make and hard to accept in some ways. 
I am thinking of our unemployed, our seniors, our disadvantaged 
families.  I am thinking of the volunteer organizations which have 
had to do more, often with less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While maintaining its commitment to improve public finances, 
the government can now say it can once again respond to Canadians' 
priorities without exceeding our means.  It has indicated that it 
is now again able to invest not only in economic growth, which it 
will continue to do, but increasingly in the development of 
Canadian society and of its human resources—men, women, and 
young people—the primary capital of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investing in our children, investing in health, building safer 
communities, offering young Canadians greater opportunities, 
investing in knowledge and creativity, these are some of our 
government's priorities. I think these commitments, once translated 
into laws, budgets and programs and put into effect, will take 
Canadian societies to new horizons of development and growth and 
will enable Canada to remain at the forefront of the international 
community.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech also warrants praise because it basically 
reflects the commitments made by the Liberal Party during the last 
election campaign in red book II, Securing Our Future Together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time I hear the criticism that this speech 
contains nothing new, nothing dramatic, that it is a rehash.  Had 
the throne speech contained anything other than the red book 
commitments, the same detractors would be accusing the government 
of losing sight of and turning its back on the commitments it made 
during the election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What counts most for this country's future, for its unity and 
prosperity, for its men, women, young people and families, for its 
businesses? 
A government committed to fulfilling its promises or a government that 
is easily distracted and borrows buzzwords from the opposition parties? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the summer, like many of my hon. colleagues, I consulted 
people in my riding, business people, representatives of voluntary 
organizations, and union organizers from the private sector. They told 
me they wanted the government: first, to continue to support job 
creation and economic growth; second, to reinvest in social programs; 
and third, to settle the issue of national unity by taking into account 
Quebec's distinct and unique reality, but in co-operation with the rest 
of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These three main concerns expressed by my constituents are high 
priority items in the throne speech. I look forward to helping implement 
measures in response to these needs and concerns shared by my community 
and many other communities in Quebec and across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I must say that I became involved in federal 
politics under the banner of the Liberal Party of Canada because I 
believe that this country can not only survive but prosper provided that 
the central, regional and provincial powers find a way to join forces 
instead of squabbling or even trying to split this country up, as the PQ 
government in Quebec and its prophets of doom and division, the Bloc 
Quebecois members, are currently doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got involved in federal politics because I believe that the 
federal government has a unique responsibility to bring together and 
mobilize every part of this country, that is to say every generation, 
every region and every citizen of this country, to respond to the 
question the Bloc Quebecois is obsessively asking with ambitious plans, 
mainly by ensuring that each and every one of us can achieve our full 
potential within the Canadian democracy while making an important 
contribution to the international community. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the course of my years of professional activity in 
teaching, the union movement, the environment, in consulting and 
in international co-operation, I learned that as Canadians we 
have many more similarities than differences, whether we are 
teachers, or engineers or unemployed, young and old.  I learned 
that among Canadians there is an important desire to work 
together in a shared political framework.  I learned that by 
working together as Canadians from Quebec and elsewhere in this 
country we can ensure a better future for ourselves and our 
children and make a most significant contribution to the 
well-being of the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all my 
friends in the teaching profession across the country, and their 
representatives, and to the union organizers.  I would like to 
pay tribute to the sustainable development promoters and 
supporters of the country, to the people concerned with 
international co-operation, and to the business people who I 
rubbed shoulders with in my career lives. I do not only wish to 
pay tribute to them, I also want to thank them for showing me 
that we have everything to gain by getting to know one another 
and by working together, with respect to our differences 
certainly, but also with the profound conviction that our 
membership in the Canadian family is a guarantee of security, 
fairness and prosperity for everyone in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for 
recognizing me.  It cannot have been an easy decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by congratulating my hon. colleague on his 
speech.  In it, he spoke about the Bloc Quebecois's obsession with 
national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he mean by this that it is not by asking our fellow citizens 
on a daily basis whether we are unique, whether we are distinct, that we 
will succeed in improving national unity? 
Or does he mean, as they have always said, that the issue will be sorted 
out within Quebec, following formal resolutions from the rest of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward with great pleasure to my colleague's reply to this 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for Chicoutimi for raising this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks were in reference to the Bloc Quebecois' unwavering 
question as to whether the members on this side of the House recognize 
the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the only question they have asked since the beginning— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> You still haven't replied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> —the most obsessive.  I replied in advance, 
with reference to the people that make up Canada, of course, that this 
included the people to which we belong in Quebec, and as French 
Canadians as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In return, I would also like to hear them tell us sometime whether 
they recognize that there is also a French Canadian people, or whether 
they think that the contribution made by francophones in this country 
does not extend beyond the borders of Quebec. 
I would very much like to hear what they have to say about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are crawling backwards across the Plains of Abraham. 
They are trying to climb back up the cliffs at the Plains of Abraham in 
their search for their identity, when the place to seek our identity is 
in what lies around us, in our own experiences, in the people we 
encounter and in what we do with our lives, not just in wondering what 
our origins are and who did what. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to move in a forward direction and that is why I joined 
the Liberal team here on this side of the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I would ask hon. 
members to keep their questions and responses short. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
could take me quite some time to respond to this, but I shall try to be 
brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this morning, we have been hearing all sorts of things. We 
heard about such things as the homeland of culture, having a unique 
character and being a distinct society. The hon. member referred to 
distinct realities in the case of Quebec, etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had Meech, we had Charlottetown, now we have Calgary and 
tomorrow we may have Canada's Wonderland. Had Walt Disney been a 
Canadian, Mickey Mouse might be the one making the premiers' 
declaration. Members opposite should get serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing being overlooked is Quebec's historical perspective. 
I am thinking of Quebec's premiers, in particular of Maurice Duplessis. 
The hon. member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies certainly remembers 
that, in the fifties, Mr. Duplessis said the Canadian confederation was 
a treaty of union between two great nations. Not a treaty between 
typical, unique or distinct societies, or whatever else. Later, Jean 
Lesage spoke of two founding peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member opposite, who is boasting because he is a 
government member, tell us here whether or not his government recognizes 
that Quebecers are a people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not the type of person who 
engages in semantics. People want to know what we will do for them in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, Quebecers, are a people, and just about everyone in this House 
agrees with this statement. There is also a French Canadian people, and 
a Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if, conversely, our friends from the Bloc Quebecois 
recognize that there is French Canadian people and a Canadian people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask our colleague a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says he is proud of being with the Liberals, because the 
Liberals have made promises in the red book. I just hope he is talking 
about the promises contained in the second red book and not in the first 
red book, because those promises were not kept, and a minister was 
forced to resign and to seek re-election and another member was forced 
to join us here in the back. They made promises that they could not 
keep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member, did you and do you still agree with the employment 
insurance reform that imposed cuts on the workers of this country? 
You talked about that in the past as a union organizer. Did you and do 
you still agree with these cuts that our people were subjected to in the 
regions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would like to 
congratulate my colleague on his election, and we all know in what 
circumstances he was elected. It is with a very definite purpose in mind 
that I begin my answer with these words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think his voice here will echo the concerns of Canadian workers, 
and there are other people who can play a similar role within the 
government party. We must all be sensitive to the problems workers are 
experiencing and this will be one of the mandates that I will be 
fulfilling in this House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to respond to the Speech from the Throne which opened 
Canada's 36th Parliament.  I begin by thanking the people of 
Guelph—Wellington for the trust and confidence they gave me and 
the Liberal Party on June 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The June 2 general election marked the first back to back 
victories for a Liberal Party candidate in 45 years in my riding. 
I am honoured to have the opportunity to serve the people of 
Guelph—Wellington for a second term, a term that will end in the 
next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin to speak about the present and the future I want 
to quote a newly elected member of Parliament, speaking in the 
House for the first time on May 23, 1963.  I quote from the 
members own reply to the Speech from the Throne when he said “I 
am very glad to be a member of a party which has a leader of the 
calibre of the prime minister”.  Those words were spoken almost 
35 years ago by our current prime minister.  I am proud to echo 
those words, and as they were used to describe Lester Pearson 
they apply quite equally to the prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some parties in the House like to refer to the Speech from the 
Throne and the government's agenda as a return to the past.  Let 
us compare their record to ours.  Was it not the same parties 
that said we could never balance the budget?  We will and our 
country's finances are currently in the best position in decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did these parties not predict when the Liberals were elected in 
1993 that there would be more of the same?  Instead we have 
witnessed in four short years record low interest rates and low 
inflation, the restoration of public confidence in our finances, 
and the beginning of hope for the unemployed.  I will compare our 
record of hope, opportunity for growth and confidence against 
their dire predictions any day, for we have delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can always point to the positive results of records in the 
35th Parliament.  Exports have increased to records never before 
imagined.  Social programs have been maintained and Canada has 
been judged by the United Nations, time and time again, to be the 
best country in the world.  Still there is something happening in 
my community which goes far beyond enthusiastic forecasts and 
strong growth.  I have witnessed a transformation of the people 
of Guelph—Wellington in the years between 1993 and 1997.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of my riding are optimistic again.  Let me quote from 
the September 16, 1997 edition of the Toronto <I>Star</I> and an 
article written about the technology triangle which includes 
Guelph—Wellington.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What's so often overlooked is that communities and regions have 
enormous human resources capable of providing the energy, 
commitment and leadership skills needed to create a new attitude 
and direction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article continues by saying that Guelph—Wellington: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>provides one example of how people at the local level in 
business, government, education, social agencies and unions 
helped this region make a transition from old industrial Ontario 
to a new knowledge based one. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly these communities are often overlooked for their 
leadership and commitment but not, however, by the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In knocking on doors throughout the general election of 1997 I 
experienced that transformation of optimism.  That optimism is 
witnessed every day by Guelph—Wellington citizens like Luiz 
Danninger, president of Trodat Canada Inc., producers of 
self-inking office stamps.  Luiz employs more than 30 people and 
works hard to succeed.  This summer he became a Canadian citizen 
and represents the spirit of co-operation and partnership 
underlined in the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is former Guelph Liberal member of Parliament, 
Jim Schroder.  Jim has given up some of his retirement time to 
raise funds for the new River Run Centre, an arts and 
entertainment complex which will officially open this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jim represents our support for the arts, which was announced in 
the Speech from the Throne.  Dr. Larry Peterson of the University 
of Guelph was recently awarded the Helsinki medal for his work 
and represents the support for knowledge promoted by our 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more examples.  Paul MacPherson is president and 
general manager of Valcom, a growing and successful company in 
Guelph—Wellington.  Paul and his employees know firsthand the 
importance of the Technology Partnerships Canada and represent 
the support for technology that has been committed by our 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently Constable Wayne Hummell of the Guelph police force was 
awarded a Canadian banks law enforcement award for his efforts in 
combating crime against banks.  Constable Hummell and members of 
the police forces that help protect Guelph—Wellington can only 
serve better because of our commitment to building safer 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the work of Mindy Ternan, the campaign director for the 
United Way community services in Guelph and Wellington county, 
can be helped through our commitment in investing in children and 
young people and the equal commitment in quality care and good 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Guelph—Wellington have rejected the doom and 
gloom spouted by the nay sayers.  On June 2, 1997 they said yes 
to hope, growth and opportunity.  They understand that Liberals 
throughout the history of Canada have never looked back, except 
to remind the opposition time and time again of the realities of 
Liberal success.  We have always appreciated and comprehended the 
present while looking forward to the future.  We have always 
worked with Canadians to find solutions to our problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will face many challenges in the 36th Parliament. 
We must still eliminate the deficit spending and we must still 
tackle an enormous debt.  We must continue the transformation of 
our social programs in response to new and difficult 
circumstances.  While investing in our future we must still ask 
for sacrifices to secure a quality of life for our seniors, our 
families, our young people, and each and every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to those challenges.  I am grateful to have been 
given the opportunity to serve with the Minister of Labour as his 
parliamentary secretary.  However, most important, I look forward 
to serving the people of Guelph—Wellington, a community that I 
describe as the best in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I again quote that newly elected member of 
Parliament speaking in 1963 and saying:  “The people of Canada 
will find in the Liberal program the solution to their 
problems”.  I believe that is true today, a solution that can 
only be found through optimism, co-operation, partnerships, hope 
in our future and belief in ourselves, a solution that will keep 
Canada the best country in the world.

question for the hon. member for Guelph—Wellington has to do 
with the throne speech and what is lacking in it, which is that 
there is absolutely no reference whatsoever to veterans or the 
merchant navy veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's government took $182 million away from the 
veterans programs in the last three and a half years.  The 
merchant navy veterans have never been treated equally.  Five 
years ago $100 million was put into a fund that was allocated for 
them to become equal.  However, the government legislation made 
them ineligible to have access to it. They came to me and asked 
for help. There are only 2,100 of them left out of the 12,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the hon. member's government going to do to correct the 
error it has made and help those veterans become eligible for the 
veterans programs?  It should put more money back into the last 
post fund and all the programs it has removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do know that as we speak the government is in discussions with 
the merchant marine veterans.  We believe that we can solve the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the member's concern.  However, I have never, ever 
believed that the Conservatives would put more money into a 
program so I have no faith in that area.  But I do share the 
member's concerns.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
another member from the province of Premier Harris, who claims to 
recognize Quebec as unique in the same way the Pacific salmon is 
unique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has heard her colleague for 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, in answer to my question as to 
whether he, as a member of the government, recognized Quebecers 
as a people,  reply “Yes, of course”.  He even went on to add: 
“Everyone does”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore asking the hon. member, a member of the same 
party as the member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, whether she 
recognizes the existence of the people of Quebec. 
If so, why did she vote against the Bloc's amendment to the motion 
on the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So there are two questions: Does she recognize the people of 
Quebec and, if so, why did she vote against the amendment we moved 
in this House? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first the hon. 
member has asked if I recognize the people of Quebec.  I 
certainly do.  First and foremost they are Canadians and 
Quebeckers. They are a part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that by being a part of the federation of Canada we 
get a great many benefits by being Canadian.  Quebeckers enjoy 
health care, unemployment insurance, welfare and all the social 
safety nets. They enjoy being Canadian.  They enjoy not needing a 
passport to travel from one province to another. They enjoy the 
use of national defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many reasons why Quebeckers have, as the polls are 
telling us now, chosen to be Canadians. I certainly do recognize 
Quebeckers.  I believe we all love and want Quebec in Canada.

serve them for another term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to lead off the debate today for the official 
opposition which will focus on the issues of national unity and 
parliamentary reform. 
These two issues are directly related. If we are ever to resolve 
Canada's unity problem we have to make significant changes to the 
way Canada is governed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Reform colleagues who will also be speaking today will be 
examining various aspects of these issues in more detail.  I 
would like to reinforce the Leader of the Opposition's response 
to the throne speech of last Wednesday.  The throne speech 
contains a great deal of rhetoric and platitudes about the value 
of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians know that Canada is a wonderful country to live 
in.  The international community knows that Canada is the best 
country to live in, but the reality of today is that the majority 
of federal and provincial politicians from Quebec want to leave 
Canada.  Yet there is very little in the throne speech on how the 
Liberal government intends to address the threat of separation 
from these Quebec politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech the government makes a commitment to work 
with the provinces and territories to advance the progress made 
in Calgary two weeks ago toward the full recognition of diversity 
inherent in the federation, including the unique character of 
Quebec society.  Unfortunately the Liberal government chose to 
ignore other parts of the Calgary declaration, which recognize 
the equality of citizens and provinces. The government also chose 
to ignore any mention in the throne speech of the premiers' 
pledge to involve the public before advancing their proclamation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is the intention of the Liberal government to pursue its 
national unity strategy by promoting the concept of Quebec's 
unique character while ignoring the equality of Canadians and 
provinces and the commitment to involve the public in the 
process, its strategy will not work, nor will the official 
opposition support such a strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our support for the Calgary declaration as a starting point on 
unity discussions was based on the total package, not just one 
item out of seven.  In the past, discussions that centred on the 
unique character of Quebec have been met with suspicion in 
British Columbia and other parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two major concerns expressed by British Columbians have been 
that such recognition will provide Quebec with special rights, 
powers or privileges that are not available to other provinces, 
and second, that such recognition would diminish the notion that 
all Canadians are equal and all provinces are equal. The Calgary 
declaration explicitly acknowledges these two concerns, but if 
the government continues to promote the unique character of 
Quebec while ignoring the equality aspect of the declaration, 
British Columbians are apt to become even more suspicious of the 
federal government's motive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians, indeed all Canadians outside of Quebec, will 
have the opportunity to express their feelings about the Calgary 
declaration over the next few months.  After these public 
consultations, the premiers are then expected to introduce 
resolutions in their respective legislatures.  I am sure the 
wording of these resolutions will reflect the sentiment of the 
various public consultations that have occurred in their 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But will these resolutions make any difference?  The Bloc 
Quebecois says no.  The Parti Quebecois government also says no. 
Both of these parties say that the Calgary declaration is 
worthless and does not come anywhere close to addressing Quebec's 
grievances.  They claim it is irrelevant, as was the Liberal 
government's Motion No. M-26 in the last Parliament.  Some people 
may remember when the government quickly passed a motion to live 
up to the prime minister's promise to recognize Quebec as a 
distinct society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration does not involve constitutional change 
and as long as there is a separatist government in Quebec, any 
constitutional initiatives are futile.  Not only would we have a 
repeat of the constitutional discussions of the early 1980s but 
in another ill-advised piece of legislation passed by the 
government in the last Parliament, the separatist government in 
Quebec now has a veto over any constitutional amendment.  No 
matter how beneficial another proposed constitutional amendment 
may be, it is extremely unlikely that the Parti Quebecois 
government would ever endorse it.  Thus the Calgary declaration 
is not aimed so much at the Quebec government but for the Quebec 
people. 
Pollsters and pundits have been filling the airwaves and 
newspapers with their take on the reaction of the people of 
Quebec and they will continue to do so even after all the 
provincial resolutions have been tabled.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear today of a poll out of Quebec suggesting that the 
majority of Quebeckers do not believe that the Calgary 
declaration is sufficient to address their concerns.  However, 
the first real tangible evidence of the feeling of the people of 
Quebec may appear in the next Quebec provincial election which is 
expected some time next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Calgary declaration and the resulting provincial 
resolutions convince Quebeckers to turf out their separatist 
government?  On their own it would appear not, but hopefully 
these initiatives will be viewed as a starting point to convince 
Quebeckers that Canadians from all across the country are 
prepared to resolve the country's unity problem within 
Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister stated in the throne speech debate at page 
43 of <I>Hansard</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day may come—I hope it will, and it will if Quebec ever has 
a government willing to work for those Quebeckers who wish to 
remain a part of Canada and they are the majority—when there is 
a legal and constitutional text to consider as such.  The words 
from Calgary are an attempt to express worthy Canadian values and 
that is how they should be welcomed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the next Quebec provincial election we will be faced with 
one of two prospects:  one, a federalist government in Quebec 
which will require that Canadians be prepared for another 
constitutional initiative or two, a separatist government which 
will require Canadians to be prepared for another separatist 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address both of these scenarios, but I will first address 
the more desirable scenario, one that will enable a strong and 
united Canada to live up to its potential in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Quebeckers recognize that they are not the only Canadians who 
reject the status quo and opt instead to elect a provincial 
government that is committed to renewing and revitalizing the 
federation, then Canada will undoubtedly enter another round of 
constitutional negotiations.  If Quebeckers show enough faith in 
Canada to elect a federalist government, that faith must be 
rewarded.  However, while this constitutional debate should 
address Quebec's concerns about the federation, it cannot deal 
exclusively with Quebec's concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any attempt to have a Quebec only round will result in 
widespread opposition, especially in British Columbia.  While 
Quebec is naturally a key to any constitutional negotiations, I 
can assure the House that B.C. will also play an equally pivotal 
role in these discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In accordance with the Calgary declaration, the B.C. government 
will hold public consultations with its citizens like the other 
provincial governments with the exception of Quebec.  While I 
would never be so presumptuous as to assume that what the people 
of British Columbia will tell their government, some of their 
sentiment on the issue is becoming more public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week a senator from B.C. made national headlines by stating 
that British Columbia should renegotiate its role in 
Confederation and that secession should be on the table.  In 
response to these comments the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs almost blew a gasket in condemning the senator.  Was the 
senator reflecting the mood of British Columbians?  I believe she 
was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not ask the House just to believe what I think.  The 
House should check with the people of B.C., just like the 
Vancouver <I>Sun</I> did with its readers.   They asked British 
Columbians if B.C. should renegotiate its place in Confederation 
and if it should, they asked if secession should be on the table. 
The Vancouver <I>Sun</I> had 1,010 responses to these questions. 
Out of 1,010 responses 800 of them said yes, British Columbia 
should be renegotiating its role in Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the more controversial aspect of including secession in 
these renegotiations, 700 respondents said yes, it should be 
there.  That is right.  According to the 1,010 people who 
responded to the Vancouver <I>Sun's</I> question, 70 percent said yes, 
secession should be on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senator was just reflecting the extreme frustration that 
British Columbians feel. 
If that is not a wake-up call for this minister and this 
government, then I do not know what is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task ahead does have some bright spots. British Columbians 
desire many of the same changes in Confederation that Quebeckers 
do.  One of these issues is the rebalancing of powers within 
Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often heard members of the Bloc Quebecois talk about how 
federal policies prevent Quebeckers from becoming masters in 
their own home.  A rebalancing of powers by defining which issues 
should be within the provincial government's jurisdiction and 
which should be in the federal government's jurisdiction would 
certainly go a long way to resolving many of the concerns of 
Quebeckers and British Columbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue that is more of a concern to British Columbia than it 
is to Quebec is revamping federal institutions, especially 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia is the most under-represented province in both 
this House and the other place.  In the Senate there are 104 
senators.  Using the 1996 census population figures, that works 
out to a Canadian average of 277,373 citizens per senator. When 
we look at the per capita representation on a provincial basis, 
there is only one province which is near the national average, 
Quebec, with 297,450 people per senator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the low end we have Prince Edward Island with only 33,639 
citizens per senator; New Brunswick with 73,813 people per 
senator.  At the opposite end of the scale we have Ontario, with 
448,065 per senator, and Alberta with 449,471.  At the top of the 
scale is British Columbia, with 620,750 citizens per senator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no equality in the other place now, either on the basis 
of equality of citizens or equality of provinces.  What we have 
is an upper chamber which reflects the reality of over 100 years 
ago.  Unfortunately there has been a litany of Liberal and Tory 
governments, dominated by central Canada, which have been quite 
happy to keep things just as they were back in the 19th century. 
We are about to enter the 21st century.  It is time to bring 
representation up to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I would be remiss if I failed to mention the illusion 
to Senate reform referred to by the Charlottetown accord.  That 
is the accord that the prime minister always hides behind when he 
is asked about Senate reform.  He claims that westerners had the 
chance for Senate reform but voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That accord called for Quebec and Ontario to give up 18 of their 
senators so that each province would end up with six senators. 
Did Ontario and Quebec give them up out of the goodness of their 
hearts?  Absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the terms of the accord those 18 senators would be 
resurrected as 18 new members of Parliament each for Quebec and 
Ontario.  Thus British Columbia's under-representation in this 
House would be even more significant. Is it any wonder that 
two-thirds of British Columbians rejected the accord?  Did they 
really think we were that stupid? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another piece of information for the prime minister's 
attention when he says that the Charlottetown accord would have 
elected senators.  It is true that the accord allowed for the 
election of senators, but clause 4 of the accord, which amended 
section 23(2)(a) of the Constitution Act of 1867, allowed for the 
indirect election of senators by provincial legislatures.  In 
other words, instead of being appointed by the prime minister 
they would be appointed by the premiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we approach the new millennium any rules that permit the 
appointment of any representatives are archaic and should be 
forever consigned to the 19th century, not to the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to the numbers in the Senate for a moment, these 
numbers are assigned on a regional basis which, as in the 
Constitution, recognizes four distinct districts or regions.  Yet 
when this government passed Bill C-110 in the last Parliament and 
handed out vetoes it recognized five regions.  It finally 
acknowledged that British Columbia is unique from the prairie 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this government recognize four regions in the 
Constitution and five regions in parliamentary legislation? 
It is an inconsistency that this government must address.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration acknowledges the equality of all 
citizens and all provinces.  If this declaration is to mean 
anything there must be true equality in Parliament.  In the 
Senate, the equality of provinces should be recognized and in 
this House the equality of citizens should be recognized.  To 
accomplish this equality we must have true representation by 
population in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I mentioned British Columbians' under-representation in 
the Senate.  B.C. is equally unrepresented in this House.  Using 
the population census in 1996 the Canadian average is 95,836 
people per MP.  Once again, only Quebec comes close to that with 
95,184 people per MP.  The range in representation goes from 
33,639 in Prince Edward Island to 109,544 in B.C.  Is this 
equality?  I do not think so.  It is due to a little heralded 
constitutional amendment made in 1985 that guaranteed that no 
province would ever lose seats in redistribution.  What that 
means is today we have six provinces that have this 
constitutional protection.  Six provinces have an average of 
73,900 people per MP.  Meanwhile, three provinces are 
significantly under-represented in this House and they average 
105,366 people per MP. With the 1985 amendment, this inequity is 
likely to be permanent unless the Constitution is changed again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that B.C. will likely be asking for is to be treated 
equally, nothing more, nothing less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just in case members are wondering why this is important to 
B.C., we happen to believe that if we had our due representation 
in Parliament then maybe we would not have a government that 
handles foreign overfishing off the Pacific coast by taking the 
B.C. government to court.  Maybe we would not have a government 
that closes the only military base on the mainland of British 
Columbia which just happens to have the highest risk for a major 
earthquake in a populated area.  Maybe we would not have a 
government that gives Quebec over $3,000 per immigrant while 
giving B.C. barely $1,000 per immigrant.  Maybe we would not have 
a government that immediately gives Quebec millions of dollars 
when it receives a large number of refugees, yet when British 
Columbia receives a large number of out of province welfare 
claimants the government not only fails to provide any additional 
funds, it penalizes the B.C. government for taking steps to deal 
with this problem on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude my comments I would like to briefly mention 
what will happen if Quebecers opt to re-elect the Parti 
Quebecois, the separatists.  I am certain that the people of 
British Columbia, as well as members of the official opposition, 
will want to make certain that Quebecers know the consequences of 
what a vote for separation will mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, I would like to dispel the myth that 
separatists like to spread that after separation there would be a 
friendly equal partnership between Quebec and the rest of Canada. 
I would like to inform the Quebec separatists that there is no 
such thing as the rest of Canada.  The separatists have no idea 
what shape the remainder of Confederation will be in after a yes 
vote.  If Quebec votes to separate rest assured that British 
Columbians will review their options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not get me wrong, British Columbians love Canada and will do 
everything in their power to have it remain united.  However, we 
expect that when Canada enters the next millennium it will be a 
country where all Canadians and all provinces are treated 
equally, fairly and with respect.  British Columbians are asking 
for nothing more and will settle for nothing less.

because you do not want to hear this message or is it because you 
feel that if it is good for Ontario, it is good for all of

permitted a settling of interest rates, with all due respect to 
Mr. Bouchard.

introduce back to work legislation within eight days of any 
strike action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strategy by the government and the management at Canada

Speaker, the papers are quoting opinion polls in Quebec in which 
Quebeckers were asked their opinion on the premiers' declaration 
from Calgary.  However most Quebeckers have no way of knowing 
what is in that declaration, that it is primarily a commitment to 
consult the public and that what it is seeking to do is to 
balance acknowledgement of uniqueness with acknowledgement of 
equality as citizens and provinces.  All Quebeckers have heard 
about this agreement is some negative attacks by the Premier of 
Quebec.

the development of an environmentally sound project whose

will put in jeopardy resource mining development all over Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and

by the minister's department to impose back payroll taxes on Mrs. 
Janice Collingridge, a severely disabled, low income, non-verbal 
quadriplegic.  The minister's lawyers said that by contracting 
care givers to help her live at home she was running a business 
in her home and was therefore assessed nearly $5,000 in back 
payroll and CPP taxes and penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the policy of this minister and government that severely

frankly I am shocked at that answer.  This is a simple question. 
Can this minister not stand up in this House and say that it is 
not the policy of this government to pursue and chase down 
severely disabled Canadians in the courts to try to squeeze money 
out of them?  Are they or are they not running businesses by 
employing personal care givers at home? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see anything in the Income Tax Act about that.  Is this

over the past 130-some years the appointment process by which

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this new justice of the supreme court will be determining whether 
Quebec has the right to unilaterally secede. This is perhaps one 
of the most important issues in our country's history.

Security guards and local police forces are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Minister of Transport subjecting our communities to 
the possibility of increased crime by disbanding the Ports Canada

the opportunity to fill out the people's tax form they told me in

have the right to know where their hard earned but easily spent

Canadians that the divorce rate in Canada had now reached 50 
percent and that 75 percent of common law relationships break 
down within the first five years.  Sixty per cent of these 
relationships involve children.  When they break down, 85 percent 
of the families are mother led. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of family breakdown we are creating a most dangerous 
environment for our children.  It is a new fatherless society 
that is filling up with children who are so emotionally damaged 
by their parents' behaviour they may have difficulty forming 
commitments and families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill requires mandatory counselling prior to legal sanction 
or granting of a divorce, not to try to reconcile a broken 
marriage but rather to serve two purposes.  One is to ensure an 
appropriate parenting plan is in place for children of a broken 
family and to address the serious issue of post-divorce acrimony.

<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to take the opportunity first of all in 
participating in this debate to express my sincere gratitude to 
the prime minister for the confidence he has placed in me by 
appointing me as the Solicitor General of Canada.  I am 
particularly honoured and proud to have been given this task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to express my regrets to those members particularly 
from New Brunswick who served in the 35th parliament and were not 
re-elected.  Their leadership will be sadly missed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week we listened with interest and with optimism to the 
Speech from the Throne opening this the 36th session of 
Parliament.  This occasion was particularly significant to me as 
a newly appointed minister.  This is a parliament with a unique 
and historic opportunity to provide leadership on national issues 
to secure the social and economic future of Canadians as we 
approach the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As solicitor general I am responsible for providing national 
leadership on issues relating to federal corrections, policing 
and national security.  As such I would like today to address 
this session of the throne speech dealing with building safer 
communities.  I want to provide an overview of the direction my 
ministry will be pursuing to help protect the safety and security 
of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians identify their feeling of personal safety and security 
as the one overriding element that contributes to their 
definition of being Canadian.  The notion of living in safe 
communities is a hallmark of the Canadian identity.  We know that 
crime creates fear not just for our personal safety but also for 
the safety of our families and our communities.  It undermines 
the very quality of life in our neighbourhoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a comparatively safe society with a crime rate that 
has dropped steadily over the last four years.  Yet there are 
many indications that Canadians do not feel safe and that is a 
reality to which governments must respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are entitled to know and feel that their communities 
are as safe, as peaceful and as secure as we can make them. Since 
the government's first election to office in 1993, we have made 
public safety a priority for action.  We have made solid gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Carrying through on our red book promises over the past four 
years resulted in an intensive focus on criminal law issues to 
improve public safety.  In particular, Canadians told us loud and 
clear that they wanted the government to get tough on violent 
high risk offenders.  Here are just some of the measures that we 
took to improve public safety in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strengthened the dangerous offender provisions in the 
Criminal Code, created a new long term offender designation and 
passed measures to make it easier to detain until the end of 
sentence sex offenders who victimize children. We devised a 
national flagging system to help crown attorneys identify high 
risk offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We established a national volunteer screening system to help 
organizations screen out child sexual abusers who apply to work 
with children.  We passed tougher laws on stalking and made peace 
bonds more effective in keeping abusers away from women and 
children.  We passed laws allowing police gathering and use of 
DNA evidence.  Just last week we introduced a bill to create a 
DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overarching theme of our safe communities agenda in the 
second red book is that building safer communities requires a 
multidimensional balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government recognizes the importance of dealing firmly with 
those offenders who threaten public safety.  Some offenders must 
be imprisoned and in some cases for lengthy periods of time. This 
is not debatable in order to protect the public.  However, there 
are others who can be dealt with more effectively and safely 
without lengthy terms in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost all offenders will ultimately return to the community one 
day.  Our best long term protection results from their return to 
a law-abiding lifestyle in the community.  Where this can best be 
achieved through community supervision, with adequate programs in 
residential communities this should be our approach.  This 
approach does not mean being soft on crime nor letting criminals 
go free.  It means making these offenders responsible and 
accountable for their crimes through other means.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne speaks to the issue of alternatives. 
The federal and provincial governments are committed to 
developing alternatives to incarceration for non-violent 
offenders who can safely and effectively be managed in the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say also a few words about public attitudes on criminal 
justice issues as they relate to this subject.  A recent Angus 
Reid survey demonstrated the remarkably strong consensus that 
exists among Canadians on the need for a balanced and 
comprehensive approach.  According to that survey Canadians 
believe that the protection of the public and the rehabilitation 
of offenders are of higher priority than punishment as goals of 
incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results of the Angus Reid survey suggest how we may further 
reform Canada's criminal justice system but they also speak to 
the need to involve citizens in the communities in the 
development of safe and effective solutions.  This is nowhere 
more important than in our work to address the needs of 
aboriginal offenders who continue to be overrepresented in our 
correctional system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While dealing more appropriately with high and low risk 
offenders will remain a priority, it is imperative that we also 
work to prevent crime in the first instance. As stated in the 
Speech from the Throne, the government will increase funding for 
community based crime prevention initiatives to $30 million a 
year.  In our safe communities agenda we focus on crime 
prevention at the community level which is essentially a process 
of community building with local involvement over a wide range of 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a wide consensus that successful crime prevention must 
take a comprehensive approach to tackling the root problems that 
lead to crime, and that these efforts must start at the earliest 
stages of a child's life.  Our efforts must bring together the 
expertise of those responsible for housing, social services, 
public health, recreation, schools and policing. Our efforts 
should include the contributions of the ordinary citizens who 
live and work in the very communities we seek to serve and 
protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the National Crime Prevention Council was established as 
part of the national strategy on community safety and crime 
prevention.  Together with the council and the Department of 
Justice, my department is targeting prevention programs where 
they are needed and will have the greatest impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These include aboriginal communities. In the coming months we 
plan to work more closely with aboriginal communities to develop 
crime prevention initiatives.  This speaks directly to the red 
book commitment concerning the reduction of crime in aboriginal 
communities by assisting these communities in the development of 
community driven activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another focus of our crime prevention activities involves young 
people.  Issues related to youth crime including the 
victimization of young people, the most vulnerable members of our 
society, will continue as a priority in my ministry.  We look 
forward to helping to renew and develop new partnerships between 
communities, the police, the voluntary sector and all levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area where partnership and co-operation are vitally 
important and one that is also aimed at improving the safety of 
our communities is that of information sharing among federal and 
provincial criminal justice agencies.  Corrections staff and the 
National Parole Board need police and court information to make 
good decisions on handling offenders.  In turn the police need 
corrections information to deal with released offenders.  Here 
again gains have been made in recent years to bring about 
improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke earlier of the need for the government to provide 
leadership in policing.  We have made a concerted effort over the 
last four years to consult with police to determine what tools we 
can develop to help them fight crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end just a few days ago I introduced legislation to 
create Canada's first national DNA data bank.  The data bank to 
be established and maintained by the RCMP will be a powerful 
investigative tool to help protect Canadians from violent and 
repeat criminals.  With this legislation Canada will become one 
of only a handful of countries to have a DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area where police have said they need more and sharper 
tools is in the fight against organized crime.  Organized 
criminal activities are clearly a matter of growing concern for 
the police, the general public and the government.  The recent 
bikers war in Quebec underscores that organized crime is not 
something intangible, something that happens in dark alleys 
hidden from view, but can and does have a direct impact on our 
neighbourhoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international trafficking in illicit drugs with associated 
money laundering continues to be the highest threat of all. 
Recognizing that organized crime knows no jurisdictional 
boundaries, our efforts to fight it are and will continue to be 
domestic, continental and international in scope.  Nationally 
there is a strong and growing commitment among police and law 
enforcement agencies in all jurisdictions to work with my 
ministry and the Department of Justice to build stronger 
partnerships to combat organized crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This fall I will be making in the House of Commons the first 
annual statement on organized crime to report on the 
implementation of the anti-gang legislation, Bill C-95, and our 
efforts to improve co-ordinated enforcement. Also in this regard 
I will be meeting tomorrow with Janet Reno, the American attorney 
general, to review progress and identify the next steps in our 
co-operative Canada-U.S. efforts to fight cross-border crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizen participation in determining solutions is no longer an 
option.  As far as we are concerned it is an obligation.  We in 
government must not forget our obligation to keep Canadians 
informed of developments in the criminal justice system. We need 
to share information about issues of importance to Canadians in 
order that we can have fruitful and informed discussions on those 
very issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to speak briefly as a minister from the 
province of New Brunswick. The throne speech was clear in stating 
that in order to secure a strong Canada for the 21st century, 
governments will need to work more closely with others in 
partnership. We will have to welcome new ideas that are citizen 
based, pursue more aggressively the strategic alliances available 
to us and consider collaboration an essential ingredient for our 
national and regional success. These are important messages. 
Co-operation, collaboration, sharing ideas and talents and 
collective problem solving are the essence of our ever evolving 
democracy.  It is about achieving together what we could not 
possibly do alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues are very complex and very numerous today and easy 
solutions are elusive, so elusive in fact that any chance for 
successful solutions usually requires collective thinking and 
action. Governments at all levels are becoming more mindful of 
this new imperative in the conduct of their business. As a result 
citizens can expect better decisions and more informed policy 
making from their leaders. This is important too in deciding what 
the state itself can do best and what the state should concede to 
the community as a better place for certain things to get done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example Canada's old age security and medicare benefits are 
regulated and funded by the national government and rightly so. 
The enviable success of these programs would not have been 
achieved without the resources and overarching presence of the 
federal authority. Regulating and distributing the country's 
wealth to achieve equitability among the provinces is a proper 
role for the federal government. However there have been other 
initiatives emanating from the nation's capital which have been 
more effectively implemented regionally or even better at the 
community level if that option were considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I earlier indicated my commitment to involve communities in the 
issue of crime prevention. Fixing crime in the different 
communities in our country will come only with the direct and 
meaningful involvement of those placed in and knowledgeable about 
the particular communities in which they reside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the national government in such cases should not be 
to prescribe solutions; rather government's role is to encourage 
and help facilitate a process of problem solving at the community 
level from the ground up. This approach to governing is not 
indicated only for crime prevention.  Communities it turns out 
are the best places to address a range of problems from poverty 
and unemployment to human resources development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the foresight of the four Atlantic premiers an 
Atlantic vision conference is being organized next month in 
Moncton. The conference is planned as an important step in a 
process of sharing and discovery aimed at economic recovery in 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will participate in the proceedings.  In 
fact I will attend the conference from start to finish.  Other 
federal ministers will also attend. The deliberations will be 
conducted in a true spirit of partnership, federally, 
provincially and interprovincially. This is as it should be and 
the better will be the chances of success for the conference and 
for our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that economic growth solutions in Atlantic Canada will 
be found in Atlantic Canada if each of the four provinces seeks 
solutions on their own for a stronger economy. The Atlantic 
vision conference will feature sharing, collaboration and 
consensus building.  It aims for the crystallization of federal, 
provincial and industry participation in the region's future 
development.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While we recognize there is a great deal to be done, it is the 
beginning of a voyage toward economic recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic premiers deserve our commendation for their vision 
in undertaking this project.  The leadership in Atlantic Canada 
recognizes it is a part of a larger community which is Canada. 
The challenge is to find ways for all Atlantic Canadians to both 
contribute to and share in our national bounty. The Atlantic 
vision conference plays quite largely in making this possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be a collaborative exercise, one which I understand 
very well.  In my own constituency I have made it a practice to 
hold regular, broadly based, very visible community forums.  I 
held a forum on aboriginal justice issues during the third week 
of August in Fredericton.  Other consultations I have engaged in 
in the short time I have been solicitor general include meetings 
with IACOLE, the Canadian criminal justice system, the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police, the aboriginal police chiefs and 
the national reference group which we established with some 40 
organizations. We spent a day together here in Ottawa discussing 
the issues of importance to that community. I also visited the 
RCMP depot in Regina to discuss policing issues with members of 
the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We approach the new millennium with great optimism, but we also 
recognize that difficult decisions will have to be made.  I 
firmly believe that we are on track, that we are making progress 
and that we are well equipped to handle both the challenges and 
the opportunities which lie ahead. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
last week I had the opportunity to ask a parliamentary secretary 
a question about section 745.  In her response she indicated she 
felt the legislation which the government had brought forward 
achieved a fair balance.  I can tell the minister, man to man, 
that it does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had people visit my office who have been fearful for 
their lives.  They are fearful because of a murder which occurred 
15 years ago.  The murder was so bad that the presiding judge 
said there would be no opportunity for parole for a minimum of 25 
years.  That was a condition of the sentence.  My constituents 
have now been put in the position of being fearful for their 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this from the bottom of my heart.  I have never been in 
the presence of people who have been so petrified, so scared for 
their lives.  This was a case of first degree murder.  The judge 
said it was such a heinous crime that the individual would not be 
permitted parole for 25 years.  These people are being put 
through a meat grinder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the solicitor general to answer my constituents. 
How is it that this government can be so unfeeling and so callous 
toward the victims, the family members of the victims and the 
family members of the murderer himself?  Why do they have to go 
through this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, today when a judge sentences a first degree murderer and 
says this crime is so heinous that this individual may not have 
the opportunity for parole for 25 years, what do those words 
mean?  They mean nothing.  Under existing legislation he will be 
able to apply for parole in 15 years, notwithstanding the 
sentencing recommendations of the judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the solicitor general please explain to my constituents, 
indeed to all Canadians, why the government insists on giving 
this open door policy to first degree murderers at the expense of 
the people who are the victims in these cases?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
reassure the member of my own strong feelings about these issues 
as well.  Surely all members of the House would recognize that 
each of us deals with people in the circumstances that the member 
has referred to in our activities as members of Parliament and 
each of us is moved by those stories. I am certain the member 
recognizes that of all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the government's reaction to the circumstances that 
we found when we took office in 1993, actions were taken. They 
have been repeated often and I will repeat them again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is the likelihood of a person's being able to 
exercise what has become known as the faint hope clause in the 
Criminal Code has been limited by the fact that now there is a 
screening process where a judge would have to determine the 
likelihood of success.  Originally in the legislation eight out 
of twelve members of the jury had to make that determination. 
Now it has to be unanimous. Those are just two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that the likelihood of that option being 
exercised, the likelihood of people having access to liberty, as 
I think the reference was by the member to an open door policy, 
is not really reflective of the likelihood of that happening.  It 
is really more likely to be an extremely faint hope.  That is the 
position of the government to this point.  It is one that I 
believe does strike the balance that the Minister of Justice 
refers to.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the solicitor general for 
attaining one of the highest positions that any lawyer in this 
country can attain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is a furtherance of a question brought forward by 
the hon. member from Saint John.  It refers to the devolution of 
powers of ports police to municipal police officers and 
potentially RCMP officers. This has happened most recently in 
Vancouver. There are plans to do the same in the port of Saint 
John as well as the port of Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this sit in terms of its consistency with the 
government's position in terms of firearms.  Trying to keep 
illegal firearms out of this country is going to be a huge 
problem when we have municipal police officers trying to do the 
specialized job of policing ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the policy that the government is putting forward in 
terms of firearms sit with its decision to devolve this 
specialized task presently performed by ports police? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
intervention.  It is our first opportunity to engage in this 
place, and I suspect it will be the first of many.  That is a 
healthy thing among maritimers, I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also correct the reference in his question to the fact 
that it is the highest office perhaps that a lawyer can hold.  It 
is also the highest office a sociologist can hold, I think, since 
I am not a lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak specifically to the question of port 
police.  I have had occasion to meet with the authority in Saint 
John.  We have discussed this issue on a number of fronts, having 
to do with questions of security and also questions of job 
security and so on.  I know members opposite are concerned about 
that.  I have begun an initiative to see what might be done in 
that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remind everyone that there remains an overarching 
criminal responsibility with the RCMP that is collaborative with 
whomever, local police authorities in our ports.  The good work 
of the former mayor of Saint John to bring the municipal police 
force to the level it is will lend itself to a wonderful port 
authority and police authority in that city.

would be no devolution of powers to Quebec police forces in that area. 
But that is just for the time being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the solicitor general heard of a timetable for the transfer of 
police duties from the RCMP to the Sûreté du Québec or other appropriate 
police forces in Quebec? Could he tell us what we can expect in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the presence of the RCMP at 
Mirabel and Dorval reflects changes that are going on with regard 
to those two airports that cannot be duplicated anywhere else in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the timetable is concerned, it really falls within the 
responsibilities of the Minister of Transport in terms of his 
responsibility to provide the security of those airports.  The 
RCMP, in this case, is simply meeting the needs as they are 
identified by him.  As to how long we will be doing that, I say 
quite honestly that will be really up to the Ministry of 
Transport to make that determination.  The RCMP is simply there 
meeting that need as requested.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has delivered on its key 1993 election promise 
to restore fiscal responsibility to the nation after the record 
$42 billion annual deficit we inherited from the predecessor 
Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Speech from the Throne has noted, we are now well ahead 
of our own optimistic 1993 projections to balance the budget by 
the year 2000.  We expect to achieve this budgetary goal no later 
than the fiscal year 1998-99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are putting the debt to GDP ratio on a permanent downward 
track and we have undertaken to devote one-half of the 
anticipated annual surplus to a combination of reducing taxes for 
Canadian citizens and amortizing the vast accumulated national 
debt left behind by the predecessor Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other half of the anticipated annual surplus will be 
addressed to the social and economic needs of Canadians.  In 
striving over the period 1993-97 to get rid of those huge annual 
budgetary deficits that had become standard practice, we insisted 
on maintaining the integrity of our famed Canadian social 
security network and our pensions and free national medicare 
systems.  We will continue these policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will note from the Speech from the Throne that the 
government has understood, better I think than governments in 
other countries, that the approaching 21st century will be a 
knowledge century dominated by those who have mastered the new 
sciences and technologies and who have comprehended the 
infomatics revolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our last budgets we invested heavily in education capital 
from the $167 million for the TRIUMPH advanced physics research 
project at the University of British Columbia, with its direct 
spin-off to major industrial export contracts abroad, to the 
foundation for innovation with $800 million for modernizing 
advanced research infrastructures in health and medicine, 
environment, science and engineering, and the $50 million a year 
for creating networks for centres of excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada leads today in the aerospace industry, 
biopharmaceuticals, biotechnology in agriculture and fisheries 
and environmental information and telecommunications 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where our last budget offered $137 million in post-secondary 
education support for 1997 and substantially increased 
scholarship and tax credits for post-secondary students and their 
families, the Speech from the Throne commits to a new millennium 
scholarship endowment fund intended to reward academic excellence 
and to open access to universities and colleges for the well 
qualified children from low and moderate income families 
throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognizing the key to national economic prosperity and 
access to meaningful long term employment for our young people 
lies in community investment in higher education and in advanced 
research, the government has learnt the main lesson from the 
ending of the cold war that dominated world community relations 
for half a century after World War II.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The old political military base of world public order where 
effective power was determined by the number of intercontinental 
ballistic missiles that one had in one's arsenal is completely 
out of date. Of what value are those remaining ICBMs in their 
silos and an aging nuclear powered submarine navy if one's 
economic house is not in order? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new base of world public order in relations between states 
is economic-industrial.  The use or the threat of the use of 
force as a solver of international problems has increasingly 
yielded to peaceful modes of dispute settlement that rely heavily 
on friendly co-operation and reciprocity and mutual advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne there is a renewed commitment to 
an activist, independent, internationalist role for Canada in the 
world community in the tradition of our one time Prime Minister 
and Nobel peace laureate Lester Pearson whose centenary we 
celebrate this year.  In this spirit we are co-operating with 
like-minded countries in revitalizing and modernizing and also 
democratizing the United Nations by seeking to expand the 
membership of the security council on a more broadly 
representative and legally egalitarian basis without any 
extension of those special privileges that were conferred on the 
five permanent members at the time of the UN's founding in 1945 
and which seem increasingly out of date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to continuing our longstanding historical commitment 
to the protection of the international environment and to the 
conservation of the earth's diminishing natural resources, as 
part of, in the United Nation's own phrase, the common heritage 
of humankind, we have led in the achievement of a new 
international treaty signed by 90 countries recently in Oslo 
banning anti-personnel mines which have so cruelly killed or 
maimed hundreds of thousands of innocent non-combatant men, women 
and children around the world in the bloody civil wars of our 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than pursuing some far off larger international consensus 
that might have included also holdout superpowers at the price 
however of open-ended exemptions or delays or special 
geographical regional exceptions, our foreign minister has 
preferred to move now on behalf of a clear and unequivocal treaty 
text that really does have some teeth in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the formal signing ceremony in Ottawa this December, we do 
expect other countries beyond the 90 who have already rallied to 
the cause to join and to help perhaps to educate by their own 
positive example the numerically small but still important and 
also politically disparate groups of holdout states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue our efforts on two oceans, the Atlantic and the 
Pacific, to ensure respect and full compliance with existing 
international law obligations, both multilateral and also special 
bilateral as to the protection of endangered fish resources and 
their equitable sharing under law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will maintain the position that we have advanced in the 
international battle against the Helms-Burton law that a state in 
the application of its own national laws is limited as to any 
purported extraterritorial reach by the legal principles of 
international comity and the duty at the same time to respect the 
legal sovereignty of other states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are continuing our efforts to establish an international 
criminal court which as a court of universal and general 
jurisdiction would replace limited geographical sectoral bodies 
like the recent ad hoc jurisdictions as the former Yugoslavia and 
also Rwanda. It might necessarily extend also to cover United 
Nations peacekeeping forces and other regional or state forces 
operating under UN legal authority or under the UN aegis 
generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end of the 20th century as an era of historical transition 
has seen a remarkable convergence of two contradictory historical 
forces:  the movement toward supranationalism and political and 
sometimes economic integration on a regional or at least 
transnational basis and the revival of local nationalism and 
ethnocultural particularism sometimes on a pathological basis 
that finds its outlet in internecine conflict within the one 
state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our renewed commitment in Canada to a strong internationalist 
foreign policy indicates our own Canadian, more optimistic view 
of the coming century and of the ability to achieve a genuinely 
one world outlook in a plural world community through the United 
Nations and related international institutions of the world 
community.

am indeed honoured to rise in the House today, the House that 
John George Diefenbaker, Pierre Elliott Trudeau and Tommy Douglas 
have spoken in.  It is for me a great honour as the son of a 
market gardener to speak in this House in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the riding of Scarborough East which is bounded on 
the east by the largest urban wilderness park in Canada, the 
Rouge River Park, and on the south by the Scarborough bluffs 
which rise from the shores of Lake Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have lived all my life in the riding. The riding was at one 
time a rural area of sleepy villages and was largely 
agricultural.  Since that time Toronto has grown out over top of 
the riding.  Had you said to my father or anyone else at the time 
that buses would be running up and down in front of his front 
door, he would have questioned your sanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a riding of about 100,000 people, 40 per cent of whom describe 
their mother tongue as something other than an official language. 
As a consequence in our constituency office we serve our people 
in at least eight languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of my speech is to talk about the role of a 
parliamentarian in this parliament which takes us into the 
millennium.  It is a wonderful opportunity on the part of any 
parliamentarian to be able to participate in the process. During 
the time leading up to the writing of the Speech from the Throne, 
the prime minister invited members of our caucus to make 
submissions to him, both written and oral, concerning the 
contents of the Speech from the Throne.  I was very pleased to 
see that the prime minister picked up on certain themes and ideas 
and wrote those into the Speech from the Throne.  I would like to 
thank the prime minister for his willingness to listen to us as 
members of his caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular the prime minister embraced the idea that this 
parliament and the government will be taking this nation into the 
21st century.  It is a monumental opportunity to foster a sense 
of nationhood, a sense of growth in our country and a sense of 
where we as Canadians can come together.  We cannot simply expect 
that this will happen.  Nationhood needs to be nurtured much like 
children need to be nurtured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as members of the 36th Parliament will be given a privilege 
never afforded to any of our predecessors.  We will take Canada 
into the new century and the new millennium. We can make it a 
noble time to build our nation or we can make it a destructive 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our citizens watch us daily and frequently they do not like what 
they see.  For instance, the 26th Parliament engaged in an 
intense debate about the national flag and the result of that 
debate graces this Chamber today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 27th Parliament introduced full health insurance to 
Canada.  It was hotly debated, but its defenders, Prime Minister 
Pearson, Minister Martin and MP Douglas, won out.  As a result, 
Canada now has one of the best health systems in the world.  This 
is one of the things which define our country and a source of 
general pride. It is an affirmation of Canadian values. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That parliament and that government also set this nation on a 
course to celebrate in a manner never seen before.  Canada was 
strong.  It was proud and it was united.  I remember travelling 
with my family from what was then a relatively provincial Toronto 
to the sophisticated city of Montreal to see that great city for 
the first time and to wonder at Man and his World exposition and 
to ride on the metro. Every community in Canada celebrated its 
centennial in one manner or another.  My own community raised a 
hospital and today it still serves our community well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those parliaments did great things.  Likewise this parliament 
can also do great things as we distance ourselves from the 
financial doom and gloom of the past number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was delighted to see that a member of the 26th Parliament, 
namely our prime minister, has asked a member of the 25th 
Parliament, namely the deputy prime minister to initiate the 
organizational process required to appropriately mark our entry 
into the millennium. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will help strike partnerships between 
governments, communities and people in celebration of the new 
millennium.  Many Canadians have original ideas and suggestions for 
millennium projects.  Parliamentarians of all parties will be given 
the opportunity to suggest activities to mark the millennium. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has invited members of Parliament to mark the millennium in 
ways that will celebrate our great nation.  We will be able to go 
into our communities and ask our citizens for their input.  It is 
a wonderful opportunity for the House to make submissions to the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has always been a source of disappointment to me that so few 
Canadians seem to appreciate or are aware of their history.  I 
had a number of rather salutary experiences this summer which 
made me aware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu in the valley of the forts 
and I was instructed about the history of that area.  I as an 
speaking Canadian was not aware of the significance of the role 
played by the valley of the forts in the preservation of our 
nation.  There was basically guerrilla theatre between the 
Mohawks, the English, the Americans and the French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had occasion to attend a University of Ottawa conference on 
the constitution.  What struck me forcefully was a presentation 
by aboriginal peoples and the dates of points of significance to 
those people of which I was not aware. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interviewing a candidate in my office, a Tamil woman.  I 
asked her how and why she came to Canada.  Little did I know that 
her answer would touch us both in such a profound way. She was 
married in a traditional Muslim ceremony and her husband 
thereafter immediately left for Canada.  Her next communication 
was from her husband's family to indicate that he had died.  She 
came to Canada for his funeral. She then was able to stay in 
Canada and by one means or another gain her citizenship. She 
returned home and her passport was lost.  A Tamil woman in Sri 
Lanka is a vulnerable person. When the Canadian embassy was able 
to intervene and secure her, she at that point felt like she was 
a Canadian. She spoke with such tremendous conviction that I was 
absolutely astounded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It brings me to the point that we do not speak to each other. We 
speak past each other, we speak around each other, but we do not 
speak to each other. I would offer to the Deputy Prime Minister 
the suggestion that we use means, both electronic and written to 
start the process of communicating to each other, that our 
history be recognized that there are at least four groups, 
aboriginal people, French people, English people and immigrant 
people who experience Canada in their own way.  I ask that the 
Deputy Prime Minister explore ways in which that can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that we need to assemble stories and pictures 
from across our land so that we will be able to communicate to 
each other what is historically and personally important to us so 
that we can make our communities even stronger.  I would suggest 
that is a fitting way to mark our millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Canada needs to develop its symbols of nationhood.  I 
believe that one way to celebrate our millennium would be for our 
government to strike a millennium medal. That medal would be set 
out so that individuals in our country who have contributed to 
our nationhood would be recognized by the government and by 
Parliament. Similarly, a millennial stamp could be issued which 
again would mark the build-up of our nationhood.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I may, 
I will start with a reply to each of the hon. members who have 
shared their time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first speaker referred to the deficit left behind by the 
Conservatives, which the government succeeded in cutting by 
$42 billion.  I would remind the hon. member that the Conservative 
reign was preceded by 21 years of Mr. Trudeau in this House, which 
makes the Liberal government primarily responsible for the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is right to be concerned about the deficit. 
The Bloc Quebecois will do everything in its power to help the 
government reduce its deficit. 
As we have been saying since our arrival in this House in 
1993, we do not want to reduce the government's deficit by cutting 
assistance to the least well-off and hardest-hit members of our 
society, including the unemployed.  It is, of course, easy to 
reduce the deficit by $42 billion when the government does so, as 
I have said, by cutting benefits to the most disadvantaged and to 
the unemployed, and by such actions as helping itself to $5 billion 
from the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present government is increasingly concerned with other 
people's business, and less and less with its own.  And how did it 
manage to reduce the deficit by $42 billion? By pulling out of 
regional economic development, as I will explain.  We know that the 
present government has pulled out of wharf operations. 
The federal government has pulled out of the wharves belonging to 
Transport Canada, Harbours and Ports Canada, Fisheries and Oceans, 
and Parks Canada.  Why?  To privatize its infrastructures and 
transfer them to provincial or regional authorities so as to avoid 
running a deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, as part of its policy to hand over the operation of 
airports, the government is withdrawing from regional airport 
development.  Charlevoix has struggled to maintain the Charlevoix 
airport, but the government refuses to refurbish this airport, 
which has been neglected for a number of years.  No money has been 
spent on it, and today they want to transfer it to Charlevoix. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government boasts of reducing the deficit by $42 
billion, but it did so by cutting employment insurance, by closing 
regional offices and especially by cutting transfer payments to the 
provinces.  This forces provinces like Quebec to make financial 
adjustments by cutting in the sectors of health, education and 
social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question in closing.  Do members agree 
that we can reduce the deficit without cutting aid to the most 
disadvantaged and that we should continue to eliminate waste? 
Allow me to cite only two examples, since I have only five minutes. 
I could list several hours worth of examples of government waste, 
but I will mention only two: promoting Canadian unity and promoting 
the Canadian flag, which has been recognized for over 100 years.

week.  It was not very good.  I am seeing the movie again this 
week.  It has not improved.  I expect that I will see the movie 
again next week. The hon. member needs to know that as we enter 
into the millennium we can do it together.

of a subsequent Canada-Russian series in which there was an 
absolutely sublime pass from the boy from Brantford to Super 
Mario and Super Mario deked the goalie and tucked it in upstairs.

municipalities of Beauharnois, Huntingdon and Napierville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who put their trust in me and voted for me last June I thank 
from the bottom of my heart.  I give my word to those who elected me, 
and to all those I represent here in Parliament, that I will carry out 
my public duties with deep and sincere respect for my new office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to pay my respects to my Bloc Quebecois 
predecessor, Laurent Lavigne, to whom I wish a well deserved rest before 
another referendum on Quebec's political future is called and he is 
again called upon to help build a country, a plan that he must not have 
lost sight of in his retreat in Saint-Stanislas-de-Kostka. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne was disappointing. As I listened to it 
in the Senate, last Tuesday, I could not help but be disappointed by a 
government program with so little vision, by a speech lacking 
consistency, apparently designed to lead us into the next century. It is 
a collection of empty words, cautious commitments and artful dodges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois has already brought to 
light the weaknesses in this speech and they will continue to do 
so all week long. The proposed initiatives to promote Canada's 
economic, social and cultural development are far from innovative 
and unlikely to give hope and create the momentum required to get 
the men, women and children of this country excited about the 
21th century.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for foreign affairs. Considering that our country 
paid tribute to the memory of Lester B. Pearson by mentioning the 100th 
anniversary of his birthday in the September 23 speech, the throne 
speech definitely did not put enough emphasis on foreign affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current foreign affairs minister, who may succeed Lester B. 
Pearson as a Nobel peace prize recipient, did not manage to convince his 
government to give foreign affairs the importance they deserve in its 
agenda. Merely listing a few measures will not provide a vision to our 
foreign policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's initiatives to ban antipersonnel land mines, promote human 
rights and protect the environment are definitely good measures and will 
get the Bloc Quebecois' support when, as in the previous Parliament, we 
feel they are compatible with Quebec's interests and those of the 
international community as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Bloc Quebecois will not hesitate to condemn the 
positions of a government that constantly reduces its official 
development assistance, or whose approach is inconsistent as 
regards the linkage of human rights and international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will also condemn the fact that Canada is slow 
to ratify a treaty as important as the American convention on human 
rights and seems too reserved regarding the inclusion of cultural 
exemptions in international trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can also count on me, as the new Bloc Quebecois critic on 
foreign affairs, to expose a government that puts its foreign policy at 
the service of national unity. I will display unprecedented vigilance in 
this regard, and I will not miss any opportunity to respond to those who 
seek to jeopardize Quebec's autonomy at the international level, to take 
away the voice Quebec has gained, after an endless struggle, with 
various states and international institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who would try to keep the Bloc Quebecois and its 
spokespersons from speaking to foreign officials in Ottawa and around 
the world about the political project of the Quebec government, a 
project shared by both the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois, will 
not succeed in preventing us from doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are probably not surprised to hear me say that the throne 
speech has very little to inspire those who seek to put an end to 
the constitutional deadlock. I respect those who promote Canadian 
unity, who find some degree of comfort in the Calgary declaration 
and who believe in its potential to produce a reform satisfactory 
to Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords, in my opinion 
the Calgary declaration does not contain the elements which would 
allow Quebecers to live with a Canadian federalism based on the 
equality of provinces and individuals rather than on the 
recognition and freedom of peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have less respect, however, for those who support Plan B, 
those who are anticipating the failure of Plan A. To the 
ministers and members of this House who wish to insure unity 
through basically undemocratic pronouncements and measures and 
who are setting us all on a collision course, my response is that 
the people of Quebec is sovereign and will, when the time is 
ripe, reject any plan intended to restrict its freedom to be 
master of its own  destiny. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now time to acknowledge the diverging views of the peoples 
of Quebec and Canada on the nature and structure of the 
federation.  It is time to reconcile Canada and Quebec in a new 
kind of partnership, a novel form of union between genuine 
sovereign states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not consider calling it a Canadian union, just like René 
Lévesque did in 1967, an entity that could foster the possibility 
of going beyond the unsuitable and inappropriate federal 
structure that has bound the peoples of Canada and Quebec for the 
past 130 years. The challenges of Quebeckers and Canadians will 
then be nation building, affirming the unique personalities of 
their two countries, and union building that is defining their 
common destiny within a novel body politic.

monarchy to renew Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, for us Quebecers, for those who 
share the idea that Quebec ought to become a sovereign country, it 
is the people who will be sovereign. The people will determine the 
head of State.  Discussions will be held on who this should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I can tell you is that there are many sovereignists who 
wish to see Quebec remain in the Commonwealth, like other nations 
which have remained in the Commonwealth but do not necessarily have 
the Queen as their head of State.  Quebec's anglophones will no 
doubt do a fine job of representing a sovereign Quebec within the 
Commonwealth's institutions, and we will be proud to have them 
representing all Quebecers there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

</I></B></P><P align=left>He quoted a poem by Robert Frost.  I can quote another poem 
called <I>The Road Not Taken</I>.  The poet indicated of the two options that life 
always offers.  Dare I hope that, during his parliamentary career 
here, the member may consider the other path, that of renewed federalism, 
adapted to the needs of the modern world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary 
secretary and I hope my behaviour in this House may be as dignified 
as his own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Quebecers have long debated the two roads, and 
continue to do so.  With the Bélanger-Campeau commission, they once 
again agreed to debate renewed federalism.  Since 1990, this road 
of renewed federalism has seemed to be a dead end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear, as we did again this weekend, major political 
personages from the rest of Canada saying that the Calgary 
declaration is unacceptable to the rest of Canada, the implication 
is that, yet again, the road of renewed federalism is a dead end.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, the road to sovereignty and partnership is 
the most credible alternative.  It the most valid one for Quebecers 
and the one that will make Quebec a country that is open to the 
realities of the world and a player in the international community, 
desirous, to a large extent, of maintaining the economic and 
monetary union that the people and sovereign states of Europe, for 
example, have maintained while retaining their sovereignty.

founded the aboriginal people were here and that when the 
francophone people arrived the aboriginal people said to them 
“come on to the land and we will continue to build Canada?” 
Then the anglophone people arrived and the francophone people and 
the aboriginal people shook hands and said “come, we will build 
Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all the same.  We are all one and we form Canada.  I say

of the hon. member.  I appreciate her concern and her will to 
make Quebec part of Canada.  However there are differences. There 
are things that have not functioned well.  There are solutions 
other than federalism to bind the futures of people together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have exhausted constitutional remedies in Quebec. 
There will be evidence shortly that the Calgary declaration shows 
once again that the views of other Canadians and Quebeckers are 
irreconcilable.  We will see once again that those constitutional 
remedies have been exhausted.  Then we will have to find a 
solution.  We will have to find a solution to bind the future of 
people living on the same land together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me and for many Quebeckers of all generations that solution 
is sovereignty accompanied by an offer of partnership which will 
be made and will continue to be made in good faith by Quebeckers 
like myself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
some emotion, and understandably so, that I address this House for the 
very first time. After ten years of militant action in favour of 
sovereignty, I finally have a chance to pursue my action as an elected 
representative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to thank the voters in the great and 
beautiful riding of Charlesbourg who have chosen me to represent them. 
I was born and raised in Charlesbourg and I still live there. It is a 
privilege for me to work for the people of Charlesbourg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Great people have spoken in this House. One who comes to mind is a 
man who was first elected to this place and, later in his political 
career, went on to become the premier of Quebec. 
I am referring to Honoré Mercier. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Honoré Mercier went down in Quebec history as a man who asked 
Quebecers to set their partisan divisions aside. People rallied around 
him and his national party with the deepest conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the unveiling of the Cartier-Brébeuf monument in Quebec City, in 
1889, he made a famous utterance: “Let us stop fighting among brothers 
and unite”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A century later, the Bloc Quebecois has answered his call. 
While advocating a sovereign Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois is asking all 
Quebecers, whether they are federalists or sovereignists, Socialists, 
Liberals, Conservatives, ADQ or PQ supporters, to rally around and join 
forces to fight for the democratic rights of Quebeckers as well as for 
their institutions and their freedom to decide their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early 19th century, Louis-Joseph Papineau and the Patriot 
movement fought for democracy and for the rights of those who were 
called Canadians at the time and are now known as Quebeckers. Papineau 
fought to ensure that his people, and not some unelected individuals, 
decide the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad, a shame really, to see this struggle we thought was over 
resurface today. 
Once again, attempts are being made to take away from Quebeckers the 
right to democratically decide their future and ask an unelected body, 
namely the Supreme Court of Canada in this instance, to decide for them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of view that the future of a nation should be decided 
by the people and not by elected officials was shared by Thomas 
Jefferson.  Jefferson said “I can think of no safer depository 
for the ultimate powers of society than in the people 
themselves”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expect my colleagues from the Reform Party to agree with this 
statement as it is written in the conference room at their 
party's headquarters in Calgary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We the sovereignists are the defenders of democracy in Quebec. 
Our goal is to ensure that Quebeckers have the right to decide 
their own future.  That future is one that we are confident will 
be as a sovereign and proud country, dealing as an equal with its 
friend and neighbour, Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc is back. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, let ask ourselves if it is possible to reconcile justice and 
escalation. Let me use a practical example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine you have a dispute with a neighbour and that neighbour 
wants to have a third party settle the issue. It goes without saying 
that you would never accept that third party to be someone appointed and 
paid by your neighbour. Moreover, should the decision be based on a 
contract which you have always refused to sign, you would have another 
reason to object. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, this is precisely what this government is attempting to do. 
Supreme Court judges are appointed by the federal government. They are 
paid by the federal government and, moreover, they will interpret a 
document that every Quebec government has refused to sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what they call justice, Mr. Speaker? Not I. Justice will be 
done when Quebeckers are free to decide, and they will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The carelessness of the current federal government is obvious in 
the throne speech. There is nothing good in it for Quebec. The 
unemployment level for my generation is tragic. Some even refer to us as 
<I>generation x</I>. Still, there is absolutely nothing in the throne speech to 
solve this most urgent problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fight against the deficit was conducted at the expense of the 
poor, including young people, and they will not forget, believe me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the part of the speech entitled “Building Safer 
Communities”, it hides another attempt by the federal government to 
encroach on areas of provincial jurisdiction. Once again, the federal 
government is acting like a bull in a china shop. But there is more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $30 million program to fight crime is a rehash. It was already 
public news on December 12, 1996, when the <I>Globe and Mail</I> published an 
article on it, on page A16 for those who want to go back and read it. 
There is nothing new. This is further evidence of this government's 
total lack of imagination.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Still in that same part of the speech, I am pleased to see that 
the government decided to develop alternatives to imprisonment 
for non-violent, low-risk offenders. The government has finally 
listened to the Bloc Quebecois, which has always stressed the 
importance of rehabilitation. The Liberal government is once 
again proving the Bloc Quebecois right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying it is an honour for me to be here. I am

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a question for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it true that the term “Canadian” is inclusive and the term 
“Quebecer” exclusive, and that, accordingly, Canadians are a people and 
Quebecers a society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. Speaker, had I rewritten the question to 
please myself, I would not have written it differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that there are some things that must be made very clear. 
We are now speaking about the people of Quebec, a very inclusive concept 
that includes francophones, anglophones, allophones and the first 
nations.  The advocates of partition are the ones who are using 
exclusive terms and who are dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have long accepted that all 
Quebec's anglophones and allophones form part of the people of Quebec. 
Partitioners are the ones who have decided to equate national or ethnic 
boundaries with political boundaries.  The Quebec we dream of and want 
to build will be inclusive and will include the people of all nations 
and all the immigrants who come here in search of freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You may rely on the Bloc Quebecois to make of Quebec a people who 
are open-minded, tolerant and generous, and not an ethnic group, as 
certain people would have us believe. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
begin by congratulating the hon. member for Charlesbourg on his 
first speech in the House of Commons.  I listened carefully to 
what he had to say.  I also listened carefully to some of the 
questions his colleagues asked of colleagues of mine earlier 
today with respect to the understanding of the existence or 
non-existence of the Quebecois people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge the history of that notion.  It is fair for the 
member to notice the NDP, going back to its formation in 1961, 
has always been ready to acknowledge that dimension of the 
collective existence of the Quebec people.  We continue to argue 
that can be achieved, recognized and enhanced within the context 
of a continuing Canadian federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons we invite members of the Bloc and other 
Quebeckers to do that is that the minute we begin to give up on 
this notion and entertain notions of separation, we come up 
against the hard political and philosophical reality that it is 
not just the Quebecois and the Quebecoises who consider 
themselves a people but, for instance, the aboriginal people of 
Quebec are also a people. It seems to me that we invite an 
infinite reductionism of self-determination the minute we get 
into the question of separation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the member not considered the difficulty that would be posed 
for Canada and for Quebec in the event of a separation and in the 
event the Cree people of Quebec decided that they, in their own 
democratic self-determining way, did not want to continue to be a 
member of Quebec as it is now understood but rather a member of 
what would be left of Canada after such a separation?  How does 
he regard their democratic rights understood in that context? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question.  The Government of Quebec was the first government 
in Canada to recognize the existence of the aboriginal nations. 
We are proud to have done so.  We continue to extend our 
friendship to the aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My dream of a sovereign Quebec is a Quebec nation working in 
partnership with the Canadian nation and in a partnership with 
the aboriginal nations of Quebec.  Dealing with the Canadian 
people, Quebec people and the aboriginal peoples equally in that 
triangle is the key to the future of Quebec, Canada and the 
aboriginal people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Edmonton—Strathcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, like other members, congratulate you on your appointment to 
the Chair.  On behalf of the constituents of Dauphin—Swan River 
I wish you a very successful term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured and privileged to be in the House of Commons 
representing the people of Dauphin—Swan River.  I thank the 
people of Dauphin—Swan River for the honour.   I pledge to them 
that as I take my seat on their behalf it is my responsibility to 
be accountable to them first and foremost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to describe to the House the make-up of 
Dauphin—Swan River.  It is as unique as the country itself. 
Dauphin—Swan River is located in west central Manitoba, the 
second largest settled area riding.  It is a land of lakes, 
mountains and prairies.  It is multilingual and multicultural. 
The people speak English, French, Ukrainian and Saulteaux. 
Culturally it is predominantly English, Ukrainian, French and 
aboriginal.  The people of Dauphin—Swan River celebrate this 
diversity with enthusiasm throughout the year.  We are all proud 
of our ethnic heritage but we are prouder to be Canadians first. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a more personal note, I am a third generation Canadian.  My 
Chinese grandfather came to Canada to help build the railway in the 
late 1800s.  My wife Lynda, nee Burelle, is ninth generation.  Her 
roots go back to 1660, to the arrival in Quebec of Étienne Burelle 
and Marie Tellier from the parish of Saint-Séverin in Paris.  They 
settled near Varennes, in Quebec. The Quebec Burelles moved west to 
Manitoba only in the 1900s. We both still have relatives in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that many Canadians are in the same position. Quebec 
is as important to us as any other province in which we have 
family members. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Dauphin—Swan River sent me to the House to make 
sure their concerns are heard.  They are not happy about the lack 
of jobs, the rising cost of post-secondary education, the 
dismantling of the health care system, the price of grain as 
announced recently by the Canadian Wheat Board, the cost of 
transporting farm products to market, the political manipulation 
of the grain transportation system over the last 40 years, an 
ineffective Young Offenders Act, and the lack of justice in that 
criminals appear to have more rights than law-abiding citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Dauphin—Swan River the issue of gun control implemented by 
the former justice minister is unacceptable to the people.  This 
bill has been very divisive for Canada.  It has put Canadians in 
two camps, those living in large urban centres and those living 
in rural settings.  The gun control of the government will no 
doubt make criminals out of millions of otherwise law-abiding 
Canadians across the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the deputy critic for national unity my role is to ensure 
that the grassroots at the municipal level are listened to and 
that they have a pivotal role to play in the future of Canada.  I 
believe that we have failed over the last 40 years in the unity 
debate because we have used the wrong process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's vision was seen through the eyes of the Right Hon. 
Pierre Trudeau in the 1970s.  In the 1980s the vision was through 
the eyes of the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney.  In the 1990s there 
has been a struggle between the old school and the new school. 
The old school wants to stick with a closed door, top down 
approach to solving Canada's challenges and problems on unity and 
on most other issues as well.  The new school wants to throw open 
the windows and let in the fresh air, open the doors and let the 
people bring their ideas to the table and have a real part in 
making the decisions.  Sadly the old school is so far barely 
letting the windows and doors crack open.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the next millennium belongs to the people of 
Canada, without a doubt.  During the last forty years, the 
politicians have failed miserably with their top-down approach to 
unifying the country.  Now is it the citizens' turn to address the 
issues of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, Canadians are interested in their day to day 
needs—jobs, health care, housing—and not in constitutional 
disputes between parties and governments.  My constituents have 
indicated to me that we must start by solving problems, and must 
treat all citizens of this marvellous country on an equal footing. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In past weeks I wrote to the provincial premiers suggesting the 
process of consultation be open and transcend political loyalties 
and partisan politics.  I also asked the premiers to encourage 
the municipal leaders to participate in holding town hall style 
meetings in each community open to the residents.  The community 
meetings would be assisted by facilitators, information provided 
by provincial governments, input from experts and include the 
participation of local MLAs and MPPs.  In short it would put the 
town back in the unity town halls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the key to this process is open discussion.  Only 
then would the people of Canada have an opportunity to discuss 
and debate the issues on the future of their country.  The House 
belongs to the people as so does the future of the country.

confident that you will uphold the integrity and the proud 
tradition of this position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take the opportunity to thank my

I will work tirelessly to ensure that change occurs in this

and support.  It has not been easy for them to take the sole 
responsibility of running our family owned business in my 
absence.  While their eldest son is engrossed in the adventure of 
his life, they are carrying the burden of running the daily 
operations of our family owned coffee shop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think my parents were a little skeptical when I first threw my 
hat into the political arena, but despite their skepticism they 
supported and encouraged me over many long months of campaigning 
and are truly the unsung heroes of my political success.  I would 
like to thank my parents also for teaching me the values I now 
bring to political life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My family arrived in Canada in 1972. They were penniless 
refugees who fled Uganda and the brutal regime of Idi Amin.  They 
came to Canada to rebuild their lives.  They came to escape 
tyranny and embrace Liberty.  They came to find a haven from 
racial prejudice in a country renowned for its tolerance and 
equality.  With a belief in hard work and with a commitment to 
meritocracy, they began to rebuild their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like all children do, I learned from their words and their 
deeds.  I saw that with hard work comes success.  That was the 
opportunity Canada offered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw that my parents were allowed to pursue business 
opportunities and were allowed to keep the fruits of their 
labour.  There was no dictator who could confiscate our property 
because he did not like the colour of our skin.  That was the 
freedom Canada offered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw that my parents, even though they were small business 
owners, were treated with the same respect as other Canadians. 
That was the equality Canada offered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opportunity, freedom and equality. These are the values I have 
come to cherish and these are the values I bring to this House. 
Canada is the best place in the world to live.  We do not need 
the United Nations to tell us that, but we risk being complacent 
if we continue to pat ourselves on the back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada does have problems.  Canadian families and small business 
suffer under a heavy tax burden.  Young people, normally full of 
hope, fear the future holds nothing but disappointment, chronic 
unemployment and debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians every day face the uncertainty of whether or not their 
country will remain united.  This uncertainty weighs heavy on all 
Canadians and is the cause of so many political problems.  It is 
this issue that I would like to address today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I have a message I would like to send through you 
to the very proud people of Quebec.  Quebecers are justifiably 
proud of their history and culture.  It is my belief that this 
culture will continue so long as there are people—sovereignists 
or federalists—wanting to keep it flowering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear, however, that Quebecers will once again in the near 
future be asked to decide whether they wish to remain in Canada. 
Separatist leaders will ask them if they want to retain their 
cultural identity or be swallowed up by an all encompassing federal 
government.  Given this choice, I too would vote sovereignist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These, however, are not the only choices available to 
Quebecers.  There is a third choice, that of a renewed Canadian 
federation.  This choice will change totally and utterly the 
relationship between the federal and provincial governments.  It 
will give the provinces the latitude they need to develop the 
cultural and economic institutions that best reflect their 
particular values. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third choice is embodied in the political movement calling 
for renewed federalism. While it is a movement that began in the 
west with the Reform Party it is fueled by frustration shared by 
people all across this country.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first ministers are among those who share this frustration. 
They have given us the framework from which to begin a nationwide 
discussion on Canada's constitutional future.  This should be an 
exciting time for the people of Quebec and all across Canada who 
are looking for fundamental changes to our federation. We should 
all look with hope at the possibilities that lie within the 
Calgary declaration.  Our premiers have learned a lesson from 
both Meech Lake and Charlottetown and are going to the people of 
Canada to hear what they have to say about their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that the people of Quebec insist that their voices 
be joined with the millions of other Canadians who will soon be 
discussing Canada's constitutional future. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also ask Quebecers, who are so proud of their culture, 
to look at this way of remaining within a renewed Canada, which 
will respect the cultural and economic diversity of its provincial 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the idea of a renewed federalism holds out promise 
and a future for Quebec, there are those who will oppose it because 
they do not believe that Quebec can or should be an equal partner 
in the Canadian federation.  Some believe that, without 
inequalities enshrined in the Constitution, Quebec will never be an 
important component of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who told me that I would never make it in the 
Reform Party, a party without official racial preferences for its 
candidates.  There are people who told me that a young minority 
would never make it on his own in a political world dominated by 
the old boys club, and yet I stand here today, the proud 
representative of Edmonton—Strathcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that what my personal experience helps to illustrate is 
that in a truly free country merit is the only requirement for 
success.  Equality is no threat to individuals of merit. Equality 
is no threat to the rich and unique culture of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the province of Quebec will demand to be an equal and 
vital member of the Canadian confederacy and will reject the 
false promises of separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that Canada finds strength in diversity.  If this is 
true, a renewed federalist system may bring this country together 
as a strong unified country as never before seen, a nation ready 
to face the challenges of the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
want to congratulate the new member from the Reform Party on his maiden 
speech in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand where the hon. member is coming from. He is a member 
of a federalist party, the Reform Party, and the Calgary meeting took 
place in his province. Fine, but the history of Quebec's plans for 
sovereignty goes back much further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as we mentioned, the proposed Constitution was never signed 
by any Quebec government, whether federalist or sovereignist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Robert Bourassa, a Liberal, was not a sovereignist but a 
federalist, yet he never agreed to sign the Constitution. Claude 
Ryan never agreed to sign it either. More recently, a former 
Liberal provincial minister, Claude Ryan, recognized Quebec's 
special rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a riding that once had a former Prime Minister as a 
member of Parliament. I am referring to Brian Mulroney, who was the 
member for Charlevoix and Prime Minister of Canada. He too made an 
attempt with the Meech Lake accord, the Charlottetown accord and other 
formulas. In the referendum on the Charlottetown accord, English Canada 
voted no because they felt it gave too much to Quebec, while Quebec 
voted no because we felt it was not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, as the hon. member will find out, that therein lies the 
constitutional problem and that, no matter what you offer, it will be 
too little, too late. 
Quebec sends $28 billion to Ottawa and is not getting its money's worth 
in return. Quebec wants to manage its own services, eliminate overlap 
and duplication, take control of its destiny and become a country by the 
year 2000.

the hon. member who just commented.  That is the whole point of 
what has been happening in this federation to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers of the various provinces have said it is time to 
consult the rest of Canada in order to have real change in the 
federation.  We have seen that frustration in every region of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the premiers making the effort to make the change, now is 
the time for us to come together and build for the future.  We 
have come a long way as a united country.  I hope there is still 
a long way to go.  The only way we can do it is to come together 
as one people of one nation, through equality in order to make 
the changes required for the 21st century.

and I am sure, my colleagues appreciate his speaking French in this 
House and speaking it very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him whether the citizens of 
Edmonton—Strathcona, whom he represents, feel that Quebecers are 
a people and whether they feel that this people has the freedom 
to determine its future and to have its own country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the things the 
people of Edmonton—Strathcona sent me here to try to accomplish 
is to recognize the view that, regardless of where people come 
from, regardless of their background, whether they are Quebecois 
or an Ismaili Muslim like myself, we are all equal. The way to 
build a strong country is not to recognize that each individual 
group makes a people, but to recognize that through our diversity 
we are equal.  That will give us the base on which to build a 
strong country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter what the people of Edmonton—Strathcona think 
in the sense of their recognizing any specific group as a people. 
They put equality first and that is what they have sent me here 
to do on their behalf.  That is what they believe will build this 
country and lead us into the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Erie—Lincoln. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great pleasure that I take part in the debate on the 
Speech from the Throne, a speech which confidently outlines our 
government's ongoing commitment to fiscal responsibility and 
social fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to offer my congratulations to you on 
your appointment as acting speaker. I would also like to thank 
the residents of Sault Ste. Marie for giving me the honour of 
representing them in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with a great deal of humility that I stand here as their 
member of Parliament.  I sincerely hope that through hard work, 
honest conduct and devotion to constituency matters that I can 
repay Saultites for the confidence they have shown in me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to the previous 
member of Parliament for Sault Ste. Marie, Ron Irwin, who is now 
a special advisor to the prime minister.  I have known Ron Irwin 
for a long time.  He is a fair and honest man who, as an MP, 
served Sault Ste. Marie extremely well and as minister of Indian 
affairs also served Canadians extremely well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ron left some mighty big shoes for me to fill, workboots in 
fact.  I thank him for his counsel, past and present, as I try to 
grow into those boots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to the matter at hand, I would like to focus my 
remarks on a few key issues raised in the throne speech, namely 
youth unemployment, the importance of exports to the Canadian 
economy and the need for a forward thinking approach to national 
unity. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth unemployment has become a serious problem in Canada and 
particularly in my riding of Sault Ste. Marie.  Too many well 
educated young people are having a tough time finding that 
all-important first job.  Still others are finding post-secondary 
education to be prohibitively expensive.  It is for these reasons 
that the government is taking decisive action to help young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne reaffirms and in many cases expands 
the government's commitment to improved job creation, training 
and education for young people.  The strengthening of federal 
internship programs will provide participants with real job 
experience, the lack of which too often prevents young people 
from finding meaningful work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of the Millennium Scholarship Endowment Fund 
will help thousands of young Canadians access the education 
necessary to succeed in the knowledge-based society of the 21st 
century.  I was especially pleased to hear that the millennium 
fund will be directed primarily at low and modest income 
students. This is welcome news indeed to a predominantly working 
class city like Sault Ste. Marie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always believed that by investing in the future of our 
young people we invest in the future of Canada.  Simply put, the 
Speech from the Throne is an example of this belief in action. Of 
course we will be in a position to do more in terms of social 
spending as our commitment to sound fiscal management yields 
larger and larger dividends. One particular area of interest to 
me is the creation of greater opportunities for physically and 
mentally challenged Canadians through wage subsidies and job 
creation initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government now operates a $30 million a year 
opportunities fund to this end, but it is my sincere hope that in 
the years to come more attention and more money will be directed 
at this often overlooked group of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are aspects of the speech that provide hope for unemployed 
Saultites.  The emphasis on exports as a source of one in three 
Canadian jobs bodes well for residents in my riding.  Sault Ste. 
Marie is a vibrant border city with a significant export economy. 
Sault Ste. Marie is a leading exporter of steel, wood and paper 
products.  The city's exporting capabilities are second to none 
thanks in large part to its proximity to the United States and 
its strategic location along the St. Mary's River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is another precious commodity in Sault Ste. Marie. 
Thousands of visitors come every year to enjoy the natural beauty 
of northern Ontario.  They come to fish, hunt, ski and 
snowmobile.  In Sault Ste. Marie they ride the Algoma Central 
Railway to the Agawa Canyon, tour the Sault locks and visit the 
magnificent displays at the Canadian Bushplane Heritage Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for those reasons that Saultites should be pleased with 
the throne speech's recognition of tourism and exports as key 
economic generators.  This recognition is not simply based on 
rhetoric.  The government was quick to condemn a new American 
entry law which would seriously inconvenience Canadians crossing 
into the United States.  The government will continue to fight 
this insulting legislation and it is my belief that it will soon 
win Canadians a well deserved exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the sacrifices 
Canadians have made the past few years.  Like government they 
have learned to do more with less.  However, now that there is 
light at the end of the deficit tunnel, we are, as the Speech 
from the Throne explained, in a position to make strategic 
investments.  We will not, as some opposition members have 
charged, abandon the attitude of fiscal responsibility that got 
this nation's finances back on track.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we will not neglect to make the necessary 
social investments such as the ones outlined in the speech. We 
will stay the course of balancing the nation's financial and 
social priorities.  This is what Canadians elected us to do in 
1993 and it is what they re-elected us to do this spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to offer my colleagues in the House these 
thoughts on national unity.  There is an old expression that says 
“Don't look back unless that is where you want to go”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there many Canadians who wish to go back to where we have 
been on the whole question of national unity?  I do not think so. 
I believe my fellow Canadians are prepared to look straight 
ahead.  I believe they are prepared to be flexible and 
open-minded in finding a lasting solution to the national unity 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I exhort all of my colleagues in the House to fix not on the 
past but on the future, to be fully receptive to new ideas and 
proposals regardless of the source so that we may bring lasting 
closure to this issue.

carefully to my colleague's entire speech, but even more carefully to 
the latter part of it.  Our colleague speaks to us about national unity. 
He tells us not to look back to the past, but ahead to the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to him, and it is to this comment that I would 
like his reaction, that the Canada of today is operating under rules 
from the last century, when we are now on the eve of the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not an enterprise in this country, or in the rest of the 
world, that is operating according to rules from the last century.  Such 
an undertaking would be doomed to failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will Canada finally understand that the Constitution, which 
was drawn up in the last century, no longer meets, if it ever did, the 
needs we now have and will continue to have in the next century? 
Sovereignty, with a proposal for partnership, is a forward looking plan 
that assures Quebecers and Canadians of prosperity in the century to 
come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Carmen Provenzano:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, indeed I look 
forward to a solution to national unity issues which have had a 
very checkered history.  It is my hope that Canadians will be 
forward-looking.  I pledge to do what I indicated in my speech. I 
am prepared to be very flexible and to take the lead from 
wherever it may come in order to find some kind of a solution to 
this problem.

shocking and alarming. Yet the government is saying that all is 
well and has resisted for the longest time any examination of 
what was happening on the Stoney reserve.  Finally Judge Reilly 
demanded that something be done to look into the societal 
conditions that were bringing so many people into his court room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> We are out of time. I 
would ask the hon. member for Sault Ste. Marie for a brief reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Carmen Provenzano:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I share the concerns 
of the member opposite.  I have a confident belief that we have 
the resources, human and material, to bring to bear on these 
problems and I am hoping that we can find a solution. Those 
conditions should not prevail in any civilized society. We must 
direct our attention to them and find solutions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
June 2 of this year I received a mandate from the people of 
Erie—Lincoln to represent their concerns in the House.  I am 
honoured to have been given this responsibility by my 
constituents and I am proud to be the first member of Parliament 
for the riding of Erie—Lincoln. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people in the 
areas of the Niagara peninsula that supported me in 1993 and then 
became parts of new ridings due to redistribution.  I enjoyed 
working with the warm people and progressive municipalities of 
the town of Pelham and Welland South. It was an honour to serve 
you.  I have many fond memories of events I attended and 
friendships made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new riding of Erie—Lincoln brings in two fine new areas, 
the town of Dunnville and the town of Lincoln. The town of 
Dunnville is located on the Lake Erie shore and is dissected by 
the friendly Grand River.  It is a picturesque community of 
greenhouses, mixed farming, light industry and most importantly, 
great people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The town of Lincoln is located on the southerly shore of Lake 
Ontario in an area renowned for its tender fruit and vineyards 
and yes, great people as well.  The excellent wines that are 
produced in the town of Lincoln are a testament to the unique 
micro climate found in the peninsula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my travels to the new areas of the riding I have been 
impressed by the number of small businesses that are actively 
exporting their products around the world.  I welcome both 
communities to the Erie—Lincoln riding and look forward to 
representing them to the best of my ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Erie—Lincoln truly runs from lake to lake to 
river. It runs from the Niagara River and the American border at 
Fort Erie down the shore of Lake Erie to Port Colborne and 
Wainfleet and on to Dunnville, then up into West Lincoln to the 
heart of the peninsula and on to Lincoln on the shores of Lake 
Ontario.  It is a wonderfully diverse and unique riding, a 
virtual microcosm of Canada. I look forward very much to working 
for my constituents in the upcoming mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity, as I did in my 
maiden speech in January 1994 to thank my family, Sherrie, Megan, 
Patrick, Alanna, Andrew and Sarah, my parents and my siblings for 
their ongoing support and understanding. All those present in the 
House know of the sacrifices that an elected official must make 
and the toll that an election campaign and representation in 
Ottawa can take.  My family cannot be thanked enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the spring campaign and throughout the summer months the 
constituents of Erie—Lincoln delivered a very clear message that 
something must be done about unemployment.  I was pleased to hear 
in the speech from the throne that “Stimulating job creation and 
economic growth has been, remains and will continue to be a major 
objective of the Government of Canada.” I applaud this 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the job creation figures are impressive, 947,000 jobs 
since October 1993, and while many of these jobs are well paying, 
full time jobs, in my riding where unemployment remains too high, 
this is little consolation. The government must continue to seek 
out the opportunities that will put Canadians back to work and 
which will put many young Canadians to work for the first time in 
productive and fulfilling jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must continue to look abroad to market our excellent 
competitive Canadian products.  We must investigate partnerships 
with the private sector.  We must break down interprovincial 
trade barriers.  We must continue to cut the red tape for small 
businesses and entrepreneurs.  Most of all we must continue to 
see the unemployment situation for what it is, a battle, a war 
that must be fought until every Canadian who wishes to work and 
can work is afforded that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fiscal course is set.  The budget is to be balanced in 
1998-99, a truly remarkable achievement that has earned the 
admiration of the world community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully support the direction the government has pursued.  As 
difficult as it was we implemented many necessary cuts, all the 
while keeping in mind the values Canadians hold dear, those 
values that set us apart from other nations.  The government's 
values are clear:  responsibility, compassion, fairness and 
respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution the government with the words written by a 
constituent.  My constituent wrote “Canada is a country, not a 
corporation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot be driven by the bottom line at the expense of the 
livelihood, dignity and welfare of Canadians.  Unemployment 
strikes at the very essence of an individual, leaving him or her 
unable to provide for self or family.  Families can be 
traumatized by joblessness whose lives are seriously affected, 
sometimes irreparably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No level of unemployment is acceptable.  I will continue to 
examine ways in which Erie—Lincoln can seize the opportunities 
available to it and shall have the same access to services and 
programs as large urban centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians and Erie—Lincoln residents are concerned about 
the unity of our fine country.  The large French Canadian 
population in my riding has close ties to Quebec.  We believe 
that la belle province is a fundamental part of our Canadian 
heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the address the right hon. prime minister spoke of a 
disturbing study showing that Canadians knew very little about 
one another.  I am convinced that an increased knowledge of the 
other would bring greater understanding to those who are 
ambivalent about Canadian unity.  Despite language, race or 
religion the day to day concerns of Canadians are the same from 
coast to coast to coast:  family, employment and the economy.  We 
are all more alike than we may realize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I embrace the desire to be innovative as we look at national 
unity.  I commend the premiers and territorial leaders on the 
recent Calgary initiative.  Oftentimes a fresh approach is 
required.  At all times an open mind is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are our most precious resource.  Some say they are our 
future, and I agree.  I would also point out they are very much a 
part of our present.  Throughout the past year as a member of the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs I was part of a 
group committed to studying the youth justice system.  The 
message in what we heard rang loud and clear.  The most effective 
way to stem youth crime is not always tougher sentencing, 
corporal or capital punishment, but by preventing young people 
from falling into a life riddled with criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moneys carefully spent on programs dealing with children from 
their prenatal period through their elementary school years is 
crucial to preventing young people from committing that first 
petty crime, a first crime that can lead very often to a lifetime 
of criminal behaviour and incarceration at enormous cost to 
Canada and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little doubt in my mind after visiting with young 
offenders, police, judges and youth workers from coast to coast 
to coast that child poverty proves to be a major setback for many 
young children that may lead to learning difficulties, adaptation 
problems and potential criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has acted by increasing the contribution for the 
Canada child tax benefit by $850 million per year with higher 
payments to begin July 1 of next year.  It is a step toward the 
very necessary eradication of child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to hear in the Speech from the Throne that the 
government is committed to working with provincial and 
territorial governments to develop a broader agenda for children 
including clear outcomes in measuring their success.  Our 
children ask little of us.  They want only to have strong support 
of families and safe communities in which to develop.  This is 
the very least we owe them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Erie—Lincoln it was announced that all four 
hospitals would be either closed or their services downgraded 
substantially.  This is unacceptable.  Many of my constituents 
have very real concerns about the present state and future of our 
medicare system.   They are worried the high quality of health 
care they have come to expect and deserve will not be there for 
them when they most need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have responded to these concerns and will continue to respond 
as we must.  The government is committed to providing a minimum 
transfer of $12.5 billion to the provinces and territories for 
health care.  This increase will see the cash payment 
entitlements to the provinces and territories rise by $700 
million in 1998-99 and $1.4 billion the year after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the nation's finances in good shape we will soon be in a 
position to make choices and investments that support this 
Canadian priority.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also being examined are innovative ways to provide health care 
to an aging population that is on the whole healthier than the 
last generation and much more able to live at home for longer 
periods of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are expanding home and community care, providing Canadians 
with better access to medically necessary drugs, and examining 
the quality and effectiveness of health care across the country 
through the health transition fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also working hard to prevent the many diseases 
and illnesses that are very costly to treat once diagnosed. 
Funding for initiatives such as breast cancer, HIV and AIDS and 
tobacco reduction are key elements in the prevention strategy. We 
must work with the provinces to ensure universal and accessible 
health care is available for all Canadians, rural or urban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no longer possible for an economically viable nation to 
live in isolation of world affairs and events.  Canada has been 
renowned over the years for its contribution to peacekeeping 
efforts.  As a country we believe in the values of collective 
responsibility as seen through our public pension system, 
publicly funded health care system and equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of the have nations of the world we have a responsibility 
to the have nots to help them through conflict and struggle by 
providing some security for the innocent civilians and to help 
provide safe havens for refugees, hopefully contributing to a 
resolution that will see them return home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all part of our responsibilities to our friends and 
neighbours around the world who through no fault of their own are 
not fortunate enough to have the stability and prosperity we find 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not only a peacekeeper.  It is a peacemaker and a 
leader.  From Lester B. Pearson in the 1950s to my hon. 
colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in his humanitarian 
efforts to rid the globe of the hideous and maiming land mines, 
Canada has shown itself to be an independent leader in this arena. 
December's conference in Ottawa will demonstrate again to the 
world the honesty and tenacity with which we tackle these 
controversial issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, too often it is easy to talk about the negative 
or the work to be done, but I cannot help but to think that we as 
Canadians get too wrapped up in it.  Canada is the best nation in 
the world to call home and we have that privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Admittedly there will always be work to be done and the best can 
always get better.  I am committed to working to make Canada a 
better place to live.  My constituents and family provide much of 
the enthusiasm that fuels my efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the new members of the House of Commons to this 
institution.  To serve the public is perhaps a calling, 
definitely a right, and truly a responsibility we all have.  I 
look forward to working with all my colleagues in a constructive 
fashion that will build on our successes as a country and will 
make Canada stronger than ever as it enters the new millennium. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague across the way for a very good speech.  I might 
mention that we shared chairs on the justice committee and 
travelled all across the country looking at the Young Offenders 
Act.  I was always appreciative of his practicality and his 
common sense when it came to addressing the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice to hear from him today and I have a question for him. 
Inasmuch as the throne speech stated that the government would 
“develop alternatives to incarceration for low risk non-violent 
offenders”, would the hon. member be prepared to support an 
amendment to the Criminal Code that would exempt violent 
offenders from conditional sentencing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former justice minister agreed that convicted rapists should 
not walk the streets, that they should be doing time.  Because 
the benefits of conditional sentencing have not been exempted 
from violent offenders, would he consider supporting an amendment 
to the Criminal Code that would do that very thing and bring the 
law into line with the promise made in the throne speech that 
they would develop alternatives to incarceration only for low 
risk and non-violent offenders and allow violent offenders, 
particularly those who commit acts of rape, to do time in jail 
for no other purpose perhaps than the deterrent effect it might 
have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this 
opportunity to publicly acknowledge your appointment to the 
Chair.  It certainly will be enlightening to have you there.  I 
am sorry we have lost you as a member of the opposition to 
comment on our debates.  You always had a very practical 
approach.  We are very glad to see you as perhaps the first 
non-member of the government sitting in that position. 
It is a welcome and refreshing step.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the member for Crowfoot, I agree there is too 
much violence in society, domestic violence and violent criminal 
activities.  While I support the removal of conditional 
sentencing for violent offenders, I think it certainly has merit. 
We would have to examine it very closely, but I am inclined to 
agree with the member that a message has to be sent to the 
citizens of country that violence cannot be tolerated in any way, 
shape or form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A tap on the wrist is insufficient for that type of behaviour. I 
would like to see the private member's bill I am sure the member 
will propose.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the sober speech made by the hon. member for Erie—Lincoln. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member showed some foresight in dealing with many of the issues 
at stake. However, as you know, I am more interested in certain points 
than in others. Sometimes, that foresight was lacking or not so sharp. 
I am referring in particular to his statement that Quebec is part of the 
so-called Canadian heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quickly go back in time and remind you that Quebec City was 
founded some 400 years ago. 
Canada, on the other hand, is 130 years old. Quebec City helped promote 
a nascent culture that blossomed through its contacts with many 
aboriginal nations. To be sure, the Conquest, 150 years later, enriched 
the culture of the people who were already there and who were already 
considering themselves a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that the anglophone ocean now surrounding 
us continues to try to assimilate us, not realizing that we are a real 
people. There are 7 million people in Quebec, 85 percent of whom are 
francophones. Ours is a pluralistic society.  What does the hon. member 
think of this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but 
his time has expired. The hon. member for Erie—Lincoln can give a very 
brief reply if he wishes to do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Quebec is a fine province 
that we are proud to have as part of Canada.  It is unique.  It 
is different.  We enjoy going there.  We all have relatives 
there.  In my area of Erie—Lincoln there are many French 
Canadian people who have family in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However Quebec does not have the monopoly on the French culture. 
My area is one.  St. Boniface is another and the Acadians in New 
Brunswick are another.  There are areas throughout Canada.  We 
respect the French factor in Canada, but Quebec is not the sole 
governance of that.

congratulate you on your appointment.  I will be splitting my 
time with the member for North Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this is my maiden speech I would like to take the opportunity 
to let my constituents know I am truly honoured to be in the 
House of Commons representing them as the newly elected member of 
Parliament for Edmonton East.  I would also like to inform the 
people who are listening to this debate today that we are 
debating the Speech from the Throne.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the members of this assembly can trace their heritage to 
a common path. We share ancestors that sailed by the shadow of 
the Quebec citadel, some stopping, most going onward to Montreal 
or beyond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My ancestors came to Canada in the 1850s.  They, like many 
immigrants before and since, followed this route to Upper Canada. 
Like the French before who enjoined the land of the aboriginals, 
so too did the British.  My wife's ancestors who came from 
Ukraine in 1910 travelled this conduit to settlement, as did many 
others who followed.  The first impressions of this new country 
for most of Canada's immigrants was the impressive heights of the 
Quebec citadel and the wharfs of Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada by this time had embraced the railroads and more than 
anything else developed the interior territories by threads of 
rails emanating from its rapidly growing cities of Montreal and 
Toronto.  Montreal was the hub of the dynamic business region and 
largest city in Canada up until the 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business dynamics of cities have changed since then.  Toronto 
now replaces Montreal in size and Vancouver may in turn in the 
future given its present growth rate.  What Montreal retains is 
the true essence of Canada's multicultural make-up.  Its cultural 
mosiac is a product of 350 years of enlightened immigration. 
This cultural diversity is shared by many cities and towns in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Edmonton East is just one of those cosmopolitan communities. 
Encompassing city hall and the Alberta legislature, Edmonton East 
also has a variety of cultural communities, Ukrainian, Italian, 
Chinese and others.  Cultural diversity is a treasured part of 
our community. A large and popular cultural event is the Edmonton 
heritage day festival.  Our community celebrates its individuals' 
heritage as well as enjoying the celebration of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Edmontonians truly do enjoy multiculturalism.  Some groups display 
great pride in cultural accomplishment without federal funding. 
More groups should.  Multiculturalism should not be about money. 
It should be about community involvement and community 
participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a father of two teenage daughters, one in high school, the 
other in university, I am proud to say that they view, as I do, 
race and colour as transparencies.  They simply do not exist in 
our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the global community of the next millennium discrimination 
will be a non-starter for those who will want to be equal 
partners in world affairs.  Canada has become a major global 
trading country because of its diversity of cultures and the 
insightfulness it brings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Day is a product of evolution from the French-aboriginal 
encounter, to the early British stewardship, to the birth of a 
nation in 1867, already growing with immigrants from all corners 
of the earth, less than 500 years since Europeans set foot in 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns me deeply is the very reason that brings me to 
this Chamber, Canadian unity.  I truly believe in Canada's 
diversity.  I have had a long and memorable relationship with a 
very significant part of our country.  Since 1962 I have 
sometimes lived in, worked in and often visited Quebec. The most 
important visit was to Quebec City during the 1995 referendum. To 
be in Quebec City for the vote was important to me, to my past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 31, like many thousands of Canadians, I was in shock 
and disbelief that our country could be lost for want of 
100,000 votes.  It was not a simple consultative referendum as we 
were told. It was a serious well orchestrated campaign for 
separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of Canadians reacted as I did.  Dozens of unity groups 
sprang up.  I organized a group in Edmonton.   While several 
projects were completed I realized that to make a serious 
impression I could better serve Canadian unity from within a 
political party that truly supports Canadian unity.  Ultimately 
it will be the government that makes constitutional changes, but 
we encourage suggestions from all Canadians that want to foster 
Canadian unity. 
I will bring forward concerns of people and groups in my role as 
deputy critic of intergovernmental affairs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand here as a product of the 1995 referendum.  I am not here 
pretending to have answers but I am here to try to help. Canadian 
unity is not just Quebec and the rest of Canada.  Unity is 
successfully dialoguing concerns of all Canadians.  It is 
renewing federalism.  It is emphasizing the equality of the 
people of Canada as well as the equality of its partners, the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians have the will and determination we can resolve 
federal-provincial concerns, we can resolve aboriginal concerns 
and we can resolve linguistic concerns.  The people of Edmonton 
East are just like the people of Gaspé and people from all across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can and will work to bring this country together is to give 
Canadians everywhere the feeling that they have a government that 
cares, a government that will bring about real jobs by reducing 
taxes, not just floating statistics, a government that will 
support fair reduced taxes after it has begun a debt reduction 
program, a government that will make families a priority, a 
government that will work to make our streets safer by 
recognizing and correcting the misguided Young Offenders Act, a 
government that will repair the damage done by the past 
governments to the all important social safety net and pensions, 
a government that will view taxpayers for who they are, our 
employers, not simply as walking wallets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then all Canadians will feel better about themselves, about 
their families, about their well-being in senior years, about 
their justice system, about their government.  Then we will have 
something to wave a flag about.  Then we will have something to 
be proud enough about to even buy a flag ourselves.  Then we 
might have unity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate our new colleague on his election and I am surprised, 
as well as happy, to learn that he is here because of the 1995 
referendum. As a result, unlike certain members of the preceding 
Parliament, he understands that the Bloc Quebecois members who are 
here today are not an anachronism and are not completely out of 
touch with Quebec realities. In Quebec, 49.4 percent of the people voted 
yes, and the member was sufficiently impressed by that percentage 
that he decided to come to the House to debate the question, just 
like us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question to our new colleague, a 
question that comes from the conclusions of the previous speaker, 
who said that Quebec did not have the monopoly on French culture in 
Canada since there are francophones outside Quebec. There is an 
important semantic distinction to be made, here. The culture of 
Quebecers is not French, but “Québécoise”, just like the culture of 
Acadians is Acadian. There are also other French language cultures 
elsewhere, authentic French cultures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did our colleague, who did come to Quebec, realize how 
authentic la culture québécoise is, since it is found nowhere else 
in the world and since it is characteristic of the way our people 
has evolved over the past 400 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear his comments. He is in a position to 
know. He has lived through the referendum. I will listen closely to 
what he has to say.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I attended the referendum my distinct impression was that I 
was there because of a failure of our government in Ottawa to 
perform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only Quebec which is looking for changes in the 
federation.  Many other parts of the country are also looking for 
change.  We are looking forward to a renewal of the Canadian 
federation with a consideration for equality, not only equality 
of the citizens but equality of the provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
if it is possible to be a people within a province like the 
province of Quebec, it is most certainly possible to be a people 
within the province of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But is it true, I ask my colleague, if he wants one people for 
one country, that it must be a nation like Canada.  A people 
perhaps for the province of Quebec, but a Canadian people for the 
nation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I share the concerns of 
the hon. member.  I believe, as I stated in my speech, that 
Canada is comprised of peoples from all over the world, gathered 
together in the country of Canada.  People who come from 
different cultural backgrounds and mosaics make Canada a great 
country. Canada is great because of the diversity of all of its 
cultures collected together.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the 
hon. member will agree with me that the throne speech is an empty 
shell, that it contains nothing to reassure Quebecers, that it has 
brought little hope to our young people and no hope to our seniors. 
Seniors tell us “The more things change, the more they stay the 
same”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member whether, when he came to 
Montreal during the 1995 referendum campaign, it was really in 
order to save Canada, or was it because of the attraction of a 
reduced $95 flight from Vancouver to Montreal? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for his comments.  However, I will have to correct him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very specific in my speech.  I said that I was in Quebec 
City during the referendum.  To the best of my knowledge, nobody 
paid for my airline flight.  I booked it long before that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was there as a concerned Canadian.  Going through August and 
September I watched the polls changing.  With Parizeau it looked 
like 60:40.  With Bouchard it looked like 50:50.  I was concerned 
about the dramatic change which occurred over the period of a 
couple of weeks because another person had taken control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was there as a Canadian wishing to experience this vote in 
Quebec City.  I had visited Quebec City several times before. My 
wife and I have had very fond experiences there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to see why people who were my age, 50 years old, with 
two teenage daughters, who were established in life, would risk 
going down the road with the uncertainties which separation would 
bring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was there out of concern for my country.  I was not there on a 
cheap flight.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
congratulations on your appointment to your position as Deputy 
Speaker, an exciting, stimulating position during these speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this discussion in the direction of 
parliamentary reform and the lack of mention of it in the throne 
speech.  I would first like to lead into that with a little 
story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the evening of June 2 this year when it was clear that I had 
won my riding with an 11 per cent increase in support, I stood in front 
of my supporters and I thanked them very much for their 
assistance. One other thing I said to them was that I could not 
wait to get back to the House so that I could stand here and look 
at the prime minister and say “I'm back”.  And here I am, his 
worst nightmare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get right into the nitty-gritty of my first speech— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Don't flatter yourself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>   It amuses the members opposite as much as 
it thrilled my supporters on the night of the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to repeat my sincere thanks to my constituents for 
acknowledging and supporting the style and type of representation 
that I gave them in the 35th Parliament.  I will certainly try to 
do even better in the 36th. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victory was sweet because apart from the Liberal campaign 
that was run in the riding of York South—Weston in an attempt to 
unseat the sitting member there, I would say that the campaign 
run by the Liberals in my riding was probably one of the dirtiest 
and sleaziest in recent history.  I do have to mention this to 
lead into my attack on the parliamentary system if we can call it 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal candidate was personally endorsed by the prime 
minister and he launched into a litany of vicious personal 
attacks, innuendoes and mud slinging which detracted completely 
from the issues. The entire campaign turned into a personality 
thing distressing a lot of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife and many of the emotionally sensitive people in my 
campaign were in tears on a daily basis.  If any other members 
were subject to that sort of abuse in a campaign they will 
appreciate that it is not a very nice way to go.  My mother who 
is 84 years old had come from New Zealand thinking that it was 
going to be a joyous, happy campaign and she was reduced to 
sobbing her heart out on the first night that she was here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a public figure I am used to the criticism from political 
opponents.  However it has often struck me that those who claim 
to have the monopoly on tolerance, compassion and understanding 
turn out to be the least tolerant, compassionate and 
understanding as they attempt to force through their agenda. The 
voters of North Vancouver could see through that and they gave 
the prime minister exactly what he deserves, a Reform 
representative from North Vancouver and a loyal official 
opposition from the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other thing.  He can no longer call us the third party. Some 
of my constituents are waiting to see if he will use that label 
for the Bloc.  I just have to mention that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Election campaigns are about power. They are not really about 
democracy.  They are about power for political parties at any 
cost.  As new members in the House will soon learn, this House is 
not a place for the most part where we carry out the will of the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunately the place where government members almost 
always obediently vote the will of the prime minister. And that 
is not because they always support what is being put in front of 
them, but because the consequences of voting against the 
government are so serious. Whether to stick to a principle or to 
represent constituents, the member for York South—Weston whose 
achievement in being re-elected to the House as an independent I 
admire, certainly knows the consequences of standing up for a 
principle. Sadly what happened to him I believe will act as a 
strong disincentive for government members to defy or even mildly 
depart from the instructions of their whip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless we do desperately need some reforms to the workings 
of this place, reforms that will make it a place of the people 
rather than a place of the parties.  If each and everyone of us 
perhaps being guided by the general principles and polices of the 
party had been elected as independents with a mandate to vote the 
majority will of the constituents, this place could actually turn 
out to be useful to the average Canadian instead of being an 
overtaxing, overregulating, overinterfering hindrance to their 
lives.  In fact some of my constituents have made the comment 
that they think the country runs better when we are not in 
session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>   I have heard that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>    One of the PC members mentioned that she 
has heard the same thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public perception of politicians as people who will say 
anything to get elected and then do whatever they like would 
disappear if we were truly representing them.  Cynicism would be 
replaced by respect and we would be doing the job that the 
majority of voters thinks we should be doing.  If we ask them 
they think we should be representing them, not ourselves or a 
hard party line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the summer I collected a folder full of issues brought up 
in letters and later some phone calls from my constituents.  I 
tend to do this throughout the year. I pick up the issues and 
bring them to this place so that I can express them on behalf of 
my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I will not have time to go through the whole 
folder today but I can promise members they will hear about it 
all over the coming weeks. They are issues that I really should 
not even need to talk about in this place and there would be no 
need to talk about them if as I mentioned earlier we were truly 
representing our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had citizens rights to initiative and referendum at the 
federal level it would make a major difference.  For those who 
always claim that citizens rights to initiative and referendum 
are not compatible with our style of parliamentary democracy, I 
say bunkum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Zealand which has a similar parliamentary system introduced 
citizens rights to initiative and referendum in 1990. The Ontario 
government is in the process of introducing those same rights for 
Ontario voters. All it takes is the political will.  Members will 
have the chance to see how it can be done at the federal level 
when I reintroduce my private member's bill on initiative and 
referendum hopefully next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The city of Rossland in B.C. which is just a small city actually 
stands as an excellent example of how initiative and referendum 
can work for citizens.  It really cleans up the politics.  Prior 
to the introduction of citizens initiative in Rossland in 1991, 
four mayors had been tossed out of office in consecutive 
elections and councillors were being replaced all the time.  It 
was very chaotic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since citizens initiative and referendum power was introduced 
not a single council member or mayor has been voted out of office 
because the constituents have been able to concentrate on the 
issues and the council and mayor carried out the wishes of the 
constituents. They voted themselves some tax increases for 
repairs to the community as well as voted against some other 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of the tools of direct democracy in this place we 
really remain captive to the will of the prime minister. 
Unfortunately that means Canadians will have virtually no input 
to this place over the next few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian voters will probably be stuck with the same inadequate 
justice system which has degenerated under the old line parties 
into little more than a legal system incapable of protecting them 
from criminals.  Canadian voters will probably be stuck with an 
immigration system incapable of preventing the entry of hundreds 
of bogus and criminal refugees every day, also incapable of 
deporting the offenders after years of taxpayer funded appeals. I 
wonder how many members know that there are more than 30,000 
illegals under deportation order in this country right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian voters will probably be stuck with the Liberals 
embarking on a special interest group spending spree wasting 
money on the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council 
while they claw back seniors pensions and increase the CPP 
premiums for workers.  Canadian voters will probably be stuck 
with higher and ever increasing taxes that eat away at their 
disposable income and kill jobs.  Canadian voters will probably 
be stuck with record levels of political patronage using their 
tax dollars and borrowing against their children's futures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will probably be stuck with the ongoing Liberal social 
engineering programs which assign rights, privileges and money 
based on race or gender instead of on achievement or equal 
opportunity; state sanctioned racism and sexism completely out of 
touch with the realities of the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way it is depressing.  But in a way it is also invigorating 
because it will give me the opportunity over the next few years 
along with my colleagues to speak about these problems in this 
place.  In my role as the direct democracy critic for Reform I 
will continue to apply pressure for change in this place, changes 
which would make it more effective and deliver real value for 
those who pay our salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strong sense of the need for change was reflected in the 
results of a vote held here last Monday.  I hope there is 
sufficient resolve to carry that feeling through into meaningful 
changes as the business of this House progresses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to make a brief comment because I know that many Canadians 
do watch the House.  I want to defend members of Parliament who 
may be affronted by the member's comment about voting the way 
that somebody tells them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the government party, I ran in the last election 
on a government platform which laid out the commitments that the 
Liberal Party was making to go into a new parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want constituents of my riding and of my colleagues' ridings 
to know that when we come to this place we will vote in favour of 
measures and bills which support a platform on which we ran. That 
is the mandate, that is the democracy and the accountability in 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member has to do with the issue of being an 
independent member and voting the will of the people, as the 
member would put it.  I am afraid that the member is actually 
serious about this.  The member continues to refer to New Zealand 
as a model.  New Zealand may be able to do referendums but the 
population of New Zealand at some three million is the same as 
taking a referendum in the city of Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member a very direct question.  When one 
considers that in the last session of parliament, just half of 
the 35th Parliament, we had over 400 votes in this House, how is 
it that he expects to consult and get fair questions to all of 
the constituents, to get them back and to process them to find 
out how his constituents feel and still do it with the resources 
that are available?  This is going to cost a phenomenal amount of 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to the member that if he truly believes in 
referendums, then he should not be here because he only got 49 
per cent of the vote.  More than half of the people said no to that 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member brought up really 
good questions and I thank him very much for that.  He knows very 
well that most of us, except for one, ran on a platform 
associated with a party.  So the people who voted for us 
supported the general principles of that party platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also knows very well that his constituents do not support 
every single plank of that platform.  He is far too arrogant to 
suggest that therefore he has permission to vote a certain way on 
every single issue that comes up in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another problem because, as he also well knows having 
been here before, there are many issues that come before this 
House that were never in a party platform and were never part of 
any policy material.  Those especially are the types of issues 
where he should be very sensitive to the will of those who are 
paying his salary I remind him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says he is actually afraid that I may be serious.  I 
certainly am serious.  He is also very concerned that I am using 
the example of New Zealand for referendums.  Of course he 
completely ignored the fact that the Harris government in Ontario 
is introducing similar legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, we have as a very good example the country 
of Switzerland which conducts most of its business, at what we 
would call the equivalent of the federal level, through citizens 
initiated referendum.  Nobody could say that the Swiss are not 
smart, that their country does not have a high standard of living 
and that they do not conduct themselves in a civilized manner, 
but the difference there is that those people who want input to 
the government truly have input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I would like to mention that of course many of the 
issues that come before this House are not issues that all of the 
constituents are interested in.  Many of them are housekeeping 
items and minor changes and amendments that affect very few 
people.  It is unrealistic to expect people to take part in a 
referendum process for such issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless there are many major things, like the Young 
Offenders Act, capital punishment and various bills that came 
through here last year on sentencing reforms on which the public 
should have had more meaningful input.  If the committees of this 
House genuinely reflected the will of the people instead of the 
political agenda, most of those bills never would have gone 
through last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I can say again to the member is to please open his eyes and 
begin reflecting the will of the constituents because the writing 
is on the wall:  the times they are a changing.
