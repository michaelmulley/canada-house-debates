      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history is too long to explain at this time.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tabled the same bill in 2005 prior to the Liberals signing a deal with the Italian community to create the well-known ACE program that would have righted these wrongs.

    <center><b>Question No. 210--</b></center><b>Mr. Wayne Marston</b>:<a name="Para719250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to programs and spending by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) within the riding of Hamilton East—Stoney Creek: (<i>a</i>) what was the amount spent in 2006; (<i>b</i>) what is the projected budget for 2007 and 2008 (if applicable and available); (<i>c</i>) how many CMHC-funded housing units for singles and families currently exist; (<i>d</i>) how many CMHC-funded housing units for singles and families are planned for 2006 and 2007; and (<i>e</i>) what is the amount that CMHC has provided to housing co-ops in the riding for maintenance over the last two years and what will be the amount over the next two years?</div>
    </p><b>Hon. Monte Solberg (Minister of Human Resources and Social Development, CPC)</b>:<a name="Para719251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Mr. Speaker, 
CMHC administers housing programs through agreements with provinces and does not compile or analyze expenditure information by electoral district. Information on CMHC program spending is disclosed in annual reports.  However, over the course of the 39th Parliament, CMHC has undertaken efforts to identify federal expenditures by postal codes which it has then summarized by electoral districts using a tool developed by Statistics Canada. While there is some promise in this approach, there is also a significant potential for error. However, CMHC has, to the best of its ability, verified the location of the units and program spending contained in this answer to try to ensure they are in the riding of Hamilton East--Stoney Creek.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to programs and spending administered by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, CMHC, within the riding of Hamilton East--Stoney Creek, CMHC does not administer any co-operative housing units in the riding of Hamilton East–Stoney Creek. It is to be noted that the responsibility for the administration of the bulk of the CMHC subsidized projects off reserve was transferred to the province of Ontario under the Canada-Ontario social housing agreement signed in 1999. There are additional units in the riding receiving ongoing federal assistance under the social housing agreement administered by the province of Ontario which are not included above. The province has the lead role for these units and does not report subsidies by project to CMHC.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under federal renovation programs, some $566,600 was committed for 43 units in the riding between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006. CMHC is unable to provide a forecast of how many more units and dollars will be committed in 2007 and 2008, since this will depend on the number of applications approved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province of Ontario administers the Canada-Ontario affordable housing program agreement. According to information provide by the province of Ontario, there was not any commitment under this program in the riding of Hamilton East -Stoney Creek in 2006. It should be noted that the province of Ontario is not required to provide forecasts of units planned by riding to CMHC.

    <center><b>Question No. 213--</b></center><b>Mr. Richard Nadeau</b>:<a name="Para719255"></a><p>

Between June 2006, the date on which question No. 59 was answered, and December 31, 2006, PWGSC amended four leases that were expiring in 2006 to postpone the end date to a subsequent year.  The consequence of doing this was that the number of expiring leases was reduced on response a) of question No. 213.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as someone of Ukrainian heritage, I was in communication with other members of this House as early as last year on my interest in working on issues related to the Canadian Ukrainian community and my interest in Ukrainian issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spring of this year it was suggested to me that recognizing the Ukrainian famine as genocide with a memorial day in November would be an important issue to address this year, as it is the 75th anniversary of the famine of 1932.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discussed this with Lisa Shymko of the Canadian Friends of Ukraine and my colleague Senator Andreychuk.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to give full credit to Senator Andreychuk who moved a similar motion a few years ago in the other place which was adopted unanimously.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it very clear that the wording of my bill was established in consultation with my colleagues in April and submitted for drafting on May 3, over a month before I heard about the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78467,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78467&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke Centre's</A> bill and more than a month before his introduction of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2992787,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2992787&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-450</A> only after which I would have first had the opportunity to see the text of his bill. Clearly, I could not have possibly plagiarized his bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719279"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evening of June 13, 2007 in the House, I sought further confirmation from the table officer on duty on the determination of any substantive difference between my bill and the bill of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78467,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78467&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke Centre</A>, who I was now aware had given notice of and introduced a similar bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received confirmation on Monday, June 18 that the decision on whether a bill is substantively different is made by you, Mr. Speaker, after an initial assessment by the journals branch. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore raising this point of privilege because I believe, based on the events as outlined above, that it is clear that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78467,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78467&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke Centre</A>, who knows full well that I could not have seen the text of his bill when I gave notice of my bill, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2909273,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2909273&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-459</A>, and yet proceeded to issue the press release in question.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, when I submitted my wording and asked for it to be drafted in April of this year as a private member's bill, I had no knowledge of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78467,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78467&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke Centre's</A> intention to submit a similar bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to my question of privilege, he states in his press release that I voted against his motion to adopt his bill at all stages when he knows that I did not vote against his motion. That is the normal procedure for both Conservative and past Liberal governments not to fast track private member's bills, whether it be my own bill or an opposition member's bill.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order paper is full of worthy bills and they all follow a uniform process of debate and vote in a fair system of precedence.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are further examples where items published in newspapers and actions taken outside the House have been found by Speakers to establish a prima facie question of privilege due to their intimidating and chilling effect upon a member's ability to perform parliamentary duties. I point to Speaker Bosley's ruling of May 6, 1985, where a newspaper advertisement was deemed to impact a member's privilege. He said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 16, 1983 Mr. Mackasey raised a question of privilege in order to denounce accusations made in a series of articles appearing in the Montreal <i>Gazette</i>, to the effect that he was a paid lobbyist. On March 22, 1983 on page 24027 of <i>Hansard</i> the Speaker ruled that he had a prima facie question of privilege.

Moreover, authorities and precedents agree that even though a Member can “seek a remedy in the courts, he cannot function effectively as a Member while this slur upon his reputation remains”. Since there is no way of knowing how long litigation would take, the Member must be allowed to re-establish his reputation as speedily as possible by referring the matter to the Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to object to another factual error in his press release which is damaging to my reputation in the community.

    </p><a name="Para719298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore insist that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78467,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78467&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke Centre</A> immediately issue an apology and a retraction request to the Canadian and Ukrainian press for libellous claims and false statements.

    </p><a name="Para719303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stressed previously that in my view press releases issued by members are not things that are subject to questions of privilege in the House. All the examples that he cited in his argument were printed newspaper articles. He has not cited a single case where this press release has made it into print. It may be that people who saw the press release knew more about the facts than as suggested by the hon. member and did not think it was accurate, and so chose not to print part of it. I have no idea.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, unless the hon. member has some evidence that this has been printed, and even then I may have doubts about this one, there appears to be a dispute as to facts. The hon. member has raised the issues. He has made clear what his position is in respect of allegations that were made by another colleague. It is a dispute as to facts. I do not think it is a matter of the member's privileges being breached. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719305"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that somebody has suggested that because his bill is a copy of somebody's else's that this somehow constitutes a breach of privilege, to my mind, is unlikely. He has made it clear that it was not, for whatever reasons. He has given his reasons, and he has indicated the dates of filing and all that. It seems to me the matter has been cleared up by his statement and I do not think it is necessary for either the House or a committee to get involved in a discussion about the details of all these disputes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. member wishes to go to the committee and raise the matter there, I am sure the committee can decide whether it wants to bother hearing the issue. However, from the point of view of the House and the Speaker making a ruling whether the hon. member's privileges have been breached, I am afraid I am at a loss to see a breach of privilege in the fact that some other member said something else outside the House about what somebody else did. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719307"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the position I have taken on these kinds of disputes for some time now, as the hon. member, I am sure, is aware and I take it again now. In my view, there is not a question of privilege raised in the issues that he has brought to the House today.</div>

There is also an amendment from the government that essentially guts whatever good work the transport committee was able to do. Essentially we are debating two different series of amendments, a series from the NDP which attempts to save Canadian lives, and a series from the Conservative government which will diminish our safety even further.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes no sense what the government is proposing as amendments today, particularly in light of what we have seen with rail safety over the last few years. The railway companies were basically given responsibility to manage their own safety systems. The former Liberal government basically got out of the safety business. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719356"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we have today? We have an epidemic of derailments across the country. Many communities have been impacted, particularly in British Columbia because some companies, having been given that responsibility to manage their own safety without oversight, have been irresponsible. Lives have been lost. There has been environmental devastation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of learning from that experience of the erosion of safety that took place under the Liberals in railway transport, the Conservative government is trying to do the same thing with the airline industry. What is wrong with this picture? At a time when Canadians are increasingly concerned about derailments in the railway system, the Conservatives are moving forward to do the same irresponsible things to our airline industry. Nothing embodies that recklessness, that irresponsibility of the Conservative government more than the amendments the government is bringing forward.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see what the Conservatives are trying to strike from the record. I am sure Canadians who are watching the parliamentary deliberations today will be very interested in learning what the Conservatives want to take out of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>. It is already a bad bill for a number of reasons. It is a bad bill because it gives a get out of jail free card to companies that violate with impunity safety in maintenance and safety generally. An airline company that does that, as long as it follows some sort of internal process, will get a get out of jail free card. Airline companies can be irresponsible. They can even cost lives. However, if they have set up some sort of internal mechanism and they say that they are following the dictates of that internal mechanism, they get a get out of jail free card. The CEOs can be as irresponsible as they want and the government is giving them a get out of jail free card.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the government is not providing any sort of whistleblower protection in any real form. We were able to get some amendments in committee but it does not in any way protect a whistleblower who has raised real concerns about company irresponsibility.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to all that, the Conservative government is moving forward and rather than having just two exemptions to the Access to Information Act, we will now be looking at nine areas that are cut off forever from access to information. The Canadian public will never find out what companies are being irresponsible and what companies are putting Canadians' loved ones in danger.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These government amendments that are coming forward today take out the safety management systems that any internal programs that companies set up have to have a responsible executive. The government is taking that out. There will not be a responsible executive for whatever purported safety mechanism that is set up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government wants to remove the appointment of an executive who has to be responsible for operations and activities authorized under a certificate issued pursuant to a regulation made under the act and accountable for the extent to which the requirements of the applicable safety management systems have been met. The government wants to take away the requirement of putting in place remedial action required to maintain the highest level of safety.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035">(1035)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para719363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are finding out that the government presented a bad bill. The government wants to repeat the same errors we have seen occur with our railway system, the derailments, environmental devastation and death. Seeing what the Liberals did there, the Conservatives have decided to do the same thing with the airline industry. They are taking out the reference to the implementation of remedial action required to maintain the highest level of safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719364"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we could have a clear picture from Conservative members, if they walked around with a sign on their foreheads, it would say “We want to make sure that we don't maintain the highest level of safety”. That is what the Conservative members are attempting to do with this bill. By bringing forward these amendments, they are gutting a section that requires a responsible executive of the company, to which they are turning over safety management, to put in place remedial action required to maintain the highest level of safety. The Conservatives are saying they do not want the highest level of safety maintained. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719365"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else are the Conservatives taking out? They are taking out responsibility for continuous monitoring and regular assessment of the level of safety achieved. They are taking that out. What could be a clearer notice of intent of where the Conservatives want to go with this?</div>
    </p><a name="Para719366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those Canadians, quite rightfully, particularly in British Columbia, who are concerned about what they have seen in the railway system, now the Conservatives are doing the same thing with the airline system. They are taking out references to continuous monitoring and taking out the requirement for remedial action to maintain the highest level of safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the government amendment is also taking out the involvement of employees in the development, implementation and ongoing operation of the applicable safety management system. The transport committee heard testimony which was conclusive, clear and constant that for any safety management system to work, the employees have to be involved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference to a responsible executive is being taken out. Implementation of a remedial action required to maintain the highest level of safety is being taken out. Continuous monitoring and regular assessment of the level of safety achieved is being taken out. The involvement of employees and their bargaining agents in the development, implementation and ongoing operation of the applicable safety management system is being taken out. Let us gut whatever minor protection existed in the bill. Let us just go to the wild, wild west of air safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719369"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard testimony from witnesses saying that this was exactly the wrong way to go. The Conservatives are saying, “No, that is fine. We do not care about Canadians' safety. We do not care about ensuring that there are high standards. We do not care about all of that”. What the Conservatives want to do is just get out of the safety business, just turn it over to the companies and in addition, if they break the law, there will be not be any punishment or consequences. As long as a company is incorporated, it would seem to be able to do anything in Conservative land. For individuals, the full breadth of the law will be brought down on their heads, but as long as a company is incorporated and has wealthy corporate lawyers protecting it, it can do anything it wants in this new, strange, bizarre world that the Conservatives seem to want to bring forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative amendment is absolutely outrageous. It is gutting what components might have existed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> which is already a pretty reckless and irresponsible piece of legislation. Now the Conservatives have brought forward an amendment to gut what provisions may have existed to actually require companies to maintain a high level of safety, to take remedial action when there were problems, to ensure that employees were involved, employees who are at the front line.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719371"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything was revealed by that terrific series on air safety done by <i>The Hamilton Spectator</i> journalists who basically went in and saw the various levels of safety violations that occur even now with Transport Canada oversight within the Canadian aviation system, it was the importance of having employees involved. Now we have a so-called safety system, we call it self-serve safety, where corporate CEOs can take whatever they want and leave whatever they want behind.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By gutting these amendments that were put in place by the transport committee, essentially to assure at least some measure of safety, what the government is doing is revealing its agenda, and that agenda is not to protect the loved ones of Canadians. The agenda is not to increase the confidence that Canadians may have in the airline system after what we saw happening to the railway system. No, the agenda seems to be purely ideological: to simply gut those safety systems and hand them over to the companies and see if it all works out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719373"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We oppose that. We oppose this amendment. We had hoped to have discussion on the NDP amendment separately from these irresponsible government amendments.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Conservatives want to do makes no sense and should concern people across the country.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Conservatives want to do exactly the same thing with the air transportation system.

    </p><a name="Para719394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the amendments agreed to at committee includes a progressive enforcement program, which includes assurances of compliance and notices of violations without penalty. Transport Canada can and will continue to take enforcement action when necessary and audits can still be conducted if required. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to resources, the number one priority within the department has and will continue to be providing effective safety oversight of the industry by allocating resources to those activities that will provide the greatest safety benefit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also made clear at committee that the concept of designated organizations is being considered only for segments of the industry that do not carry fare-paying passengers or are considered to represent a low level of risk in relation to aviation safety. This was covered in an amendment to the original proposal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting systems were also discussed at length. To encourage voluntary reporting of safety related information, amendments to the act propose a universal, non-punitive, voluntary reporting program, as well as protections for information that may be obtained by Transport Canada when assessing or auditing the internal reporting system of a certificate holder. Data, once de-identified, is available to all for more analysis and distribution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is important to note that protections will never prevent enforcement action for deliberate and wilful commission of violations for which Transport Canada would have obtained evidence through its own investigations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistleblower protection also formed an important part of this discussion. The amendments put forward are in the spirit of this type of protection, while at the same time holding true to the intent of encouraging the cooperation of employers and employees to proactively work together for safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now would like to take a moment to address the five government motions that we have put forth in order to align Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>. The amendments are all very technical in nature.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, during committee deliberations, an amendment was introduced to clause 8 to establish a new rule-making authority for safety management systems. However, upon further review, we see that this same authority is already provided for in section 5.39. Therefore, it will create a redundancy in respect to the enabling authority to make regulations regarding safety management systems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719402"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paragraphs in section 5.39 are much broader and are consistent with the definition of management systems adopted by the committee in the definitions section of the act. It is more logical to keep the enabling authority under section 5.39 because this provision is followed by a series of other provisions dealing specifically with management systems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719403"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there are three motions at clause 12, all of which are editorial in nature and meant to correct inconsistencies between the French and the English. These changes are meant to ensure that both versions have the same meaning and, therefore, equal weight. The purpose of these motions remains consistent with the deliberations at committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719404"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our final motion affects clause 49. The intent is much clearer than the proposed NDP motion for this clause and it still meets the intent of the committee, which is to delay by three years the implementation of designated organizations. This motion will also serve to correct the versions of both languages since as presented they do not have the same meaning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719405"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Canada has one of the safest aviation systems in the world. This bill will go a long way toward ensuring that the required tools are in place to maintain and enhance the safety of Canadian aviation systems for the future.</div>

It is good to finally have a Conservative stand up. Of course, the member did not speak to any of the issues of diminishing safety, and he did not address any of the concerns raised by Justice Moshansky or the many witnesses who came before the committee and raised serious concerns about the direction the government is headed in.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not even address the government amendment that essentially guts any oversight of having a responsible executive that has to look to the implementation and has to ensure there is remedial action required to maintain the highest level of safety. He did not talk about why the government essentially is trying to move to gut what safety provisions were in this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not in any way address why the government is moving ahead with the issue of diminishing airline safety when we have seen what happened with the railways. That is where the government has been completely incomprehensible about this. We saw what happened with railways. In fact, Transport Canada said it had to make changes because when railways violate with impunity the whole issue of safety, as they have, what we see now is the government having to take the railways to court in order to get action to protect the lives of Canadians.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem is that the government is setting aside Canada's existing inspection system, the only one of its kind in the world.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wrong to say that clause 5.391 replaces this paragraph, because the paragraph on page 8 stipulates that every carrier must perform continuous monitoring and regular assessment of the level of safety and mentions the involvement of employees and their bargaining agents in the development, implementation and ongoing operation of the system. I hope the member is aware that deleting this from the bill will endanger Canada's existing inspection system.</div>

I am still left with the question, and I guess anyone who is watching this debate is wondering, whether the government is interested in getting the bill through the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the government do? It has presented an amendment, which I would have expected the government would try to defend. If I read the mood of some of my colleagues, it has no chance of passing. In Motion No. 2 the government tries to delete clause 8, lines 1 to 25. There is no chance of that happening, none whatsoever. Therefore, I have to ask myself whether the government is interested in getting the rest of the bill through.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee worked for four full months on the bill. I reject, outright, the rhetoric of the member from the NDP, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78654,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78654&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—New Westminster</A>, who suggests that people have a desire to wreck the system instead of improving it. As a member of the committee, we worked for four diligent months on improving a bill to ensure the safety of Canadians, who trust the aviation industry to get from point A to point B. While we were trying to improve the bill, he has suggested we were trying to do something negative. It is absolutely insane that someone would do that. It is absolutely irresponsible, hypocritical at the very least.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell the House why. The NDP presented a series of motions. The fourth one says that the bill be amended by deleting clause 12. Clause 12 is the heart of the entire bill. Judge Moshansky, to whom the member referred, said that we could keep this bill and we could make improvements if we wanted, but if we touched clause 12, then it would be all for nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee members heard him and went through a series of debates. Colleagues from three parties, except the NDP, looked for ways to ensure that clause 12 could be improved. We looked for ways to ensure that accountability practices and transparency would be available throughout the bill. Yet today the NDP members come forward with a decision to gut clause 12. In addition, they put a series of other motions to delete other measures that would improve the bill. Then, with the greatest of chutzpah, they say that another party, which refused to stand up in its own defence, is interested in gutting the bill. They even get it done up in one of the papers in southern Ontario. There was obviously a lot of research done, but I cannot believe it. The government members are sitting there saying that it is okay, that they will vote on this and something will happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who had a desire to make improvements to a bill, which looked for amelioration of conditions for travellers in aviation in Canada, an industry that is growing by leaps and bounds, we are absolutely outraged that the NDP members would have proposed their amendments and that the government would have suggested that we remove clause 8, after we had debated this in committee at great length.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my colleagues on this side of the House are probably going to feel the same sense of outrage. We could not have worked this closely for that long and that precisely to have the government then come back and say that it does not matter that we did all of that, that the committee approved all of this and that it wants to take it out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? It is nonsensical. The clause the government wants to amend is reflected again in subsection 5.9(3), which reinforces a ruling oversight, a structure that says as we receive information on an SMS system, we will put the system in a position to safeguard those people and the system itself against frivolous actions or legal actions.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could say the bill is designed to ensure that information comes forward freely. It is the ultimate whistleblower legislation. Those who bring forward information they might not otherwise bring forward will not be penalized for looking out for the greater interest of the public. The greater interest of the public is what the SMS system is supposed to address. Judge Moshansky has said that we could avoid a lot of things as people come forward with more information about how to improve the system, but we have to give people an incentive and protection when they come forward with that information. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We put that in subsection 5.9(3) and in section 4.9. The government is now going to pull it out of section 4.9. Why? Where is the sincerity in wanting to make the parliamentary system work and the safety management system that the government wants to put in place?</div>
    </p><a name="Para719436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were sitting on the government side and presented legislation to initiate this process, we were open enough to recognize that there would be other views and that those views would come before the House and committee. That bill did not survive the election of 2006, but it did come back in three different formats. This is one of those. To try to link this legislation with rail safety, which the committee also dealt with, is doing a disservice to the integrity of members of Parliament who want to improve aviation safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us are getting on in years. I have some grandkids, Isabella, Gianluca, Alessandro, Stefano, Tazio and Amedeo, and I know they are watching this. I know in a few years they will ask if those members of Parliament, who were with their granddad, were looking out for their interests when they travelled. We see the famous commercials about dad not drinking and driving, and we see the little child on the poster tugging at our heartstrings. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the member from Burnaby is saying that the rest of us are being irresponsible for wanting to do something with this legislation. I am offended because the government introduced a motion to gut an important element of the bill after agreeing to it in committee. The only member who voted against the amended legislation was the NDP member from Burnaby. The Conservatives voted with all other members. Now the government comes before the House and wants to gut one of the most essential elements in the legislation. That is insane. This is the story of the kettle and the pot. I do not know how NDP members can look at themselves in the mirror in the morning. They introduced a series of 12 motions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719439"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill, as amended, would improve a structure and would build an architecture for safety management systems in the aviation industry. Those who came before committee said that if we did these things, they would support the bill. Now the NDP members are now saying that those of us who spent four months trying to improve the bill are being nefarious in our intent because we are trying to produce something that, as one of the members already said, set the fox among the chickens. That is absolutely outrageous. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All colleagues should vote against the government motion and against all the NDP motions so we can get on with a serious discussion about amended Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my understanding that a great number of the amendments proposed in the bill are described as technical or editorial in nature. There were some serious amendments and efforts, as the member mentioned, during the four months of hard work by the committee, and I applaud the committee's efforts. However, I would like to ask the member opposite whether there was a consensus among the pilots represented at the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my understanding, if there is anybody who would want to ensure there is safety in the air, it would be the men and women whose livelihood is flying these aircraft. Were the pilots in favour of the amendments being proposed to the bill?</div>

First, I do agree that some of those motions, such as Motions Nos. 6, 7 and 8 on the government side and Motion No. 16, are really technical amendments. They use language with which I think everybody agrees. They try to clean up the language that we agreed in committee needed to be cleaned up but they are not germane to the actual bill itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would never support Motion No. 2 from the government side because, as I said, that guts an essential element of compromise that was reached among all committee members. I say that because it is important for all of those who are following the debate to understand that if one is to answer the question of the member opposite about the acceptability of what the committee was doing for those who are actually engaged in the industry then the answer has to be yes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those people, the pilots especially, could only support the legislation if in fact the committee had listened to all of the interventions by interested parties, by expert witnesses and by those who are experts on oversight, and then acted accordingly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the committee acted accordingly in the main. What happened, of course, is that the committee amended the legislation to reflect the concerns of all of the interested people and all of those who are experts in the area of aviation safety and in the area of safety management systems and their outcomes. I would be surprised if the amended Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> would not receive the support of the aviation industry and the pilots' association.</div>

    </p><a name="Para719449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing more at risk and fragile than an airplane in the air and particularly one that is not safe. It surprises me. I see the government on one front, and particularly where air is concerned, going over the top with now a no-fly list and the rigour that is exercised when we go through security to get on a plane, the backups and the lineups that we all experience. I have no difficulty with those things because I think we do need to ensure that when we fly, and thousands of people fly every day, we feel confident and we feel safe.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to turn the oversight of the safety of airplanes to the companies themselves that actually run them, given the very competitive nature of that industry now, it does not seem to me to be very much in the public interest. I would like the member to respond to that.</div>

    </p><a name="Para719452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second view was that an inspectorate to provide the appropriate oversight would actually have increased mechanisms and resources to get the job done.

    </p><a name="Para719453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took that into the committee and the committee's amendments to the initial act reflect that fact. In other words, an SMS works but the inspectorate and the ability of the government to regulate the industry and provide inspection to ensure there is compliance remains not only untouched but actually improved.</div>

It is a pleasure because our party, the Bloc Québécois, opposed the first version of the bill tabled here in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We opposed the bill because of the actual wording in the bill. Statements made by senior Transport Canada officials suggested that the intent of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>, with respect to safety management systems, was to replace Transport Canada's inspection service. The inspection service consists of a mechanic-inspector, a mechanic-engineer-inspector and check pilots, that is, over 800 people who can, at any time, intervene without giving prior notice to any company, to check the condition of the aircraft and to ensure that the pilots are qualified for that type of aircraft. Thus, it was a genuine inspection system. Thanks to that inspection system, in recent years, Canada has been one of the top countries in aviation safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to ensure that this system was protected. There were statements from Transport Canada, including from Merlin Preuss, the director general of civil aviation. He told his own employees that down the road, Transport Canada's inspection service would be replaced by the safety management system. He also said that the number of inspectors would be cut by half around 2010.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport Canada was already planning to replace the inspection system that was so successful and still is. Furthermore, the inspection service was not enhanced even though there are more planes, the industry is doing well and there are more airports accommodating the planes. Nothing was done to increase the number of people working for the inspection service. Obviously, we were concerned about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In committee, we heard witnesses and we were finally able to make some changes. We were hearing two different things. Transport Canada told us that this service would be added to the inspection service, but this is not what we were hearing from those in the field. Earlier, I heard a Conservative member ask a question about the pilots. The Canadian Air Line Pilots Association came to tell us in committee that the inspection service should be changed and that the inspectors should probably do something other than monitor the pilots.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could understand that the pilots did not always like being subject to some sort of inspection of their work, without notice. They were not too happy about it, but it is something they are going to have to live with. When we have a safety system, we are not there to avoid frustrating air line pilots or anyone else. We are there to have a pre-established system. The Bloc Québécois' goal always was to ensure that the inspection system, which has made Canada famous, is maintained.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the discussions, work and witness appearances, the government decided to take this line. Thus, changes were made to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> that will guarantee some things. Personally, before the changes and the amendment put forward by the government, I could say to my colleagues in my party that we can indeed change people's minds because the government did decide to maintain the inspection system and the safety management system, as recommended by ICAO.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Civil Aviation Organization representative told us that all over the world, countries are implementing safety management systems that have to be added on to their inspection systems. We were on our way to having a bill that recognized the desire to maintain inspection services when we found out a few days ago that the government wants to get rid of clause 8, which it had agreed to in committee. Clause 8 is the very definition of a safety management system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should take the time to read clause 8, because it provides definitions of the safety management system.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 named the person responsible and listed all the obligations to be met by the airlines. It will be replaced by a paragraph that says that all the airlines have to do is to name the person responsible. It is difficult to understand.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I have a better understanding of why the government was in a hurry to adopt Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>: it decided to make itself look good in committee and then to return to the House to propose amendments that will change the meaning of what was discussed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will change the whole meaning of the discussions and Transport Canada will have won. The pilots who were not happy about having check pilots to oversee their work will have won. The airlines that were not happy about having inspection and monitoring systems will have won.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, the inspection system allows for an inspection to be carried out without warning. The Bloc was concerned because for business reasons, many airlines are established and fail practically in the same year. We are committed to ensuring that our citizens are safe.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we explained to ICAO what Transport Canada was trying to do, it did not understand. It believes that an inspection system must be kept. Today, all that could be set aside. I understand that the government is in a hurry to finish up with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>. However, there is a problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this motion sets aside the entire aspect of inspection. Thus, Transport Canada could go ahead with its initial plan, which was to reduce the number of inspectors, check pilots, mechanic-inspectors and engineer-inspectors by replacing them with just a safety management system. That worries me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will vote against the motion in amendment tabled by the government. There are also the motions tabled by the New Democratic Party. I think that the NDP members must talk to one another. Initially, the Bloc was opposed to the entire safety management system because we believed that it would take the place of an inspection and monitoring system. We want to ensure that the inspection and monitoring system is kept.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Liberals, the NDP and the Bloc defeat the government amendment, the opposition will have knocked some sense into the Conservatives. We will force Transport Canada to keep the inspection and monitoring system, as recommended by ICAO. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we will have been the responsible ones. The Conservatives decided not to be responsible. That is their problem and, besides, it is typical of them. The Conservatives are closer to companies that do not want to be monitored and inspected. It costs money to always be on the lookout and ready to receive inspectors at any time. But that is what is needed. That is what our constituents want. Quebeckers want to be assured that, when they get on a plane, the airlines have made every effort to offer better safety. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be guaranteed by voting against the government motion, thereby ensuring that the current inspection system is maintained, and forcing businesses to conduct better analyses and to consider everything that is important. Thus, Transport Canada's inspection service will be more effective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inspection may not take as long, because businesses will have upgraded everything to ensure that the aircraft are in good condition and that the pilots have received proper training. Furthermore, these inspectors could fly with the pilot to ensure that he or she is properly qualified and that the aircraft is in good shape.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what we want to ensure and what we will do. As for the NDP motions, they demonstrate that the NDP is not quite there yet. We are convinced that the safety management system adds yet another layer to the safety net. I can assure this House that the government's amendment, Motion No. 2, which amends the very foundation of the definition of the safety management system, will be defeated in order to ensure that Quebeckers and Canadians can fly safely.</div>

Does he not agree with us that from its very inception, which was brought in by the Liberals, this has been part of a trend to turn absolutely everything over in government to the private sector because it is felt that it can do things more efficiently and cost effectively without any real consideration to the public good, the public safety or the protection of citizens?</div>
    </p><a name="Para719488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more about saving money, pulling government out of areas that require further expenditure and more effort by government to protect its citizens. If this is not another step down that road, but a very alarming step because there is nothing, in my view and experience, more fragile than an airplane full of people crossing the country at a great height and if something should go wrong, there is absolutely no turning back, no way to deal with it without the possibility of great tragedy. I am wondering if that is part of the reason that the member's caucus will be voting against this bill.</div>

Our caucus will vote in favour of the bill, but against the amendment introduced by the government that would reduce the level of safety. We will also vote against the amendments introduced by the NDP, because they still do not see that the safety management system is an extra layer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are satisfied with the bill, as amended by the Bloc Québécois and other parties and passed by the majority—the NDP voted against it. We want to maintain an adequate inspection system, which has been Canada's strength, and to add an extra layer of safety in order to force companies to have an internal management system to facilitate the work of inspectors. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what we want to do and it is what we will do, so the government's amendment will have to be defeated. Once again, the purpose of this amendment, Motion No. 2, is to allow Transport Canada to abolish its inspection system and replace it with the safety management system. The Conservative members did not understand this. They once again listened to Transport Canada. Transport Canada's desire was expressed in 2006 by Merlin Preusse, Director General of Civil Aviation, when he told his employees that they would see their services decrease by about 50% by 2010.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not what we want. We want an inspection and monitoring system like the existing one, which would enable someone to arrive unannounced at any airline to ensure that everything is in order—the aircraft, the pilots and the mechanics—and that everyone working there has the necessary training. This is what we want, and it is what we thought we had before the government introduced Motion No. 2, which we will make sure we defeat in this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also the NDP amendments to consider.

That is where I stand, but the NDP are not there yet. Perhaps by rereading it, trying to analyze it and talking to us, they will come to understand it some day.</div>

    </p><a name="Para719495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our discussions and in the work we are doing with respect to rail derailments across Canada, one of the things that was pointed out to us on the committee is that the Railway Safety Act lacks the muscle and the teeth that the Aeronautics Act presently has. The suggestion was that when the time comes we will be recommending changes to the Railway Safety Act to put more teeth in it so that the safety management systems that are in place in the rail industry can be enforced in the way they can be with the Aeronautics Act right now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think it is also fair to say, and the member from the Bloc may comment on this, that all members of the transport committee have expressed a high concern for air safety in terms of the passengers, the crews, the pilots and in terms of the safety issues that are referred to by air safety at the airport, just generally the whole concept of air safety, and that was the nature of the discussions that occurred.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I can see, the amendments that the NDP has proposed really restate issues that were raised in debate among all the committee members following the presentation of information from the witnesses. They were debated in the committee, voted on and decisions made. Therefore, this is a re-entry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the government's Motion No. 2 does attempt, as has been said by both my colleague and the Bloc member, to change the nature of the bill and we will not be supporting it.</div>

This is, quite simply, because the railway inspection system created by Transport Canada has only 25 inspectors for all of Canada. Imagine the kilometres of tracks to be inspected. One day, that legislation will have to be amended. We must not make the same mistake as the Conservatives, however, by trying to reduce the aviation inspection service, which consists of 800 employees, to 25 inspectors, like the railway inspection service.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time comes to amend the legislation to enhance rail safety, it will be important to ensure that the inspection and monitoring system can guarantee that the safety management systems created by the railway companies are adequate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An inspection and monitoring system is therefore needed, and that is what the ICAO is talking about. Every country must have an inspection and monitoring system so that, when safety management systems are in place, it is easier for inspectors to ensure that companies are in fact safe. </div>

    </p><a name="Para719503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we cut through all the rhetoric we hear in this House, the bill would move us a huge step forward in improving the safety of aviation in Canada. As a member of the transportation committee, I had a chance to hear all the witnesses who appeared before us, and there were many of them. They represented the different aspects of the industry. They represented, of course, Judge Moshansky, who was involved in an earlier inquiry into the Dryden tragedy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What came out very clearly from all the witnesses, even those who were perhaps opposed to the direction in which this bill was going, was that if we pushed them far enough, the witnesses would admit that safety management systems are a good thing for the aviation industry. SMS, as we call it, clearly improves safety. It is another level of safety that we superimpose upon the already existing regulatory and enforcement framework. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were at the committee, the members of the committee know that, as a result of the testimony of the witnesses, we as a government brought forward amendments, as did the other parties, the NDP, the Bloc and the Liberal Party. Quite frankly, I believe we were able to accommodate most of them because all of us had a common goal: to ensure that aviation safety in Canada is improved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee also heard from representatives from the International Civil Aviation Organization. When asked what Canada's record in civil aviation safety was, they said that Canada was the leader in aviation safety. When asked where Canada was in terms of implementing SMS, they said that Canada was the leader in adopting SMS, which is a good thing. It is not a bad thing, as the NDP would have us believe.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard a lot of rhetoric in this House several minutes ago about how this legislation was essentially a get out of jail free card, that this legislation was full of holes and that it would actually lead to a reduction of current safety levels. That is not true.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the big objections was the suggestion that this bill and the safety management systems were, in effect, self-regulation or deregulation of the industry. In other words, the suggestion was that the government was washing its hands of the whole safety issue when it came to aircraft. However, that is not the case at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of very good suggestions were made at the committee and we as a government said that they were excellent suggestions. To ensure there was no doubt that we still had a strong regulatory oversight, we agreed to amendments that were brought forward by the other parties and other members of the committee that would ensure there was no step backward, that the existing enforcement mechanisms would still be in place, and that superimposed on that would be the safety management systems that each organization would need to adopt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of safety management systems is that we are now empowering companies, airlines, small aircraft operators and their employees to identify safety concerns and report those on a non-punitive basis. That means that if I, as an employee of an airline, find that someone missed a bolt here or someone else did not do the work correctly on the aircraft, I can report that and not worry about being punished for that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear from the evidence that we heard at committee that implementing SMS and engaging the front line workers in the airline and aviation industry will lead to an increase in the number of reports made about safety issues by 400% to 500%. That is excellent news. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is that the new authority in the Aeronautics Act will not allow the minister to abdicate his oversight responsibility to an industry body. These designated organizations will be allowed to monitor the activity of a specific segment of the industry, but only in those areas that represent a low level risk in relation to aviation safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address a number of the motions that have been brought forward by the NDP. Unfortunately, as usual, NDP members had an opportunity at committee to bring forward amendments. The amendments were defeated, or the NDP members did not think of them. Now after the fact, the bill is back before the House and they want to bring these same motions forward again. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a process in place. If a specific issue has not been addressed when the bill is at committee, surely this is not the place to bring it up, unless it is of critical importance. Quite frankly, all the critical issues were dealt with at committee. We came to a consensus with all of the opposition parties, notwithstanding that the NDP in the end opposed it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the first motion brought forward by the NDP has the effect of limiting the definition of a violation to mean only a contravention of the act or of an instrument, and would therefore create a void since it would exclude a security measure and an emergency direction. More important, the impact of the motion would be to remove the minister's ability to issue an administrative monetary penalty for contravention of a security measure or emergency direction. That is why we do not support this motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another motion which eliminates the regulatory authority of the Minister of Transport to require designated organizations to carry insurance. During committee discussions this motion was presented, but it was not approved. All concerns in regard to designated organizations were adequately addressed. Where? At the committee. They are found in the reprinted version of the bill. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there was also an amendment that the committee would review designated organizations in three years. We are going to live up to that commitment. That is good. That is healthy for aviation safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third motion, again that we as the government oppose, came from the NDP and it deletes the substance of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>. It is trying to essentially remove clause 12 which contains important amendments that introduce the concept of designated organizations, in other words, organizations that industry can work through to ensure that safety measures are being implemented throughout the industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause also deals with expanding the enabling authority for management systems. Everyone, including international bodies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization, have determined that these amendments are an important step in advancing safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has been called a leader, as I mentioned earlier. To carry this motion would be a cause for embarrassment with countries that are following our lead. Our lead is one that leads to greater, not less, aviation safety within our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fourth motion the NDP brought forward which again we oppose. It is similar to the previous one. It is deleting all sections that deal with designated organizations. We had a good debate at committee. The majority on the committee agreed that designated organizations were a huge step forward in adding another level of accountability, responsibility and monitoring.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fifth motion, which again we oppose, which imposes new compliance tools. The amendments contained in this motion are also meant to make the administrative compliance activities more consistent with other transportation acts, such as the Canada Shipping Act. This clause addresses how the minister will handle notices of violation, assurances of compliance and monetary penalties. It does not make any sense to remove this clause from the body of the bill. We would be gutting it. We would be taking away some of the essential elements of implementing safety management systems in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719523"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other motions. For example, there is a motion that would remove all protection from access to information sought in the bill. Canadians would like to see accountability in government. They want access to information that is important. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What our bill does is it strikes a great balance between confidentiality where employees are concerned, to make sure that they are willing to report safety problems and that they are not afraid. Otherwise we will find cover-ups. As I mentioned earlier, we expect that this legislation is going to increase the reporting by 400% to 500%. That is great news. </div>

    </p><a name="Para719527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ICAO representative told us that Canada was a leader, he also said that our inspection and monitoring service was the key to our success and that our entire inspection, assessment and monitoring service must be kept in place along with the safety management system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois has always stood behind that goal, and that is why we were against the bill as tabled by the Conservatives. This bill has been amended and changed. Now that the Conservative Party has decided to backtrack with its Motion No. 2, I have a problem. My problem is that the member thinks everything Messrs. Reinhardt and Preuss and the Transport Canada people say is gospel truth. Yet it was Mr. Preuss who, during a convention in August 2006, told his employees that staffing levels would be cut in half by 2010. <sup></sup></div>
    </p><a name="Para719529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the Conservatives in the committee decided to go along with us, to go along with the Bloc's recommendations, and the Liberals also supported us with respect to maintaining the inspection system. But that is not what will happen if we get rid of clause 8, which clearly defines the safety management system to enable better monitoring and inspection.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a problem with this clause, because I know that Transport Canada asked the government to do this. The member did not do this on his own, because in committee, he supported us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we always have to believe everything that Messrs. Reinhardt and Preuss tell us?</div>

    </p><a name="Para719533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially the suggestion came from the NDP, the Bloc and a couple of the witnesses that supposedly at one time there were 1,400 inspectors. That number had gone down to somewhere around the 750 mark. In fact, later on, evidence at the committee, as the member knows, showed very clearly that of the 1,400, a very significant number had been reclassified. They were still in the system. In fact, the evidence at the end of our committee meetings made it clear that if anything, the number of inspectors that are in place today is higher than it was 10 years ago. We have not in any way taken away from that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719534"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to point out to the member that when we were discussing the amendments at committee, we acknowledged that there was a clear role for the minister to oversee aviation. We introduced an amendment that the minister shall continue to carry out inspections of the aeronautical activities of holders of Canadian aviation documents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not saying that the designated organizations are going to take over the role of government. The amendments that we accepted at committee make that very clear. At no point in time do we ever want to compromise aviation safety. The purpose of this bill is to actually enhance aviation safety considerably. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719536"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we heard evidence from international organizations, such as ICAO, they confirmed that Canada is a leader in aviation safety and it is a leader in implementing SMS. The world is looking to us as the model to follow. I think that is encouraging news for the member. I encourage him to support this legislation.</div>

When asked where Canada stands in terms of aviation safety, the response was that Canada is the leader. When we asked what safety management systems are going to do to our already excellent record, the ICAO said that they would just enhance it considerably. In fact, safety management systems are being implemented in the United States and around the world. Canada is one of the leaders and this legislation is leading legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is also remarkable is that not only does ICAO support it, not only does Transport Canada support this legislation, not only do the airlines support this legislation, but the two airline pilots associations that appeared before committee strongly support SMS. They wanted to make sure that there was strong regulatory oversight. The amendments that we adopted at the committee, as the members will know, do exactly that. We are not trying to bail out of our responsibility as government. We are insisting that we move forward to enhance aviation safety, not move backward.</div>

After first reading and the debate at second reading, the Bloc Québécois was opposed to the bill. We had a lot of concerns about comprehensive safety management systems, which came with no guarantees that the detailed inspections by federal check pilots could continue. At the same time, there were many signs that the number of check pilots would be reduced in the future. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78639,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78639&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel</A> and I studied the bill carefully. The committee held 11 meetings to hear witnesses from all the stakeholder groups—pilots, federal officials, lobby groups—and six special meetings to examine the bill clause by clause. After studying all the clauses, we wrote a report, which was recently tabled in the House and proposed 20 amendments to the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc's concerns have to do with the safety management system and the designated organizations, because we did not have a clear idea of what responsibilities they would have in the overall system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard the different parties, including Justice Moshansky, an aviation expert who even conducted an inquiry into a plane crash. He said that the clause on designated organizations should be kept, but with provision for oversight. This is what we did, as it was clear to us that, in light of all the positive comments we had heard, this safety management system could give good results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we made sure government inspections would continue, in particular by means of the Bloc amendment, which stated:</div>

        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>

</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para719548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We proposed this amendment, which was included in our committee report, because we wanted to ensure that the inspections that are already part of the air transportation system would continue, despite the more general implementation of safety management systems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, we made sure that Transport Canada would not just have audits of the systems themselves done and not carry out its own visual and technical inspections of aircraft. By doing this, we are bringing about what the minister and the department were talking about—a dual safety system—and not just replacing inspections with a safety system. Continuing with the inspections and implementing the systems across the board ensures that, as a basic principle, all companies will be governed by a safety management system. We can at least rest assured, thanks to the continuing inspections, that the system itself will improve safety overall within companies. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am particularly disappointed that 16 last-minute amendments are being introduced at this stage. Of these, 10 or 12 have been moved by the NDP. One amendment asks for the elimination of clause 12. We studied designated organizations together at length and now, all of a sudden, we are told that all that will be eliminated, at the last minute, even though these views were not accepted when the bill was studied in committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most surprising is the government's amendment No. 2, which seeks to eliminate everything pertaining to safety systems. The NDP, the Bloc and the Liberals worked together to come up with a good definition, which was not in the legislation. It is a matter of regulations, establishing regulations for safety management systems. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to the trouble of spelling out the definition of these systems. Suddenly, at the last minute, just before the vote, the government wants to eliminate this definition—which is very binding for the government, it is true—that allows us to give our full support to this bill.</div>

We do not just want to have a nice system that comes from management and is in the company's files, but does filter down to the core to ensure full involvement of the entire company.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the government is proposing to eliminate this entire nice definition that we worked on together. It is not very reassuring as far as any wish they might have to implement a good safety management system, which we subscribed to only after examining it and hearing from all the witnesses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I noticed earlier that the representatives of the official opposition will not support such an amendment. They took part in this, just as we did. We do not want this amendment to be adopted. They put forward three or four other admissible amendments that simply make corrections to the text.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this amendment will not be adopted. I also hope that after the bill has been considered by the other place, there will not be any surprises, like the ones we had with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>.</div>

This ultimately could affect all of us in a very negative way if we do not do the right thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering how the Bloc finds it possible to support a bill that takes us further down the road to the privatization of the ability of government to monitor, inspect and participate actively in guaranteeing the safety of our transportation systems and, in this instance, the airline industry in particular.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find this passing strange as well. We have a government that is over the top in concern about safety, particularly in our airlines with some of the moves that it is making now, such as the no-fly list, which I oppose, as it is arbitrary and has no appeal process attached to it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen a trend, first from the Liberals, who introduced the bill originally, and now we see it from the Conservatives as they push this forward more and more toward pulling government out of the responsibility that it traditionally and historically has had in this country and turning it over to the private sector. When we turn these responsibilities over to the private sector, our experience has been that the private sector begins to impose its priorities, which are more about the bottom line, cutting corners and being more cost effective and so on, and I believe that is a risk for the safety of the public and the common good.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the member to explain a bit further for me this morning why it is that the Bloc members will support the bill. They are not supporting the amendment that has been put forward today, but why is it that the Bloc will support this bill when in fact, as we see it, it is taking us down a road that really will be hard to travel back up again once we have gone in that direction?</div>

It gives me an opportunity to clarify this important point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, at the beginning, as I said earlier, we did not support the bill, which would establish a safety management system. To us, it was somewhat abstract, and it seemed to be beyond oversight, in terms of government responsibility. However, we satisfied ourselves that all inspections of the system done by federal inspectors would be continued. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have read the amendment that is part of the report tabled, and it is quite important. It says "the Minister shall maintain a program for the oversight and surveillance of aviation safety in order to achieve the highest level of safety established by the Minister".</div>
    </p><a name="Para719576"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that obligations were added that were not there in the bill at the outset. It simply referred to establishing the safety management system in a general way, even by designated organizations for companies that were able to set it up themselves. That was of considerable concern to us in the beginning, as it was to you. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, by maintaining the minister's obligation to continue all inspections that are in fact done, we made the bill acceptable, particularly given that safety management systems have already been set up in a majority of the major airlines. It is therefore a system that has been tried and tested.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We heard testimony from pilots. They told us that it was a good system. They were reassured by the fact that their companies had their own safety management systems, that they were not simply relying on a federal inspector who makes regular visits, although I do not know exactly what the frequency of the inspector's visits are. Still, if we are completely assured that at least the same level of inspections will be maintained by the government, the system put in place once and for all should provide us with better safety in future. We certainly must not simply rely on an inspection that may be done every six months or once a year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, with a system that is kept in place permanently, we should be even safer. We must not, however, eliminate the companies' obligation to submit to inspection by the federal inspector who is really there to check that everything is as it should be.</div>

It will have ramifications both in the short term and the long term if we allow it to go through the House today. I think it will put at risk the safety of travellers who fly by air across the country and those flying internationally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It disturbs me deeply that we are moving with such haste and in a direction that we have seen in other jurisdictions has proven to be not good, and in some instances disastrous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I commend and thank my colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78654,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78654&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—New Westminster</A>, for the very vigilant effort he has put into this and the oversight that he has provided. The contribution that he has made to this committee, as it has struggled with the bill, has been nothing but outstanding and he continues right to the last minute to put on the table all of those concerns that we as an NDP caucus in the House have raised about the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member speaks very effectively on behalf of many people and particularly those who work in the airline safety industry, groups like the Canadian Union of Public Employees, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, airline inspectors, and other representatives from the trade union movement. They know directly. They have to sleep with this every night. We will have to sleep with this as well if their ability to act on behalf of the common good, in the interests of safety for all Canadians, is in any way jeopardized by the interests of the airlines themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen this on a number of occasions in the not too far past. Many of us will remember the demise of an airline company called Jetsgo in this country. After it was grounded it was found that the safety record that it had was pretty alarming. Just by way of some commentary, I wish to quote what was said in a newspaper at that time:</div>

        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para719586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went on to say:</div>
    </p><a name="Para719587"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Jetsgo experience underscores some of the major findings that are part of an ongoing investigation into aviation safety by the Toronto Star, Hamilton Spectator and The Record of Waterloo Region.

</div>
    </p><a name="Para719588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To simply say that if we pull some of the government oversight out of this and turn it over to the companies themselves that somehow it will correct itself is, I believe, simplistic at its worst.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the government to be moving down that road and with the support of the Liberals in particular who brought the bill forward in the first place, I think, is quite irresponsible. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have our own member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78598,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78598&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Trinity—Spadina</A> raising issues with the minister and the ministry in the context of this bill that speaks to her concern about an airport right in the middle of downtown Toronto. It already presents all kinds of safety and environmental challenges, never mind if that company, as it struggles to find its niche, gets a toehold in the very competitive market of the airline industry, and begins as well to cut corners where safety is concerned in order to be successful and profitable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It concerns us deeply in this caucus that we would allow ourselves to be manipulated, led and driven in this way by the industry itself knowing what happened in the railway sector where we have done this, where we went down this road. There was very similar legislation in place in terms of safety oversight. Now we see day after day, week after week, railway accidents, some very close to communities. One of these days one of those accidents will be disastrous. If we have an accident in the air it is automatically disastrous by the nature of the way that business happens.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of what we know and what we have seen, our past experience, and the road we have gone down with other privatizations of this safety oversight and other privatizations of government operations, why would we continue to support a bill such as the one we have in front of us today?</div>
    </p><a name="Para719593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned just a few minutes ago about the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78654,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78654&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—New Westminster</A> who has worked really hard on this bill. In fact, given that it looked like the bill was moving through anyway because the Liberals, the Bloc and the Conservatives have now agreed that they are going to support, it did make some substantial progress. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think our concern, and perhaps that little bit of progress, needs to be put on the record. These are major policy initiatives that would have a direct impact on Canadians who travel by air.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The financial bottom line of Air Canada and WestJet will be a factor in setting safety levels in the sky. Transport Canada will be relegated to a more distant role as a general overseer of this new safety mechanism that we are putting in place, namely, adequate safety costs and money, but the safety management systems, SMS, would foster a tendency to cut corners in a very competitive aviation market racked by high fuel prices. What would happen to safety when the need to make profits and save money becomes paramount, as in fact it already has? </div>

    </p><a name="Para719597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety management systems would let the government transfer increasing responsibility to the industry itself to set and enforce its own safety standards. It is designed in part to help Transport Canada deal with declining resources and high projected levels of inspector retirements. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the NDP passed an amendment at the transport committee that emphasizes a reduction of risks to the lowest possible level, rather than just accepting or tolerating these risks, we are still concerned about the delegation of safety to corporations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the amendments that we were able to get through committee included: a new legislative requirement for the minister to maintain a program for the oversight and surveillance of aviation safety in order to achieve the highest level of safety, a new legislative obligation for the minister to require that aeronautical activities be performed at all times in a manner that meets the highest safety and security standards, and a new legislative requirement for the minister to carry out inspections of operators who use SMS. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP supported a government amendment to give the transport committee the unprecedented ability to review Transport Canada regulations that may have a reported safety concerns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under pressure from the NDP, the government was compelled to introduce extensive amendments to limit the scope of designated organizations, the bodies that would assume the role of Transport Canada in setting and enforcing rules on airline safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One such amendment would require proper government inspection of these designated organizations while another would require the minister to approve any rules made by these bodies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The designated organizations provisions were also delayed three years before taking effect, as well as being subject to annual reporting to Parliament and the review by the transport committee after three years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment was successfully pushed through to ensure that the Canada Labour Code would prevail over the Aeronautics Act in the event of possible conflict. An amendment was added that would ensure employees and their bargaining agents are included in the development and implementation of SMS.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government was compelled, after extended debate, to introduce a form of whistleblower protection for employees who report to Transport Canada. A new definition of safety management system was put in the legislation, emphasizing a reduction of risks to the lowest possible level rather than just accepting and tolerating these risks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We claim, as I wrap up, that without constant and effective public regulation corporations would constantly push the limits of safety operations, at growing risk to the travelling public. This was said by Dave Ritchie, general vice-president of IAMAW. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the government's intention to download the regulation and monitoring of safety to the private sector is dangerous, we are particularly concerned about the use of SMS in foreign repair stations. If the monitoring of Transport Canada and SMS in Canada is problematic, it is even more unlikely at foreign work sites. So, we continue to be very concerned and will in fact be voting against this legislation when it comes forward.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things the member just mentioned was his concern about this being a disaster waiting to happen.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenge the member. He is not a member of the committee and may misunderstand certain parts of the legislation, but if he is speaking in the House today I am sure he has read through the legislation. I would challenge him to point me to the sections which actually move Canadian aviation in the direction of privatization, move the whole issue of safety management into the private sphere. I do not see it. Maybe he does.</div>

It is located right in the heart of downtown Toronto. One cannot get to that airport without flying over major parts of that very important city in the province of Ontario. The potential for a disaster to happen is definitely there, particularly if we go down the road of turning over safety oversight in this industry to the companies themselves. There is only one company operating out of that airport right now and it is trying desperately to grab on to some piece of that industry, which is very competitive and very difficult. </div>

Marie</A>. When we are called upon to look at legislation, we inevitably look at it through the prism of our region and our experience. What I have seen in northern Ontario, which reflects rural regions across Canada, is the general abandonment at the federal level of a vision for transportation in our country. I want to speak to that first because it ties into the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have three key areas of transportation in northern Ontario. We have rail, we have a very thin ribbon of highway, which masquerades as the Trans-Canada trucking route but often it is two lanes for 18 wheelers on icy roads with rock cuts on either side, and we have a series of airports. A number of years ago two decisions were made. One was at the provincial level and one was at the federal level, which cut loose key airports from the economic life of our communities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One was a decision by then Premier Mike Harris that we did not need the norOntair air service, which was a vital service linking all the communities in southern Ontario. The private sector could step in. The private sector did not step in and key airports were left without carriers and without service.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the federal government was making a decision to walk away from its traditional role of supporting the infrastructure of airports, leaving these airports on their own. In my region, the airport at Earlton has always played an essential role. Also the airport in Kirkland Lake played an essential role in terms of medevac services, connecting the communities in the central Témiscaming region with southern Ontario. The loss of carrier service and the loss of federal support for those airports has seriously challenged economic development. If we are trying to bring new business, new families and entrepreneurs into a region, and the best thing we can offer them is two lanes of highway and icy roads, they are going to think twice. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have asked again and again where the government plan is to ensure that not every single airport, but key airports in key regions are given some level of support in order to maintain themselves. Clearly the issue of the Earlton airport and the Kirkland Lake airport speaks to a lack of vision in the country and about the need to ensure we have infrastructure to support airline service and airline access in all regions, including our rural regions. The lack of support for Earlton and Kirkland Lake is indicative of a lack of vision for the larger transportation issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we see in northern airports that Transport Canada and the federal government no longer mandate the same level of emergency services. For example, at the Timmins airport, which is very busy serving the James Bay coast and the De Beers project with numerous flights in and out, there is no longer the obligation to maintain fire services there. Therefore, this is a question of risk management, that we believe the odds are with us and that nothing will go wrong. If something does go wrong, if we do not have fire services at those key airports, the tragedy would be immense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to speak to this bill because the New Democratic Party members have looked carefully at the transportation agenda being brought forward by the government and by the former government. We have a number of concerns that link to the larger issue of the abandonment of the federal responsibility to set a certain level of standard to ensure the transportation links, whether they be rail, road, or by air, are maintained.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We brought forward a number of amendments to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> because we found it fundamentally flawed from the get-go. At the end of the day, we still believe those problems remain. As far as we can see from having gone through this legislation, this is about allowing industry to set the level of risk, not government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a fundamental problem for us. Look at the Jetsgo situation. Jetsgo was considered a model. Any upstart airport business is considered a great thing when it happens and we support that, but there were major problems with Jetsgo. I can refer to the <i>Toronto Star</i> investigative report that said when it was offering fares as low as $1, a price was going to be paid and that price was in safety, training and maintaining a level or standard with which all Canadians would feel comfortable.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220">(1220)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para719630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians assume the federal government is taking that role. However, we saw Transport Canada do very little to address serious issues. In fact, over a two and a half year period it dismissed the troubles being brought forward on safety. It said that it was part of the growing pains of a start-up operation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be quite the growing pain if something did go horribly wrong, and they can go wrong. Given the risks of airlines, being much greater than any other form of transportation, we have to ensure we have the standard in place. This will ensure that either a start-up airline or a long-standing airline has to meet a certain standard of safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe the issue brought forward in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> is that we will let companies set their level of what is acceptable risk, and that is simply not good enough. We are concerned about why the Conservative government would bring this forward right now. There are key areas that the Conservatives campaigned on. One was access to information, which they said would bring accountability. They also talked about whistleblower protection, again for accountability. Then there is the larger issue of simple accountability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we look at the bill and the flaws in it, the New Democratic Party's research on the bill has found that instead of allowing for access to information on flight safety, it heightens secrecy. It restricts access to information on the safety performance of airlines. Canadians will be left in the dark when it comes to important safety information. Public access under the Access to Information Act to safety information and reports to Transport Canada by air operators will be totally unavailable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not acceptable, especially for a government whose members, for example on the issue of accountability, are running around saying that they are going to give out every Wheat Board meeting note, yet on the issue of Canadians of being able to ask clearly for the records of what is happening with airline safety, they are not going it to give them that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whistleblower protection, we have always thought we would believe it when we saw a government commit to whistleblowers. However, for airline safety, whistleblower protection is vital. We need people to come forward to tell us if there are problems. Otherwise we only will find out the problem after the fact. While some form of whistleblower protection for employees has been introduced, there is no effective redress mechanism for employees who have had reprisals taken against them, other than a warning or a possible fine of the offending employer. We believe there has to be really clear and committed protection so people bring forward problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719636"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the overall issue of accountability, we believe the safety management system in place is not acceptable to the larger issue of public safety. We are allowing the airline industry to increasingly define what its comfort level is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members of Parliament, we fly a great deal, and I have learned a lot more about flight safety from flying. I fly on the large jets, but I also fly on the little puddle jumpers like the little Bearskin tube planes that fly into Sioux Lookout and Thunder Bay. There are also the little planes that I take to the James Bay coast. Therefore, I have begun to reflect a great deal more about the issue of safety. As travellers and passengers, we always assume safety is the first and foremost requirement. However, when we are dealing with an extremely competitive market, when we are dealing with the extreme high costs and the need to get into markets, any industry is going to be challenged. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of safety perhaps does not become an issue of negligence, but cutting a corner here and a corner there can lead to problems. This is why we need that objective body. We need a really clear presence of Transport Canada acting. In terms of railway safety, it has failed to act. We have seen the incredible number of rail accidents that have taken place in the last three years. Clearly this system is not working. We need greater accountability and a greater sense of protection for the public</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me back to the whole Jetsgo issue. We looked through the reports that were done in the media on it. It was very disturbing that a key maintenance document was more than a decade out of date. There were no engineering orders to demonstrate that three safety orders relating to engines had been complied with. There was no evidence that a quality assurance audit, due in the latter half of 2004, was ever completed. The review uncovered a 2004 internal Jetsgo audit that found numerous examples of missing or inappropriate entries on maintenance release forms that allowed the planes to fly in the air.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 10 or 20 years, the deregulation of the airline industry has had a huge impact on remote parts of the country. Northern Ontario has suffered due to the lack of service that has ultimately transpired. We used to have an excellent government operated airline, norOntair, that connected in a safe and coordinated way all the major communities in northern Ontario. Since the deregulation and the pulling back of government from the airline industry, we have found we no longer have the service that we need and deserve. In fact, airports are barely hanging on.</div>

    </p><a name="Para719646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is there are very few profitable sectors in terms of airline transportation in Canada today, where there are enough numbers to generate the kind of capacity building needed. With large level deregulation, we will end up with one or two giant carriers that pick up the key routes and the smaller ones will be left by the wayside. This is the way markets work, but is that necessarily the work of government? </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of our country, in terms of land mass, does not exist between the Windsor-Quebec City corridor, although certain politicians believe that is the full extent of our country. In fact, the vast majority of our country is composed of outlying regions that are harder to service. Those areas are not economically unviable. For example, exploration is key in my region, with its immense resources in diamonds, gold and copper. To bring in either value added or new business, people have to be able to fly there. It is not good enough to fly them three hours away and then have them drive the rest of the way. That does not work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had excellent air service in northern Ontario. The air service covered off all the key communities so people could travel and businesses could develop. That was lost by a decision made by then Premier Mike Harris and by the government when it walked away on its obligation, not to continually fund airports but to ensure a basic infrastructure program so municipal, rural and regional airports could access it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to get back to the issue of the Earlton airport and the Kirkland Lake airport. These are key examples of the kind of airports across the country, which serve important links. Right now they are fending for themselves. They have been downloaded to the municipalities and their ability to continue to provide needed service is highly questionable.</div>

These findings are based on Transport Canada data. That includes more than 800 incidents between 2001 and mid-2005 in which planes were getting too close to each other. In some cases, they were seconds away from colliding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should happen? We are saying that the Transport Canada guidelines will need to make sure devices are put into the planes to ensure there is a system to make sure the planes do not come close to one another.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I raise this? It is because through access to information my office was able to find out that recently in downtown Toronto at the island airport we had an incident on March 13, 2007, I believe, when a Cessna 150, a training school type of plane, was doing circuits around runway 26. There was a Porter Airlines flight, a Dash 8 400, approaching the runway. The plane doing circuits on runway 26 cut off the Dash 8, overshooting, and the two aircraft came within 400 feet vertically or a half a mile horizontally of each other. That is very close. How did I get that information? I obtained it from access to information. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 7 of this bill, no one, no member of the public, whether it is a member of Parliament, a journalist or a person concerned about airline safety, would be able to get this kind of information. The <i>Toronto Star</i> did a series not long ago, in September 2006, recording all of the problems that various airlines, the industry and the passengers had. What will happen after Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> passes is that all of this information will not be allowed to become public.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719660"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the accountability when there is no transparency and no openness? What is the government afraid of? Why is the government shutting down the public's right to know about airline safety? If the government is not doing that, then we should cancel clause 7 and get rid of it. The bill is very clear. Clause 7 says that we cannot continue to have this information.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier there was a question about Toronto's downtown airport and Porter Airlines. Parts of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> say that it is now going to be up to the industry to decide the level of risk that the industry is willing to accept in its operations, rather than it being done through the level of safety established by a minister acting in the public interest. It allows the government to transfer the responsibility from the minister and from government so that the industry itself would set and enforce its own safety standards.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not the way to go. Why?</div>
    </p><a name="Para719663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me describe Toronto's island airport for members. The island airport is in downtown Toronto. It has a large number of pilot cautions. I will tell members what they are. It is stated that all arriving and departing aircraft are instructed to avoid flights over the CNE and Ontario Place. The wind turbine at the CNE grounds is listed as a hazard. There are two large chimney stacks that are noted as hazards, the Hearn power generating plant and the incinerator on Leslie Street.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pilots also are instructed not to fly over surrounding neighbourhoods, including the entire Bathurst Quay, the residential condominiums along Queen's Quay, and the island community. There are close to 20,000 residents in that downtown area. There are high-rises, some of which are 40 to 50 storeys high. Some of them are within a few seconds to a few minutes of the airport. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240">(1240)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para719665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilots are also warned about vessels with 120 foot masts in the vicinity of the final approach to all the runways. There is frequent banner-towing activity over the CNE, which is a hazard. The flagpole in Confederation Park is listed as a hazard. As well, pilots are cautioned that a number of new high-rise buildings have been approved around Fort York. Also, a building on Fleet Street is 44 storeys high, so just along Fleet Street there are at least five to eight new high-rise condominiums that have been approved and are going in.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That area is surrounded by large buildings. Also, because it is right by the lake, people have observed that lake fog in the spring and fall sometimes causes poor visibility at the airport. There is severe weather, such as crosswinds, wind sheer and air turbulence, creating difficult landing conditions. In fact, in just the short while that Porter Airlines has been flying into the island airport, there already has been one incident in which the aircraft could not land at the island airport and was told to go to Pearson International Airport.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aircraft flying into the island airport, the Q400, is certified to operate in crosswinds of up to 60 kilometres per hour. During February 2006, wind gusts of over 60 kilometres per hour were recorded on 11 different days, so in one month alone there were 11 days when the crosswinds were too strong. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another problem at this airport. The runway is incredibly short. The Q400, when fully loaded, requires 1,402 metres for takeoff and landing, which is almost 200 metres more than the longest runway at the island airport. That is how short the runway is. These are the safety requirements at the downtown Toronto Island Airport. Even Bombardier, which manufactures the Q400, has said that 1,400 metres of runway is required only if one of the two engines fails on takeoff. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of problems at the downtown island airport. There is also a problem with the large number of birds in that area. There is a bird sanctuary nearby. Occasionally people have to shoot off some guns in order to scare away the birds. Transport Canada statistics show that the shore birds, and gulls in particular, account for the greatest number of bird strikes and that 80% of bird strikes occur during takeoff and landing. There are all sorts of problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the island airport is run by a port authority that this year at the annual general meeting declared a loss of $6 million in a $10 million business. It is quite incredible that our government is continuing to subsidize a money-losing business and that this rogue agency continues to run an airport that is not welcomed by the citizens of Toronto and definitely has a lot of safety problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing a pattern in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>, which deals with airline safety. We have other bills like this before us, such as Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>, the proposed fisheries act, which basically allows corporate polluters to dump toxic substances without fines. The new act allows the minister discretion to give alternate measures to big polluters instead of criminal records as mandated in the old fisheries act. Environmentalists and people who are concerned about the Great Lakes, for example, are appalled. There is a big campaign against the bill because it is seriously flawed. That is one of the patterns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other things are happening. Last week we discovered that at least 90,000 toys in Canada have dangerous levels of lead and again the government is asking the industry to determine what the safety level is, just like it is doing for the airline industry. We are asking companies to detect toxins and lead in toys and asking them--</div>

    </p><a name="Para719675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to be clear: we know that from the outset this was basically a Liberal government bill. It is roughly the same bill that was placed before the House in 2005 by the Liberals. Back then it was known as Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',93910,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=93910&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-33</A>. It was slated to go through the Senate before the House of Commons. It was introduced in the Senate by a Liberal senator but subsequently was ruled out of order because it was a money bill. Interestingly enough, it was challenged in the Senate by Conservative senators. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill then reappeared magically as Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1992172,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1992172&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-62</A> in the fall of 2006 and of course died on the order paper because of an election. Apparently there were forces at work that made this very bad bill disappear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have it back again. This time it is Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> and not much has changed from the bad old days of Bills <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',93910,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=93910&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-33</A> and <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1992172,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1992172&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-62</A>. It is still flawed. It is the same old bill with the same problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, there have been numerous concerns about the way in which governments, both the Liberals and the Conservatives, are dealing with this area of aeronautics policy and safety management.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the biggest concerns that we and other Canadians have is about accountability, accountability to Parliament, accountability to the people of Canada, and open and transparent decision making, all the things that the Conservatives said were intrinsic to their mandate and inherent in their philosophy and would be fundamental to the work of the House, the work that they would do here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet here we are again, as we have been on so many other occasions over the last little while, with another example of the Conservatives reneging on accountability and the interests of Canadians because of expediency. On a fundamental issue of accountability and safety and security of the people in the country, the government once again is going the route of expediency rather than route of what is in the best interests of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have made substantial progress, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> emphasizes cutting costs rather than improving safety standards. There can be no compromise on airline safety. Let me repeat: there can be no compromise on the safety of Canadians. These are major policy issues that will have a direct impact on Canadians who travel by air. The financial bottom lines of Air Canada and WestJet unfortunately will be a factor in setting safety levels in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport Canada will be relegated to a more distant role as general overseer of safety management systems, or SMS, as we have heard it called. Adequate safety costs money, but SMS will foster a tendency to cut corners in a very competitive aviation market racked by high fuel prices. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That of course will lead to concerns about the profit margin, with a lot of money for fuel and less money for profit. We know that in business profit is paramount. It is called bean-counting. That is where corporations analyze the degree of risk they are willing to take in order to make money. But when it comes to airline security I say that any risk is unacceptable, and I say not in Canada, no bean-counting when it comes to airline security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In collaboration with stakeholders such as the Canadian Union of Public Employees, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, airline inspectors and other representatives from the trade union movement, the NDP transportation critic successfully fought for a number of amendments to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> in the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, serious flaws still remain in Bill C-6. The bill will enshrine SMS, which will allow industries to decide, as I said before, the level of risk they are willing to accept in operations rather than abide by the level of safety established by a minister acting in the public interest.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMS would let the government transfer increasing responsibility to the industry itself to set and enforce its own safety standards. It is designed in part to help Transport Canada deal with declining resources and high projected levels of inspector retirements. This just cannot happen. The Government of Canada has to be responsible. It cannot relegate and slough off its responsibility to the industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the NDP passed an amendment in transport committee that emphasizes a reduction of risk to the lowest possible level rather than just accepting or tolerating these risks, we are still concerned about the delegation of safety to corporations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP did manage to improve this legislation somewhat in committee. A new legislative requirement for the minister to maintain a program for oversight and surveillance of aviation safety in order to achieve the highest level of safety was passed. A new legislative obligation for the minister to require the aeronautical activities be performed at all times in a manner that meets the highest safety and security standards was passed. A new legislative requirement for the minister to carry out inspections of operators who use SMS was passed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP supported a government amendment to give the transport committee the unprecedented ability to review Transport Canada regulations that may have a reported safety concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under pressure from the NDP, the government was compelled to introduce extensive amendments to limit the scope of designated organizations, the bodies that would assume the role of Transport Canada in setting and enforcing rules on airline safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment was successfully pushed through to ensure that the Canada Labour Code would prevail over the Aeronautics Act in the event of a possible conflict.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment was added that would ensure employees and their bargaining agents were included in the development and implementation of SMS.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government was again compelled, after extended debate, to introduce a form of whistleblower protection for employees who report to Transport Canada that their employer is violating the law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new definition of safety management system was put into the legislation, emphasizing a reduction of risks to the lowest possible level rather than just accepting or tolerating risks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still have a number of concerns with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> and the fact that it compromises the safety of Canadians. We believe that the travelling public and aviation workers deserve better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also concerned with issues involving SMS secrecy, weak whistleblower protection and a lack of airline accountability. These compromises are unacceptable. They are unacceptable to the NDP, and I believe they are unacceptable to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The airline industry would be permitted to increasingly define the safety levels of its operations. While the scope of designated organizations has been restricted, significant loopholes still remain. Unfortunately, an amendment ensuring these designated organizations respect key laws in their rule making was defeated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no three year review clause for SMS, as is the case for designated organizations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still no real accountability because this legislation seeks to heighten secrecy. It restricts access to information on the safety performance of airlines. Canadians will be left in the dark when it comes to important safety information. Public access under the Access to Information Act, the ATIA, to safety information reports provided to Transport Canada by air operators will be totally unavailable. We have heard about this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP amendments sought to preserve operations like ATIA in key areas. Unfortunately, these were defeated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new hands off enforcement policy by Transport Canada under SMS would mean that there would be no action taken against corporate offenders if there were problems. The government contends that companies will no longer divulge safety problems without this provision. We find this very unconvincing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe there has to be protection. We believe this bill does not afford that protection. We demand that the government and this House consider the safety of Canadians first.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example. Four Air Canada Jazz mechanics were suspended in June of last year when they warned of poor maintenance of the airplanes that threatened passenger safety. The pilots, various mechanics and air traffic controllers are saying that the management of the airlines would rather not know about any of these safety issues. There is a long list of information saying there is pressure to cut corners, something that all mechanics encounter in the industry as a known stigma, and other mechanics have said there are serious problems. They are over-burdened and underfunded. There are somewhat inefficient government regulatory bodies, et cetera.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that the U.S. prohibits retaliation? It has very clear legislation, called AIR 21, directed at the airline industry. It prohibits employers from retaliating against employees involved in raising concerns of reporting violations of airline safety rules and regulations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that Canada does not have such legislation? There are so many examples of airline mechanics and others being fired. Is that fair? Would this bill make it even worse?</div>

It is clear to me that the Americans understand that employees must be protected. When it comes to losing their jobs, being reprimanded, or finding themselves out in the cold, many employees think about the security of their families and feel obligated to consider the loss of a job and the consequences on the family first.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, it is very cold comfort for those of us who utilize airlines in this country. It is absolutely essential that whistleblowers, airline employees, be able to report with impunity the problems they see. The risks are incredible. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure members have found themselves on airplanes in the last little while. That feeling of vulnerability is profound in terms of travelling by that mode of transportation. No matter what the record may say, we are talking about the past in terms of airline security. We are not talking about a new regime which would occur under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has to be security for workers, pilots and those who would do their duty to the travelling public. There has to be stronger whistleblower protection.

We heard earlier how this bill has come back to haunt this place on several occasions. It began in the other place where it was first introduced, on May 16, 2005, if I recall correctly. At that time the Senate Speaker withdrew the bill because it had funding implications which of course were not appropriate. The government of the day subsequently followed with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1992172,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1992172&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-62</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current bill that is before this place today, rather than improving safety standards, the safety management system will allow the airlines to decide what level of risk they are prepared to take. Each member of the House travels regularly. I wonder how members are going to feel as they board the planes knowing that a lot of the accountability is no longer there and that the industry itself, an industry that is under extreme financial pressures, is going to decide what maintenance to do and when to do it. For myself that raises some very tremendous concerns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost daily in this place we hear government members talk about accountability and in various areas we agree with them. We hear about accountability that has to do with a violent offender and whether people have a right to know when the violent offender is in their community and things of that nature. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7 of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> flies in the face of all of those statements. We hear the Conservatives going on ad nauseam about accountability, but section 7 takes away the right of Canadians to have access to information. Let us think about that for a moment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently at the Hamilton airport there were two incidents where planes that were set to fly overseas had to return to the airport. The very next day in the <i>Hamilton Spectator</i> and other news media across the country, there was a story which told what had gone on and what was being done to account to the passengers and allow them to have some peace of mind as they set about their journey later on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that company had not understood that somewhere behind the scenes there was a sense of accountability, where the company knew that whatever decisions were made regarding those flights would come back and rest on its shoulders in the near future, perhaps those stories and the accounts from that company might have been less forthcoming with the information as to what had happened and what went wrong.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is amazing to me that the government would actually entrust the safety of Canadians to this industry. It is not that the industry has proven to be irresponsible, and I am not suggesting that, but on the other hand when they are looking at the balance sheet and they have shareholders and people with great interest in the bottom line where, is the cut-off point? Where does it become truly in the interest of the public as opposed to the interest of the company when they are trying to decide the cuts?</div>
    </p><a name="Para719720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often refer to a very wise, I would even go so far as to call him a sage, writer. His name is Kris Kristofferson. He wrote songs in the 1960s and 1970s and still is a well-known performer around the world today. In fact, he is an activist on many fronts. By the way, he is no relationship to the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78545,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78545&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hamilton Centre</A>. He wrote in the 1970s that the law is for the protection of the people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my experience, and I think of many members of the House as we review the legislation that has evolved through this place over many years, we would agree with that statement, that the law is for the protection of the people, but in this case with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>, is that truly the case? We have to ask ourselves that. I am not so sure. In fact, I cannot quite understand how they could get to this place.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many members present will likely remember the confrontation in the United States in the 1980s between President Ronald Reagan and the air traffic controllers. At the time, Mr. Reagan took what I think was an amazing stand when he actually had all the air traffic controllers in that country fired. How inconsiderate, to say the least, to the safety of the public, but following that there was the deregulation of the airlines in the U.S. and the number of air crashes and near misses went up tremendously. I am very concerned that we are facing the same thing in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all kinds of problems when we look at the various information that comes to us. We talk about Jetsgo's problems and how it was ignored and the probe into the death of the discount airline not that long ago and how it revealed shortcomings in existing legislation and here we are talking about weakening the legislation that protects people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP in committee put forward a number of amendments and one was a requirement for the minister to maintain a program of oversight and surveillance of aviation safety in order to achieve the highest level of safety, and that was passed. I cannot imagine a person in this place who would disagree with something as fundamental as the government having accountability and authority over the airlines to ensure they follow safety practices. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from the labour movement, I will give an example that I use quite often. We have worker health and safety committees throughout the workplaces in Ontario. I will use a hospital as an example. Many hospitals are moving to offloading or contracting out the health services because they see it as a fundamental work and that it is easy for someone to come in to do. Today, when a CUPE member or an SEI member is doing the work, when people go to the hospital and see a problem they take it to their health and safety committee which carries it to the company where it gets a response. Hopefully, in due course, whatever the issue is it gets resolved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If workers are there earning minimum wage, that worker will see that same thing but because they are under the gun of the low wage, the lack of accountability and not having that health and safety committee to protect their interests, they will simply keep their head down and keep working. Whatever the problem is remains and grows and grows. In the hospital systems throughout this country we are fighting varying forms of bacteria and other things that are taking residence in the hospitals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take that same view of health and safety to the airline industry. When we are flying at 35,000 feet we want to be sure that the person who has worked on that aircraft has followed every bit of due diligence and has had no directives to cut corners or the benign neglect that can come from legislation like this where the employer will tell employees that they have so many minutes to get that aircraft ready. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if members are aware of this but the people who put the aircraft in the air and the ticket people who pass us on to the airlines are not well-paid. Air Canada has contracted out that work and if the aircraft is late in leaving they are not even paid. The emphasis is on getting the plane into the air. If we transfer that same kind of thinking to the mechanics, the pilots and the ground crews, we will be putting the airlines at risk, which is precisely what Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> does. It opens a door at all levels and puts the Canadian public at risk, and we cannot have that. I assume and expect that the members present will totally disagree with Bill C-6.</div>

    </p><a name="Para719730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We in the Bloc Québécois had the feeling that we ought not to eliminate all aircraft inspections. That is why the NDP and the Bloc moved an amendment specifying that the Minister had to maintain a program for the oversight and surveillance of aviation safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that this amendment, which is part of the committee's report, assures us that the government will not be divesting itself of its responsibilities even though a safety management system is being put in place. Rather, I believe he is talking about the designated organizations that he would like to eliminate from the bill with his last amendment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minister's obligation to do all these inspections is being retained. Whatever safety management system is put in place that enhances safety, the government will not be divesting itself of any responsibility and will thus be protecting the safety of the entire population. I would like to hear my colleague on that subject. </div>

I say that because we should not have to deal with this kind of inferior legislation, particularly when we are looking at the safety of our citizens, our constituents. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are entrusted with the responsibility to make public policy and to make legislation that takes into account many different aspects and facets when we look at the bills that have been in front of us recently, be it on trade bills or on voting bills. One of the most important facets in the area of transportation is safety. Protecting the safety of Canadians is one of the key issues that we are here to deal with in this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason the NDP has put forward so many amendments and the reason we are standing today to speak to the bill is that if the bill were to go ahead without any changes or amendments it would be a colossal disaster.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incumbent upon all of us to foresee, and perhaps it is the unintended consequences of the government, but we need to foresee the consequences of any legislation that passes in this place. On Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>, we need to look at the consequences for air safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An issue that has been important in my riding is the integrity of being able to support those men and women who work in our public service to come forward and be protected when they see wrongdoing happening. We know it in the popular term as whistleblowing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was proud to work with my colleague from Winnipeg Centre and other colleagues in this place on the committee dealing with the accountability act, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, to strengthen whistleblower legislation. We believed it should have gone further but we made some important and positive changes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I see this bill, one of the things that stands out that will shock and should appall many Canadians is what the bill does. It takes away that whistleblower protection. We are not talking about maintenance of bicycles, as important as that is. We are talking here about aviation safety. We are talking about very complex mechanisms that most of us would not have the slightest idea of how to get around, whereas with bicycle repair we might.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure that those men and women who see wrongdoing are protected. That is a value and a principle that I thought the government believed in. If we listen to the rhetoric, it suggests that it does but then we look at this legislation and we see that it does not seem to be the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was already mentioned by my friend from Hamilton that many people have spoken out. They are not lay people. They are experts in the field. They are telling us that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> does not get the job done. They are saying that Bill C-6 opens up, not only the safety of Canadians but the reputation that our country has on the world stage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding of the bill is that not even our friends to the south, who perhaps have more of a laissez-faire view of things like air safety, would contemplate going this far. It really begs the question as to why we would believe that, in the area of air safety and this idea of changing things to this extent, we would be better off going with less control and oversight than our friends to the south and in other jurisdictions. It really does beg the question of what we believe we know better than others.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly would not submit to the House that we should do things our own way. Our party suggests that the Canadian way is often the better way of going about things. However, when we are talking about aeronautics and aeronautic safety and we look at this industry, and the fact that it is global in proportion and needs to be carefully viewed, we have to look at this bill and ask, “What is it that the government believes it is helping Canadians with?” </div>
    </p><a name="Para719753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I go back to experts in the field and, if I may, cite an article that I believe has already been referenced but is one that I think bears repeating. The headline says it all: “Judge calls for review of 'sliding' air safety”. I think that says a lot about where we are going here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the 1989 report on the Dryden crash in which 24 people were killed led to many improvements in air safety. We had fears, and I remember that instance very well, that we were in fact backsliding, that we needed to strengthen air safety. We heard from one of the authors of the report who looked at air safety, and the quote is pretty straightforward:</div>
    </p><a name="Para719755"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>I believe the government is moving away from more vigorous inspection and enforcement strictly as a cost-cutting measure, much as was done in the mid- and late-1980s preceding the Dryden crash.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para719756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is not a call for oversight and to review more thoroughly this file, I do not what is. What the good judge was saying, and he was given an Order of Canada for his work in this area, was to not repeat the mistakes of the past. When we allow things to be deregulated without the proper oversight, without protection, for instance, as already mentioned for whistleblowers, we are essentially saying that it is okay to allow for further crashes, for further mishaps.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I point to what we have seen in the rail industry as of late. Since we have given over rail maintenance, and it is not regulated to the extent it should have been, we have seen, and we just have to turn on the radio or read the paper, more crashes and derailments, be it passenger or cargo trains.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want members to think about this because I think it is important. There is a connection between what has happened with rail safety and what is contemplated with aeronautic safety in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>. It is the following proposition. When we had the tools and the oversight, and we had the regulation involved in rail safety, we were able to be more nimble, to be stronger in our response when we had instances where rail safety was failing. We had citizens and people, be it in unions or in management, et cetera, who were able to cite problems in rail safety, be it at crossings or, and we see this presently, with cargo trains that have too many cars on their load. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to do something about it. It used to be that we had the public sector there to respond. Unfortunately, what we did is we gave that up. We gave away the tools to properly respond vis-à-vis rail safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been the consequence of that? As I said, just turn on the radio, read the paper, and look at the evening news, the consequence is cargo and passenger derailments. There is a lack of confidence. At the very time we need to be more reliant on our rail system, we now have problems with rail safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, many of my friends who would like to see our government go further in building the capacity for more rail as a form of transportation see that we have problems because of lack of oversight. So, let us take that lesson from the problems with rail safety and oversight, and the fact we gave that up and gave it away, and let us take a look at—</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the member's question, I do not know why the government wants to put all of this important aeronautic safety information in a locked box for no one other than those who are involved in the industry to know about.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we saw this whole idea of a no-fly list which has been given attention and prominence by the government, when in fact what it should be doing is sharpening its pencils, or in fact taking out erasers and doing this bill over again because it is not up to speed and not good enough for Canadians.</div>

However, in view of the fact that these safety management systems already exist in actual practice, one of the things that we wanted to ensure in committee was that the government oversight and inspections would continue. This is not always the case now. This provision was added in response to the representations made by federal inspectors.

There is reason, though, to wonder why the government wants to rush this bill through despite its many flaws. I think that Canadians are right to be concerned. They should be seriously concerned about this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that people can say anything these days and get anything passed so long as it will reduce government involvement, as if that were a good thing in itself, without any care for the consequences. In this case, the consequences are very serious because public safety is at stake. That is something the government has apparently forgotten. It would rather worry about the profits of the big corporations than the safety of the general public. We should wonder, though, what the effects will be on public safety. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada has often been recognized—as other hon. members have said—as a leader in the field of public safety. There is an expression that when something is finally perfect, people often want to start changing it. In this case too, I have the feeling that the changes are for the worse. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning, my hon. colleague, our transport critic, who has done a lot of work on this, compared what happened in the railway system with what could happen in the airline industry if the government’s proposed amendments are passed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In British Columbia where I come from, there have been many accidents, sometimes virtually weekly, on the railways. We know that these accidents started to increase after the safety system was simply handed over to the companies. The government more or less just offloaded its responsibilities. </div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para719784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law that is proposed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> contains many flaws. The policy issue that is important to note is that this will have impact on Canadians who travel by air. The financial bottom lines of Air Canada, WestJet and others have been preferred and that is going to be the factor in setting safety levels in the sky. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport Canada will be relegated to a more distant role as a general overseer of safety management systems. That is why I asked, with the government saying it is going to reduce government intervention, is that in itself a good thing when public security is being sidelined for commercial interests?</div>
    </p><a name="Para719786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk a bit about the impacts of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>. It seems to enshrine the safety management systems which allow industries to decide the level of risk they are willing to accept, tolerable levels of risk in their operations, rather than abide by the level of safety established by the minister acting in the public interest. Safety management systems allow the government to transfer increasing responsibility to the industry itself to set and enforce its own safety standards. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government seems to think that because it says something it makes it true. We have seen that all too often in the way the government has acted on accountability and in the way it has acted on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A> in tackling environmental issues. The government takes half measures and proclaims it has acted in the interest of public. Canadians are not fooled by this kind of talk. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does not exempt whistleblowers. A worker who identifies a problem, for example, a loose wing nut, and I will not talk about the kinds of wing nuts, reports it and no action is taken, he or she will be silenced. That is a problem with what the government has proposed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the government would like us to think that companies will automatically report any problems to the public. Any of us who have negotiated with the private sector knows there are many financial interests to protect. The private sector is very guarded in anything that will affect its financial bottom line. I fear very much for transparency, for what Canadians will find out about some of the problems that can occur.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the NDP agreed to an amendment in the transportation committee, which emphasizes reduction of risk to the lowest possible level rather than tolerating risk, we are still concerned about the delegation of safety to corporations. Acting in the public interest is still, as I see it, the responsibility of the government. It is not the responsibility of corporations. Their responsibility is to make money. By giving that responsibility over to corporations, the government is abdicating its own responsibilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate safety costs money. Safety management systems will foster a tendency to cut corners in a very competitive aviation market racked with high fuel prices. What will happen to safety when the need to make a profit and save money is paramount? I do not think the bill adds to that and it does not answer that question adequately.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close by asking one last question. What happened to the government's responsibility to protect public interest?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aviation is about risk management, with the emphasis on management and on safety. Those members somehow seem to think we are taking away whistleblower protection.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also talks about the bottom line and suggests that airlines are only interested in making money.

Airlines are very good regulators because that is their bottom line.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are very concerned that both the tone and the content of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> are really geared toward the financial bottom lines of these air transportation carriers and we could put at risk, or at least put back in the order of priority, the best interests of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should note that my colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78654,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78654&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—New Westminster</A>, worked in collaboration with stakeholders such as the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents a great many airline personnel and workers, and IAMAW, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Both these unions have advocated on behalf of the best interests of their own members, but also the best interests of the public at large when it comes to any changes that we make to the air transportation system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of amendments were made at the committee stage, put forward by my colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78654,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78654&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—New Westminster</A>. That is perhaps why so many of us are taken aback today. We made amendments at committee that we believed were progress, with the cooperation of the various stakeholders such as the unions. However, then today, we find the federal <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport</A> making a bid to sweep aside the changes to the airline bill, which were intended to ensure safety in the skies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We find it very troubling that the government has tabled a motion to gut the very critical amendments to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>, which my colleague, <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78654,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78654&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—New Westminster</A>, and other members of the transport committee so diligently put in place. We cannot understand how a minister of transport, in all good conscience, could undermine the work of the committee. Its earnest interest was simply to do what was right for Canadians. It certainly has my colleague, the NDP transport critic, scratching his head and wondering what possible motivation there could be. What possibly could be driving the government to, if anything, back away from safety as priority number one. It is a grave concern to us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very critical of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> in its current form. There are a number of issues, in fact too many issues for me to deal with in any depth in the 10 minutes that have been allotted to me. I will point out some of the concerns in which I have a particular interest. One is Bill C-6, as contemplated by the government, will actually undermine and reduce the freedom of information, the freedom of Canadians to know what the safety situation is of airlines, in that it withdraws seven sections of the act from the Access to Information Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit on the committee that is responsible for privacy, ethics and access to information. It troubles me greatly to see government in any of its activities pull back from freedom of information. On those grounds alone, I would criticize the bill. The public has a right to know what the government is up to and surely the public has a right to know the safety and maintenance information about airlines. Airlines and carriers of the general public are not just the average private business.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345">(1345)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para719815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have a right to be more involved in airline safety and they certainly need more thorough information. I am critical that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> would remove sections from the scrutiny of the Canadian public through freedom of information laws.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also critical that the systems maintenance regime would now be put under the scrutiny of the airlines. We believe this is a stepping back again of government scrutiny and government supervision of airline safety management and essentially the airline industry would be permitted to increasingly define its own safety level of its operations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would think that the airline would make this a priority and that safety interests would be the airlines' top key concern and priority, but in our experience it is a legitimate role of government to take responsibility for those things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very concerned that another element of this bill would become very weak or in fact non-existent, and that is the whistleblower protection. While a form of whistleblower protection for employees has been introduced, there is no effective redress mechanism for employees who might suffer reprisals as a result of blowing the whistle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind members that this is one industry sector about which, for heaven's sake, the public has a right to know. The public has an interest in knowing if there are any shortcomings in the maintenance regime, and whistleblowers should be rewarded, not criticized and certainly not suffer any form of reprisals. Those three things, piled together, give more than ample reason to be critical of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719820"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill has a rather rocky history in that it was introduced in the last Parliament by a senator in fact. It came to the House first known as Bill S-33, introduced by the other place. We are always suspect, frankly, when bills come to us through that back door mechanism. After a great deal of debate there, it was later reintroduced as Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1992172,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1992172&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-62</A> under the Liberal regime in September 2005, but it died on the order paper and did not go past first reading.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719821"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we came to it in this particular Parliament, I note that a great deal of time has been spent on this already. It was introduced on April 3, 2006 as Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>. After a brief staff meeting, the NDP was disappointed that the Conservatives and the Liberals initially struck a deal to pass Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> without any further amendments. This is why I began my remarks by complimenting my colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78519,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78519&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—Douglas</A>, for the yeoman's job he did, virtually alone at the committee, to overturn that alliance that was put together by the ruling party and the official opposition that they would somehow ram Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164201,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164201&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> through in its flawed state.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was clearly a lack of consultation with the stakeholders or these many amendments would not have been developed. I cannot imagine any government going forward with legislation like this without doing a comprehensive consultation with groups like CUPE and the IAM. When we received it back today and realized that this was not only not in its original form but that the amendments made at committee would be stripped back and undermined by the minister and that the Tory amendments intend to gut air safety, we could not help but stand up and be critical.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People will notice that a number of speakers from the NDP are speaking back to back on this bill because the public has a right to know and the public deserves to know. The public should know what is going on in our air transportation safety system and I do not believe, if it were left to the devices of the ruling party and its partners in crime, the official opposition, which has been absent, AWOL as it were, in terms of doing its job as official opposition and bringing the government to task for the glaring problems and oversights with this--</div>

    </p><a name="Para719826"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter, if the member can ever recognize it, is that there were four months of witnesses, debates and scrutiny that surfaced in the form of a series of amendments now before the House and the only party that voted against all of the amendments proposed by all the interested parties, all of the industry sectors, all of the labour unions and all of the client representatives was none other than the NDP.</div>

Well, the opposite is true as well. Just because the NDP members read something into something does not make it so, and that is what they have doing all day throughout the debate.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will point out once again that safety is an airline's bottom line. If it violates safety, its bottom line will be affected directly. However, I will point out one thing that keeps coming up. Members keep talking about the 100 vacant inspector positions. What they do not say is that there are 873 inspector positions and that 100 empty positions at any one time has been a relatively constant number for the last number of years through attrition and so on, and in fact the vacancies are advertised and this is not an abnormal situation. To take it to their numbers, there are still 773 aviation safety inspectors on the job. </div>
    </p><a name="Para719836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel pretty safe and I think most people here do. The NDP will never get the relationship about risk management, safety and the practical common sense bottom line.</div>

I have represented Canada around the world but nothing compares to the natural beauty of Macleod.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719839"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the southern Alberta Summer Games being held this year in the Crowsnest Pass in July to Longview's Bar-U Ranch, a national historic site celebrating its 125th anniversary this year, Macleod is rich in history and activity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macleod's businesses and communities are at the forefront of local innovation and development, especially in the biofuels industry. In fact, Ag Energy Corporation in Vulcan and Western Biofuels in High River will benefit from the investments made by the federal government in biofuels.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer, farmers in my riding know that they will be able to market their barley outside of the Canadian Wheat Board.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Families and individuals will benefit from tax relief provided by the government's budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business and industry will benefit from Canada's first free trade agreement in six years with the EFTA countries and the new FIPA with India.</div>

To help, they call for new policies such as those in place in other countries which establish a defined period of temporary status for sponsored spouses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Canadians who have sponsored spouses and family members from overseas have been victims of domestic violence and family breakdown. When marriages break down the sponsoring spouse remains financially liable for their estranged spouse under the sponsorship agreement. This includes social assistance payments. These payments, usually in the thousands of dollars, are made without the knowledge of the Canadian spouse. When provincial governments seek to collect, it causes terrible hardship, loss of savings and even family homes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians can be victimized twice, once by an abusive spouse and then by the state on behalf of the abuser.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policies must ensure that in cases of domestic abuse and family breakdown, Canadian sponsors are not further victimized by government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last 71 years, the Ponoka Stampede has treated people from all over North America to top notch entertainment, exciting races and affordable family entertainment.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stampede has become a tradition not only for the spectators but also for the 500 volunteers who come out every year, making this spectacular event one of Alberta's prime annual tourist attractions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719872"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year the animated mile-long parade, that hearkens back to the days of the old west when gunfighters and yodelling cowboys roamed the Prairies, will be led by none other than the captain of Canada's gold medal hockey team and all-around good guy, Shane Doan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something for all ages: superb stage shows, chuckwagon races, pancake breakfasts, rodeo clowns and much more. The high calibre of stock and contestants, plus the unsurpassed facilities, ensure a great show rain or shine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719874"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created in 1998, the Phoenix environmental awards focus on people and organizations in Quebec whose actions respect the environment. Projects that took place in whole or in part during the year preceding the awards ceremony are eligible for awards. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourteen Phoenix prizes in six categories are given out each year to individuals, institutions or associations in Quebec that demonstrate a commitment to environmental protection. Among other things, the Phoenix environmental awards are meant to encourage the protection of natural places, like Gatineau Park, for future generations.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt there will be questions about how a government can get things so wrong: detainees in Afghanistan, two disastrous environmental plans, the twisting of truth on the matters of income trusts and the Atlantic accords, and of course, the biggest spending budget in Canadian history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para719901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever happened and where did this train wreck come from? I believe it comes down to leadership.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank my colleague for his good question. Our super government has a real plan to reduce greenhouse gases and fight air pollution. It is scandalous to find that the Bloc Québécois and the NDP are ready to back a major industrial polluter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bloc wants to stand behind big polluters, that is its choice. Our choice is to protect our environment  and to regulate against these industrial polluters.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I have advised you, Sir, that I will be standing down as member of Parliament for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78693,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78693&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Toronto Centre</A>, effective July 2. I do not wish to take a lot of time of the House to share that notice with you, but I did want a chance to say thank you to my electors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electors of Toronto Centre, known as Rosedale when I first ran, had perhaps the good sense to turn me down the first two times I ran. So, I learned something about democracy. They subsequently elected me five times. There will be members of the House who will think they were right the first time. Others will think they were right the second time. That is what makes a great democracy. I want to thank them for having had the chance to represent one of the great ridings and diverse ridings of our country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720118"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank my wife, Cathy, my children and my family and friends who have supported me. We all know we would not be here without that support.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that it is a privilege to be elected to one of the best Parliaments in the world. It is a great privilege to sit in this House, It is very hard for me to imagine that I will no longer have access to this place that is so sacred to us all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720120"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to extend many thanks to the Clerk of the House and all the parliamentary staff. Far too often we go about our business without recognizing the work they do for us here and in committees.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para720121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our capacity to do our jobs and represent our constituents is enormously enhanced by their work, and I thank them. I know from their applause, members thank them from their hearts as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the opportunity of serving as foreign affairs minister and defence minister. I could not leave this place without being thankful for the extraordinary efforts of the representatives of our foreign service who do us so proud as they work for us around the world, tirelessly and selflessly. I also could not step down without recognizing the fantastic privilege to have been the defence minister and to work with our young men and women in uniform, who every day risk their lives for us and their country and do it so well.</div>

The people of my riding, I hope, will understand why I believe it is important that they be represented by a future voice rather than someone from the past. All parties in the House have representatives now nominated to run in that riding. I would ask that they have the opportunity to be represented in this place as early as possible for the sake of our democracy and our future.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I want to say one thing about the civility of this place. There has been a lot in the press recently about the lack of civility in the House. It may be attributable to the minority situation we are in and it may be attributable to a lot of causes, but surely we owe it to ourselves to disagree without being disagreeable. We do not need to do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe everyone in the House carries within him or her the desire to serve our country and, whether one has that desire or not, the capacity to affect the future lives of every citizen of this great land, and to some extent others around the globe. Let us treat each other with the respect that thought brings. In what we bring to this place, let us respect one another and, in so doing, I believe our fellow countrymen will respect this institution and respect us for the work we do.</div>

    </p><a name="Para720129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78693,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78693&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Toronto Centre</A> has served this House in many roles, as minister of foreign affairs, minister of defence and most recently as leader of the opposition, but his most important role was unofficial. He served this House as the very model of a gentleman.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said, his own career is a kind of a model of perseverance. He first stood for election in 1984 and finished somewhat behind Mr. David Crombie. He ran again in 1988, this time coming much closer to victory, but close is never good enough, so in 1993 he ran a third time and won, and the House has surely been the better because of it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made his mark as chairman of the foreign affairs committee. He presided over a series of unanimous reports. Looking back over the current session of Parliament, the magnitude of this achievement should not be lost on any of us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his greatest achievements were still to come. In 2001 he was appointed minister of foreign affairs. Consider the difficulty of this job in a world shaken by 9/11 and on the eve of the G-8 summit of Kananaskis, yet the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78693,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78693&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Toronto Centre</A> handled his new responsibilities with ease. Not only that, to those of us in cabinet, it seemed as though he had always been there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more significantly, he was minister of foreign affairs at a time when Canada was debating one of its most historic and important decisions, whether to become involved in the coming war in Iraq. As we all know now, but could only guess at the time, our decision not to support that war was a momentous one for Canada. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78693,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78693&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Toronto Centre</A> knew it was the right decision, and I applaud him for it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His deep competence and his mastery of policy made him the right choice for minister of defence. He oversaw the single largest increase in Canada's defence spending in over a decade, an increase of $13 billion in the 2005 budget. What a minister of defence he was.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the previous prime minister resigned, it was clear that one man had the gravity, the strength of personality and the moral authority required to serve our party as interim leader and to serve the House as leader of the opposition. The member asked for nothing in return, save the chance to serve his party and his country, and serve them he did, with honour and distinction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retirement the member will spend more time, much deserved, with his wife Cathy, their two children and their many grandchildren. He will also return to his previous career, but I know he will always stay very close to this House, to his party and to the service of his country. I wish him the best of luck in this modest enterprise and I hope he is able to make a living at it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On behalf of every Liberal, every member of the House and every Canadian, let me thank the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78693,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78693&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Toronto Centre</A> for his service, his talent and his inspiration.

    </p><a name="Para720141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, it is a great pleasure for me to commend and congratulate the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78693,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78693&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Toronto Centre</A> for his long and distinguished career in the House of Commons and outside this chamber.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para720142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to take a few minutes to recognize and to appreciate the incredible career, really a lifetime career, of the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78693,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78693&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Toronto Centre</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been noted already by both the member and his leader that he took a long time to get here and was very persistent in trying to get here. I must say I went through a similar experience. I ran once and was defeated. I still cannot find anyone who voted against me, but I am sure he knows the same phenomenon as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I think what is important to note is that all this perseverance to come to the House of Commons and to engage in public service was not something that the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78693,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78693&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Toronto Centre</A> really needed in any way, shape or form. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had, long before coming here, an outstanding private life. He was outstandingly successful as a corporate director, as a lawyer, and as an academic whose expertise was valued both nationally and internationally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He certainly had no need for the trials and tribulations of elected public office, but nevertheless he took those on, was ultimately successful in his electoral quest, and then went on to achieve great things in a parliamentary career.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720147"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he even entered cabinet, he had a long parliamentary and interparliamentary career, as noted, as committee chair, a career, frankly, that was very successful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then of course went on to hold two of the most important and most highly visible cabinet positions one can hold in the Government of Canada, first, as minister of foreign affairs and then as minister of national defence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720149"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He served with great distinction in both roles. However, I think he served, if I do not mind saying so, with highest distinction in the job he was to attain next and that was to be leader of the opposition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should tell members, and I certainly have conveyed to my friend opposite, that leader of the opposition is never an easy job to have. It is certainly the one job in the country where everybody, including it seems at times everyone in one's own party, thinks they can do it better and very often there is a sense that they would like to do the job.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78693,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78693&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Toronto Centre</A> had more than that sense. In fact, while he was doing the job, several of his colleagues were actually out there competing for it, which I am sure did not make that job any easier. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have to say, as I have said before, I do think, and I think we should all recognize, that he really did a tremendous job as leader of the opposition. He conducted himself with great intelligence, with great passion and with great integrity, and I think we should all appreciate his efforts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course in that role, he and I disagreed about very many things. I recall on one occasion we even disagreed about the various ways in which one should or should not wear silk. So, it is fair to say that our disagreements covered a wide range of issues. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in retrospect, I think we agreed on a couple of subjects where I think the country was better for our agreement and where that agreement will prove to be recognized over time.</div>

I can therefore attest to the fact that, as the Leader of the Opposition said, we were able to produce unanimous reports in large part thanks to his humanistic attitude, which would transcend party lines to get to the bottom of problems and find real solutions to the challenges facing the committee. His leadership on the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade made it possible to reach a consensus. Having worked on other committees, I can say that sometimes, the dynamic was rather different and we rarely produced unanimous reports. We owed it all to him, and I would like to congratulate him on that.</div>

I think that I am speaking not only on behalf of the Bloc Québécois, but on behalf of the entire Quebec contingent.

    </p><a name="Para720163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that he was born in Montreal accounts for his desire to learn how to speak excellent French, as someone mentioned. We should all consider him a role model. The member for Toronto Centre is a great francophile, not only in Canada but throughout Francophonie, and he has been recognized as a great defender of the French fact. That is just one more asset that he brought to the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, he studied law both here and in France. He even headed up the Alliance française in Toronto for 10 years. I do not have to repeat that he was a brilliant academic, that he worked for and taught in the faculty of law, and that he was elected in 1993. Earlier, his two defeats were mentioned, but I would rather highlight his four consecutive election victories, which show just how much voters in his riding liked him. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. members: </b>Five victories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Paquette: </b>Five victories; I forgot one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, we like him too.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As someone else mentioned, he did a very capable job as interim leader of the Liberal Party between the last two Liberal prime ministers prior to the most recent election. He could easily have been a formidable candidate during the Liberal Party of Canada's last leadership contest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course I will always remember his work in foreign affairs and international trade, as I have already mentioned. I would like to reiterate the fact that he truly had a vision, which is crucial when dealing with such contentious and serious problems and when so much is at stake, which is usually true of foreign affairs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vision gave him the right attitude, particularly during the debate on Canada's possible intervention in Iraq. I am sure he must have been torn between the two options for some time. In the end, thanks to his humanistic, multilateral vision, which focused on international cooperation, development and security, he came to the conclusion, like the majority of this House, that our participation in the war in Iraq would not be well received, unlike our mission in Afghanistan, which had a multilateral foundation and was entirely understandable at the time. The situation is not quite so clear now. That said, when he was national defence minister, we knew a little more about where things stood.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say, I hope he puts all this experience to good use for all Canadians and all Quebeckers. I can assure him that if he decides to set up a little foreign affairs consulting business, the Bloc Québécois will consult him regularly before making any decisions. As we all know, he has extensive expertise in this area. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has worked very hard for his fellow citizens. Many of his constituents have very limited means. His riding was known as Rosedale a few years ago and, as we all know, some of the poorest neighbourhoods in the country are found there.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I witnessed firsthand what a member of Parliament who is truly committed to all of his constituents can do. It probably would have been very easy for the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78693,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78693&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Toronto Centre</A> to have found many reasons not to be a part of a lot of community activities. He was a minister and a brilliant chairman of the foreign affairs and international development committee. He served his country in so many different ways and yet I can attest to how devoted he was to his constituents. We would often be together in some of the poorest neighbourhoods where some of the greatest homelessness is found, where people are really struggling, and the member for Toronto Centre would be there because he is someone who takes and who always has taken his responsibilities very seriously. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is warmly welcomed in the parts of the community that he represents. He was also one of the first to stand for civil rights and human rights for gays and lesbians at a time when that was not very popular.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I was always very impressed by his dedication to human rights and his participation in such a celebratory and principled way with people who are often on the margins and can still feel that marginalization today, but they will never feel it when it comes to the member for Toronto Centre. He has been honoured many times, and rightly so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720179"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was thinking of the things we share in common. We were both born in Montreal and both spent some time in the same academic institution at the University of Toronto. He was far more famous and illustrious than I in my time there, I must say. We also had the opportunity to contest the 1993 election in Toronto Centre. We were both trying to defeat David MacDonald at the time who was the member and a Conservative. I succeeded in converting David MacDonald to a socialist but that was really the only consolation I had. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Toronto Centre taught me the lesson that one needs to lose a couple of times before one earns the right to be in this place. Three of us would often go out for a couple of beers after an all candidates debate, a practice that I would like to propose to the other party leaders, by the way, and we would talk about job sharing and the issues of the day. He did assure me that someday I would probably be elected but not in his riding. He was right once again.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing I want to say is that I have always felt that despite his sort of straight back demeanour and his very dignified presence, the hon. member is very approachable at the human level. We had a number of occasions to talk about issues together one on one. Every time I found a dignity, an openness, a friendship and the kind of conversation that we really wish could happen among all of us much more often.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720182"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stood in his place to debate, we knew several fundamentals about this man: he felt that he was here to serve the others and his country. We also knew that he loved his country very profoundly every time that he spoke. We finally knew that he respected this place and the opportunity that it provides for all of us to do our best on behalf of our fellow citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720183"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what we are talking about here is a true parliamentarian, someone who can serve as an example for people coming newly to politics.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that he will accept, on behalf of my caucus, the New Democratic Party, and all our members and supporters across the country, our gratitude because we appreciate the service of the member. We also want to thank his family for sharing him with us over these last number of years. We wish him well in the future.</div>

I have been waiting 12 years for this day. That is when we started putting an end to the Liberals' infamous $2 billion boondoggle on the firearms program. This is the day we start to dismantle Bill C-68 and return our gun laws to the way they were in 1995.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720190"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no evidence that those gun control laws were effective, but at least they were only costing taxpayers $12.8 million a year, not $100 million. This is the day we start putting an end to the Liberal gun control laws that do not work, do not save lives, do not reduce violent crime, do not improve public safety and do not keep guns out of the hands of criminals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720191"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this is the day we start putting in place weapons control laws that have been proven statistically to save lives, to reduce violent crime, to improve public safety and to help to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of criminals. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to warn Canadians of the blather they are going to hear from the other parties on this issue, likely today. Their gun control proposals sound too good to be true and they are. They may sound good, but they are not sound policies. Policies that are driven strictly by emotions may actually do more harm than good. They may divert resources away from more useful endeavours. Emotions may encourage us to act to solve a problem, but they can be harmful if they make us act irrationally. Because Bill C-68 was not based on factual evidence, it has done more harm than good.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I intend today to expose that flaw in our response to crime in Canada. Canadians need gun control policies that are effective as well as cost effective, but Liberals have not let logic, facts and truth get in the way of a good sound bite or a scary political advertisement at election time. The truth is they want votes more than they want effective gun laws and this is hurting our nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a right versus left issue on the political spectrum. It is a right versus wrong issue to crime control. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us start with the colossal overspending by the Liberals on implementing the Firearms Act. On April 24, 1995 then justice minister Allan Rock appeared before the Standing Committee on Justice and promised Parliament and the Canadian taxpayers that implementing the Firearms Act would cost $2.2 million over five years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 17, 2006 the Auditor General of Canada reported that the Liberals had spent more than a billion tax dollars over 12 years to implement that program, and guess what? It is still not completely implemented.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a letter to me dated June 15, 2006, the Auditor General confirmed that her audit of the firearms program costs did not include enforcement costs, compliance costs, economic costs, and unreported indirect costs to other departments. She also confirmed that the Liberal government's cost benefit analysis of the firearms program and the Liberals' 115 page economic impact study are still cabinet secrets as they have been since 2003 and 1999 respectively.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his 1993 report, the previous auditor general, Denis Desautels, criticized the government for moving forward with new gun control regulations without “important data, needed to assess the potential benefits and future effectiveness of the regulations”, and recommended, “it is essential that the Department of Justice evaluate the effectiveness of the program again”. But it never did.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political posturing overrode common sense. Mr. Desautels' findings 12 years ago seem very similar to Auditor General Sheila Fraser's report in May 2006. Paragraph 4.36 of her report states:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That quotation is the most important part of my speech because it exposes the tactics used by those that defend the gun registry. This appalling lack of evidence of effectiveness was also confirmed by the Liberal government's response to order paper question No. 19 on November 29, 2004. Statistics Canada's statement was in bold text and underlined that the specific impact of the firearms program or the firearms registry cannot be isolated from other factors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, their own statistical evidence proves that the Liberal gun control policies and programs have been a dismal failure. Last December the Library of Parliament obtained a special set of tables for me from Statistics Canada showing firearms related statistics for the total number of homicides committed in Canada between 1997 and 2005. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider these Statistics Canada findings: Of the 5,194 homicides committed between 1997 and 2005, only 118, or 2.27%, were committed with a registered gun. Of the 5,194 homicides committed between 1997 and 2005, only 63, or 1.21%, were committed with a firearm registered to the accused murderer. Of the 5,194 homicides committed between 1997 and 2005, only 111, or 2.14%, were committed by a person who held a valid firearms licence. Of the two million licensed gun owners in Canada, only 111, that is 0.00555%, used their firearm to murder somebody.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This analysis shows what almost everyone in Canada knows, with the exception of the opposition parties in this House, that criminals do not register their guns and cannot be bothered to qualify for a firearms licence. Sadly, these statistics prove the main point I have been making for the last 12 years, that laying a piece of paper beside a gun does not prevent it from being used to murder someone. These statistics represent a failure of gun registration and gun owner licensing as cost effective measures to save lives, improve public safety or keep firearms out of the hands of people who should not have them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 8, 2006 Statistics Canada released its 2005 homicide report. Here are some of the highlights which show that criminals are the real problem, not the type of weapons they use against their victims. There are two things to keep in mind as I read the highlights from the StatsCan report. Number one, the RCMP have been registering handguns since 1934 and fully automatic firearms, sawed off rifles and shotguns have been banned for decades. Number two, in 1995 when the Liberals passed Bill C-68 they banned some 555,000 handguns and required the licensing of all gun owners and the registration of all rifles and shotguns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two billion dollars later, this is the result according to Statistics Canada in 2005: We have the highest homicide rate in nearly a decade. The firearm homicide rate is the same as it was 20 years ago. Sixty-six per cent of murders in 2005 were committed without a firearm; 58% of the firearms homicides were committed with handguns; 9% were committed with banned fully automatic firearms, sawed off rifles and shotguns; and only 30% of recovered firearms were registered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the more relevant homicide statistics that parliamentarians should be focused on: Sixty-four per cent of the accused murderers had a criminal record, 6% for homicide. I have to ask what were these people doing back on the street? Seventy-three per cent of the accused murderers had been drinking or on drugs. Thirteen per cent of the accused murderers were mentally ill; 45% of the murders occurred while the accused were committing another crime; and 22% of murder victims were involved in illegal activities.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us turn to an example of the opposition parties using false statistics in an attempt to keep our government from replacing useless gun control laws with truly effective ones. That is why we are here today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2006 the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security debated a Bloc motion calling for the retention of the long gun registry. A number of opposition MPs repeatedly quoted a statistic to justify their defence of the gun registry. The researchers in the Library of Parliament later proved there was no evidence to support their claims. They claimed “71% of the firearms assaults perpetrated against women involved long guns”. That is a false statistic. The Library of Parliament researcher could not find the source for that statistic but she did find two different sets of statistics to contradict it. The researcher reported:</div>

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para720213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have time to read the whole Library of Parliament quotation, but it clearly notes that the number was not 71%. It was 17.1%. Those were misleading statistics by the opposition. While we deplore domestic violence regardless of the type of weapons used, there are far more effective measures the federal government could take up to help spouses living in violent households.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While doing research on domestic violence, we keep finding news stories about women's shelters not being able to accommodate abused women showing up at their doorsteps. The Library of Parliament sent me the most recent statistics Canada reports on shelters for abused women that showed the tragic truth ignored by the Liberals for years: “On the snapshot day, about one-fifth of all shelters referred about 221 women and 112 children elsewhere. Two-thirds of those referrals were made because shelters were full. Eight in ten abused women in shelters were there to escape a current or former spouse common law partner”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720215"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Liberals were wasting over a billion tax dollars on the gun registry over the last 10 years, hundreds of women and children were being turned away from women's shelters every day. I do not need to remind the House of the massive cuts to social transfer payments to the provinces that were made by the previous Liberal government during the 1990s.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another analysis of domestic violence just completed by the Library's parliamentary research branch showed spousal homicides committed each year have remained virtually unchanged over the last 10 years. The futility of it all is driven home by the fact that 70% of the women murdered by a family member over the last 10 years were murdered with something other than a firearm. These domestic violence reports expose 10 years of Liberal deception on the firearms file.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women should be outraged that they were treated so shoddily when one of the solutions to combat family violence was obvious and blatantly ignored for so many years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were telling people the truth, they would be telling us that helping abused women is more important than simply laying a piece of paper beside our guns, but then the opposition parties will claim that the police use the system thousands of times a day. Members have likely heard that claim.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This quote is from a young RCMP officer in my riding who was told by his superiors to stop sending requests to the gun registry before attending domestic disputes because he was “putting his life in danger”.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may surprise many MPs on the other side that the majority of front line police officers do not support the gun registry nor do they use it. Why should they, when it is so full of errors?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2005, I released Liberal government documents showing that the number of unverified firearms in the gun registry had increased from 5.1 million to 5.6 million over the last two and a half years, and there are only seven million firearms in the registry. The more millions wasted, the further they fell behind. So much for the Canadian Police Association's resolutions in 1999 and 2004 demanding that data entered in the gun registry be “verified as accurate”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Canadian Police Association demands from 1999 that have not been met are as follows: that the Auditor General of Canada conduct a thorough review of the firearms registration system and release a public report on the findings to the people of Canada; that the CPA receive confirmation that the registration system has the capacity to meet the legislative timeframes established for firearms registration; that the CPA receive confirmation that the cost recovery plan for registration can be achieved; that meaningful consultations with the user group take place to ensure that the concerns of stakeholders are addressed in the review process; and that the CPA receive confirmation that the implementation and operation of the system is not taking officers off the street.</div>

It may perhaps result in mistakes, but it does exist nevertheless. If we are defending it, it is not because it is the creation of one political party or another, but rather because almost every police force in the country and those who look after victims of crime believe that a gun registry is a preventive measure that gives results.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous speaker spoke of the weaknesses of the registry and used that as an argument to abolish it in its entirety. I would like to ask him whether he believes that the amnesty granted over a year ago, allowing those who had not registered their firearms or who had to renew their registration to postpone the registration or renewal for a certain period of time, is a measure that will improve the effectiveness of the gun registry, or whether he believes that it will have the opposite effect and make the registry less reliable.</div>

    </p><a name="Para720246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with some of the opening comments that my colleague from the Bloc has raised. First, the member said that one of the charges I made was that the firearms registry is not reliable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately seven million guns out of all the firearms in Canada have been registered in the system. How many firearms are there in this country? A reliable estimate indicates that the minimum number is 16.5 million. If seven million have been registered and at a minimum there are 16.5 million in the country, and probably closer to 20 million, we have barely scratched the surface.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will let that sink in for members here. If we are trying to put a piece of paper beside every gun in the country, we have barely begun, and this at a cost of approximately $2 billion. So how can the registry be reliable? The police want a tool that will be effective. It is not effective when only a fraction of the guns have been registered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can explain how these numbers were achieved, with import and export numbers, the number of guns manufactured in the country, and a reliable estimate by the justice department before all of this was put in place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General also pointed out, and I think my hon. colleague knows this, that 90% of registrations had errors, so what happens if the police go to a system like this and let it in any way affect what they do? I do not think there is a policeman in this country who will allow this registry to affect what the police do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the police go to a home, they do not trust any of the information they pick up on their CPIC system, their computer system, because of what the Auditor General said, which is that 90% of registrations have problems. Police want effective tools that will help them in their fight against crime.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a quick question for him. Recognizing that at this particular point there is about a six month backlog for people being able to actually acquire a licence when they purchase a gun, would he not agree with me that it is something like going to an automobile dealership, paying for a car, getting the insurance for the car and then being told that sometime, somewhere, perhaps in the next six months, we could come back and actually use the car?</div>
    </p><a name="Para720254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the member would agree with me that it is exceptionally frustrating.

It almost answers itself, but the key point is that this registry and the licensing affect only law-abiding citizens, people who are trying to comply with the law. My hon. colleague has pointed out, I think adequately, that people are frustrated with the fact that they cannot do what they would like to do and lawfully use their property.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has no effect on the criminal. In fact, that is the key problem. We are spending so many resources on a paper-pushing exercise and creating a huge bureaucracy when in fact if we were to ask police what they would like to see, they would say they need more police on the streets in the right areas, combating criminals, gangs and drugs. That is what they want.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question that was asked of me previous to this one, the amnesty does not waive the law. The legislation we are dealing with today is what will repeal that law.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two sons who are policemen and a third in the process of becoming one. One of them is on the tactical team.

    </p><a name="Para720260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My son said they would never at any time rely on that, because, as the member so correctly stated, it would give them a false sense of security. They do not trust it. When I asked him if that is the prevailing attitude among other policemen, he told me that is precisely the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720261"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question, then, for the hon. member is this: why do we keep hearing that access to the registry is at 5,000 hits a day? Why do we keep hearing that as the best reason for why we should be maintaining this flawed gun registry?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics has overridden factually based evidence.

The gun registry was not gun control, yet that government could get votes in the cities from people who took the Liberals at their word.

    </p><a name="Para720265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country of New Zealand, I will point out, tried to go down this road and about a decade ago scrapped its gun registry. It had no effect on crime in that country. New Zealand saw that and did away with it, yet we are still trying to promote something that is not a tool that will affect criminals in any way. As my colleague has pointed out, the police know this very well.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill received first reading in the House of Commons on June 19, 2006.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only now that we are finally debating the bill at second reading, a full year later. The government is clearly dragging its feet, aware that it does not have the support for the legislation in the House.</div>

Provisions of the Firearms Act regarding these expiry and revocation of registration certificates are accordingly amended, as are provisions setting out the documentation that is involved when lending, importing or exporting non-restricted firearms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although registration certificates would no longer be involved when transferring, selling or giving away a firearm, a person transferring a non-restricted firearm to an individual would be required to seek an authorization from the chief firearms officer who will verify that the recipient is entitled to possess the firearm.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Code is also amended so that the failure to hold a registration certificate for a non-restricted firearm does not give rise to any of the offences relating to the unauthorized possession of a firearm and does not allow police to seize a firearm.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commentators have pointed out that the gun registry did not prevent recent high profile shooting deaths, notably the four RCMP officers in Alberta in March 2005, a teenage girl in Toronto in December 2005, a police officer in Laval in December 2005 and two RCMP constables in Saskatchewan in July 2006.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the proponents of gun control have referred to these tragedies, and they are tragedies, as a reason for strengthening, not weakening, the firearms registry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among others, the Coalition for Gun Control, the Attorney General for Ontario and Quebec's Minister of Public Safety are against any dismantling of the firearms registry. Police organizations, both the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the Canadian Police Associations, are in favour of maintaining the firearms registry as police do query over 5,000 times a day.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the members opposite can quote individual policemen who have other opinions but the two organizations certainly are on side for keeping the registry complete.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the total cost of the gun registry, often cited, and I heard this many times, at $2 billion by the Conservative government members, we know that it has been placed at less than $1 billion over more than 10 years by the Auditor General's report.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proponents of the firearms registry have blamed cost overruns on the opponents of the registry who have forced the government to deal with non-compliant gun owners, as well as to initiate or respond to expensive court challenges and proceedings. They also say that the computer glitches and administrative problems have now been resolved so that abolishing the registry would make no sense now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that it was an expensive setup but changing it after the investment is made is not smart policy either. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has further been argued that removing the requirement to register non-restricted firearms will save only $3 million a year and that $22.7 million in revenue a year will be lost by the government if it stops charging for the various fees involved or rebating them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been argued also that because long guns are the ones most frequently found in homes, the long gun registry has successfully reduced domestic violence, suicides and accidents. According to a recent Swiss study, a decrease in gun injuries and gun deaths since 1995 shows that Canada may be saving up to $1.4 billion a year in violence related costs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gun laws are an important part of public safety in Canada. They are not the only solution but they are a part of the solution. In spite of the common use of the word “registry”, the 1995 legislation set up a comprehensive screening and licensing system for all gun owners, as well as the registration of firearms, which did include recording details of what guns individuals owned.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2006, the Conservatives introduced an amnesty to effectively eliminate the need to renew firearm licences and to register rifles and shotguns. A rifle or a shotgun in the wrong hands is just as deadly as a handgun.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All gun owners need to be carefully screened on a regular basis and all guns need to be registered. Of course these measures do not eliminate the possibility of tragedies. No one is saying that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we know with certainty that countries without strong gun laws are more likely and frequently to be the site of these terrible events. We can look to the south. Every year more than 10,000 Americans are murdered with guns, compared to 200 in Canada. The rate of murders without guns is comparable but the rate of murder with guns is dramatically higher in the U.S. Our gun laws are an important investment in public safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many experts have maintained that rifles and shotguns in the wrong hands represent a threat to safety. They include many powerful semi-automatics like the guns used at the Polytechnique and the “elephant gun” used to kill Constable Gignac in Laval. They are also frequently among the caches recovered from gangs and organized crime by our police.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All firearms are potentially dangerous and all guns should be strictly controlled. All guns start as legal guns. Six separate public inquests have maintained the importance of renewable licences and the registration of all firearms. The Supreme Court also emphasized the importance of both. It said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the Supreme Court, reference regarding the Firearms Act in June 2000.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720302"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts have also maintained that the 1995 Firearms Act has aided police in taking preventative action and reducing firearm death and injury in Canada. Supporters of the gun registry include the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the Canadian Professional Police Association, the Canadian Public Health Association, the Canadian Paediatric Society, more than 40 women's associations, the Centre for Suicide Prevention and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give some statistics, even though the other side on this debate does not believe them. On average, more than 5,000 queries are made daily. Since 1998, approximately 19,600 firearms licences have been refused or revoked since the Firearms Act came into force. More than 5,000 affidavits, which is an even higher number now, have been provided by the Canadian Firearms Registry to support the prosecution of firearms related crime and court proceedings across the country. There have been 333 fewer Canadians who die annually of gunshots than in 1995. Homicides with rifles and shotguns are down, suicides with firearms have decreased and domestic violence with firearms has plummeted. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these trends suggest that stronger controls on rifles and shotguns have had an effect on improving public safety. Physicians, crisis workers and police have also provided anecdotal evidence of specific cases where the registry was useful in removing firearms from potentially deadly situations.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the long Easter weekend of this year, an “Order Amending the Order Declaring an Amnesty Period” appeared in the <i>Canada Gazette</i>, Volume 141, No. 14, on April 7, 2007. This order extends the one year amnesty, which expired on May 17, 2007, for another year for individuals who have failed to renew their licences or register their rifles or shotguns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the government bill to abolish the registry would likely be defeated, the Conservative government is deteriorating the effectiveness of the gun registry by stealth. Police associations and powerful anti-gun groups have lobbied to keep the registry and the Conservatives are abusing the democratic process to save face and appease core voters. They are doing it through the back door because the facts do not support their position. The facts show that the gun registry is actually working and that police officers find it to be a very useful tool.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after announcing the first amnesty in May 2006, the government tabled this legislation to eliminate the requirement to register rifles and shotguns.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation for the 2006 amnesty appears to have been to satisfy political aims and remove “the teeth out of the registry and free rifle and shotgun owners from complying with the rules over the next year”, rather than building compliance with the law as stated when the order was filed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the 2007 amnesty order appears to be political rather than as stated, “to build compliance with the existing law”. But if the objective of the amnesty was to address the confusion of gun owners, why did the government not plan a significant media announcement and public education campaign to accompany it? </div>
    </p><a name="Para720313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what a previous government did when we wanted to have people comply. Instead, the announcement was published without publicity and only inadvertently discovered by an enterprising journalist. There is no evidence that the previous amnesty improved compliance with the law. There has been no evaluation of the impact of the last amnesty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government did not fulfill its responsibilities to undertake a review with an eye to improving the integrity and security of the data. Police have made clear their opposition to a year long amnesty arguing that it undermines respect for the law and that the amnesty penalizes the law abiding gun owners who regardless of their personal views complied with the legislation in a timely fashion. It also encourages groups and individuals who publicly flout the law. It also undermines the integrity of the data in the firearm registration system, a problem that was highlighted in the 2006 Auditor General's report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the issue of the importance of the integrity of data, particularly the address of firearm owners. In the recent killing of a Laval police officer, Daniel Tessier, during a home raid, the media reported that the owner of the legal handgun had not reported the change of address. The Auditor General noted the need to improve the integrity of the data and recommended in the 2006 audit in the chapter entitled “Data quality needs to be addressed”, under paragraph 4.64:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could prevent police from removing firearms and charging potentially dangerous people.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ontario attorney general stated, “Ontario supports the need for the registration of all firearms, including long guns. There are close to two million long guns registered to licensed owners in Ontario. If the long gun registry is dismantled, as you propose with Bill C-21, these guns will become wholly untracked. We have already identified a number of legal implications surrounding untracked firearms that will certainly lessen our ability to carry out searches for firearms, and to ensure effective enforcement of “no firearms” conditions on bail, or on prohibition orders. In practical terms, this has significant implications for public safety”. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. David McKeown, a medical officer of health in Ontario, has stated, “Gun violence is a serious public health issue and unrestricted rifles and shotguns are most often used in domestic violence, suicide and police killings.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know my time is up, but public safety is an investment. Last year we had a motion passed in committee saying that we need to keep this registry alive. We know that all types of gun deaths, homicides, suicides and accidents, have declined since the registry was brought into force. I think that we have to invest in this registry and continue, so that it will be one element of helping public safety in this country, but not the only element.</div>

    </p><a name="Para720335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member cited a number of things namely, that police associations and so forth were on board with the registry. I would just like to begin by pointing out that a gentleman I respect a great deal, the commissioner of the OPP, has gone on record saying that forcing law-abiding Canadians to register their rifles does nothing to reduce gun crimes and the money would be better spent on front line police resources.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren Schinkel, president of the Winnipeg Police Association, said that the Winnipeg Police Association has never supported the long gun registry. It has made its position very clear. The Manitoba Police Association passed a motion calling on Ottawa to scrap the long gun registry. The Calgary Police Association and the Edmonton Police Association support calls for scrapping the registry. I could go on. I have a whole list here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at what Canadians have had to say. The <i>Globe and Mail</i> on September 15, 2006 asked: Do you believe an effective gun registry program could have helped prevent the shooting at Montreal's Dawson College? The response: 77% said no. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the member has heard of the London <i>Free Press</i>. It asked: “In your opinion, would stronger gun control measures have prevented this week's shootings in Montreal?” The response: 85% said no. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CFRA in Ottawa did a poll. The three guns used by Kimveer Gill, the Montreal Dawson College shooter, were legally registered. They were in the Liberal gun registry. What does this tell us about the effectiveness of the $1.5 billion gun registry? The poll results indicated that 84.7% said the gun registry should be scrapped.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot understand those members over there. They stand against what Canadians know. Canadians, including the commissioner of the OPP, Julian Fantino, have said that the gun registry does not work and that it will never work. It does not make any sense. There is no empirical data that demonstrates that the registry works.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the member, as part of the former government, close nine RCMP detachments along the border so that her government could fund the long gun registry when what we really needed was law enforcement officials to make sure the guns did not get into the wrong hands?</div>

I quite honestly do accept that there is a divide on this issue. I think we should respect that there is a divide on it. In a minority situation, this is not a bill that this Parliament should be dealing with. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a situation where every gun starts out as a legal gun. Every person starts out as a non-criminal. The bottom line is that we do have evidence showing that there are now more than two million gun owners and 90% of those guns are now licensed. There are over seven million firearms and 90% are registered. That leaves some unlicensed and unregistered weapons, and we know that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amnesties by our former government were trying to encourage that. We did amnesties in a way that was respectful of the process. We did not use an amnesty to kill a registry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an act of Parliament. In 1995, this body respectfully put through a piece of legislation and it was put into effect. We have to take out an act of Parliament with an act of Parliament. For a year now we have had this piece of legislation and this is the first time it has been debated in this chamber. That was because commentators in the media were going after the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the statistics in all areas are down. The rate of firearm thefts is the lowest in 30 years. Five hundred fewer people are killed per year than in 1991. The firearm homicide rate is down by 29%, even though the homicide rate without guns is down only 23%. The rate of homicides with rifles and shotguns, and the rate of women murdered with guns has plummeted both in 1991 and 1995. We strengthened controls on rifles and shotguns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to advise the member that the Quebec provincial government is trying to strengthen its controls. Why are we sitting here doing the opposite?</div>

    </p><a name="Para720349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major concerns that the people whom I represent in northern British Columbia brought forward to me, when we were debating the gun registry back in 2003, 2004 and 2005, was the issue of cost. There are those who are ideologically opposed to the registry on principle of having to register a firearm of any kind in any place in the country. I do not fundamentally agree with those people. We have been registering firearms in the country, in various ways, for many decades. However, there are those in my constituency, and I would imagine in her constituency as well, who have opposed the cost overruns from the beginning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to talk about the costing of this registry program since the new government has come in. First, is she aware of what the total cost overruns were for the registry leading up to the break in the last election and the change of governance? Then, what has happened in the last 18 months in terms of the costs of the registry?</div>
    </p><a name="Para720351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can remember Conservative opponents of mine in my region and former representatives from my region, who were Reform, then Alliance and then Conservative members, often focused and fixated on the costs. That was the major push. They did not often speak of the ideology. However, since taking government, I am curious as to what the current numbers are and if this is a top priority for the current regime, to deal with the registry and the costs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What has happened to the actual spending on behalf of hard-working Canadian taxpayers in relation to this registry?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one gun registry and it is for long guns and smaller weapons. This registry is less effective now as we go through the two years of the amnesty. It is not getting complete information. On top of that, there have been refunds, rebates and waivers of fees. This is unusual. Other people pay for their licences out of their own pockets. However, in this one, we have had a considerable length of time now where the government has been forgoing registration and licensing fees and rebating those who had paid before the amnesties were put in place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member's question is very apt. One would think that if savings were the incentive here, the savings of the first $10 million, when it was moved to the RCMP, occurred under the previous government. Even though $3 million was said to have been saved, what we have found in going forward is more money is being spent.</div>

    </p><a name="Para720365"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a definite intensity among those opposed to long gun registration. I am not exactly sure why that is, but I have certainly met my share of people who are fascinated with guns and who think that they are pretty great even though they are not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guns are good at just one thing: killing. People use them to kill animals, among other things. Police officers, people who transport large sums of money and people whose lives may be in danger because they protect very valuable goods carry handguns not only to protect themselves, but also to injure or kill others.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is a very emotional subject, people tend to go to extremes. I would not want to fall into that trap. Personally, I think that gun control is the best way to prevent crime. It is also a way to prevent the most dangerous crimes—those that can result in death or serious injury. I think that we can start with a number of premises with which we all agree. Firearms are dangerous. Only responsible people should be allowed to have them. To the extent possible, nobody wants bad guys to have guns, and nobody wants it to be easy for criminals to get them, but we know that is impossible. There will probably always be some criminals who can find a way around the controls we put in place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not become discouraged because it is impossible to implement controls to ensure that criminals cannot get guns. We can still achieve results. We cannot abolish guns entirely, but we can reduce their numbers. That is why it makes sense to look elsewhere in the world to see if other countries and other legislators have gone through what we are going through.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720369"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the majority of civilized countries whose homicide rates are similar to ours also have comparable incarceration rates. But there is one—our neighbour—that has an extremely high incarceration rate. It is six times higher than ours and three, four, five or even ten times higher than the incarceration rates of some Scandinavian countries. Does its high incarceration rate get results when it comes to homicides? Not at all. On the contrary, it has the highest homicide rate in the world. So putting more people in prison and leaving more guns in circulation is not the best way to go. We also tend to register dangerous objects that were not created for killing, but that can be a danger. We register vehicles, large and small. We even register snowmobiles and scooters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wondered why we register automobiles. Some think that it is so the government can collect fees. If the government really wanted to make money off drivers, the easiest and cheapest solution would be to increase the tax on gas. It is true that the government may use this as a source of funding. In Quebec, when people register vehicles, the government collects an insurance premium that compensates motor vehicle accident victims. However, I think we started registering vehicles because they can hurt people.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who had injured someone and who had probably been negligent tended to leave the scene if the car could not be traced. Thus, it became mandatory to display licences on automobiles.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, we have a somewhat ridiculous situation where duck hunters object to registering their guns that kill, but they get into a boat that has a registration number. When they hunt in the winter, they travel by registered snowmobile, but they absolutely do not want to register their rifles. What is more dangerous, a snowmobile or a rifle? Do they own the boat or the rifle? </div>
    </p><a name="Para720373"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I sometimes believe that the Conservatives are not as mean as they would have us believe. They recognize that these guns are not used solely for sport, as long guns are. However, handguns—guns that can be used with only one hand—should continue to be registered. And they have been since 1934, which allows us to compare our experience with that of our neighbours to the south.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that weapons circulate very freely in the U.S. Yet, those who commit crimes with weapons are for the most part punished very severely. What is the result? The homicide rate in the United States is three times higher than in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People will say that it is criminals who kill and so forth. At some point, I would like to have the definition of a criminal. The Conservatives talk about them as though they are people who have chosen to lead a criminal life. But they are not the only ones who kill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People kill for all sorts of reasons. They kill out of passion, revenge or jealousy. Very often individuals who do not really have a criminal past are found guilty of murder. Some have a criminal past and others do not. Easy access to weapons, the availability of weapons, is an important factor in the increase in the homicide rate. The best evidence is that your chance of being a murder victim is three times higher in the United States. Unfortunately, women are five times more likely to be victims of murder in the United States, probably because of marital strife.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at it, these numbers are rather substantial. Incarceration rates are six times higher in the United States and homicide rates are three times higher. Ask any educated, well-informed American who is not a member of the National Rifle Association why their homicide rate is so much higher than ours and they will tell you that it is due to the fact that firearms are so easy to acquire in that country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not bring the statistics with me today, because I did not have a great deal of warning. However, I have been a part of this debate for quite some time and I often hear things that, in my opinion, prove the opposite of what they claim.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, regarding the very high homicide rates in the United States, the Conservatives pointed out that, in nicer neighbourhoods, in comparable neighbourhoods, such as the Seattle suburbs and the Vancouver suburbs, the homicide rate is more or less the same. I agree and I am not surprised, because people who have similar levels of education are likely to have a similar sense of responsibility. But if we look at the United States as a whole, if comparable neighbourhoods with similar education levels have the same homicide rate, that means that in other areas of the United States, the homicide rate must be extremely high. Firearms are easily accessible in those places, too.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the U.S. experience, everyone thinks there should be gun control. T what barrel length should be start controlling guns and at what length should we stop? People involved in crime want to use guns, but then some of the people who have a fascination with guns—something I have never really understood—are not criminals. Nonetheless, generally speaking, criminals have a fascination with guns for a criminal purpose. This includes all kinds of criminals, crooks for example. Criminals who have a fascination with guns want to perpetrate violence. The easier it is to get guns, the sooner they will start to use them. Those are the general conclusions we draw from the difference between us and the Americans. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720381"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always wondered why people would buy a rifle and saw off the barrel. The reason is simple: they want to hide it. It is easier to carry a rifle that is inconspicuous when one wants to rob a bank. That is why they saw off the barrel. By doing so, they are cutting off the difference in price between a handgun and a rifle. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criminals were sawing off shotguns—so much so that a specific offence was created for this—because they were having a hard time getting revolvers. Revolvers and handguns were registered. Accordingly, the sale of these weapons was better controlled. It cost more to get them on the black market. And since hunting rifles were not controlled, a person could buy one, saw off the barrel and have a weapon that could be concealed until it was needed in a bank robbery. I fear we may end up back in that situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720383"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then people bring up another statistic, which was actually used this afternoon to prove two opposing notions. Fewer than 2% of firearms related homicides in Canada are committed with registered firearms, which proves that the system does not work. That sounds strange to me, because I would tend to believe that it proves that the system does work. It proves that people who register their weapons are responsible. The primary purpose of the gun control program is to ensure that only responsible people have access to firearms and to encourage them to keep these items safely locked up, as they have been taught to do, and never to give in to the temptation to sell them to someone who does not have the right to buy them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720384"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of the gun control system, registration may not eliminate homicide altogether, but it is a vital tool to lower the homicide rate significantly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are cases where registration is essential to facilitating the application of the law, such as when a judge issues an order to surrender firearms. It is important for police officers to know which firearms to seize, which is easier when they are registered. The Montreal police brotherhood, which came to one of our press conferences, told us about a striking case. A woman was afraid of her husband, who had a lot of guns. She knew that he had guns, but she did not know how many. The marriage was going badly, and there was some danger of violence erupting, so they went to a judge. The judge issued an order to seize the firearms. As I recall, there were over 280 of them. The police did not leave until they had found all 280 registered weapons. As you can see, registration was vital in that case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720386"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other cases where registration is useful.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705">(1705)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para720387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These judges' orders are issued in cases where spousal abuse may be a concern and where someone has suicidal tendencies. The judge may issue an order. That is why all suicide prevention organizations are asking that the gun registry be maintained. If an order can be obtained, the authorities know what weapon to look for because the weapon is registered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 480 or so murders committed last year, two were committed with registered weapons by Kimveer Gill, in the Dawson College tragedy. Some claimed that the firearm registration system did not work because the weapon used was registered. The Dawson College tragedy could perhaps have been prevented. Just after this incident, another tragedy was averted and it received a great deal of publicity. It was obvious from his website that this individual should never have owned weapons. That was not known at first.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some individuals found a site in Hudson and believing him to be dangerous, reported the author. The police looked into the matter and realized that the individual had registered firearms in his possession. The police went to court, obtained an order and retrieved the weapons. That is why I am proposing a reporting site.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Kimveer Gill, had this reporting site been operational and if, by chance, someone had seen Gill's site, the police could have determined if he had registered weapons. Thus the police could have retrieved the weapons and a tragedy would have been prevented. The registration of weapons can be useful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720391"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can produce results. It seems to me that the American experience, when compared to that of Canada and other countries, clearly shows that the fewer weapons are in circulation, the fewer homicides take place. The safest country in the world is Japan, where there is absolute gun control. Only police officers and registered hunters have the right to purchase firearms. The homicide rate is even lower than that of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720392"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate shows that there is some emotion attached to firearms, and that disturbs me. The rational attitude is obvious. People do not want the government to register things, but my goodness, so many things are registered. Cars, boats, bicycles, dogs and cats are all registered. What is so wrong about registering something that can kill?</div>
    </p><a name="Para720393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firearm registration is important because we do not want firearms to easily find their way into the hands of irresponsible people. Currently, when a person sells or gives a registered firearm to someone else, they must go to the registry office. We take care of our firearms and ensure that they are always under control.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that some people want to keep the provision that prohibits selling a firearm to someone without a permit. However, this is not verified. It can also happen through carelessness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this leaves the door open to organized crime. If a group member has a permit, he can purchase unregistered firearms and then supply his group. I will remind the House that there are no savings. What was expensive was the computer system.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are keeping this computer system since the Conservatives want to keep it for handguns. A computer system that would register 30%, 40% or probably even 100% more transactions would be pretty much the same computer system. There are no savings, obviously. There was an amnesty, but no savings. This is why I think we should keep the gun registry.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member made quite a point about police confiscating or getting a court order to remove 180 firearms from a residence. A key thing that the Liberals do, the Bloc does and some of the NDP members do is confuse registration and licensing. What we need and what the police would like is to have more resources to deal with this, but there is a difference between laying a piece of paper beside every gun in the country, which is gun registration, which is what we are dealing with in this legislation, and the licensing of every firearms owner. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts have made over 200,000 prohibition orders in this country but they are never enforced. Why? Because the police do not have the resources at this point to do it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member were in government, which he is not, he would have to make the decision on the best way to spend our money: do we put $1 billion into a paper pushing exercise that does not affect the criminal, or do we put it into enforcing the laws of this country, such as prohibition orders? Why do we not have more police to check the people who are not supposed to own firearms? That to me seems logical.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quote what a former provincial Liberal candidate had to say. By the way, Brian Ford was the Ottawa Police chief and he was upset. This is from the <i>Ottawa Sun</i> of May 17, 2006:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget was $2 million and it has gone 500 times over budget. He publicly supported the registry as chairman of a Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police committee. He said, “They were lying to me. It bothers me. I was telling people what I believed was the truth”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720404"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what we need to have come out. We do not need all this rhetoric, theorizing and explanation about how it might work. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720405"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refute something else the member said, that gun control is working in some countries. England went to very strict gun controls recently to the point where it banned all handguns. Gun crime has increased. One cannot simply implement these laws and say that passing the law is going to work. We have effective laws in this country. People are not allowed to carry handguns.

The police officer in charge of the investigation ensures that the guns are turned over to him and, generally speaking, he checked beforehand in the gun registry whether the person owned rifles or handguns. That is why representatives of the Fraternité des policiers et policières de Montréal came to see us. They gave us the example of a case where a woman did not know how many guns her husband owned. The police checked the information in the registry, saw how many guns were registered, went to the individual's home and did not leave until they found all his guns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I practised criminal law for years and I can assure you that when judges issue a condition on bail for firearms to be turned over, they talk to the police to find out how this order will be applied. Furthermore, the judges give a deadline and ask the police to file a report, at least to the crown prosecutor.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion—and you will surely agree—this is a very bad reason to amend legislation that can provide good results. It does not provide good results because, in some provinces, police officers do not have the means to see the work through.</div>

When people register something, they feel responsible for it. They are more likely to follow the instructions they are given during their courses: keep guns locked up and keep ammunition in a separate location. Before letting their children use the gun or enrolling them in a course, registered gun owners will take precautions and so on. They will ensure that the firearm registered in their name is always in a safe place. They will take care of their firearm just as they take care of their car. They will not let other people use it. And when the time comes to get rid of the gun, people will transfer the registration so that they are no longer responsible for the it. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people here are elected representatives, so they must be accountable. They do not need this kind of system to make them accountable. However, we have to think of people elsewhere, in general. They will take care of a registered item. They will not abandon it. They will not get rid of it without following the right process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government could easily improve the system so that it costs less. It could get gunsmiths involved. There are not very many of them in Canada, perhaps a few hundred at most. They know firearms. They could register their guns so that there would be fewer errors. They could even do it for free. It is not very complicated. They can describe the firearm. A buyer would have to go to the gunsmith, who would register the firearm under the new owner's name. The new owner might even turn out to be a hunting client, so it would be advantageous, and the firearm would be—</div>

    </p><a name="Para720428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to begin by acknowledging the passion that this issue has raised in this country, including yourself, Mr. Speaker, on a number of occasions. To some significant degree, it is unfortunate that this issue is at times so clouded by passion rather than by reason and fact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a significant degree, members of the Liberal administration need to take a good deal of responsibility for this because, quite frankly, of their mismanagement of the long gun registry in particular, and the manner in which they dealt with the registration of firearms in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we look at the history of the registration of guns. If we go back, even at the turn of the century there was some requirement if people were carrying a gun to register it. However, the real registration system began in 1934 for, using various terminology, but what we would now refer to as restricted weapons as opposed to prohibited, those weapons that one could legally own and did not need to register, which, from 1934 on, were generally handguns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real controversy arose, and I say that objectively in terms of the history of the registration of guns in this country, after the massacre at the École Polytechnique in Quebec when we moved to require the registration of long guns. That was when the real passion arose in the country. To a significant degree, that anger against the long gun registry was generated by, in some cases, gross mismanagement in the system and the cost that went along with that system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is quite clear that we need to look at the facts. I do not want to be overly critical of the people who are opposed to the long gun registry because there are some of those within my own caucus. I want to acknowledge, perhaps at this point, that if this bill ever gets to a vote, although I have some doubts about that with the current administration, our party has decided, because of some long-standing opposition from some of our members and their constituents, that in our party this will be a free vote, not a whipped vote. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who are opposed to this bill and in support of the long gun registry will stand in this House and vote against this bill and vote in favour of retaining the registry. Those within my caucus who are opposed to this registry and in favour of this legislation will stand and vote accordingly. That decision has already been made and taken some time ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to say that a substantial majority of my caucus is opposed to the bill and in favour of maintaining the long gun registry. I want to be very clear about that because of the history that we are prepared to take that position because we do believe the long gun registry does have some validity in reducing injury as a result of the use of long gun weapons in this country and in reducing certain types of crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, we are very clear that this needs to be managed well, whether it is a Liberal administration or the current Conservative administration. There are some problems with the system and Ms. Fraser, our Auditor General, made that very clear in her report in 2006. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the fact that the government has moved to transfer the registry to the RCMP, I am very concerned that it has not looked at some of the significant improvements that the registry requires. I say that not just with regard to the long gun registry, but with regard to the handgun registry as well. Some significant improvements are required and are necessary and we are capable of doing them but we are not seeing that from the government. Its approach has been to simply dismantle the long gun registry. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be critical again, although I do not want to be overly passionate about this, but I am angry at the government for the position it has taken. This bill was tabled in this House exactly one year ago today, on June 19, 2006. Since that time, the government has had the opportunity to bring the bill forward for debate and for votes. I would estimate roughly 100 days and maybe more than that. It has not done so and I think that is to its discredit for not having moved on this earlier. The debate is going on in the country, the passion is still there and we need to deal with it.</div>

The chemicals that are addressed within the bill, while complicated in their nature and obvious pronunciation, which again you had no problem with and it was quite remarkable, many parliamentarians will say that this is awfully specific and they may ask why this has been raised at this time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of principles are contained within the bill, which we fought for rigorously and had considered for a long time. This is one of the few and rare exceptions that we will be bringing something as important, as specific, to the protection of Canadians and their health, particularly to the health of our children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept around the family of chemicals known as phthalates has been raised by New Democratic members in this place for 12 years now. Various members from different parts of the country have raised the issues of what is contained in our consumer products in particular, how that will eventually affect the health of Canadians and the way the government is ill-equipped to deal with it on a day to day basis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians, when considering the role of governments or the role of private industry, assume that governments will take on the capacity of protecting the overall health and well-being of Canadians, by not allowing products and chemicals that harm us to enter our bloodstream, our health and our environment. They would never knowingly do this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge facing government is the enormous number of chemicals that are introduced each and every year by various industries, both domestically and internationally, and how to contain them and have some sort of understanding of what effect those chemicals have on human health.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular group of chemicals known as phthalates are used predominantly in the softening of plastics. Various members in the House will know that even the cords we use in our microphones allow this plastic flexibility. They are often use in children's toys, rubber duckies, teethers, et cetera to soften the plastics. Oftentimes they contain serious quantities of phthalates in them. This would not be a problem, except for the fact that government health agencies around the world have identified certain parts of these chemicals to be developmental and reproductive toxins. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a number of people watching, they might wonder why these chemicals, which are known to have such harmful effects, have been used for so long. In various lab testings they have been found to cause tumours. They are endocrine disrupters. That means they go to the genetic reproductive level of humans and cause disruptions. In particular, they get concentrated in small children and affect their developmental growth. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could we have allowed these chemicals to go through our manufacturing process and be used for so long? Clearly, there must be some reasons. For a number of years, industry has presented various reasons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the government was engaged in the review of the Canadian Environment Protection Act, known as CEPA for short, which was designed some years ago. It was up for review for a number of years and, finally, after haranguing, we were able to get it through the committee and present a number of important recommendations. I suggest those recommendations dovetail in with the recommendations proposed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164190,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164190&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-307</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is oftentimes catching up to the developments that go on within the chemical and manufacturing industries. The innovation and consumer demand for new and innovative products is so high that the manufacturers are seeking new ways to present their products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, when dealing with these three phthalates, BBP, DBP and DEHP, they are often presented in such a way where the proper rigorous testing is never brought. Government does not have the resources at capacity, and we have heard this from testimony in front of us and also when we reviewed CEPA, to do the proper testing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that in government there is a certain amount of aversion to raising any alarm bell. These very chemicals were reviewed in 1994 and 2004. They were found to be what is called not CEPA toxic. Unfortunately, the nature and design of the tests can often predetermine the results. When the government, particularly in 1994 but also 2004, went through the testing, it eliminated things like consumer products.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740">(1740)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para720473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already listed some of the products that contain these chemicals, but there are others such as cosmetics, nail polish, blush and mascara. All these are also known to contain these chemicals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government went through the review on the exposure of Canadians to chemicals and whether that exposure would be harmful, it excluded all consumer products. It seems a bit dastardly and at the very least shortsighted. One tries to take some measure of faith within the hard-working civil servants, but that oversight needs to be corrected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill seeks to correct that. There would be another review process for these chemicals. We would include consumer products. We would also include up to date information, not information that was known 13 or 15 years ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill seeks to do a number of other important things, but it is important at this time to recognize the validators that have come on board such as the Canadian Cancer Society and a whole swath of environmental and health groups that have seen their way to support the merits of the bill, as well as other jurisdictions, in particular Europe, which has been conducting a process called REACH. It is a new vision of looking at chemicals, trying to instill principles such as substitution. It is also the review of chemicals in such a way that we avoid unnecessary risk and harm. It is the precautionary principle, which is written into Canadian law but is almost never practised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me deal with each of them separately.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The precautionary principle says that even in the absence of 100% certainty, we take a cautious route and try not to expose Canadians to something we suspect might be harmful, but still requires further study. We do this all the time and every day in our lives. We know there is not a 100% certainty of falling off a bicycle and getting a head injury, but we put on a helmet anyway. The precautionary principle says that there is some chance this could happen, and we all recommend that for our children. We say in this cautious way that we will recommend this thing. That principle is built into the bill, and we believe for the first time in Canadian legislation. It says we must take a precautionary approach.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second principle is one around substitution. Oftentimes when legislators of all levels of government seek to ban a dangerous chemical, unfortunately the industry will come forward and raise the economic spectre. It will say not to do it, that it will be too expensive and it will cost Canadians jobs. We have to weigh out that fear. Is it true or is the industry avoiding change?</div>
    </p><a name="Para720480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the substitution principle says is that the government, when a known dangerous chemical is being introduced into a product, must first seek and demand of the manufacturer, not of citizens or government, to look for alternatives. Is there an alternative available to soften plastics or to apply cosmetics that will function in the same way the manufacturer seeks, but will not harm Canadians?</div>
    </p><a name="Para720481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That substitution principle is one of the recommendations the environment committee, I believe unanimously, suggested in its review of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, and it is one of the essential things within this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out a number of other things that are required under the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires that regulations respecting cosmetics that contain DEHP, one of these chemicals, under the Food and Drugs Act. It requires products such as toys that contain DEHP and that may come in contact with the mouth of a child less than three years to be prohibited.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An important side note is a certain amount of leaching goes on in a plastic water bottles over time. One of the quickest ways to have these chemicals enter into the greater environment is to chew it, to masticate it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sad irony is we were finding products and toys that were designed to be chewed also containing these harmful chemicals. That is the absolute principle of unintended consequences. I believe no manufacturer in the world would put these chemicals in toys, knowingly realizing that children would be releasing these chemicals into their mouths. This bill would prevent that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a whole sector around medical devices. Here is another system of unintended consequences. There are medical devices that are plastic but they are softened. We know through studies that these chemicals will leach out of the plastics and into whatever is being used. We have blood transfusions and transfusions of many kinds and other testing. This is the absolute last moment, with the vulnerable population of children and now the vulnerable population of those seeking medical attention. They are in hospital for an obvious reason and now, lo and behold, while they are there receiving things like transfusions, they may be receiving a known reproductive toxin.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745">(1745)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para720487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of things that did not happen in this bill. I suppose in a minority Parliament, as in many places in life, that concessions have to be made. We wanted to go a step further than the bill describes. There should be an outright ban on all these chemicals in cosmetics and toys. We also asked for a phase-in period for medical devices. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still reluctance on the government's part. We appreciate that there have been some concessions by the government and those within the bureaucracy, but we still believe, in principle, that there is much further to go. We still believe that when the government goes through its testing and retesting, with the proper parameters, and with a good look at these chemicals, it will realize there are substitutes available. We had witnesses come before us to talk about medical devices. They said that they had held these medical devices in their hands and they did not contain any of these chemicals. They can be made and at a cost benefit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospitals in this country and across the United States have labelled themselves phthalate free. When people enter those hospital, there is no chance of contact because they have self-initiated. When they looked at the studies and did the research, they encouraged the manufacturers. The manufacturers have stepped to the plate because, lo and behold, there is a market. They have made the products that then go to the hospitals where there is no potential for contamination.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think some Canadian hospitals have moved this way, and there will be growing numbers. We would recommend that the government get ahead of these health and hospital groups and look at making these things come true. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another essential principle is identifying vulnerable populations in the bill. When we deal with the notion of toxins in our environment, oftentimes in past legislation and with previous governments adults have been the test group. Many would argue that it makes sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when we look at the conditions and the nature of children, they have a higher absorption rate of many of these toxins because of their body mass to skin ratio. These are used by the medical and health communities to determine someone's vulnerability to a toxin. Children are almost in all cases more vulnerable than an adult.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently one of the environment groups in Canada did toxicology of our blood. It tested famous Canadians. The former minister of the environment and the leader of the NDP found they were exhibiting levels of mercury, PCBs and other things in their blood, some that have been banned for a number of years. They are bio-accumulative. They come through our bloodstream.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the results of this testing showed that even in families that had made a concerted effort to live well had toxic levels as high as other Canadians in some cases. They do not live in a particularly toxic air shed or environment, they try to eat well and do all the things we tell Canadians to do. In fact, their children's toxicity was higher than the adults.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first nations' elders in my community commented to me the other day, while we were talking about another issue, that “we must become good ancestors”. I thought this was a powerful way for us to think about it as the leadership in our country. We must conduct ourselves in a way that future generations will look back and thank us for the work that we did and honour our memory, not in a way that we have seen our generation conduct itself by leaving behind problems and not solutions. We are leaving behind a more toxic world, not a cleaner one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a small way, but an important way, we believe the bill pushes us in the right direction: substitution, precautionary principle and looking at vulnerable populations. I think Canadians when given the measure will find important, will find meritorious. We look for support for this bill from all sides.</div>

I have two questions in that perspective. First, was the impact on women and seniors considered when the committee was reviewing this legislation? Second, was there any discussion around mandatory labelling?

I did not go through the list of what these chemicals actually manifest themselves as in the human system. The reason I resist is only for the sake of civility. This starts in the womb. The way that these chemicals exhibit themselves, particularly in young children, can affect the growth and the actual physical nature of children from that point on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion of looking at groups such as seniors and women in particular goes on an issue by issue basis. Oftentimes when we are talking about air quality, we definitely look at seniors to identify if they are more vulnerable to smog or one pollutant or another. That is one sure category that we look at.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to women, a whole range of studies has been done on breast milk and toxicity. Women in northern populations in Canada were suddenly showing up with levels of mercury in their breast milk that in effect were making their children toxic. The breast milk could become so toxic in nature that health officials were recommending that women did not breastfeed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any indication for us as leaders in this country that things are not right, it clearly must be these indicators. When health officials are advising women in this country not to breastfeed their children because they themselves are toxic and that in doing so they will be causing harm to their children, that has to be an indication. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly there is the science. There is the testing. There is the proper rigour. There is also the intuitive understanding, because the anecdotal information that we know about and see before us says that we are not doing it right. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will turn to the member's second question about mandatory labelling. Boy, is there a lot of fear within industry about doing this. It is the same question we had when automakers were asked to put labels on their vehicles as to fuel efficiency. They said they could not do that because it would destroy them and consumers did not want to know that. Lo and behold, they did it, and now consumers use it as one of the choices they make when deciding things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to say that labelling will answer this problem entirely, because who knows what a phthalate is? When someone is entering hospital or putting their child in hospital, the education level of the average Canadian makes it difficult to ask the hospital to check for phthalates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We really believe that while labelling can be important, the onus rests within government to protect the overall and general health of Canadians, particularly when we have the information at hand, particularly when we know that substitutes are available, and when the precautionary principle tells us to just not introduce this to people, to not expose people to this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Labelling can play a role, but we should not be overly reliant on it, because it then means that the education level is high enough that it will mean something.</div>

Certain bills grab a lot of attention and seek the headlines. Others go to a specific case involving a constituent. With respect to this bill, we wanted to combine the issue of environment and health. We wanted a bill that would eventually have results. We did not want a token bill. We wanted a bill that would make a difference and change the way things are produced. We wanted a bill that would protect the health of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked at the various predominant chemicals such as mercury and a number of the PCBs, the toxic chemicals of note and repute. We looked at the chemicals that most Canadians could identify as being bad. A lot of work had been done on them, but the fight was very clear on this one. These phthalates, while not well known, are instructive for legislators as an example of how to deal with other toxins, those that are involved in our manufacturing process, those that do not have 100% certainty. The case has not been closed with respect to these chemicals, but it has been very strongly presented that there are problems with phthalates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good example of how current legislation has been failing us. If the rule and the letter of the law of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act had been applied, the changes in this bill would have been made already. I feel absolutely certain of that. A number of health groups also feel that way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the obscurity of the actual chemicals was a threat to getting proper attention from Canadian families, we realized that in changing Canadian practice this was the best way to go.</div>

    </p><a name="Para720514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill seeks to regulate the use of certain phthalates in specific consumer products and cosmetics that Canadians may be exposed to. I am pleased to say that after a lot of hard work by all the members in the environment committee to fix some of the major errors of the bill, we think we have found a way to move forward with the bill. It was good to focus on solutions. Solutions are very important for our environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously mentioned, phthalates make up a group of chemicals that are used to make certain types of plastic softer and malleable. These plastics may be used in a variety of consumer products, such as shower curtains and blood bags, including small toys or other children's products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2164190,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2164190&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-307</A> deals with three of these, which I will refer to by their common substance names: BBP, DBP and DEHP.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government recognizes that the current state of scientific knowledge and evidence for one of these phthalates, DEHP, warrants more aggressive measures to help reduce Canadians' exposure to it. These additional measures will complement and strengthen the existing voluntary actions taken since 1998.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, I would like to outline the existing activity related to DEHP in consumer products and cosmetics, the only phthalate so far that has been declared toxic under CEPA 1999.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toys, equipment and other products for use by a child in learning or play are covered under the Hazardous Products Act. There currently exists guidance to industry on the requirements for plastic used in toys designed for children under the age of three. In 1999, Health Canada requested Canadian industry to discontinue the use of phthalates in the manufacture of soft vinyl teethers and baby products that could be mouthed by young children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on Health Canada's retail market reviews and intelligence gathered from various levels of trade, including importers, exporters, distributors and retailers, the evidence shows very little Canadian manufacturing of children's plastic toys, rattles and teethers. The vast majority if not all of this activity takes place offshore, predominantly in Asia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a continued precautionary measure and to ensure a level playing field for all industry, the government will implement within 12 months of the coming into force of the act a prohibition of DEHP in products intended or likely to be used for sucking, chewing, feeding or mouthing by a child under the age of three. This prohibition will be accomplished by using the authorities of the Hazardous Products Act. The prohibition will allow for continued use of existing compliance and enforcement strategies to monitor the marketplace and will ensure that established mechanisms for communicating consistent messaging and directives are used to inform industry and the general public.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's actions also will bring Canada more in line with the European Union's actions for similar types of children's products. Having similar requirements may foster opportunities to share compliance information, leading to opportunities to help limit the numbers of non-compliant products entering our country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720523"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government takes pride in the fact that the best suitable risk management options are discussed and selected based on sound science. As hon. members of Parliament, it is our duty to ensure that risk is taken into consideration when weighing control measures for chemical substances used in consumer products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720524"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mere presence of a chemical substance does not necessarily mean that the public is at risk when using those products. The bill's approach for phthalates achieves this goal by focusing our actions where the greatest risk exists for the consumer products: those intended or likely to be used for sucking, chewing, feeding or mouthing by a child under the age of three.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to actions proposed for the specified consumer products, DEHP in cosmetics will also be addressed by Health Canada through the authorities provided in the Food and Drugs Act under cosmetic regulations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720526"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the phthalate DEHP has not been reported in any cosmetics notified with Health Canada, it is used in other countries as a cosmetic ingredient. By controlling DEHP, it will make it clear to cosmetic manufacturers that they cannot use DEHP in new formulations and it will allow Health Canada to quickly identify and take action on any cosmetic product sold with DEHP in the formulation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government would like to note that the estimated risks from other phthalates in cosmetics such as nail polish are negligible, based on several scientific expert panels in Europe and the United States.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New regulations that came into force for the Canadian cosmetic industry in November 2006 require manufacturers to label product ingredients. This means that if a phthalate is used in cosmetic preparation, it would be identified on the product label, allowing customers to make an informed choice about which brand to use.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this bill, the Government of Canada is committed to reviewing the available science on phthalates. Pending the results of those assessments, the government will have the opportunity to further control specific phthalates in consumer products and cosmetics, based on sound science and potential risk to users.</div>

    </p><a name="Para720532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that we are going to begin to hear more and more about, and that is the relationship between the environment and health. We all sort of know it is there, but we will be able to see more specific linkages to what is in our environment, the health of our bodies and the relationship between them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all stand in the House to speak wearing a variety of hats as the people elected in our ridings. I am the health critic for the federal NDP as well as a former nurse who worked in hospitals, and I will speak of medical devices in a moment. I am also a mother and a grandmother. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720534"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do Canadians expect? We expect, as we have heard other people say, that somebody, and I do not think people could identify who but perhaps Health Canada or whoever, has used the highest level of safety consciousness possible before any product is put on the market that someone in their family might use, their child, an adult or anyone else.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we become parents and sometimes even grandparents, although some of us try, we are not as successful at holding advice back as others, I am sure. My daughter would say I was probably less successful. As parents and grandparents we read books, Internet sites and anything else to find out everything we can possibly know to keep our children safe. We work very hard at that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720536"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We check what is in food and in formula if women are not breastfeeding. We ensure children lie in the correct body position when they sleep, but we expect if a neighbour or grandma buys a toy that it is safe. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720537"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there are phthalates in toys. It is of course much more pleasant for babies and small children if the toy is soft. I have picked up toys and squeezed them and thought that one felt better for my granddaughter than the other and that is the one I would buy. It never occurred to me that I should be looking for other things as well that I would not have known to look for before.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that children, some more than others but every child to some degree, puts things in their mouths whether it is due to teething or it is one of the ways of exploration. It is one of the ways children learn. If it exists, their instinct is to put it in their mouths. If someone hands a child a toy, the child puts it in his or her mouth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we know that particularly smaller bodies have very different levels of absorption. Their levels of absorption are higher but among adults as well the levels of absorption will vary. If a child is particularly prone to mouthing a toy and has a high absorption level, that child will therefore be exposed to more phthalates than perhaps other children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all imagine this lovely picture of moms who are breastfeeding their children because they have been told that is the best thing to do, that is the way babies maintain their immunity and all kinds of wonderful things for moms who are able to breastfeed. It would not occur to us to think that because of mom's exposure to a particular product, a cosmetic or perfume, depending on how much a woman uses a certain product, it gets absorbed into her body and might be transferred through milk to her infant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As careful as parents want to be, these are things that we have not known about before and why the European Union has banned this completely in toys, as has Argentina, Fiji, Finland, Japan and Mexico. In the United States there are a number of states that are moving to do exactly the same thing. I am quite sure that here in Canada we could do that. We will not be breaking any new ground to do this and we should be moving as quickly as possible to ban phthalates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other people we have to be concerned about are other vulnerable people, like folks who are immunosuppressed because they have had chemotherapy for cancer. Their bodies are particularly vulnerable.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many phthalates are found in medical devices which I certainly did not know about before I read this. Going into the hospital to have surgery people are already worrying enough, at least if they are like me, they are. So do I think about whether the IV line they are using is safe? Or the catheter that someone is inserting is safe? I would not have time to even begin to read the entire list of medical devices, such as the aprons used during radiation therapy, feeding tubes, IV equipment and catheters. The list is enormous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have enough things to worry about if I am having surgery other than whether that equipment, which we now know has phthalates in it, is safe, but we also know that there are alternatives. We know if manufacturers are told that it is a banned substance they will very quickly find another substance to use. Indeed, with medical devices a variety of companies have found other substances to use so they can remove phthalates and still have the same effect in the product that they are producing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a superb opportunity to move forward with this. I am disappointed that it is not a complete ban because the precautionary principle says we should probably ban them all. Nevertheless we are still faced with the challenges around leaching, absorption, mouthing, et cetera. We are going to spend 24 months reviewing something that was reviewed in 1994 and 2000 by CEPA and found at that stage to be acceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our tests are more sophisticated now and I think we will find a very different outcome. However, I would like to believe we could do that in a much faster period of time because I do not like thinking that in the next 24 months people will be going to hospitals or children will be mouthing toys. It is not the toys that will be banned, but with the medical devices people may still be at some risk.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had some health crises in this country that we were not able to get ahead of. We could not see them coming and we could not get ahead. Tainted blood is a good example. We do not see health crises coming. We cannot see ahead. This is an opportunity to be ahead of something, not chasing it. No one wants to chase a health crisis. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the European Union and all the countries I mentioned have already taken action on this, the faster we act on this bill, the better off Canadians will be. It does give legislators an opportunity to say that we do believe in the precautionary principle. If there is any risk to Canadians we will do everything we can either to reduce or eliminate the risk until we know that the products on the market are as safe as they can possibly be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not world shaking. Many other countries have done this and we know that manufacturers will be able to change because with any other product that we have said is dangerous and told them they could not put this in it, a week or two later the product is back on the market, the dangerous substance is out, and another one is back in that enables the product to be sold safely. We are more than able to do this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be happier if we could have moved more quickly. I would be happier if this were a ban, although it is a ban on the toys, but I am worried about the 24 months before the act comes into force and the total reassessment of all of the medical devices. We will have a lot of people standing beside us, hurrying us to do it, including consumer groups, health groups, patient groups, parents, all those people I mentioned where products could bring their child or family member into some risk or maybe some significant risk.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illnesses from cumulative diseases are very hard to assess because it not like one exposure to tainted blood or something. Cumulative is very hard to assess and therefore we should not take any risks around cumulation of a product. We should move very quickly to ban these and to move forward to assess the others as quickly as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I thank my colleague for his very hard work on this and I thank the House for the time to speak.</div>

    </p><a name="Para720556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended bill restricts the use of DEHP in children's toys, cosmetics and medical devices using the appropriate existing federal statutes and regulations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current regulatory regimes and in keeping with the federal constitutional jurisdiction, Health Canada has legislative authorities in place to regulate the safety and effectiveness of medical devices and their manufacturers under the Food and Drugs Act and the medical devices regulations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One phthalate known as DEHP is used as a softening agent for many medical grade plastic materials made from polyvinylchloride, PVC.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a softening agent life saving medical devices such as medical tubing and blood bags would be brittle and crack during use, or could not be sterilized as effectively.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative materials have been developed for use in some medical devices for certain medical applications. In other cases non-DEHP containing devices are not available or do not perform as well as devices made with DEHP.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these cases an individual risk evaluation must be undertaken to fully understand the implications of alternate treatments or no treatment compared with the use of a medical device containing small quantities of DEHP.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a physician in consultation with the patient can make the final decision as to what is an appropriate medical treatment. No medical device or drug is 100% safe and effective. This is an important consideration in any decision when seeking medical treatment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows then that the government's response to the phthalates in medical devices must differ from its approach taken with other consumer products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns have been raised about the safety of DEHP in medical devices since the 1980s. These concerns are based on studies showing that DEHP administered at high doses to rodents caused certain adverse effects, particularly effects on the developing reproductive system in young males.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is concern that DEHP has the potential to produce similar adverse reproductive effects on humans, although there are no reliable data demonstrating that it does. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Canada has extensively studied the safety of DEHP in medical devices. In 2001 Health Canada completed a review of the scientific and medical literature and in the fall of 2001 convened an expert advisory panel to review the report and provide specific advice on managing the risk associated with the use of DEHP in medical devices. The recommendations of the advisory panel were made public in January 2002 and implemented. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003 Health Canada published a draft position paper regarding the use of DEHP in medical devices. Health Canada has committed to finalize this position paper within the next few months.</div>

    </p><a name="Para720570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this bill the Government of Canada will work with the health care community, hospital associations, industry and other stakeholders to facilitate the development and promotion of clinical practice guidelines for the use of DEHP-containing medical devices. It will finalize and release a position paper on the use of medical devices containing DEHP and develop a guidance document on labelling requirements for these products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will also give priority to the review of phthalate-free medical devices intended to be used on vulnerable patient groups. These actions will lead to a phase-out of the use of DEHP in medical devices starting with those used on vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women and newborns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach will aim to provide Canadians with continued access to the best available medical devices and treatment options. Health Canada continues to monitor and review the approaches of other global regulatory agencies with regard to the potential risks associated with DEHP and other phthalates used in medical devices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1980s' Canada's risk management approach to this subject has been evidence based, recognizing the balance between potential exposure to DEHP with the need for medically necessary treatments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure members that Canada's approach to minimize the risk associated with medical devices containing DEHP is one of the most stringent in the world.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have followed the progress of my colleague's work on this bill, in the drafting process and in getting ideas together. This bill should be supported by all parliamentarians and all Canadians because it will reduce the risk of cancer and other diseases in a vulnerable part of our population. There is no appreciable downside to the bill. It is all good. It meets all the tests for developing environmental legislation in this country. As such, I hope that the bill can receive reasonably speedy passage. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as things like this bill are put in place, the cumulative impact of the products on people's lives will be taken away. As soon as we start to reduce that cumulative effect there will be a reduction in the serious and debilitating illnesses and diseases that are a real plague in modern society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the statistics that come out about the rate of cancer in our society are truly frightening. We need to confront things as soon as possible. We need to take action. We need to take away the risks of living as much as possible. Preventing disease is much more practical and reasonable than trying to deal with it once it has happened.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we understand that a substance can be harmful to humans, then surely we should follow the precautionary principle and take it out of manufactured products. There are substitutions. There are other products that are just as good. These are the things that drive the bill forward. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate my hon. colleague for putting forward this bill. It is not something that will catch the headlines, but it will help Canadians in the future. It is something we can all support to make a difference in the lives of Canadians.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the principles that my colleague has put forward in this private member's bill are carried forward with many other substances, we would be much better off. We all make compromises in what we do in this society. If we understand that products that we are using are harmful to people's health sometimes we make compromises and allow it to continue which is a real detriment to our society.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I was elected to Parliament, there was a Conservative member who put forward a private member's bill regarding taking the compound out of cigarettes that allowed them to stay lit when they were not being smoked. I was impressed that a private member's bill could make such a dramatic change to people's health in terms of things that some people were ingesting through their use of tobacco. Cigarettes play a major role in people's lives. We know of people who have died in bed because of smouldering cigarettes.</div>

It is very important to recognize the committee's work. I have the privilege to chair a committee. In a minority government chairing a committee is sometimes quite difficult. My colleague sitting beside me also chairs a committee and he does an extremely good job. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a committee in a minority Parliament all members have to sit down and work together to try to make things happen. This piece of legislation that came out of the committee is indeed quite a bit different than when it first went to committee. It is important to recognize that the committee members actually looked at it in a non-partisan way and tried to decide what was in the best interests of Canada and the Canadian population. They agreed to have the bill come out of committee in a way that all parties can and will support it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to recognize the good work that the committee has done. We can point to other examples where the committee has not worked in that way. There are other committees in this House, particularly in the last month or so, that have become quite dysfunctional.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we come back in the fall and get into the committee work in aggressive ways again it is important that we recognize the importance of the people we are here to serve and they would be the people of Canada. We should work in as much of a non-partisan way as we possibly can on all pieces of legislation and lower the temperature in order to get things done. I want to compliment the committee for a job well done.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this piece of legislation, it really is about balancing the environment with risk. Although phthalates are used now in Canada and we recognize them as being safe, it is probably a good thing to be able to take a serious look at whether that continues to be the case. What this piece of legislation really allows for is the government to take a more in-depth study, to examine whether these phthalates are indeed causing perhaps some of the problems, which could be some of the cancers and some of the unknown diseases that occur at the present time in this country. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we do examine this and take a look at some of the blood studies. When we start looking at some of the blood studies of the population I think we will find some surprises. A perfect example occurred in Swan Hills where there is a toxic chemical plant. When some of the deer population was examined at a spill that occurred it was found that some of the deer in the general population much further from the plant had more toxic chemicals than those that were exposed to the chemicals close to the plant. That adds to the question of what is actually happening in our environment and what we need to look at.</div>

    </p><a name="Para720601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to go back to how I started my comments this afternoon, which was about trying to reduce the passion around this issue. Although I am being critical of the government because I think it has gone down the wrong road on this, I want it to be seen as constructive criticism rather than a diatribe against it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am concerned and I actually was angry at the government because of the process it embarked upon with regard to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Conservatives sought legal opinions shortly after they were elected. They were told by legal counsel at that time that they had to bring in a bill. They looked at various ways, through regulation or other methodologies, that would have avoided a vote in this House. Ultimately, they determined that they did not have a choice, that the democratic process had put the long gun registry in place and only the democratic process in the form of a bill and a vote in this House could do away with it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had said earlier, the Conservatives introduced the bill into the House exactly a year ago today and have not done anything since then to bring it forward, which is anti-democratic. I am bothered that they took that approach. However, they compounded their inaction with regard to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A>, in the sense of bringing it forward, having a debate and having a vote twice, by publishing and putting into place amnesties for individuals who had long guns who would no longer be required to register them. If they came up for re-registration, they would not need to do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of things with that. The amnesty provisions within the Criminal Code, in my opinion, were never designed for that purpose and it is really abusive to use them in that way. Amnesty is to be used in very limited ways, mostly for individual crimes rather than in these circumstances where a whole group of people were exempted from the application of this legislation as it existed and as it continues to exist today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They granted that amnesty and at the same time made the decision not to collect fees. That has cost the Canadian taxpayers now over $20 million per year. We are into the second year and we are approaching the $40 million mark that it has cost the Canadian taxpayers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obvious question is why the government would have taken this approach, given the Conservative Party's long antipathy toward the long gun registry. Why would it sit on this? The very simple answer is that it knows it does not have the votes in this House to support this piece of legislation, even at second reading and to send it to committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of that, it has engaged in a campaign to avoid its democratic responsibility to bring this matter to this House in a timely fashion and to let this House decide, to let the elected officials in this country decide whether in fact we were going to have a long gun registry. It has avoided doing that and I am highly critical of it for doing that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though we are having this debate tonight until 10 p.m., I do not see it going any further than that. We will not have a vote on it this week and the House is scheduled to end on the 22nd, this Friday. The House will return in the fall and I have no sense that this bill will be brought back in the fall. To some significant degree, the government is avoiding the issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential point I want to make is that we need to lower the passion around this issue in this country and this does not do it. In fact, it is just the opposite. It feeds it, both for those of us who are opposed to the gun registry and those of us who support it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the remaining time I would like to briefly address the bill. The bill is pretty straightforward. Although it is some 10 or 12 pages long, it is very basic. It would amend the Firearms Act. It is legislation that refers to long guns and in effect it would systematically dismantle the long gun registry in this country if this bill were to go ahead and become law at some point in the future.That is all it would do. I suppose I should not say that because it would do a bit more, but that is essentially what the bill would do, which why those of us who feel the long gun registry performs a function are opposed to it. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1835"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835">(1835)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para720612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, there is no question that the debate around whether this has reduced violent crime in this country is a debate. There is not sufficient evidence on either side to absolutely control that question. There are strong arguments that I voice on a regular basis that have convinced me that the long gun registry has had a substantial impact in reducing violence in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence, I believe, is incontrovertible that the suicide rate has been reduced substantially since 1996 when the long gun registry began to have an impact. Certainly in the period of time from 2001 to 2003 when it really began to have an impact, the suicide rate went down.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accidental death rate dropped dramatically, in the 20 percentile range, as a result of the controls that the long gun registry imposes upon the storage, transportation, et cetera, of long guns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting as well to look at what happened. It was one of those unintended consequences. I certainly did not hear anyone during those debates on the long gun registry legislation speak to this. One of the unintended consequences of the legislation, because it costs money to register, or at least it did before the Conservative government got hold of it, was that it dissuaded people from keeping their long guns when they had to register them. It also had the effect of dissuading people from buying long guns knowing that they would have the ongoing cost of registration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, there was a pretty extensive survey done at one point that showed that in the previous year of the survey being conducted slightly more than half of the people who owned long guns in this country did not use them. We have this image portrayed of us making it difficult for hunters to use their long guns for hunting and other recreational purposes, including target practice. The reality is, from what we have been able to ascertain, that continues to be the case. A large number of long guns, slightly more than 50%, in any given year, are not used at all by the owners of those guns,.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go back to the point of that unintended consequence, when the legislation came into play, people who had to begin to pay fees gave up their long guns rather than pay the fees because they were not using them and had no use for them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the fears, of course, if the long gun registry is done away with and the requirements for storage and the sequence that we follow in terms of enforcing and patrolling that legislation, is that we will see an increase in mishaps, at least in accidental deaths. Suicide is another issue but the fear is that accidental deaths will go up because casual owners, not the hunter who is devoted to a recreational pastime, but the casual owners, who on a whim in many cases buy long guns, will not be careful in how they store the guns and, in effect, protect their families, friends and the environment from the accidental use of the guns. We will see an increase in accidental deaths and for that reason alone it is well worthwhile to keep the registration in place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other statistics that is very clear, which my colleague from the Bloc mentioned in his address, is that the number of violent crimes within domestic settings between partners, almost all of it males serviced on females, has dropped dramatically as we got rid of that many guns. We got them out of the households where they should not have been. We restricted the use by other people who should not have been owning them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of that will continue. I do not want to mislead the public in that regard. This legislation would continue to require people who own guns to be registered and screened.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1840"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1840"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1845"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1840">(1840)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para720621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What should we be doing to improve the registry of both handguns and long guns? I believe the government has gone wrong by spending so much energy, including the amnesty and including forgiving the fees. Rather than doing that, if it had been spending time and effort and doing analyses of what we should be doing, we probably would have had some significant impact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about the Dawson situation. The long gun that was used, which looked like an assault rifle, at one point could have been banned as an assault rifle because there are provisions within the legislation now that say this type of a gun, if it looks this way, which is the kind of wording and essence of the legislation and the regulations, is banned. That was during the Liberal government administration. There were a number of opportunities but because of the opposition that was coming from those people who opposed the long guns, the Liberals were not prepared to take those administrative decisions to get guns like that out of the hands of people who, as my colleague from the Bloc said, have this fascination with guns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to taint all owners of guns that way but it was one of the places where we could have done better as a government. We did not do that because of the opposition to the long gun registry. We should be doing that. There are other assault rifles appearing in this country that should be on our prohibited list and no one should be allowed to own them, rifles similar to the one used in the Dawson killings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be tightening up quite dramatically the screening of everyone, whether they own a handgun or a long gun. There are simply too many other possibilities. I want to point to one of the suggestions that has been made, which has come out of the province of Quebec, around screening people by getting the gun clubs more on side, requiring them to provide information and, in particular, concerns, if they have them, over individuals who have gone through the training process that they needed to go through in order to get themselves and their weapons registered in this country, requiring them to do more in that regard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial reason that they should be required to do that is because they benefit from the use of guns in this country at the clubs they run, whether they are private or non-profit. They have an additional responsibility and I believe it is one that we should be imposing upon them and should be enforced. That would have some significant difference. Again, in the Dawson situation we should have done additional screening with regard to military records. It is quite clear in that case that it would have brought forward to the registrar that this individual had a problem and that may very well have prevented that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can go down the list. There are a number of other areas where we could be doing much better. The concentration that we have done on simply getting rid of the long gun registry is a major error. We should be doing much more work in these other areas of screening and getting other guns out of circulation that really have no purpose in a society such as Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all members of this House in the debate that will be taking place through the rest of this evening to try to limit the passion, look at the facts and to argue from whichever side, because there are facts on both sides of this, but to reduce the passion and hopefully that will spill out into the rest of the country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend who just completed speaking had talked about a lowering of the emotions and I think that is important. I think the debate tonight has been civil although people feel strongly about it. Previously there have been unfortunate references, which I have not heard tonight, to almost a questioning of whether one really loves one's loved ones if one is supporting getting rid of the long gun registry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that has not entered into the debate. Most of us here have children. Some have grandchildren. We all have loved ones.

I am glad that has not entered into the debate. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, in two cases I have talked to parents, each of whom lost a son who was tragically slain by a firearm. In each case, those parents said to me, “Don't fix the problem by trying to keep the long gun registry”. They said that it is a waste of money and a waste of police time and resources. Both sets of parents had sons who were police officers and who were slain by long guns. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share that with members and will share just as emphatically that I have talked with parents who have lost loved ones because of a handgun and want to see the long gun registry maintained. I say this to show that even among parents whose children have been slain there is a difference of opinion on this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720636"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasize some things that we are not changing as we look at Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not changing the requirement to have a licence if a person wants to own or acquire a firearm of any type. A person still must have a licence. That does not change. A person still must have the training that is involved in the handling of a firearm. The storage laws remain in place. We are still maintaining those.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handgun prohibitions still remain. We do not endorse a ban on handguns because effectively there is one now. A person can own a handgun only under very strict conditions. A person can transport it only under very strict conditions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I notice with interest some new legislation being proposed by one of the provinces. I am glad to see provinces engage in this discussion. That province is saying that it should be illegal to carry a handgun on a bus or to take it to school, for instance, but it already is illegal to do that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point should be noted about virtually any country where we look at a handgun prohibition, where handguns were banned and ordered to be removed from the hands of all citizens, such as Ireland, the United Kingdom and Jamaica. We watched this debate play out in our newspapers about two weeks ago. In all countries, everybody was agreed that over the period of time in the last 10 years or so where these handgun eradications took place, firearm use, death by firearms and the use of firearms in crimes all went up and went up substantially. I agree with my colleague who just shared his comments. It is difficult to try to endorse what we are doing here with actual statistics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720641"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some things that we are changing and that we have changed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, recognizing that thousands of people were out of compliance because of the fees that were involved in being registered themselves, we waived those fees to encourage people to come into compliance so we would know who is out there with a licence to own handguns. Literally thousands of people came back into compliance, back into the system that tells us who has a firearm licence. We changed that and it proved to be a positive thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also are proposing, with an allotment from our budget this year, that $14.2 million go into screening people who want any type of firearm. It would be screening at a much higher level than before. A person is going to need to have an interview with a firearms officer or his or her designate. Also, the person's two references will have to be interviewed. It is going to be tougher from the screening point of view to get a firearm licence than it is to get a passport. We are going to be checking into that more thoroughly.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1850"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1850"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1855"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1845"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1850">(1850)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para720644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I have heard colleagues on all sides of the House recommend other things that can be done to alert those in the health care professions, and in other ways, to the possibility that they are dealing with a person who possibly should not have any type of firearm. Those are things that we need to continue to look at.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have put the funding in place because we believe that we fight crime by having more police officers on our streets and in our communities. We have put in the funding for a thousand more RCMP officers from coast to coast. I am engaged right now in discussions with provincial ministers and territorial ministers for a cost sharing formula to have 2,500 more municipal officers on the street.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are proceeding with arming our border officers so that no longer when there is a concern about someone who is armed and dangerous coming to the border do they vacate their posts and shut down the border. That is going to assist them and it sends a message to people south of the border who may be carrying firearms that they will be greeted by people who are equipped to handle that eventuality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are giving extra funding to the teams that work together across the border on the whole area of smuggling. Police officers and police associations talk about the huge percentage of firearms smuggled into the country. We are being very aggressive on increased resources to deal with that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are putting literally millions of dollars into the whole area of gang activity and it is especially directed toward youth who would be prone to being drawn into gang activity. We want to show them that there are other choices. Millions of dollars will be and are in the process of going to local jurisdictions and local organizations that can be effective in reaching out and providing prevention programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything I have just mentioned in terms of more police, going after smuggling and a more aggressive police presence on the street also has to be accompanied by legislation. As members know, we now have legislation dealing with the mandatory requirement for somebody to spend jail time if they commit a crime with a firearm. We think it is right that a multiple offender with a firearm should go to jail for at least seven years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was disappointed that most of the Liberals did not agree with that. They voted against that. I have never fully understood it. The Liberals want a long gun registry for farmers and duck hunters, but they do not want people who have committed more than one offence with a firearm to have to go to jail. I have not fully comprehended that and I will be listening to hear an explanation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of aggressive action of going after the criminals and going after the problems is something that the city of Toronto police have done over the last year following the tragedies in that city. Crime with firearms has been drastically reduced, notwithstanding two very tragic incidents that have happened recently. The Toronto police are putting into practice what we endorse. We think that we will continue to see crime with firearms go down.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A> talks about three basic things. It is mentioning and making it a matter of law that to acquire any type of firearm an individual is going to have to be licensed. For any type of firearm, that individual will have to be licensed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720653"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also lays out rules for how businesses are going to have to record and maintain the records of any firearm transactions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720654"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, getting to the contentious point, the area of long guns themselves, we are proposing that the long gun registry of non-prohibited weapons be dismissed, be removed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720655"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are reasons for that. There are millions upon millions of long guns out there, primarily used by duck hunters and other types of hunters and sports shooters. There are literally millions of long guns. Rightly or not, and I will always assume good intentions on the part of members of Parliament, in the last decade the Liberals thought they could embark upon a journey to see every single one of those long guns all across the country registered, the long guns themselves, millions and millions of them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720656"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It proved to be a disaster. I will quote the Auditor General herself. She said that the long gun registry was “significantly over budget” and that her office had evidence that they were looking for an accounting solution. She also said, “The quality of the information is doubtful”, in reference to the long gun registry, “and they don't have the mechanisms to verify it”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went on to say, “If a police officer is consulting it, he cannot be certain that the information is complete and exact”. That is quite an indictment, with $946 million spent up to that point to support a long gun registry that the Auditor General herself said simply did not give accurate data. It may have been well intended, but it was an impossible task.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1855"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1855"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1900"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1850"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1855">(1855)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para720658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads us to the question that often comes up about something called the CPIC system. It is a police information system. I consistently hear that it is used 5,000 times a day to check for firearm occupation or firearm possession. It is not. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That CPIC system is available to police officers all across the country. If they pull somebody over for speeding or they catch someone for jaywalking, whatever the serious or less serious nature of an event may be, they plug into the system. They have a person's car licence there. They want to see who it is they are dealing with. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720660"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coincidental to that, there are also links, as those who are familiar with websites know, to a number of different sites from the CPIC system. One of those sites is linked to the firearms registry. If they want to hit the link button and go into that particular registry, they can, but this is predominantly used by police officers who want to check that system daily for any person they stop. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 5,000 police officers in Toronto alone and 6,500 in British Columbia. In a day, they use the CPIC system thousands of times, but in the vast majority of those times they are not checking whether or not a person has firearms. It is some other related activity on which they are checking.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish people would exercise caution when they use that number.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the facts of the matter related to the firearm registry, in 1998 there were 51 deaths as a result of long guns. In the year 2003, just before the long gun registry was fully implemented, finally, after the Liberals had tried for many years to do so, the number dropped. The number of long gun deaths dropped from 51 to 32 without the long gun registry. Two years after the long gun registry was in place, the numbers went up to 55.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not use a specious argument and say that the long gun registry caused more deaths, because I do not think it did, but it certainly did not reduce any. What it did do was take away millions upon millions of dollars of resources and time that police officers could have been more effectively using in all of their efforts to reduce crime with firearms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidential coincidence at all that over the period it has been place the long gun registry has reduced crime with firearms in any way, shape or form. The only thing that reduces it is aggressive activity, with more police officers on the street and some of the other items I mentioned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often hear quotes from those who want to substantiate the reason why there should be a long gun registry of sports shooters, duck hunters and farmers. Often we hear that this is one group of elected people who endorsed this particular bill and this path that we are embarking on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me quote some other people whom we never hear quoted. Samara McPhedran is the chairwoman of the International Coalition for Women in Shooting and Hunting and she says, “The ideologically driven registry has not reduced rates of violence crime”. That is a fact. She says that it “has not improved public safety”. That is a fact. She says that it “has not prevented criminals from illegally obtaining firearms”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She goes on to say:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often hear the term “the police” want the long gun registry maintained.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An officer from the Fredericton police said that officers responding to a potentially dangerous situation always assumed there was a firearm involved.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just western police, if somebody is reflecting on that. I have talked about some in Fredericton. The deputy chief of the Toronto police said that the money spent on registering shotguns should be used instead on stricter law enforcement and social programs to keep kids out of gangs. He said, “The $1 billion could be better spent elsewhere. It really has done nothing to solve the crime problem. The gun registry registers legal guns. Gangsters do not register their guns”. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian Ford, former Ottawa police chief, supported the registry at one point but makes an interesting statement.

    </p><a name="Para720694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the minister knows that the members on this side in the official opposition support mandatory minimums for gun related crimes because the research shows they work. That is why, before Parliament dissolved in the last session, our Liberal government introduced legislation to increase the mandatory minimums for gun related crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the minister speaks of the 5,000 hits to the gun registry per day and argues that it is all tied in with CPIC, he knows full well that if law enforcement officers are accessing the CPIC, they have an option of whether to go into the gun registry database. If they go into the gun registry database 5,000 times a day, they should know whether it is useful information or not. If they sit in their cars, investigate crimes and take the time to access the gun registry, the police officers know their business and have taken the time to do that. Although it is tied in with CPIC, the 5,000 hits are on the gun registry per day. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the minister quoted a selection of police officers who do not support the gun registry. How about the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the Canadian Professional Police Association? Those are rank and file police officers. They support it.</div>

    </p><a name="Para720698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quite rightly said that when police officers consult the CPIC system, they are not doing that primarily to consult the gun registry. They are using it for other reasons. All I am saying is that it is really not a totally truthful argument to say that 5,000 times a day police officers consult the CPIC system to get into the gun registry. They do not. The vast majority of the hits on the CPIC system are for other things. It just shows there is a link into the long gun registry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be a minor point, but people strike fear in the hearts of Canadians by saying that 5,000 times a day police officers are looking at the gun registry. They are not. It is possibly a handful of times a day, but not 5,000 times a day, so it is a correction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say I selectively quoted police officers, I quoted representatives of vast associations. I would suggest for the member, if he did a poll of the associations that he quoted, he would find that the head of those associations had a certain point of view and the rank and file might see that drastically differently.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I am saying is there is a vast difference of opinion among police officers on this point and they should not quote one or two officers as that being the monolithic position of all police officers. Most rank and file police officers do not support the hundreds of millions of dollars going into the long gun registry.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a former life I was a database administrator. I am fairly conversant in how databases work and how queries work between databases.

We used to call it garbage in equals garbage out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the minister clarify and give us more information about whether the information in the database is good, whether the police officers can use, through CPIC, the licence database, as there is obviously a repository of information there, and whether that information is useful to police officers in lieu of the fact that the registry information is obviously flawed?</div>

Guns have been passed on from generation to generation. Some do not even have the serial numbers on them. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the member has asked, it is only fair that I use the quote from the Auditor General when she looked at that. She said, “The quality of the information is doubtful”. This is not very reassuring to a police officer pulling up to a home and thinking that he or she is going to be able to get exact, precise information about a certain type of long gun or not. However, what a police officer can know is that an individual has a licence to possess firearms. We can have this information without spending $1 billion trying to register every type of firearm. That is the disconcerting part.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have quoted a police officer who says that the officers cannot trust the data. What they trust is their training and they approach every situation as if there is a firearm present.</div>

Police will not have that prior information, when approaching a potential crime scene, to know whether there are five, ten, twenty or forty long guns.

He shared some quotes. I shared some others. Injecting this fact that anybody would deliberately try to mislead people when it comes to the use of firearms is detrimental to the debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quoted the numbers, and I will quote them again. In 1998, at the time when this unfortunate journey began of trying the impossible task of registering millions upon millions of long guns, there were 51 deaths as a result of long guns. The year the long gun registry was to be put in place officially, that had dropped to 32, without the long gun registry. Then two years after the long gun registry was officially in place, from 2003 to 2005, deaths actually went up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be specious of my to say the long gun registry caused those deaths. I do not think it did, but it certainly did not reduce crime. The way to reduce crime is taking valuable and precious resources, getting more money on the streets, getting more police officers on the streets going after gun smuggling and keeping youth out of gang activity. When that is put into place, we know one thing, that approach works. The Liberal attempt to register every long gun did not work.</div>

    </p><a name="Para720721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know why the Conservative government is introducing the bill. The Conservatives know it has no chance of being passed, but they are trying to deliver on a promise that they made, which is fair enough. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they know that the gun registry is supported by Canadians, maybe not in their political constituencies generally but by Canadians generally, who overwhelmingly support not only the handgun registry but the long gun registry, and I certainly do as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened with interest to the minister's comments. He quoted a member of a gang who said that the gun registry has not worked at all with respect to the acquisition of handguns. That might be true; I am not sure. However, by his own logic, then, he would be banning or dismembering the handgun registry, which does not make any sense at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, not a handful of police chiefs, voted on this particular matter and it supports the handgun registry and the long gun registry. The Canadian Professional Police Association, the association that represents the rank and file police officers across this country, voted and supports the gun registry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for the minister to argue that there are one or two police officers across Canada who support this is nonsensical and absurd.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the figure of $1 billion to build the gun registry. It did cost a lot of money to build the gun registry. In fact, it cost too much to build the gun registry. That was as a result of a number of problems, organizational problems, policy influx problems, a whole host of systems development problems that emerged, which our Liberal government restructured and fixed, but at that point in time, the costs had been incurred.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would remind members in this House, for those who have worked in the private sector, systems development budget overruns are not unique to the Government of Canada, believe me. In my experience in the private sector, I have seen many large systems development projects run way over budget. Does that justify it? Of course not. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is another reality. There is a concept in economics and business called “sunk cost”. Sunk cost means if it cost that much, it may have cost more than it should have, but the money has been spent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now we are faced with a house, let us say, that costs more than it should have. Does that mean we burn it down? The question really at that point in time is: What is that house providing in terms of benefits and what is it costing? </div>
    </p><a name="Para720730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that operating the gun registry today is costing in the vicinity of $15 million a year, which is a very manageable cost for the benefit that it delivers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come back to the issue that if 5,000 police officers and law enforcement officers access the gun registry daily, which is the case, they might do it through the window of CPIC but these are the actual hits on the gun registry itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know how the members opposite, who have a respect for law enforcement officers, I think they do because they seem to present themselves that way, would ignore the support of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the Canadian Professional Police Association, and ignore the fact that 5,000 times a day law enforcement officers across this country access the gun registry, and that is a fact.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other fact that I think the minister conveniently ignores, or in fact I think he misstated, perhaps he had not had the right information when he made his remarks, is that all forms of gun violence are down in Canada. While other types of murders have increased, murders with guns have declined, and I think that is partly the result of the gun registry. The mistake that is often made is to say that the gun registry is a panacea for crime, to deal with criminality.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1920"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1920"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1925"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1915"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1920">(1920)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para720734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course one cannot look at it that way. One has to look at the gun registry as a tool that is used by law enforcement officers. I am told it is very useful to them. I am told this on very good authority that it is very useful, especially for domestic violence calls when they want to know how many guns are registered in a home.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all realize that police officers are not naïve people and if there are not guns registered they do not automatically assume that there may not be guns there. Unfortunately, there are some Canadians who have not registered their guns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that point it is only about 10%. We believe that 90% of Canadians have registered their guns, in contrast to the statistics that were quoted earlier. The police do know if the guns are registered and when they are going to a home where there is domestic violence they have to be very mindful of that. It is a useful tool for the police.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, most countries in the world licence guns and register guns. Of course the government would be totally irresponsible if it eliminated gun licensing because that is something that is very valuable and results in guns being denied to many people who should not have guns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the gun registry was put in place there have been approximately 16,000 firearms licences that have been refused or revoked. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something else that the members opposite do not highlight or bring forward in a debate is that the Canadian firearms registry provides many affidavits that are used in the prosecution of firearms related crime. In fact, more than 5,000 of these affidavits have been used. This is a tool that is used by Crown prosecutors to convict people who are charged with gun related crimes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the member to say that people on this side do not support enforcement and conviction of criminals with firearms, this tells it right there. These affidavits are useful in convicting and putting people in jail.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister talked about how long guns are used. He used the expression that they were used by squirrel hunters and duck hunters. It sounds interesting, but the reality is that long guns are used in equal amounts in contrast to handguns for violent crimes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if we look at the police officer deaths from firearms, I have a list and the number of police officer deaths from long guns is about the equivalent to the police officer deaths with handguns from 1996 to 2006. Long guns are used to commit murder and also by people to commit suicide.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect is to try to think of the long gun registry and the handgun registry as separate and distinct. I would like to read into the record from the Supreme Court of Canada. It said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para720744"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The registration provisions cannot be severed from the rest of the Act. The licensing provisions require everyone who possesses a gun to be licensed; the registration provisions require all guns to be registered. These portions of the Firearms Act are both tightly linked to Parliament's goal of promoting safety by reducing the misuse of any and all firearms. Both portions are integral and necessary to the operation of the scheme.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para720745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has to do with the linkage especially between licensing and registration, the point that my colleague made earlier, that the two go hand in hand. There has to be both registration and licensing to make the system work and for it to be an effective tool for law enforcement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that if we look at the statistics and this was in 1995 I believe, the trend is very much the same. If we look at the percentage of firearms that are recovered at crime scenes, something in the vicinity of 47% are rifles and shotguns. Handguns comprise about 22%. So, to ignore long guns, we do at our peril. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1925"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1925"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1930"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1920"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1925">(1925)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para720747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are rifles and shotguns. If these guns are not registered I shudder to think how the criminal world will adapt to that new reality and start sawing off more shotguns and using rifles indiscriminately to commit more crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part that I find particularly amazing is the fact that we have no difficulty licensing a car. In some areas we have no difficulty licensing pets. We do not have any problem with that but when it comes to registering a firearm, a lethal weapon, then some people get very upset and I am not quite sure why.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gun ownership is a huge responsibility. It is a lethal weapon. We as Canadians have the right to know who owns the guns, who is licensed to own a gun, and are they responsible gun users. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are crimes in the area that I represent, Etobicoke North. There is a sad history of gun related crime, drugs and gangs. Therefore, the argument often comes up that the guns that are used in those crimes, are all those guns registered? That is a fallacious argument. It does not have any merit whatsoever. It is like the equivalent of arguing that because we have police there should be no crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we cannot eradicate criminality. We cannot eradicate gun related crime, but to deny police authorities a useful tool that they themselves are saying is a useful tool, and the capital costs have been managed away, at $15 million a year, if it saves one life it is worth keeping in place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the notion that the guns are not licensed or registered flies in the face of the data that everyone knows: some 90% of the owners are licensed and 90% of guns are registered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have to look at the gun registry as part of an overall scheme of dealing with criminality. In my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78509,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78509&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke North </A> we have taken advantage of the national crime prevention program to launch a number of crime prevention initiatives in Etobicoke North. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program was introduced by our Liberal government. I am told that the program, like so many other programs that the Liberal government brought in, is being re-examined, repackaged, relabelled and rebranded. In fact, I am told the crime prevention program might be focused more on gun and gang related crime which frankly in my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78509,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78509&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke North</A> would not be a bad thing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before we start changing the national crime prevention program, we should look at it very carefully because it has been quite useful in my riding, getting young people into activities other than drugs, gangs and violence. Has it eliminated drugs, gangs and violence in Etobicoke North? No, it has not, but to give up on effective tools like that, to give up on the gun registry, is a bogus argument and certainly something that I will not support. We know that most members of the House will not support the bill. It is sort of a masquerade going on in the House as the Conservative Party knows.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is that we have to have a holistic approach. We have to look at crime prevention. We have to look at enforcement. We need more visible policing. In fact, I am very pleased that in <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78509,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78509&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke North </A> the police have taken action. They have used some of the tools that our Liberal government brought in, the anti-gang legislation, to arrest a whole range of people who are involved in drugs, gangs and violence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was our party, when we were in government, that introduced increases to mandatory minimums for gun related crimes. Notwithstanding what the minister said, and I know that he has tabled new legislation. This party will generally support any legislation that is reasonable. However, the reality is that young people do come out of prison, they have to be integrated back into society, and the idea that we can just lock them up and throw away the key just does not work.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was our party as well in the 2006 election that argued for a complete ban on handguns. The former prime minister, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>, came to my riding of Etobicoke North and we announced a complete ban on handguns which I think would have been useful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it have solved the problem of gun related crime? How could anyone be so naïve, yet that is the argument we hear. It is the same argument, as I said, that there is no point in hiring police officers because there is still going to be crime. It is a totally bogus argument. I think that banning handguns would have been useful.</div>

In fact, they would go into their homes, they would find out where the guns are collected. The gun collectors, I am sure, are properly motivated. They want to own and collect guns. They probably secure them very well. They are all registered; they are all licensed, but these people find out where the handguns are and they go in with trucks and dynamite and they rob them. These handguns are used in murders in the city of Toronto.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By banning handguns completely, unfortunately we would affect legitimate collectors, but I think it is needed because these handguns are getting into the hands of criminals through robberies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part of it is that we all know that 50% of the handguns that are used in crimes in Toronto come from the United States. That is why our government set up quite an elaborate system with the integrated border enforcement teams that involve law enforcement officers in Canada and the United States. They work on cross-border issues. They try to identify firearms and drugs that might be coming into Canada at an early stage. They use intelligence based policing. Those initiatives are paying off.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To actually go ahead like the Conservative government is doing to arm the border guards at a cost of $1 billion is such a draconian waste of money. It does not even come close and pales in significance to the gun registry in the cost and misuse of taxpayers' money. We know from evidence that we heard that arming the guards at the border will not act as a deterrent. We heard this from the RCMP themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is someone sitting in Chicago thinking of running guns or drugs up to Canada, do members think that person is actually going to sit in a little room and worry about the border guards being armed in Canada, that the person had better be careful? Come on. Let us be realistic. Of course it will not be a deterrent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the president of the Canada Border Services Agency told us at committee, quite rightly, that the protocol will be for the border officers not to use their firearms. That is a very appropriate protocol because we do not want border guards shooting up people at our borders where there are people waiting in line and a lot of innocent people standing around.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a total waste of money. I know it is the American way of doing things and that is what has intrigued the government opposite to move in this direction, but it is a total waste of taxpayers' money. That money could be much better used to fight crime, to hire police officers, to build up our integrated border enforcement teams and to put more money into crime prevention programs. That is what the money should be used for.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly I will not be supporting this bill. No one in the House, apart from the Conservatives, will be supporting this bill and for very good reason. The gun registry is a useful tool for police. They have told Canadians that time and again. Canadians support the gun registry. They support the handgun registry and they support the long gun registry. I will be voting against this bill.</div>

These same individuals have no difficulty becoming licensed gun owners. But the logic ends there. They have difficulty seeing the wisdom of having each gun registered.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the politics of this issue. We know that when Conservative members go to town hall meetings in rural Alberta people do not cheer for the retention of the gun registry. Those members have become mesmerized by their own spin. They actually believe that the gun registry is not needed. They actually believe it now because they have been to so many town hall meetings where the people have said that they do not want the gun registry and the Conservatives have developed this veneer of getting rid of it. They know the facts are completely different.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an interesting comment that the hon. member made about the 16,000 licences that were not issued.

The Liberals say they are the friends of the police and they identify with the police, but remember that it was the Liberal Party that said to add one person to a group of eight people on a judicial council to review appointments of judges would undermine our judicial system, as if one police officer added to seven other people in a group would be a terrible thing that would undermine our system.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More important, the Auditor General said in her last report, and the public accounts committee studied this matter, that misappropriation of money by the Liberal government in the last Parliament is insulting to this institution. They broke the Constitution of Canada, and those are the Auditor General's words, the Public Administration Act and they broke the Treasury Board rules to funnel tens of millions of dollars in many years consecutively on this matter. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member prides himself in being involved in the private sector, knowing numbers and finances. After the fact, after the money was spent, after all these deals were done without any authorization, the Liberal government handled this matter by inserting something in the public accounts estimates, which was described as a miscellaneous unrecorded liability. A miscellaneous unrecorded liability. It was stuck in some miscellaneous parts of the estimates which nobody could pick up. I have not found a single accountant in this country who knows what a miscellaneous unrecorded liability is, other than calling it creative accounting, deceptive accounting.</div>

That is why I support mandatory minimums for gun related crime and our party supports mandatory minimums for gun related crime, because that has been shown to work. Having the police as part of the selection process, I do not have huge difficulties with that myself.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a case the other day. There were two young people racing down Mount Pleasant Avenue in Toronto. They killed a taxi driver. They were going about 140 miles an hour. Those two young people were put on house arrest. I think that is tragic. I think judges should use their discretion better than they do.</div>

    </p><a name="Para720812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an opportunity for me to discuss Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A>. This legislation addresses firearms control, an area of great concern to all Canadians. Everyone who watches the news knows how prevalent gun violence has become in some communities and this is extremely troubling.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gang members carrying illegal handguns and brazenly settling scores in public areas have brought fear to cities across the country. In some neighbourhoods, people witness gun violence regularly but are intimidated into silence by criminals. This kind of criminal activity must be stopped. Canada has always had the reputation of being a peaceful country. We must do something now to help ensure this remains the case, and that means cracking down on violent crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government made a commitment to protect Canadians and that is what we intend to do. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A> is part of the government's larger plan to strengthen the safety and security of Canadians. The government has taken steps over the last year to keep Canadians safe and to do so in a way that simplifies compliance for law-abiding citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first responsibility of any government should always be to protect its citizens from harm but governments should also be careful to do this in a way that law-abiding citizens can comply with easily. This government is working diligently to ensure that this balance is respected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have introduced Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A> to reinstate a balance between protecting Canadians and easing requirements for responsible firearms owners. I would like to highlight some of the public safety measures our government has taken in the past year. The government has an overall plan for safer communities and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A> fits within our vision of a safe and prosperous Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the government felt that policing and law enforcement needed to be bolstered in Canada. In budget 2006, we invested a significant amount of money to give the RCMP additional resources to focus on law enforcement priorities. These included the expansion of the RCMP's National Training Academy, known as Depot; increasing the DNA samples on file to include a greater range of offenders; support for a special contingent of first nations RCMP; and an additional 1,000 RCMP resources to focus on drugs, corruption and border security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in Budget 2007, we have continued this support for our national police services to protect children from sexual exploitation and trafficking and supporting the Canadian Police Research Centre's work in science and technology in policing and public safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we are taking action to crack down on white collar crime by appointing a senior expert adviser to the RCMP to help develop and guide the implementation of a plan to improve the effectiveness of the integrated market enforcement teams. We are also investing $80 million over two years to make the Canadian Security Intelligence Service's operations more effective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720820"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another front, the government took steps to strengthen our borders in a way that keeps legitimate goods and people moving across the border and threats out of our country. We put in place a plan to start arming border guards. Through our plan, approximately 4,800 officers will be trained and armed. This includes 400 officers who will be hired so that no officer will be required to work alone. Some of these officers will be deployed as early as this summer and we expect that by March 2008, between 200 and 250 armed officers will be working at the border.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720821"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another issue that affects our communities directly and that is youth crime. Many communities in Canada have youth crime problems. It can sometimes mean vandalism, drug abuse or even gang involvement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our work is based on the principle that the surest way to reduce crime is to focus on the factors that put individuals at risk, factors like family violence, school problems and drug abuse. We aim to reduce crime by tackling crime before it happens. That is why my hon. colleague, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78755,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78755&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Public Safety</A>, announced in January $16.1 million in funding for youth at risk. These projects are funded through the National Crime Prevention Centre and they help youth make good choices and stay or get back on the right track.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firearms control should focus on criminals, not on law-abiding and responsible firearms owners.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the hon. members of this House can now better understand the broader public safety context within which our gun control measures operate. Gun control is but one of many ways we are working to protect Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720825"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of today's debate, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A>, deals with an aspect of the firearms control program that has been at the centre of discussion ever since the introduction of the Firearms Act in 1995: the registration of non-restricted firearms. These are ordinary rifles and shotguns most often used for hunting.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1950"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1950"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1955"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1945"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1950">(1950)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para720826"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we wish to abolish the requirement to register these firearms? The answer is twofold. The first reason is that we are not convinced that the registration of non-restricted firearms prevents gun crime. The second reason comes back to what I said earlier. Governments have a responsibility to direct limited to resources where they will have the most effect. With respect to gun control, we believe this means investing in measures that focus on criminals rather than on law-abiding citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent example of this was the successful raid carried out in Toronto last week that resulted in over 60 arrests and the seizure of 30 illegal guns, dealing a significant blow to a notorious street gang that terrorized the neighbourhood. Protecting the most vulnerable is where our limited resources should be directed to, not inundating law-abiding citizens with cumbersome rules and regulations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the government has decided to remove the registration requirement for legitimate and responsible non-restricted firearms owners and focus on gun crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, to achieve this very goal, my colleague, the hon. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A>, tabled a bill on May 4, 2006 to strengthen the mandatory minimum sentences for violent gun crimes. The government has introduced a number of legislative initiatives that target gun crimes and we encourage opposition MPs to support these initiatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> passed third reading in the House on May 29 and is awaiting second reading in the other place. Bill C-10 proposes escalating minimum penalties for specific offences involving the actual use of firearms. These offences include attempted murder, sexual assault and kidnapping, among others. Minimum penalties are also proposed for certain serious non-offence uses, such as firearm trafficking and smuggling. The higher minimum penalties rest on specific aggravating factors such as repeat firearms offences, use of restricted or prohibited firearms or the commission of firearm offences in connection with a criminal organization which includes a gang.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2519653,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2519653&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-35</A> is another important piece of legislation on our agenda to tackle gun crimes. It deals with the burden of proof during bail hearings for firearm related offences. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These reforms will lower the risk that people charged with serious offences may reoffend while out on bail. It will also reduce the risk that they may take flight to avoid facing trial for the charges. This bill was also recently passed by the House of Commons and is awaiting second reading in the Senate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new measures send a clear message that the Government of Canada will not tolerate gun crime on our streets and in our communities. However, as the members of the House no doubt know, firearms control includes much more than handing tough sentences to those who commit crime. Firearms control includes measures that aim to prevent firearms from falling into the hands of ineligible individuals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The registration of non-restricted firearms has not proven itself to be effective in accomplishing this goal. In fact, in our view the most effective system currently in place that accomplishing that goal is licensing. We have the support of many groups that agree that licensing is the critical information necessary. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As deputy commissioner of the RCMP, Peter Martin, stated to the public safety committee:</div>

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para720838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the steps that an individual must take to obtain a licence, authorities can determine if the individual in question poses a security risk. The steps include passing the exams for the Canadian firearm safety course, passing the background checks that are performed using police files and answering personal history questions to identify the possible safety concerns such as serious problems with substance abuse. The answers to these questions must be corroborated by two references who have personally known the individual for at least three years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720839"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screening individuals before they are issued a licence is paramount to an effective firearms control system. Even once a licence is issued to an individual, a continuous check is performed through an automated link between the Canadian firearms information system and the Canadian police information system or CPIC. If any new information is entered on the CPIC system by police, such as a report on threats made to another person, the firearms information system automatically checks to see if the person in question is a firearms licence holder. If so, steps can be taken to suspend or revoke the licence and law enforcement authorities are notified so they can take appropriate action to remove the firearms.</div>

The Government of Canada strongly believes that it is vital to protect the safety and security of Canadians. In fact, it is our top priority.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am often saddened and even shocked by what is happening in some of our communities. Blatant acts of violence committed by gun-toting criminals all too often make the headlines. There are too many perpetrators and there are too many victims. We hear of gang members gunning down their rivals on sidewalks or in parking lots, or even in local parks where children play. We see the reports of them waving handguns openly in neighbourhoods, frightening residents into complete silence about what is going on in their area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These acts are committed by criminals, people who show no regard for our laws. Therefore, the government believes it is time to put in place effective gun control measures that work, while streamlining requirements for law abiding citizens. This will help to ensure the focus stays where it belongs, on those who would harm our families and our communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government introduced Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A> to eliminate the requirement to register non-restricted firearms, generally ordinary rifles and shotguns, by legitimate firearm owners, while maintaining important safeguards to help protect Canadians. It is important to focus on measures that keep guns out of the wrong hands and that the public safety is protected. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first clarify an important issue, the difference between licensing and registration. Licensing focuses on the individual. It is a way of identifying who can own a firearm. Individuals who want licences must meet various criteria that help to ensure they do not pose a risk to public safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, registration focuses on the firearm. It involves providing a complete description of a firearm to firearms program employees, who then add the information to a database. Authorities can then know which licenced owner owns the firearm.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If passed, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A> would repeal the requirement to register non-restricted firearms, that is to say, ordinary rifles and shotguns such as those used for hunting. There are two reasons behind this decision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is, as I have previously mentioned, to ease some requirements for law abiding owners of non-restricted firearms who have been demanding that this requirement be eliminated for many years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is of even greater importance. The government believes that registration does not prevent gun crime. We believe that we must invest resources where they can be most effective. Under the current firearms program, an individual must hold a licence to possess or obtain a firearm, or to obtain ammunition. This will continue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720871"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A> requires that everyone who purchases a non-restricted firearm will have to have his or her licence verified. This can be done through a simple phone call to the firearms centre.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720872"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is committed to strong, reinforced licensing. Budget 2007 invested $14.2 million over two years to enhance the screening of 20,000 new applicants for restricted licences every year. This is a real investment in public safety and it was an area totally neglected by the previous government which did not provide resources to fulfill this important task effectively.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it now stands, to obtain a new licence for any class of firearm, including a non-restricted firearm, a person must pass the required Canadian firearms safety course exams. The course was developed in partnership with the provinces and territories, national organizations with an ongoing interest in firearms safety, and many firearm and hunter education course instructors from across Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720874"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard completely inaccurate comments from the Liberal benches that we are doing away with gun control. This is completely false and ridiculous. What we are determined to do is to make gun control focused and more effective. Indeed, firearms safety training is something that firearm owners and users support, and this government believes in.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2010"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2010">(2010)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para720875"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize that firearms safety starts with well trained, law abiding firearms owners. That is why we are maintaining the requirement for safety training as part of the firearms program. In this way we will help protect Canadians from possible tragic accidents. Teaching firearms owners how to store their firearms safely and securely helps prevent children from accessing those firearms and can reduce the chance that firearms could be stolen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the election campaign we made a commitment to keep Canadians safe. When it comes to firearms safety, an ounce of prevention is certainly worth a pound of cure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another requirement individuals must meet before they can be issued a firearms licence. They must pass a background check. Background checks are performed by chief firearms officers or their representatives who employ law enforcement systems and resources to ensure the individual in question has not committed a serious criminal offence in the recent past, is not under a court sanctioned prohibition order for firearms, and does not pose a threat to public safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, in budget 2007 we committed $14.2 million over two years to enhance the screening of new firearms licence applicants. For the first time, this investment means that each year 20,000 new restricted licence applicants and their two references will be interviewed by a firearms officer before determining whether that applicant should be issued his or her first restricted firearms licence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720879"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These resources were not provided by the previous government. Instead, it funded a long gun registry that we know does not work, but our government is determined to invest in what really benefits public safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720880"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a background check is run before every applicant is issued a licence, another type of verification is also carried out by authorities. The Canadian Firearms Information System, which houses all information on firearms licence holders and registered firearms, is connected to the Canadian Police Information Centre known as CPIC. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that every time information on a person of interest is uploaded in CPIC, for example, information on someone who has threatened to harm his or her neighbours or colleagues, the Canadian Firearms Information System runs an automatic check to see if that person is a licence holder. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720882"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the person is a licence holder, the chief firearms officer of the province is warned and action can be taken to follow up on the case. If an investigation shows that the person is a threat to public safety and should not be allowed to own firearms, the individual's licence can be revoked. The police are then made aware of the situation and can take the appropriate action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is called the continuous eligibility check. It is done automatically and allows for the proper identification of licence holders who should no longer be in possession of firearms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background checks and continuous eligibility checks are critical in helping to ensure that firearms are only held by responsible law abiding citizens. However, ordinary citizens also have a responsibility to the firearms program when it comes to protecting public safety. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firearms program has a 1-800 public safety line that individuals can call if they believe someone could pose a threat or should not be allowed to have firearms. That number is indicated on the form the applicant must fill out for a licence and that the applicant's spouse signs. This means that the spouse as well as the references have access to this number, so they can call and inform the chief firearms officer of their concerns, even if they feel pressured to sign the form.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the steps that come before the licence is issued and the ongoing checks while a person holds a licence, authorities know who is entitled to own a firearm. This is the type of tool the Government of Canada believes is effective in protecting the public.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clearly evident that licensing is the most important dimension of a firearms control system. This is because licensing screens the individuals themselves regardless of the types of firearms they intend to acquire.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, as I mentioned before, we are maintaining the registration of restricted and prohibited firearms. These firearms include handguns, some semi-automatic long guns used for target shooting, and gun collecting and other automatic weapons. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals can only possess restricted firearms and prohibited handguns for legitimate purposes such as target shooting or collecting. Target shooting has a long history in Canada and covers all types of firearms disciplines right up to competition at the Olympic level.</div>

    </p><a name="Para720893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in terms of our police in this country, is there any advantage to them to know, when they go to a home to arrest somebody or to deal with a domestic dispute, whether or not there are firearms at that location?</div>
    </p><a name="Para720894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I wonder if the hon. member could explain to the House what in fact this bill would do. We know that there are licences, in fact two types of licences: to acquire a firearm; and also to own one, to posses one. With that, is it the intention of the government to do away with the licensing of the owner, of the person who plans to acquire it? </div>
    </p><a name="Para720895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in my experience, the major complaint in this country has been the need for a renewable licence. The average farmer or sportsman who has a rifle, or a long gun, probably only has to register that once in his lifetime and it is not an onerous problem to license a gun. However, to maintain a licence to own a gun over a period of time, there has been a fee involved. Does the hon. member and his government intend to do away with that five-year fee?</div>

It is yes to both those questions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the important issue here is how the police officer is trained. A police officer is trained to approach every residence, when he or she receives a call, as if there were a firearm on the premise. It would be foolhardy, quite frankly, for the police officer to make any assumption otherwise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is very important that individuals be licensed to make sure that they know how to handle firearms and that they are the right kind of person; in other words, there is no criminality or mental condition that might preclude them from owning a firearm.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the police officer approaching the residence has the name of a person and runs it, as I mentioned, in the CPIC system and it comes back that the individual is licensed to possess a firearm, it is reasonable to assume that there are firearms on the premises. Whether there is one or fifty is—</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A>, whose intention is to repeal the requirement to obtain and hold the registration certificate for a non-registered firearm, specifically rifles and shotguns, is a dangerous weapon in and of itself, created by the minority Conservative government. If it is passed, millions of people in possession of long guns will no longer be required to register their firearms. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This act means gutting the gun registry and seriously weakening gun control in our country. It means that the registrar of firearms will no longer issue or keep records of registration certificates for non-restricted firearms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservative minority government is seriously flawed and its wrong-headed objective to remove the long gun portion of the gun registry is patently wrong. Not only is this attempt by the government against the wishes of the majority of Canadians, as reflected in the Ipsos Reid poll with 67% of Canadians who said so, against the wishes of the majority of parliamentarians, against the wishes of the victims of the tragic recent Dawson College shootings and their families, as well as victims of other such tragedies and their families, it completely flies in the face of the vocally stated wishes of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the president of the Ontario police chiefs, York Regional Police Chief Armand La Barge, the Centre for Suicide Prevention, and more than 40 national women's associations. All oppose strongly this attempt to cripple the gun registry and to weaken gun control in Canada, in turn diminishing the capacity of police to keep Canadians safe, to err on the side of caution, all for the sake of a flawed and ill-conceived election promise, even though it is clear that by including the long gun portion the gun registry works.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important preventative tool. We cannot only look at the measures after a crime is committed. It is essential that we always strengthen prevention, not lessen it. This is inconceivable when we consider that on average more than 5,000-plus queries are made daily by police. Approximately 15,965 firearm licences have been refused or revoked since the firearms act came into effect, and this was born of the tragedy of École Polytechnique in Montreal. Also, more than 500 affidavits have been provided by the Canadian firearms registry to support the prosecution of firearms-related crime in court proceedings across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is abundantly clear, the gun registry in its entirety continues to provide a vitally necessary tool used by both police and the courts, helping to safeguard and strengthen the safety of Canadians. The safety of Canadians is paramount. This is not something to be taken lightly or trifled with and that is precisely what the Conservative government did when it implemented an amnesty last year and recently extended it for one more year, which has already resulted in an increasingly outdated registry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action by the government is of particular concern and is another blatant example of its pattern of governing by stealth, totally disregarding Parliament, its duly elected representatives, and in effect, then, disregarding, disrespecting and bypassing the very Canadians that we as MPs are elected to represent. The removal of the important long gun portion of the registry will have significant far-reaching implications that will reverberate, adversely impact Canadians and compromise the safety of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, a number of legal implications surrounding the untracked firearms will definitely lessen our ability to carry out searches for firearms and ensure effective enforcement of no firearms conditions on bail or prohibition orders. The fact is that all types of gun deaths, homicides, suicides and accidents, have declined since the registry was brought into force. This includes deaths involving handguns and long guns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78755,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78755&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Public Safety and National Security</A> has repeatedly defended this decision by stating that Canadians will not be any less safe with these actions because owners will continue to be licensed even while long guns would no longer have to be registered. This is completely misleading, erroneous and disturbing. The fact is that we need both: licensing the individual and the registration of every firearm, including long guns. Without the critical requirement of registering each long gun, police will not know how many long guns people possess when approaching a potentially dangerous offender or crime scene. There could be 5, 10, 20 or more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This diminishes the capacity of our law enforcement personnel and puts our officers and others at higher risk because, in the words of the president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, Winnipeg Police Chief Jack Ewatski, who also opposes removal of the gun registry and the long gun portion, “information is the life blood of policing”. He says, “The more information we can give our front-line officers, the better position they are in to perform their duties”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative minority government is demonstrating a smoke and mirrors approach on this issue at the expense of the safety of Canadians. It is time for the Conservatives to come clean, be honest with Canadians and tell them that licensing and registering are not one and the same, as both are equally essential to Canadians' safety. One cannot take the place of the other. This fact cannot be overstated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, the Conservative government knows it is on very shaky ground and is not secure in this action. This is further reflected in its new firearms advisory committee, which the Conservatives have kept secret.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78658,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78658&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">London West</A> continued, she said, “If the government really supports the police, why was the Canadian Police Association left off this list?” Why was there no representation, she wondered, asking, “Could it be because it dared to support the gun registry?” She asked, “Why does the advisory committee only hear the voices of the pro-gun lobby?” She asked where the balance is that we had before when we were in government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government has repeatedly put forward money as the primary rationale for these dramatic changes to the gun registry, as the rationale for taking out the long gun portion and weakening gun control. The fact is that since the government's amnesty was implemented, there have been virtually no savings. Total spending remains stable, this after the government crippled the gun registry and after the two year amnesty for long gun owners who are exempted from the existing law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the former vice-chair of public safety and national security committee, I participated in the committee meetings on both the departmental estimates and the Auditor General's report. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78755,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78755&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Public Safety</A> meanwhile implied that by cutting the long gun registry the government would be saving $10 million this year, when in fact his own deputy minister expressly testified that the $10 million in savings would happen no matter what, because they were administrative savings due to management. It had nothing to do with reducing the registration of long guns. This was erroneous again. This completely debunks the government's supposed rationale. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I state strongly on behalf of Thornhill residents and all Canadians that we must invest in the safety of Canadians. It is non-negotiable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on that committee, I vigorously supported a motion to keep the gun registry intact in its entirety, including the long gun portion. This motion was unanimously passed by all three opposition parties yet was ignored by the Conservative government. The government continually states that it supports the average Canadian, yet when it comes to gun control, and in fact all issues, it is completely out of touch with what Canadians want and displays a total disregard toward the wishes of the majority of Canadians, the wishes of the average Canadian.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the contrary, the government turned its back on Canadians and used a backdoor, non-transparent method of weakening gun control, getting around what it clearly saw as a little nuisance: Parliament and therefore Canadians themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative minority government's dogged determination to fulfill its ill-conceived election promise despite indisputable facts and the absolute responsibility of government to do everything in its power to ensure the safety of its citizens is indefensible. Anything less than a fully intact gun registry is unconscionable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight we heard the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78755,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78755&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Public Safety</A> say that the government's intention with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A> is to dismiss the long gun portion of the gun registry. The truth is out. The Conservative government, through this bill, is dismissing the safety of Canadians. This is shameful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also heard the minister tonight call the registration of guns in Canada an unfortunate journey. This belittles and makes light of Canadians' safety and it is also a major slap in the face to those who have been victims of firearms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From day one the government has made it abundantly clear that it is ideologically committed to weakening gun control in our country.

    </p><a name="Para720930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Canadians have any confidence in the Conservative government when it is clearly putting a misguided, deeply flawed election promise before the safety and well-being of Canadians? The government, through this bill, will fail to uphold the most important responsibility of any government: the safety of its citizens. I take this very seriously, as do Canadians.</div>

This bill should not even be on the table.

Obviously she is very concerned about the safety of Canadians. That is really what should be at the heart of this debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has the intention of abandoning the gun registry in Canada and that is quite sad. I think it will be a disaster for safety and of course for issues of gun violence in our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every indicator throughout the world, certainly in the OECD countries, has shown that the country that is the most violent of all is the United States, which has the weakest gun laws of any OECD member country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of members over there clap when people say to get rid of the gun registry. Quite frankly, I do not understand their love of guns. The passion they have for this gun culture is quite foreign me. Maybe I need to understand where they are coming from. Maybe that is the case. We need a dialogue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that is a party that has zero members elected in the three largest cities in this country. It is the first time in the history of Canada that we have a government without a single elected member from Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver. It does nothing to reach out to those cities that have serious problems with guns in the streets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is baffling and quite mind-boggling as to why the government would not want to reach out to the cities and toughen the laws, not weaken the laws.</div>

When one of its members had a petition which stated that 95% of his constituents did not support the gun registry staying intact, that clearly was not reflective of the vast majority of Canadians. It was a minority point of view. It clearly did not take into consideration the very serious situation that we have in our urban centres.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that I will continue to speak out about. The fact of the matter is that there is no defence. There is no justification for changing and dismantling this portion of the gun registry. It is wrong in every sense. I am sure that we will defeat this. I am totally confident that we will defeat this, because it must be one of the worst pieces of legislation I have seen in the three years that I have been here. </div>

The riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78995,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78995&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prince George—Peace River</A> is over a quarter of a million square kilometres up in northeastern British Columbia. It is almost perfectly dissected by the Rocky Mountains. It is a huge rural riding. Without a doubt, one of the most controversial and emotional issues that my constituents deal with and feel about is the long run registry and their opposition to it. It is almost uniform throughout my riding. I am very pleased to have this opportunity to rise tonight and raise their concerns. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As someone who was a member of the House of Commons, when the original legislation to establish the firearms registry was being debated in 1995, I cannot adequately convey my relief that we have now been provided with an opportunity through Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A> to right that wrong.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We knew back then that the move to register each and every long gun in Canada was the wrong move. Many of us spoke out about that increasingly and persistently throughout that debate and in the years since. We knew then it was a waste of tax dollars that would do nothing to keep Canadians safe. Of course, history has proven us correct. The statistics have proven us correct.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, even MPs, like myself, who opposed the long gun registry could have predicted that the cost of this failed Liberal experiment would spiral from their projected estimate of $2 million to somewhere in the order of $2 billion today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening I will use my limited time to reassure those Canadians who may have been misled by distorted facts and misinformation by the official opposition and others, as they attempt to defend their fiasco known as the long gun registry. In other words, I want to dismiss the most obvious myths about the long gun registry that members from the other side of the House are attempting to portray as fact. Indeed, we have heard a number of them repeated here again tonight.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The myth is the Conservative legislation to scrap the long gun registry will make it easier for Canadians to obtain firearms. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is the registration of each and every shotgun and rifle in Canada is separate from firearms licensing. Nothing will change in regard to licensing. Canadians will still require a thorough background check and safety check. Violent behaviour and certain criminal convictions will continue to be checked as well. Applicants for a licence will also be subject to specific safety standards and training. Stringent storage requirements will also be maintained.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Liberal government was fond of quoting the fact that tens of thousands of firearms licences were refused or revoked under firearms legislation. Again, this is a licensing issue and is not a registry issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720970"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The myth is the proof that the long gun registry is an essential tool relied upon by law enforcement agencies is the fact that the Canadian Firearms Registry On-line, or the CFRO, gets 6,500 hits per day from police officers. We hear various numbers. Some people say 5,000 or 5,600. I will quote 6,500.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that figure certainly sounds impressive until we realize that whenever a police officer enters a person's name for any reason, even an address check, an inquiry or hit is generated with the CFRO. Regardless of any changes to the registration of long guns through Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A>, police will still know whether a person is authorized to own a legal firearm.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The myth is the $2 billion spent on the problem ridden long gun registry are well worth it because the registry helps to reduce gun deaths in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is according to Statistics Canada 2004 homicide report, firearms homicides actually went up 13% over a two year period. In fact, statistics continue to demonstrate that the long gun registry has done absolutely nothing to reduce firearms homicides. That is because most gun crimes are not committed with registered firearms. I know it has been repeated many times before in the House, but criminals do not register their firearms. That is why our Conservative government has taken concrete steps to target criminals on our streets. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we also heard tonight, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>, which I am pleased was passed by the House late last month, targets organized crime and gangs by imposing tougher mandatory penalties on those who use firearms to commit crimes. We recognize that we have to target the people who are using firearms to commit crimes, not the firearms themselves. Two billion dollars are better spent cracking down on the people who commit gun crimes than on reams of paper and bug ridden computer systems to chase down millions of rifles and shotguns legally owned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The myth is Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A> will remove the need to register handguns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is the handgun registry has been in effect in Canada since 1934. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A> does not change that. Whereas shotguns and rifles are an essential tool in many parts of Canada, and I already mentioned my particular riding, handguns are primarily for the use of sportsmen and collectors. Handguns are also easier to conceal and are best registered to better avoid their misuse.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-thirds or 65% of firearms homicides in 2004 were committed with handguns. That is because they are the weapon of choice for organized crime and gangs. Again, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> targets the real root of gun crime and firearms homicides by going after the real criminals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The myth is a complete ban on handguns is a worthy consideration to enhance the safety of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is although our Conservative government believes handguns should continue to be subject to registration, we do not believe they should be banned. As I said earlier, it is a perfectly legitimate use for sportsmen and collectors to possess handguns. A handgun ban will do nothing but unnecessarily impact upon those individuals. </div>
    </p><a name="Para720980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I contend that gangs and other criminals could care less whether there are registration requirements or an outright ban on handguns. If they want a gun, it has been well proven, not only in our society but in other western societies, that criminals will get their hands on a gun if their intent is to use it for a criminal purpose.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final myth about firearms registration, which I will address tonight, concerns the Conservative government's fundamental position on this matter. I want to reassure my constituents and all Canadians that this Conservative government, as demonstrated by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A>, remains as committed as we ever were before to putting an end to this long gun registry that imposes a great burden upon law-abiding Canadians, consumes substantial federal resources, yet brings no measurable benefit to public safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we are as committed today as we were for the last 12 years, which seems like a lifetime, not only to myself but to those of us who have been waging this fight against this senseless registry. We will scrap the long gun registry and redirect those previous resources to measures that will actually make our streets and communities safer for all Canadians.</div>

He talked about the myths and the facts. I want to tell a quick story.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720984"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past weekend I had the opportunity to ask my daughter, who was celebrating her 15th birthday, what she wanted to do. She asked if we could go to the local rodeo. It makes a father awful proud when his child asks to go to a cultural event such as that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That evening there was a 50/50 draw and a young man from Killam won it. He said to me, “I'll give you all of this money if you'll put it toward the fight against the firearms registry”. That shows the level and degree of passion for getting rid of this long gun registry. I told him that I could not take his money, but assured him that the government was taking some very specific measures to get rid of the long gun registry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the things we have talked about are investing in front line police officers, the $1 billion registry, mandatory minimum sentences and real measures that would help get the criminals off the street and fight crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para720987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the member, who has served the country and his riding so well over 13 or 14 years, elaborate on a few of the crime fighting measures we are putting in place, and how a long gun registry is simply not sufficient in the fight against crime and is a waste of Canadian taxpayer dollars?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest there be any in this House or among those listening to my words today who would question whether Mrs. Ross has sufficient knowledge of guns or an adequate knowledge of gun violence, I can only say that she knows the problem well and better than most of us. One of her family members was killed by a man wielding an unregistered gun.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this tragedy that the gun registry did not prevent, I would turn to a typical story of frustration that the registry has created. Steve Beck from Watrous, Saskatchewan, cannot even shoot a gopher because he has yet to receive confirmation of his registration. He recently called my constituency office to tell us about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary Canadians know that this registry has not kept guns out of the hands of criminals. They know that it has not saved lives. They know that it is not an effective tool in fighting crime, in reducing violence or in making our streets and communities safer. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do know that it has cost over $1 billion. They do know that it has intimidated, harassed and criminalized law-abiding gun owners and duck hunters. They do know that it is yet another example of how the previous Liberal government created ineffective programs that never dealt with the problems that they were intended to target.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been hearing this message from my constituents since I was first elected in the House of Commons and I am happy to be able to deliver on our promise to repeal this registry as Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A> begins its legislative journey to hopefully passage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be clear that this government is very concerned about gun-related crime. Unlike the Liberals, the Bloc and the NDP, this government is committed to effective gun control and tackling the criminal misuse of firearms. We believe in targeting criminals, not farmers and not duck hunters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals continuously neglected our licensing system, which is why we allocated $14 million over two years in budget 2007 to improve front end screening of first time firearms licence applicants. This will help prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal Party wasted $1 billion on a failed long gun registry, which was acknowledged by the Auditor General, and our government is investing $161 million over two years to add 1,000 more RCMP personnel to focus on law enforcement priorities such as gun smuggling.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government raised the age of consent from 14 to 16 years of age to protect children from sexual predators. That was something we tried to do in opposition on at least six occasions, through private members' bills and opposition day motions, but the previous Liberal government kept saying no.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are trying to impose mandatory prison sentences for gun crimes but the opposition does not like that either.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government just does not talk about fighting crime. We do not create another committee or another registry to create the appearance of fighting crime. We go to the heart of the criminal justice matter and insist that violent criminals serve their time. We do not blame the victims. We punish the criminals. We do not arrest duck hunters. We try to stop violent offenders. We do this because Canadians told us that they were tired of the Liberal delay, confusion and diversion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721019"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians expected action and the Liberal gun registry was not the kind of action they wanted. Canadians already knew that nobody could find ways to waste a billion dollars like the previous Liberal government. They did not need to be shown again by the example of the gun registry, which has been a disaster for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attempting to count and track every long gun in Canada has been ineffective and expensive. It has misdirected police resources from what is most important, which is going after criminals who use firearms in crime.</div>

    </p><a name="Para721022"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals would still be required to have a valid firearms licence and to go through police background checks and safety training in order to purchase or possess firearms and to purchase ammunition. Individuals would also continue to be required to register prohibited and restricted firearms, such as handguns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a quick background check, our police officers would be able to determine who is in legal possession of firearms and who is not.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, the Liberal government told Parliament that the long gun registry would involve a net cost of $2 million. That was in the Auditor General's report 2002, chapter 10.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721025"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2000, the Liberals admitted that the costs had actually ballooned to at least $327 million. That was in the Auditor General's report 2002, chapter 10.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By March 2005, the net cost of the firearms program was over $946 million. Today it exceeds $1 billion. That was in the Auditor General's report 2006, chapter 4.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $1 billion figure does not even include the costs incurred by law enforcement agencies enforcing the legislation and compliance costs to law-abiding firearms owners and businesses, which likely runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. That was in the Auditor General's report 2002, chapter 10.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General said that the Liberals misinformed Parliament about many of these costs. That was in the Auditor General's report 2006, chapter 4. However, misinformation has ruled the day.</div>

    </p><a name="Para721051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A>. I would like to thank the government for finally bringing the bill forward, for finally finding the courage of its conviction at this very late date. If we approached all the bills with the same degree of courage the government has shown with this one, we would be way behind in our legislative agenda.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from the Northwest Territories and being our party's critic for rural and remote communities, I have run in three elections supporting the concept of taking away the registry on long guns and shotguns. Throughout those three elections people across the north consistently said to me that it is not required, it is not necessary and it is not really working for them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take a step back from that and look at what is working in gun control in Canada now. What is clearly working right now is the registry that is in place for licensing. Quite clearly, we have a better system of licensing now. I guess we can thank the Liberal Party for delivering that in the legislation in 1995. We have a better computerized system. It delivers for licensing. We are more organized and efficient at processing licences. I have heard the number of rejected licences, some 16,000, for people who were not considered appropriate to have firearms. That is a good and meaningful figure. It is a figure that makes Canadians safer on the ground. We can thank the Liberal Party for that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when it comes to suggesting that one party or the other in Parliament has the vision to put everything together, that has the ability to transcend the ideology and politics of the day, whether it is in 1995 or 2007, and come up with a plan that is going to match what is required for Canada, that is a very egotistical approach.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721055"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We suffered under that with the majority Liberal government. It did not understand the nature of gun control. The Liberals had a law that tried to do too much. The things that it did not do well are the certificates for individual firearms, for long rifles and shotguns. Those are the things that were not done well. Those are the things that this bill will take out of the system. This is not the end of gun control in Canada. It is an adjustment to the gun control legislation that we have in the country. Quite clearly, that is what we are doing here and that is why we should all look at it in that fashion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721056"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not about one party being against the other. This is about looking at what is good for Canadians. As a New Democrat in an open party, I feel very good about standing here today and supporting the adjustment that is being proposed by the government. Why? Because in my territory, before the gun registry, the value of subsistence hunting was some $60 million for 45,000 inhabitants. That same message is repeated right across northern Canada and northern parts of the provinces. For people who use rifles and shotguns for their way of life, the gun registry did not work. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was said at the time in 1995 in Parliament that it would not work. It was not adjusted to make it work. The importance of that to many people across the country was not recognized. We had a situation where a majority government, not a minority government as we have today, made a decision in its magnificence to create a gun control law that went too far.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2110"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2110">(2110)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para721058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are taking it back now perhaps with this bill. This is a minority government and we may find that this bill will not meet the test of all members in this House. It meets the test of this member standing here right now. I support it because I see it as a necessary adjustment to gun control.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does not pass up the good work that is in gun control now. If the government decides to put more effort into licensing by ensuring that the people who own firearms are capable, competent and not criminal in nature, then the gun registry is an excellent investment of public funds. It is an investment that will be returned to everybody in the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Storage is extremely important. Safety is extremely important. Training is extremely important. These characteristics that we have built into gun control now should be enhanced and regulated to a greater degree. Quite often if guns are not stored properly, they become available to people who may use them wrongly. I have seen too many tragedies involving young people or people who are not in their right mind who are impaired in one way or another, taking somebody else's rifles or guns that are not stored properly and either doing themselves in or doing in others. We can control that through legislation. We can make a difference to all legal gun owners and the safety of this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge requirement for the control of handguns in our cities. There is a huge requirement for the control of restricted weapons that are easily concealed and are the basis of the criminal industry in this country. A ban on handguns in the future may be part of the legislative agenda of this House, perhaps not with the present government, but perhaps with the next. There would be an onward evolution of gun control in this country. I hope when we debate it that we make sensible choices about how to put that in place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other aspect of the use of guns in this country that I want to speak to and that is what guns are being used for. Guns are being used to feed the appetite of Canadians for drugs and illicit goods. The majority of illegal guns are causing death and havoc in our cities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say that we have to stop criminals by catching them and putting them in jail. We need to recognize the necessity of adjusting our legislation to truly change the criminal state. We need to take some of the oxygen out of the criminal system, what makes it worthwhile for someone to have a handgun in his or her possession, the tens of billions of dollars of illicit drugs that are being sold in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we stop the appetite of Canadians for illegal drugs and illicit goods? Are we doing a successful job at that through enforcement, through all the tricks of the trade that we have developed in our war on drugs? I do not think so. I think it has been an abject failure. If this legislature does not come to grips with that, we will never truly understand how to deal with crime in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand I support this legislation. It is a great adjustment to the gun control legislation in Canada. On the other hand, we have so much work to do to reduce crime in this country. </div>

    </p><a name="Para721068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member mentioned the problem in urban centres. What we are seeing across Canada are illegal guns and how they are tied to the drug trade. I know in Manitoba we see a lot of people growing marijuana and then trading that for illegal guns in the United States and bringing those back so that they can carry out their crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to get back to this issue of legitimate ownership. I know that one of the things we both talked about was the need for subsistence living. We have a lot of Métis and aboriginal hunters in our ridings that use their firearms as part of their daily living. I know in my riding a lot of people hunt for geese, ducks and deer in the fall, and they stock up their freezers and they are good for the year. The member mentioned that and that is important to me as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, what has been affected in my riding is the outfitting business. It has become difficult for people to transport their firearms across the line. We do not have those international visitors coming in any more and supporting these people. That has hurt our local economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member expand upon that and explain if that is one of the same concerns that they have in the western Arctic as we have in Selkirk—Interlake? Again, I want to thank the member for his support of this bill.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could say why not just register them. It does not work like that. When people are part of that subsistence economy, they may borrow guns and use guns.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of Charlie Snowshoe, an elder from Fort MacPherson who has run the game council there for many years, he is totally opposed to this.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Montreal massacre 18 years ago, an assault rifle was used. Every year, when we have the candlelight vigil, we make a commitment to ban violence and to reduce the gun culture. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An assault rifle is a long gun. It is a gun that is used to kill animals sometimes in rural Canada, but in a lot of other places, especially urban centres, assault rifles and long guns are used to kill people and a lot of those people are women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if some members of Parliament were here 18 years ago, but for every year since, on December 6, we wear white ribbons. The white ribbons are from the families in Montreal who say they want to work for change. It is also a symbol, saying that we want to stop men's violence against women. I hope members of Parliament remember that moment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that 88% of women killed with guns are killed with shotguns or rifles. We know that 50% of family homicides end in the suicide of the murderer, indicating that key to protecting women and children is licensing and screening, including the renewal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the gun deaths in Canada, 80% are suicides, most by using rifles or shotguns that were readily available. Access to guns is the fifth highest risk factor in spousal homicide.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard from different inquests in domestic violence that a lot of the women are killed because of the gun culture and because of passion, but also because of access to guns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, if more women were elected to the House of Commons, this debate would be somewhat different.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long gun registry has been working. The gun registry is very mismanaged, but it is working. It is being used. Over two million gun owners are licensed and six million guns have been licensed. We now have police using this registration database 1,500 times per day and are reporting successful use of this tool in fighting an illegal gun trade. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It works. Why? We have seen statistics that say there were 525 fewer gun deaths, which include suicides, homicides and accidents in 2002 compared to 1989, the year I was just talking about. It is a 60% reduction. We are talking about 525 lives. We are talking about 40 fewer women per year being shot, compared to 15 years ago. Every year, 40 fewer women being shot. I want people to remember those lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 100 fewer murders every year with rifles and shotguns. Think of that number as we are debating this bill today. Think about those women. Think about those murders. In Quebec alone, there were 30 fewer gun related suicides each year among young people in 2000-01, a 50% drop from the average of 56 firearm suicides in this group in the nineties. Obviously, the gun registry is working. Yes, it is mismanaged, but does that mean we need to scrap it? No. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a better and improved system. We need better screening, tightening the screening, getting and requiring the gun clubs to provide information on individuals who are having problems, who may be slightly bordering on very dangerous behaviour. There should be at least two references and spousal notification when a spouse is getting a gun.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We definitely should be banning semi-automatic rifles. Because of the registry some who did not need their long guns gave them up because they had no use for them, which means that we are getting the guns out of places where people do not use them, so that there is less chance of accidents, less chance of guns being stolen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun registry is like building a house. We have a foundation; the walls are in and the roof is in. Yes, there are some problems with it. Maybe it has a lousy coat of paint or ugly drapes, but we do not destroy the entire house. We have already spent a lot of money. For us to scrap it now would mean a gigantic waste of taxpayers' money that was already spent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheila Fraser, the Auditor General, said in 2006 that there were problems in this registry. This bill was tabled on June 19, 2006, but nothing happened for an entire year. Why not talk to Canadians? That did not happen. It did not go to committee. If it is so important, why did it not go to committee? Why was there no debate?</div>
    </p><a name="Para721096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the Conservative government decided to have an amnesty and said it would not charge any more. Each year that has happened $20 million is not being collected. The total for almost two years now is $40 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard tonight that perhaps we should take that money and invest it in young people, invest it in anti-crime initiatives. The Conservatives, during the election, said that they would provide $50 million in crime prevention programs. That did not happen, did it? </div>
    </p><a name="Para721098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even today in the House of Commons during question period we heard only $10 million being announced and we do not even know where we can find this $10 million because if we check the website for the National Crime Prevention Centre there are no clear guidelines. How do communities apply? I do not know.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old program was mismanaged in terms of the anti-crime prevention programs, but we need to improve on that. Improve the gun registry, strengthen it, and manage it well. What we should not do is scrap it and have this bill passed because it would be very unfortunate. We know what the results would be: homicides, suicides, and accident rates would go up. Lives would be destroyed and most of those lives would belong to women.</div>

She mentioned that the gun registry was like building a house. I suppose, but that house was about a thousand times over budget. The gun registry that was supposed to cost $2 million cost $2 billion. It is like starting out to build a house for $150,000 and accidentally going over budget and costing $150 million. Now we are thinking it might be a nice house except that it leaks and probably was built on a lousy foundation, so it is probably going to fall down, but let us keep spending money on it anyway because it might be a nice house some day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is garbage. The long gun registry does not work. The hon. member mentioned homicides, domestic assaults and so forth would go up. First of all, she cannot present any evidence in that regard. Second and more importantly, homicides happen by various means. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would she propose that we start a parallel registry where perhaps we could ask chefs to register all their kitchen knives because as we know, stabbings kill people. So if we registered every knife and we knew where every knife was, we could probably put an end to stabbings because it is the same philosophy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we register every weapon imaginable, surely nobody could commit a crime. This whole philosophy is so flawed. Would she like to recommend to the House that we start a parallel registry to register kitchen knives?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days, maybe in the 1950s, when kids got into fights they may have pulled knives on each other or fought with their hands but not many of them had guns.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go back to the example I was using. If someone were to spend $150 million building a house, I cannot imagine that person would bulldoze it to the ground just because the roof was leaking. The person would spend a bit of money to repair the leaky roof. The member would not get a bulldozer and scrap the entire house. I cannot imagine anyone would do that to a house that is worth a bit of money.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I come from, predominantly a rural riding in Alberta, this bill is one of the most important changes that my constituents, over the seven years that I have been a member of Parliament, have asked for. They want to see the gun registry changed and the long gun registry dropped.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is the start of a process that would reverse the burden that has been placed on rural Canadians by Liberal governments for far too long, approximately 10 years. Farmers and ranchers, those of us who live in remote and rural communities, have been taxed and red-taped by the Liberal government's failed gun registry for a decade now and they are saying that enough is enough and that it is time to make changes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have lived with this type of registry for a long time but we have lived with firearms, and long guns specifically, for generations in rural Canada. We have lived with them safely as responsible and law-abiding owners and users. However, when urban Canada, and our largest cities in particular, began to suffer from gun violence on an increasing basis, the Chrétien government launched a long gun registry. However, it did not address the problems in these urban centres and caused considerable hardship to rural Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party campaigned on a promise to address what some estimate to be now a $2 billion waste of taxpayer dollars and to remove the yolk that the Liberals placed on rural residents when it comes to firearms ownership. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78803,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78803&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the current Liberal leadership, Canada's new government is committed to effective gun control in tackling the criminal misuse of firearms. We understand that serious gun crime problems are very evident in our urban areas. They continue to rise and this government will do something about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721119"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is that the vast majority of these firearm homicides are committed with illegal, unregistered firearms. That is why we believe in targeting the criminals themselves, the criminals who use and traffic in illegal firearms, not the duck hunters, not the farmers and not the ranchers who have nothing to do with the criminal element or criminal activity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721120"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals continuously neglected our licensing system. We allocated $14 million over two years in budget 2007 to improve front end screening of first time firearm licence applicants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened to people tonight from the other side say that we were getting rid of every type of regulation. That is not right. We want to ensure that those who apply for a firearms licence will be trained and screened so they will be responsible firearm owners. Those are very important measures that will help prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands. It was the aspect of a licensing and screening system that was totally neglected by the previous government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, over more than a decade the Liberal Party wasted hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on a long gun registry that could have been used for fighting crime and the sources of criminal behaviour.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other failure of the Liberals' long gun registry is well-documented by the Auditor General. Data was too often inaccurate and costs skyrocketed while Parliament was, in my opinion, intentionally misinformed about the progress that was being made.</div>

    </p><a name="Para721126"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since taking office, we have brought forward 11 new legislative proposals that will help crack down on crime, proposals such as restricting conditional sentences such as house arrest for serious crimes, imposing mandatory prison sentences for gun crimes, and keeping in prison the most violent, most dangerous repeat offenders in the country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians expect action, not further delays, yet that is what the opposition is doing with its majority of votes at the justice committee. They opposition members are slowing down and watering down and doing everything they can to postpone the proposals to strengthen our criminal justice system. Yet again, getting tough on crime was one of our major planks in the previous election and the Canadian electorate supported our proposals.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals' attempt to count and track every long gun in Canada has been ineffective and costly. It has misdirected police resources from what is most important: going after criminals who use firearms in crime.</div>

In fact, when a person purchases a non-restricted firearm, the validity of his or her licence will have to be verified. This can be done relatively simply and not at a huge cost, but we want to make certain that the right and responsible type of firearm owners are the ones doing the purchasing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants will continue to go through police background checks and safety training. Canadians also will continue to be required to register prohibited and restricted firearms, such as handguns, as has been the case since 1934.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our intention is not to change the handgun registry. It is not to take that away. We recognize that it is the gun of choice for the criminal element. It is not our intention to touch that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, we are talking about the long gun registry. Through a quick background check, our police officers will be able to determine who is in legal possession of firearms and who is not.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, the Liberal government told Parliament that the long gun registry would involve a net cost of just $2 million. That is a fact. Anyone can check. That is what was in the Auditor General's report in 2002 in chapter 10.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2000, the Liberals admitted that the cost had actually ballooned to at least $327 million. Again, that is a fact. Members can check the Auditor General's report of 2002 in chapter 10.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By March 2005, the net cost of the firearms program was over $946 million. Today those costs exceed well over $1 billion, according to the Auditor General's report of 2006 in chapter 4.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This $1 billion figure does not even include the costs incurred by law enforcement agencies in enforcing the legislation or the compliance costs for law-abiding firearms owners and businesses, which are astronomical and likely run in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721139"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worst of all is that by 2006 the Auditor General said that the Liberals had misinformed Parliament about the many costs of their failed long gun registry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721140"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the many towns and villages in my riding, the waste of these taxpayer dollars by the Liberals in a phony attempt to fight gun violence is overshadowed only by the tremendous and terrible burden placed on rural Canadians and, I dare say, also on western Canadians. The Liberal gun registry targeted every rural Canadian and certainly out west it would seem to me that we felt it the most.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Liberals deny and then after electoral defeat they wonder why they are having problems in western Canada. Their long gun registry is a prime example.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not mention the fact that the Liberals ignored and dragged their feet on the agriculture file, that they denied rural Canada a real and useful child care policy, that they refused to appoint our elected senators, that they racked up surpluses while forecasting deficits, and many other things.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a long gun registry that costs $2 billion. I heard Liberals tonight say that if it only saves one life, that if it only saves a couple of lives. If we could take the billions of dollars for a failed gun registry and put it into places where we could see front line officers out on the street, if we could take that billions of dollars and make certain that there is more effective education to help fight crime, I think we would see crime lowered even more.</div>

    </p><a name="Para721158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been well stated tonight that the country has had the toughest handgun laws in the world since the 1930s, yet that has not prevented gun crime from happening. It is unfortunate, but it is a fact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989 we had the troubling and tragic Montreal massacre at École Polytechnique Institute. This is remembered to this day. In 1995, as a result of that terrible incident, the Liberal government of the day, with a knee-jerk reaction and without thinking, introduced Bill C-68. It was a Firearms Act that was called the strictest gun control legislation in the world. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was first established, the Department of Justice estimated the cost of the Canadian firearms program, also the gun registry, to be $2 million. In the end, the Auditor General reported the cost as way over a billion dollars and approaching $2 billion and still climbing. It has turned out to be the biggest single deception of the Canadian people ever, another Liberal boondoggle, nothing more than a black hole for taxpayer dollars. Their money went nowhere and was used to accomplish nothing, our money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the bill was to license all firearms, including shotguns and rifles. Furthermore, it was supported by the anti-gun, anti-hunting crowd that put their support behind it, knowing full well that it would do nothing to reduce crime, but would move them one step closer to their ultimate goal and their naive dream of the total ban of guns from the average citizen. This would suit the criminal element in society just fine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that we cannot eliminate guns totally and that the criminals will always have their way. A good example was during the temperance movement years ago. Liquor was still smuggled in. The criminal element will always find a way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we throw up our hands and penalize the rest of society instead of targeting the real problem? No. That is the Liberal way. They did it. It was “let us go after the farmer, the duck hunter, the target shooter”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-68 will not and has not prevented gun crime from taking place. Now, unfortunately, last fall there was another tragic example of that in our country. The shooting at Dawson College was carried out by a man using a registered gun. This registry was supposed to stop this kind of thing, but the reality again was it did not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These events, in addition to the numerous shootings that have taken place in other Canadian cities, have all occurred with that legislation in place. The gun registry has not saved any lives. Many speakers, including the hon. member beside me, have spoken to that point. Any member in the House or any police officer would support that kind of an objective, but unfortunately Bill C-68 did not do this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History speaks for itself. If we continue along this same path, the future will repeat itself. We need to make changes, and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2295041,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2295041&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-21</A> is about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something that needs to be pointed out is the lack of on the ground police support for the gun registry. While some police leaders have supported it, it is very hard to find an actual police officer out there on the ground who will say the registry is needed. That is a fact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition and the anti-gun, anti-hunting lobby continually mislead the public and the media by telling them the police use the registry 5,000 times a day to check out criminals. This is a total misrepresentation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun registry is automatically linked so when an officer investigates someone on a regular traffic infraction, he or she is also checking that person out on the gun registry. However, the officer does not even know that he or she is running that person's name in the gun registry. The officer does not see any information from it and does not keep or use that information. Total blarney, a whitewash, just another “fiberal” scam.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the previous government, the Conservative government is not interested in licensing guns. It is committed to licensing people. People with long guns do not rob Mac's Milk stores. People with long guns do not hold up gas stations. People do not use legal long guns in drive-by shootings. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T2155"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2155"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2155">(2155)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para721171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe in targeting criminals, not duck hunters and farmers. That is why in budget 2007 we allocated $14 million over two years to improve front end screening of first time firearms licence applicants. This will help prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721172"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals will still be required to have a valid firearms licence. We are not opposed to that. They will still go through a police background check. For 25 years I went through a police check to purchase a gun. I do not have a problem with that and neither does the long gun owning crowd.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety training is still going to be part of it. We have no problem with that. In order to purchase or possess firearms and ammunition, individuals will still also continue to be required to register prohibited and restricted firearms such as handguns. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721174"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a quick background check, our police officers will be able to determine who is in legal possession of firearms and who is not. The government invested $161 million over two years to add 1,000 more RCMP personnel to focus on law enforcement priorities, such as gun smuggling, restricting conditional sentences such as house arrest for serious crimes, especially gun crimes, imposing mandatory prison sentences for gun crimes and keeping the most violent and dangerous repeat offenders in the country in prison.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to point out that the opposition party across the way and many other members in the House en masse voted against our tough on crime bills. It is unbelievable. Yet they still stand and say that they want to get tough on crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721176"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para721177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I said this was a passionate issue for my constituents. In my last householder I conducted a survey in my riding just to be sure the mood had not changed. On the topic of the gun registry, more than 95% said yes to scrapping or revamping the long gun registry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has introduced an amendment to the Firearms Act that will eliminate the expensive and ineffective long gun registry. It has not saved lives. It has cost us billions and is still climbing. The bleeding must stop.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721179"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fair to say that all in the House truly want to reduce gun crimes, but I implore everyone on all sides of this issue to think with their heads. Let us tackle gun smugglers, gangs and all criminals and give our police officers and border guards the tools and support they need, and we will make headway.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that battle, unfortunately, we will never eliminate all the Marc Lepines of the world or get them off the street before it is too late. Unfortunate as it is, it is simply a reality.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gun crime is a serious issue in Canada; there is no doubt about that. There have been a number of recent incidents in my city of Winnipeg. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, May 25 of this year a 22-year-old man was shot early in the morning in Winnipeg's Spence Street neighbourhood. The man was out walking around 1:30 a.m. when he was approached by a pair of teenage boys. They reportedly made comments related to gang involvement before shooting the man in the upper body, police said.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just this past weekend a 20-year-old man was gunned down on an inner city street. He died after being taken to hospital in critical condition. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just an hour before in a separate incident, a 15-year-old girl and a 37-year-old man were shot and taken to hospital. The residents in the area where the shootings occurred were frightened and would only suggest the shootings might be gang related and they were fearful of repercussions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para721208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents in my city of Winnipeg should not be afraid. They should not have to live in fear. We need to protect these citizens in an accountable and effective manner. That is why our government is taking steps to strengthen gun control by making it effective. We want to tackle the criminal misuse of guns, not hunters and farmers.</div>

    </p><a name="Para721211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that requiring legitimate long gun users to register their guns is not a way to prevent gun crimes. Hunters and farmers are not criminals and should not be treated that way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long guns are not commonly used in gun crimes. In fact, there are over seven million registered long guns in Canada. However, as I said earlier tonight, of the 569 murders recorded in Canada in 2003, only two were committed with long guns known to be registered. That is only .3% of all the murders in 2003. </div>
    </p><a name="Para721213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that it is not only the government side of the House that feels the long gun registry is ineffective.
