	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise to inform my hon. 
colleagues in the House that on behalf of the Government of 
Canada I am sending a proposal to the  provincial and territorial 
governments today. It proposes a new partnership with them on 
active employment measures.
<P>
	This partnership respects provincial responsibility for labour 
market training. It recognizes that both levels of government must 
find new ways to help unemployed Canadians get back to work as 
rapidly as possible.
<P>
	The proposal responds to the long standing provincial and 
territorial call for greater responsibility in the field of labour 
market development. It provides a basis for managing the federal 
withdrawal from labour market training the Prime Minister 
announced last November.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This represents flexible federalism. The proposal provides for a 
new federal/provincial/territorial partnership in labour market 
activities. Provinces will have the opportunity to deliver active 
employment measures funded through the employment insurance 
account; use EI funds to tailor active measures to meet local and 
provincial or territorial labour market priorities; provide labour 
market services such as counselling and screening now delivered 
by the Government of Canada; match local labour market demand 
and supply through job placement services; and assist individuals 
with career action plans to address their employment needs and 
guide them to successful employment opportunities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The proposal retains the legal responsibility of the Government 
of Canada for the funds of the EI account and the requirement that 
these funds be spent effectively and efficiently in a way that 
achieves agreed to results.
<P>
	Under this proposal the Government of Canada will make 
approximately $2 billion available to the provinces and territories 
for active employment measures and for the related labour market 
services the Government of Canada now delivers.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is committed to working in concert 
with our provincial and territorial counterparts to develop new 
labour market arrangements. These new agreements will help us 
provide appropriate transitional assistance to Canadians who face 
temporary periods of unemployment. Bilateral agreements will 
reflect the diverse and changing circumstances that exist across the 
country from province to province to territories.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3166"> 3166 </A></B>
<P>
	The Government of Canada will maintain a significant role in 
labour market issues. As I indicated, these agreements will be 
consistent with the Government of Canada's fiduciary 
responsibility for the employment insurance account. We will 
continue to be responsible for labour market matters that are 
pan-Canadian in scope. These include the interprovincial mobility 
of workers, labour market information and national sectoral 
partnerships on sectors.
<P>
	We will continue to respond to national economic crises and 
facilitate labour market adjustments. This initiative is consistent 
with the best traditions of the Canadian federation. Federalism in 
this country has always been a living and creative solution to 
challenges of Canadian life. We must adapt to meet the needs of 
each succeeding generation.
<P>
	A major challenge that faces us now is creating more jobs in the 
context of a new, demanding, challenging global economy. 
Renewal to our federation through flexible initiatives such as this 
proposal will contribute to help put Canadians back to work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This proposal builds on the announcement on labour market 
training made by the Prime Minister on November 27, 1995. That 
commitment was restated in the speech from the throne earlier this 
year. We have already begun to take action to implement it. 
Funding has already ended for cooperative education and 
workplace-based training.
<P>
	Under this proposal we will phase out the remaining federal 
presence in labour market training in less than three years. Our 
government is committed to working in concert with our provincial 
and territorial partners on the design, delivery and evaluation of 
active employment measures.
<P>
	We understand that some provincial and territorial governments 
will want to take on more of these responsibilities than others. We 
are ready to accommodate that diversity.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is what we mean by flexible federalism. The provinces and 
territories will have the opportunity to shape the design and deliver 
the new active employment measures in order to achieve maximum 
results.
<P>
	We look forward to achieving mutually agreeable arrangements 
with our provincial and territorial partners. The agreements will 
emphasize results. They will underscore our responsibilities to 
each other, to employers and to the men and women who pay the 
employment insurance premiums that will fund these measures.
<P>
	The transition to this new partnership must be smooth and 
effective. We will carry it out in a way that ensures our clients' 
needs are met. We will ensure there is no interruption of these 
services to Canadians.
<P>
	Transitional employment measures will be delivered through 
human resource centres of Canada or community based services 
until new federal-provincial-territorial arrangements are in place.
<P>
	Some Government of Canada employees may see their work 
shift to another employer through these new agreements. In such 
cases the transfer of employees in keeping with established 
government policies will be a very important aspect of our 
negotiations. We expect provinces and territories will want to take 
on many of these experienced employees. They are people who 
know their community and regional labour markets well. The 
Government of Canada is absolutely committed to ensuring the 
rights of our employees will be fully respected.
<P>
	I believe this proposal of the Government of Canada is a new 
page in the evolution of the Canadian federation. The door is now 
open to more efficient, effective and flexible approaches that will 
help more unemployed Canadians find work, and that is our 
objective.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to begin by pointing out that we have just received the 
document on this proposal. Obviously, then, I cannot react to 
something I have just had for a couple of hours, but I will react to 
the minister's statement.
<P>
	I must say that there is no assurance in the minister's statement 
that the Quebec consensus will find a response in the proposal. 
There is no assurance, because the key intentions it expresses are, 
first of all, to withdraw from manpower training but with no 
mention whatsoever of compensation and, second, to share the 
administration of active measures, whereas all of the major Quebec 
stakeholders have been unanimous in demanding total control over 
these active measures, their administration, planning and delivery, 
via other organizations if necessary, as has often been done in 
Quebec in the past.
<P>
	The reason Quebec is demanding total control is rooted in its 
own experience. Some of the measures contained in this 
legislation-need we call it the Employment Insurance Act when it 
is not yet in effect?-have already been tried in Quebec over a 
number of years by one government after another. Quebec's 
assessment of the experiment certainly does not match the federal 
government's opinion; otherwise it would not have made a 
proposal calling for this to be the approach used.
<P>
	The Quebec government's proposal of January 18 was therefore 
based on the input of all of the stakeholders, institutions and groups 
in Quebec constituting the SociÃ©tÃ© quÃ©becoise de la main-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3167"> 3167 </A></B>
<P>
d'oeuvre, and reflects their experience, consensus, and concern for 
efficiency and the best use of workers' and employers' funds.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	I must point out that this consensus in Quebec has been 
expressed long before today, even before the election of the Liberal 
Party, I would say. Since that party has been in power, we have 
repeatedly asked when, given the urgency of the situation, given 
the high unemployment levels, given the poverty levels, Quebec 
could finally have control over all of the means to help its ordinary 
citizens.
<P>
	In the statement, the fact that there is no mention at any time of 
compensation for the withdrawal from manpower training is a 
source of great concern. We must, however, accept and 
acknowledge that finally there seems to be some openness to 
negotiation. It will be looked into, but I must again repeat that there 
is great concern. Our concern is great because, this time, there is no 
pretence of any transfer arrangement relating to the active 
measures as a whole. Yet the consensus in Quebec demands this, 
and strongly.
<P>
	I would point out that much time was needed, that this is not a 
response to Quebec's demands, that there is nothing in this 
proposal which points to any recognition of the distinct character of 
Quebec, but we take note of the proposal nevertheless. I personally 
am most anxious to read it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the minister for his courtesy in giving us overnight 
advance notice of this initiative of the government.
<P>
	This is a hesitant baby step in the right direction. It is something 
that Canadians from coast to coast have been urging on the 
government for some time. We have been trying to get the 
government to consider moving responsibility closer to the people 
being served in all aspects of governance and this is yet another 
aspect of governance that needs to be moved closest to the people it 
serves.
<P>
	In my opinion, this responsibility should be vested in the 
provincial governments. On the surface this appears to be, once 
again, the government buying Canadians with our own money.
<P>
	The UI fund is a tax, a payroll tax off the top of every working 
Canadian's income. This year the fund surplus will be in the region 
of $5 billion and $2 billion will be put back into labour market 
training. Some serious questions need to be asked about access to 
the $2 billion in labour market training. Will that access be 
restricted to those with attachment to the labour market? What 
happens with people who have never had a job or have never been 
able to get into the workforce in the first  place? Is this a provincial 
responsibility? Is it a shared responsibility? When a citizen goes 
into an office, will he or she be told that because they are 
unemployed, go through that door, not this door.
<P>
	The number one concern of Canadians from coast to coast is 
unemployment. My constituency is one of the wealthiest 
constituencies in the country. The number one concern of people 
there is employment and security of employment for themselves 
and their children. The government needs to get its act together. 
The responsibility belongs to the provinces. There must be one 
door.
<P>
	I applaud the fact that we are getting out of useless federal job 
sharing programs that really do not achieve anything. They just do 
not work. In my view, we need to ensure that the provinces clearly 
understand it is their responsibility to provide training for their 
citizens.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	It is the federal government's responsibility to ensure that the 
labour standards across the country provide for portability of 
people, of circumstance and of qualifications. It is our job to have 
vision. When we are addressing the global economy in which we 
find ourselves, we should be leaders. It is our job to ensure that a 
national long range vision is present. The minister should consider 
this a very important and strategic part of the federal deliberations 
but the responsibility and the accountability goes to the provinces.
<P>
	If we end up with a situation where the provinces are able to 
point their fingers at the feds and say, it is their job, and the feds are 
able to point their fingers at the provinces and say, it is their job, 
nothing will be achieved. We need clear, defined accountability in 
this whole process.
<P>
	Second, we must address the fact that the funds for this program 
come out of the wages of people who are employed. Payroll taxes 
are perhaps the number one killer of jobs in the country. When 
business is not increasing, when it is stagnant, the only room for 
most employers to find additional revenue is by laying off people. 
When taxes go up, employment goes down. Everyone knows that. 
We have to make sure that payroll taxes go down.
<P>
	There are other areas. This may or may not be the appropriate 
place and time to address them but when we talk about stability in 
our communities, perhaps our vision should be on the impact of 
part time work on the country. When families are able to get only 
part time work, when both parents are holding down two or three 
part time jobs, how can they have a sense of community or 
involvement? How can they have a foundation from which to go 
forward or to provide parenting to their children?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3168"> 3168 </A></B>
<P>
	Why do we have such catastrophic problems with youth crimes? 
They seem to be unsolvable. However, how can parents be parents 
if they have to hold down two or three part time jobs?
<P>
	Perhaps we should be looking beyond the surface of some of 
these matters and ask what is our responsibility to the communities 
of which we are all part? As we get further into this and start 
looking into the nitty-gritty of the employment situation, we will 
start to address the people who are chronically unemployed or who 
chronically find themselves in part time employment, particularly 
the young.
<P>
	Another suggestion that I would like to bring to the table is with 
regard to employment insurance. A fundamental decision has to be 
made about whether employment insurance is employment 
insurance or whether it is a redistribution of income and wealth. If 
it is truly employment insurance, then other avenues should be 
looked at to find the funds necessary for training, particularly with 
the requirement in this legislation as it is now for attachment and 
previous attachment to the labour force.
<P>
	People who are not part of the labour force now will be asking 
how they can get a foot in the door. That question needs to be 
answered with a very strong foundation so that people have a sense 
of hope and confidence in the future.
<P>
	I look forward to working with the minister as we pursue these 
questions over the next year. I appreciate that the minister has 
invited me and others to work with the department in this area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I wonder if I might have the

The current Nuclear Liability Act only obliges operators to buy $75 
million worth of insurance coverage. The American equivalent is 
$7 billion. To fix that problem I have corrected the figure in the 
Nuclear Liability Act by the rise in the cost of living. I have also 
included Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. as an operator which 
would be required to buy insurance, something which it is not 
required to do. I believe it is time the nuclear industry came into the

	In particular, bears are at risk in North America. Some 
environmentalists say that each year in North America up to 20,000 
bears are killed for their body parts, specifically their gall bladders. 
That figure may well be exaggerated but provincial authorities do 
recognize there is a significant trade in this kind of thing and it does 
put pressure on bear populations. Last October several businesses 
and people were charged with trafficking in black bear and grizzly 
bear parts.
<P>
	My bill would not stop legitimate hunters but it would prohibit

<BLOCKQUOTE>That given the Prime Minister's 1993 election commitment ``that there will

<BLOCKQUOTE>That given the Prime Minister's 1993 election commitment ``that there will

<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	That is the motion. By the way, that last quote came from page 
91 of the Liberal red book.
<P>
	The promise the Prime Minister made during the election 
campaign was very bold. I think the Prime Minister knew exactly 
what he was doing. At that time Canadians were very cynical about 
politics, federal politics in particular given the record of the 
Mulroney government. When the Prime Minister made the promise 
that he would not break any promises, he played on the hopes 
people had for a new government. People were desperate for some 
integrity in government. They wanted to believe that a new Prime 
Minister would instil some integrity and that they would be able to 
believe what the Prime Minister was saying.
<P>
	How disappointed Canadians must be today. How disappointed 
they must be after the red book made all kinds of pronouncements 
about the promises the government would fulfil. Although there are 
many, the most obvious example is the breaking of the promise 
with respect to integrity. I point in particular to the recent 
resignation of Sheila Copps, the former Deputy Prime Minister 
who is now pursuing re-election in Hamilton East.
<P>
	I want to talk a bit about the sequence of events which led up to 
the breaking of that promise. I must underline how important it is 
as politicians that during an election  or at any time when we make 
statements about what we propose to do, people regard those words 
very seriously. We need to take these matters seriously. We cannot 
just hope that people are going to say: ``Oh, it is just another 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3171"> 3171 </A></B>
<P>
politician making a promise. We do not really take it very seriously 
anyway so if they break it, it is no big deal''. We have to do 
something to restore the confidence people had at one point in 
politicians. I will talk about the events which led up to the breaking 
of the GST promise.
<P>
	In the three or four years between the time the GST was 
introduced and the time the present government came to power we 
heard over and over again from members across the way when they 
were in opposition that they would scrap the GST. They would kill 
the GST. The GST would be eliminated. We did not hear it just 
from the former Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps, although she 
went on national television and said it. We also heard it from the 
Prime Minister himself who said: ``I hate it. I will kill it''. We 
heard it from the finance minister. We heard it from the current 
human resources development minister. We heard it from many 
backbenchers across the way. The promise was made by many 
people.
<P>
	Subsequent to that, about a month before the election, the red 
book came out. It was distributed to about 70,000 people. It 
certainly did not get the distribution the Deputy Prime Minister's 
remarks received on national television. That document said that 
the GST would be harmonized, or would be replaced rather, with 
something that was equivalent in terms of the revenue it would 
generate.
<P>
	Now we have a new broken promise to deal with. Subsequent to 
that the finance minister introduced a harmonization agreement in 
Atlantic Canada, along with other sundry rule changes, which will 
actually increase the amount of revenue that goes to the 
government. In fact it could increase by as much as a billion dollars 
a year. Again, that promise is being broken. Again, the government 
is not living up to its word.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	I want to take the point a little further. Two months ago the 
finance minister said the government was not raising taxes and 
would not raise taxes. He was talking about personal and corporate 
taxes but I point out that although he is living up to the letter of his 
word, he is not living up to the spirit of his word.
<P>
	Since the government came to power it has raised taxes and 
increased revenues in various different ways to the tune of $10.5 
billion. That is unbelievable. Two months ago the finance minister 
said they were not raising taxes.
<P>
	What did the minister do after that? He effectively raised taxes in 
Atlantic Canada. Before the House broke last week the 
Government of Nova Scotia revealed that the new harmonized GST 
in Atlantic Canada was to cost  Nova Scotia consumers $84 
million. That is another broken promise and a breach of integrity.
<P>
	The finance minister lived up to the letter of his word but he did 
not live up to the spirit of his word. The government deceived 
Canadians in the budget by saying it was not raising taxes. That is 
absolutely untrue. Nova Scotians will pay more and anybody who 
deals in used goods will pay more. It is to be a billion dollars a year 
in extra revenue to the government.
<P>
	How the government can say it is somehow fulfilling a promise 
is beyond me. However, we have the Prime Minister who is still to 
this day saying they have met their GST promise and that it was 
only the former deputy prime minister who overstepped the bounds 
and went too far. I cannot believe he truthfully believes that in his 
heart. The Prime Minister knows that somehow Canadians do not 
buy this. Even if the finance minister lives up to the letter of his 
word he is not living up to the spirit.
<P>
	Deception takes many forms. Sometimes deception is not lying 
to people. Sometimes deception is withholding the truth, which is 
what the government has done over and over again.
<P>
	I wish I could say it ends with the GST promise, but it does not. 
There are many other instances. I refer to page 95 of the red book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In particular, a Liberal government will appoint an independent ethics 
counsellor to advise both public officials and lobbyists in the day to day 
application of the code of conduct for public officials. The ethics counsellor 
will be appointed after consultation with the leaders of all parties in the House 
of Commons and will report directly to Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Has that promise been fulfilled? The answer of course is no. 
What do we have today? We have a situation in which the defence 
minister is embroiled in a controversy. He is alleged, although it 
goes beyond alleged because he has acknowledged it, to have given 
$100,000 to a former campaign worker, broken up into small 
contracts so he could get around the rule that contracts over 
$30,000 have to be tendered. We have called for the ethics 
counsellor to be brought in.
<P>
	What has happened? The ethics counsellor has not been brought 
in because the government did not fulfil its promise. It broke its 
promise to make the ethics counsellor accountable to Parliament. 
The ethics counsellor is a lapdog for the Prime Minister. He 
answers only to the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister refuses 
to bring him in to do a proper investigation into this matter. This is 
another example of a broken promise. I want to talk about another 
broken promise.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	One of the promises in the red book is: ``We will examine such 
programs with the objective of reducing waste and inefficiency and 
promoting economic growth. Expenditure reductions will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3172"> 3172 </A></B>
<P>
achieved by cancelling  unnecessary programs, streamlining 
processes and eliminating duplication''.
<P>
	If the government is so efficient at reducing waste, I wonder if 
members across the way can tell me why last year the Department 
of Human Resources Development gave $105,000 to the Canadian 
Bankers Association. That is the organization that promotes the 
bank industry. If my memory is correct, the banks made about $5 
billion in profits last year. I heard yesterday or this morning that the 
Royal Bank posted a quarterly profit of $324 million.
<P>
	Why is it that when the banks are making $5 billion and the 
government says that it will reduce waste, we are giving banks 
$105,000 of taxpayer money? That somehow defies logic. How 
does the former deputy prime minister explain that when she is 
campaigning in Hamilton East?
<P>
	Hamilton East is a working class neighbourhood. People there 
are probably wondering about the profits made by the banks. When 
Sheila Copps comes knocking on their doors, when they hear her 
government has given $105,000 to the bank industry and they have 
heard the banks made $5 billion, I wonder how she answers their 
questions. I wonder how she would answer a question when going 
door to door about all the money the government gave to the 
Canadian Bar Association, $277,000. The government promised in 
the red book it would get rid of all that waste.
<P>
	The government gave $277,000 to the Canadian Bar 
Association. Does that not seem odd? The association received 
$20,000 from its buddies in the justice department and 
approximately $250,000 from CIDA, of all places. I expect that 
lawyers, some of the most well paid professionals in the country, 
would be able to afford to fund their own lobby organization. I 
would not have thought the Liberal government would have to give 
them $277,000. Another broken promise.
<P>
	The government cannot get the message that people do not want 
it to spend money on organizations like the Canadian Bar 
Association and the Canadian Bankers Association when we keep 
going further into debt, when we are cutting social programs and 
when people are really suffering. Yet the government continues to 
spend on wasteful projects like those. Another broken promise.
<P>
	I would think lawyers already benefit enough from the 
government. We have 36,000 challenges before the tax courts 
today, which should keep lawyers plenty busy. They do not need 
any more help from the federal government.
<P>
	I point to another waste issue. Recently the auditor general 
reported that a $2 billion family trust had been transferred to the 
United States from Canada without any Canadian tax being paid. 
That is odd. The government said it is committed to ensuring there 
is no waste. That is a waste. There are tens of millions of  dollars in 
taxes that should have been paid on that to the Canadian treasury, 
but all that money escaped.
<P>
	The government will argue that was before it was in power, 
which is very true, but why did it not lift a finger to close the 
loophole? Why is it waiting for all the horses to get through the 
barn door before it closes it? Why is it allowing people with big 
money, people with all kinds of ability to navigate through 
loopholes and complex regulations to transfer millions and billions 
of dollars out of the country? By doing that it is ensuring that 
ordinary people like the steel workers in Hamilton and farmers in 
my riding, fishermen on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts have to pay 
taxes to make up for it. Why are the Liberals doing that? It is 
another promise from the red book blatantly broken.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	I wonder how Sheila Copps would answer that? Unfortunately 
we do not know because Sheila Copps will not come to any all 
candidate forums. Sheila Copps will not take calls from her 
constituents when she is on talk shows. I guess we have to talk 
about it in here. Hopefully when she goes door to door people will 
ask her some of those questions.
<P>
	A major promise the government made during the election 
campaign was jobs, jobs, jobs. I wonder if people remember during 
the election campaign when the now Prime Minister pounded Kim 
Campbell for saying she did not think there was any prospect that 
the job picture would improve before the year 2000. I think a lot 
people will remember that. It was a fairly prominent headline in the 
news.
<P>
	Recently the Prime Minister said in Calgary and in the House ``I 
guess we will have to live with high levels of unemployment''. At 
the time of the election he said Kim Campbell was wrong. He 
suggested that somehow things were to be much better under the 
Liberal government.
<P>
	What is the situation today? Today there are 1.4 million 
unemployed Canadians. There are approximately 13 million people 
in the workforce. One third are underemployed. One quarter are 
nervous about losing their jobs. As a result of all of that the 
economy suffers because there is so much uncertainty about the 
future.
<P>
	The point is the government in many different ways implied that 
somehow things would be radically better than they were under the 
Conservatives. As I pointed out before, deceit has many different 
faces and sometimes it is not a blatant lie, it is a withholding of the 
truth. The government again has broken its promise of jobs, jobs, 
jobs.
<P>
	When we look at the numbers there are actually 4,000 more 
unemployed young people today than there were in 1993 when this 
government took power. I cannot help but wonder how the Liberals 
are saying they are keeping their promises on the job issue, as some 
members did a moment ago. They have absolutely not done that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3173"> 3173 </A></B>
<P>
	The debt has climbed, interest rates have climbed, taxes have 
climbed and course unemployment climbs. The people over there 
have added $120 billion to the debt; $10.5 billion in new taxes 
and revenue measures since this government came to power. That 
not only ultimately kills jobs, it prevents jobs from being created 
because there is much less money in the economy and so people 
are not able to start businesses.
<P>
	I have argued on may different fronts that the government has 
repeatedly broken promises and it does it without even batting an 
eye. It took overwhelming public opinion to force the deputy prime 
minister to resign. The Prime Minister denies there are any 
problems. I put to the House that the government has done a 
terrible job of fulfilling its promises and should be punished in the 
byelection in Hamilton East.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I do not 
know whether to cry or to laugh. Today we could have had the 
opportunity to debate a very serious manner, the business of 
looking after the Canadian people, and at the same time the 
opposition could bring forward suggestions and ideas. Instead we 
have a nonsense motion which really does not do anything except 
signify to the Canadian public and to members of Parliament, on 
this side at least, that the old Tory party is back.
<P>
	There are two children of the Conservative Party on that side of 
the House. The reason the Bloc was created was because its 
members were not happy with Brian Mulroney so another party 
was formed. The reason the Reform Party was created was because 
its members were not happy with Brian Mulroney's Conservative 
Party so they created another party.
<P>
	Only one Reform member was around in the Mulroney years. 
The Reform movement was very concerned about the Conservative 
Party and where the right wing was going so it started its own party. 
During the process of becoming a new party those members said 
they would be different. That was one of the major promises of the 
Reform Party during the last election. They said they would come 
to the House of Commons to change things.
<P>
	I have been in the House almost eight years and I have seen 
many interesting politicians come and go. I have seen many 
interesting motions from the opposition. However, I have never 
seen a motion as difficult as this one is to be serious about. We 
should be sad. I will try not to laugh because we have to try to bring 
some points forward today. I will do that because it is important for 
the Canadian public to see how ridiculous the reformed 
Conservative Party has become and how much disarray there is 
within the party.
<P>
	I will spend some time talking about the government's record as 
it relates to job creation and the economy. That is important. The 
member opposite just finished telling us that the economy has not 
improved, that the economy is falling apart, that the economy 
under the government has not made any significant improvements. 
I want to put on the record some factual information, not simply 
rhetoric.
<P>
	Before I do that I would like to have a bit of fun. It is important 
for people to know just how bad the Reform Party has become as 
the new child of the Conservative Party.
<P>
	I recall during the last election campaign, when I ran against the 
Reform Party for the first time, that its members said they would 
come to the House to be different. They were going to represent 
their constituents and they were going to have all sorts of free 
votes. We know that the leader of the third party does not allow free 
votes. They pretend they do, but you never see any major free votes 
over there. You get the odd person who votes against the party. 
When a member votes against the party, their seats keep going 
backward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> If you are going to speak, tell the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> The member who is chirping in his seat used to be a 
lot closer to the front. He moved to the back, as he must have had 
the odd occasion to vote against his leader.
<P>
	That was one promise which the Reform Party made. When we 
run in the next election we will be able to say that they are free to 
vote with their constituents, but, quite frankly, we know that the 
leader of the third party muzzles his members.
<P>
	Speaking of muzzling, we now know that the party is very 
similar to the Tory party of Brian Mulroney. A few members have 
been placed in the penalty box. They were muzzled because they 
were too extreme. If a member of the Reform Party wants to be 
extreme, let him be extreme. Quite frankly, that is the philosophy 
of the party. That is what the party projects out on the hustings. I 
have heard that on many occasions from the members who were 
booted out by the party because of things they have said about 
certain individuals in society.
<P>
	The member, when he made his speech, continued to suggest, in 
sort of a roundabout way, that somebody is on the take and that 
there is some sort of conspiracy going on. That is the theory I heard 
during the election campaign from the Reform candidate.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	This member has followed through, saying that there are evil 
people out there who are running the government and who do not 
care about the people of Canada. After hearing statements like that, 
that is why the people in Canada are cynical. Had he taken the facts 
and said this is what I am disappointed about, this is what the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3174"> 3174 </A></B>
<P>
government can improve, and talk about it, then it would be a 
reasonable debate.
<P>
	We could have a debate on what the Reform Party would do 
about the GST. When I was in opposition we had that debate. It 
would be a good debate. I would love to have a discussion about 
taxation and about what could do done differently.
<P>
	All the member wants to talk about is poor old Sheila Copps, 
how she made a mistake, how terrible it is, how deceiving it is. Yes, 
she has paid a price. She has admitted that she was wrong. She has 
admitted that she went further than the red book.
<P>
	I campaigned on the red book. I can tell members that my little 
Reform friends in Kenora-Rainy River spent about two months 
trying to figure out whether I said something I was not supposed to 
say about the GST. My friends in the press have come back to me 
and said that I must have followed the red book very closely 
because I am pretty clean. They have spent weeks trying to figure it 
out.
<P>
	Many of us on this side ran on the red book. We knew changes 
had to be made to the GST but in this place, like everywhere else, 
people make mistakes.
<P>
	The member suggested that the government has broken all its 
promises. We are human and err. We are willing to admit that we 
make mistakes. However, the member stated that everybody on this 
side has become as bad as Brian Mulroney. I was here. I know why 
the Tories have only two seats. I know why there are two children 
of the Tory party on that side of the House: one is a separatist party 
and one is so far right wing that its policies are extreme because 
that is the way it is on the far right. Those are the facts and the 
reality.
<P>
	Remember also there is the odd moderate in that party. One was 
kicked out and it has a couple more to go and I suspect it will not be 
long before they are out. One of them is laughing across the way. 
He is probably closest to being a moderate.
<P>
	Reform will get rid of them because they do not fit into where 
this party is going. I look forward to the Vancouver convention 
when Reform makes it quite clear to the few moderates there are 
that they have to go. They just do not fit into the mould of the 
Reform Party, which is the very cynical view of how politicians 
and Canada work. It is unfortunate that it continues to portray that 
as the economy gets better and better.
<P>
	I have one last little point to make about what makes me angry 
about this silly little motion we are debating today. The leader of 
the third party has a suit allowance paid by taxpayers' money. 
Remember how different these members were going to be. Heaven 
knows, my wife would like it if I had a suit allowance paid by the 
taxpayers of Canada. She does the shopping. If you do not like my 
suit, Madam Speaker, it is my wife's fault.
<P>
	I am very disappointed in the member across the way who 
portrays his party as so sanctimonious and lily white, as a party that 
has never done anything the public would disagree with. 
Meanwhile, the leader of the third party is down at Moore's 
shopping for free suits at taxpayers' expense.
<P>
	That is the fun I thought I would have in relating to the people of 
Canada why the Reform Party is in such disarray. It is pretty 
obvious to me when we see a motion like this that this party is 
running out of steam. Its members are looking for things to use to 
criticize the government, but they cannot find them because things 
are starting to improve in the economy.
<P>
	As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, my role is to talk about job creation and the 
improvements that occur in the economy because of the economic 
policies of this government.
<P>
	The government has had to make some very difficult choices. 
We admit that. We came in after the right wing government of 
Brian Mulroney. The folks across the way voted for but did not 
want to get branded with the mistakes made Brian Mulroney and 
his Tory party, therefore they started their own party. They do not 
want to take responsibility for that mess. I can understand that. I 
would not want to be part of that party either if I had to admit that I 
voted for those folks on a number of occasions. I can tell members 
from experience that I never voted any other way, but one way.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	I do not have to pretend that I flip-flop on which party I belong 
to. It is very clear to me that the reason why that party exists is 
because its members did not want to take responsibility for the 
Mulroney years and I quite frankly do not blame them.
<P>
	The Liberals came into a total mess, after a right wing party had 
said it was going to be fiscally responsible, good managers of the 
economy, that it would deal with the deficit and the debt. Its biggest 
issue during the 1984 campaign was that the Liberals could not 
manage the economy. When we came in there was a $42 billion 
annual deficit. We have a huge debt. We know we are going to have 
to deal with that and we are working toward that.
<P>
	Since coming into power the deficit has been reduced by $25 
billion. Members opposite are not saying: ``That is pretty darn 
good''. When the right wingers were in power the deficit never 
went down, it always went up. After three years the government 
will be able to show the Canadian public at the end of this fiscal 
year that the deficit is down to $17 billion.
<P>
	I cannot guarantee this because I do not know how the economy 
is going to react, but I am very sure that if the economy continues at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3175"> 3175 </A></B>
<P>
the rate it is going by 1998-99 the budget will be balanced. What 
are those folks across the  way going to say then? Are they going 
to do what they are doing now and say: ``They are terrible 
managers''?
<P>
	It is because of the policies of this government that we have now 
proven-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Talk about the debt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Madam Speaker, the next issue is the one that my 
chirpy friend is talking about and that is the debt.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the Liberals are going to deal with the 
debt. We have a strategy to deal with it because it is a major issue. 
We cannot deal with the debt until we deal with the deficit, get our 
fiscal house in order and clean up the mess of the Mulroney years.
<P>
	When I sat in opposition there were 42 cabinet ministers over 
here. They took up two and a half rows of seats. They all had their 
fancy limos. They all ran around creating programs. We have come 
in with a very streamlined and clean government which is working 
toward improving the economy. I want to prove that we have.
<P>
	So far I have explained to everyone in the House and across 
Canada that we have met our commitments in moving toward a 
balanced budget. We have worked very hard at that. We have had to 
make tough choices.
<P>
	If the party across the way were to be different than the Tory 
party of old, it would admit that the government has done a very 
good job as it relates to that issue, even though it has been tough. 
None of us on this side are happy when programs are cut because 
we are Liberals. Liberals like to give service to the Canadian 
people. Liberals do not rejoice when somebody is cut off. We do 
not rejoice when a program is cut because it hurts people.
<P>
	Therefore we do not spend our time running around the country 
saying: ``Man, are we ever doing a good job cutting the deficit,'' 
because it hurts. We just carry on with other areas by focusing on 
issues that we think are important.
<P>
	I want to talk about the government's record on jobs. The 
member talked about that at the end of his speech. I do not want to 
talk about it very long. It is a pretty darn good record. Quite frankly 
anybody should be proud of it. The question Canadians should ask 
is: ``Are we better off than we were before? Are we better off now 
with this government than we were under the old government? Are 
the directions, the policies and the programs of this government 
proving to be successful in going where we want to go?''
<P>
	There are key indicators that should show that. One of course is 
interest rates. They are at the lowest in 30 years. The inflation rate 
is at the lowest in 30 years. The bond raters and even the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> said that the government has really got its act together and is 
going in the right direction. That is two areas.
<P>
	The other area is job creation. Nobody in this Chamber will say 
that Liberals are happy with the unemployment rate because they 
are not. If we had our way we would like to see the unemployment 
rate down to the lowest level that it has ever been in history or at 
least lower than it has ever been in my lifetime and that is under5 per cent. We have a long way to go because the rate is still over9 per cent.
<P>
	I want to lay these facts on the table. Perhaps the Reform's 
research is not very good. If the Reform members would ask us we 
would send the facts over to them.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	Reformers continue to pretend that something is not working in 
the government as it relates to jobs and strategy but the numbers do 
not prove that. Six hundred and thirty-six thousand more Canadians 
have jobs than when we took office. That is not bad. The average 
gain in 1996 has been roughly 30,000 more jobs every month since 
December. Full time jobs were up 47,000 in April. That is the fifth 
month in a row there has been growth in jobs. Most of the increase 
in that month was in the manufacturing sector with 37,000 very 
good, high quality jobs.
<P>
	Another issue which I find very cynical about the Reform 
members, as sanctimonious as they can get, is that they pretend 
there is some sort of conspiracy over here. They just want to be 
very selective in their facts.
<P>
	Let me give the reason the unemployment rate has not gone 
down as fast as it should even though jobs have been created. The 
labour force was up 54,000 in April and up 137,000 since October 
1995. What does that mean? It means people who had quit looking 
for work over a number of years are now beginning to look for 
work and are finding work. The labour force is getting bigger 
which changes the numbers and makes it look in some cases as if 
the unemployment rate is not going down as fast as it should. The 
reason is that people are now getting so much a sense that the 
government is going in the right direction that there is hope and 
they are now looking for work more than they ever have before.
<P>
	Another statistic comes from the private sector. This is another 
indication of how well the government's policies are working. 
Twenty-three per cent of employers told Manpower Temporary 
Services, which is a private sector group that does monitoring of 
this, that they expected to increase staffing in the third quarter of 
1996. This survey found that 23 per cent of employers expected 
that they would be hiring more employees.
<P>
	In northern Ontario, 40 per cent of the employers in the Sudbury 
area expect to hire more people in this next quarter. Thirty-three 
per cent of the employers in the Thunder Bay area, which is close to 
where I am from, said they expected to hire more individuals 
because of the faith they have in the economy and because of the  
policies of this government. This comes from a private sector 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3176"> 3176 </A></B>
<P>
group which knows that growth is coming and that we have our 
fiscal house in order and the benefits are beginning to show.
<P>
	In the last budget we focused on certain areas. I could spend 
another hour talking about the nonsense motion of the Reform 
Party simply because it shows just how desperate Reformers have 
become. I know how frustrating it can be to be at the same level in 
the polls as the Conservatives were two and one-half years ago 
during the 1993 election. They were hovering around 12 per cent. 
Those were the good days. That is about where the Reformers have 
been hovering around. Sometimes they jump to 16 per cent, the odd 
time when somebody says the right thing. I can understand why 
they would get very depressed and why they would have a nonsense 
motion like this one.
<P>
	Let us remember that in the last budget we said that because we 
could not raise taxes, which we recognized, and because we knew 
we had to deal with the deficit and debt, we would have to 
repriorize some of our spending. We focused on three areas: youth, 
technology and trade. A multitude of things are going on with 
respect to youth, which I wish I had some time to talk about but I do 
not. There is also technology and trade, the Team Canada approach 
and the $20 billion worth of trade and exports we have been able to 
help employers with because of the priority we put on international 
trade. Those are the kinds of things Canadians expect us to do.
<P>
	In closing, I will tell the opposition members about this 
government's very good record and the integrity it has brought 
back to this place. I can understand how difficult it can be for right 
wingers to understand what integrity is. They had to live through 
the Brian Mulroney government and all of the scandals that I lived 
through between 1984-88 and 1988-93 when some 20-odd 
ministers had to pack their bags and wonder off. Of course they 
voted for those folks.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Let me give Reformers one bit of advice. If they are going to be 
successful as a party they are going to have to do it based on facts, 
not on fiction and not on trying to scare Canadians that this party is 
doing a bad job. Talking to my constituents and the polls prove to 
me every day that we are doing the right thing. We are improving 
people's plight every day and we are working very hard at it. We 
are not doing it overnight but we are making a difference.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
there are so many issues and so little time.
<P>
	I smelled the distinct odour of Liberal arrogance when the 
member was boasting about their standing in the polls. I remind the 
hon. member that the Conservatives were very high in the polls the 
summer before the last election and they ended up with two seats.
<P>
	The member mentioned a number of issues. He pointed out that 
the deficit has fallen by $25 billion. Will he also acknowledge that 
revenues for the government have gone up by exactly $25 billion 
and that $10.5 billion of that has come from new taxes?
<P>
	When the member was talking about how difficult it was for him 
and his colleagues to cut social programs, he did not mention how 
easy it was for them to vote themselves a very fat MP pension. A 
very fat one. They are cutting seniors benefits and benefits to 
people in Atlantic Canada, but I note he forgot to mention how 
much money he had given himself in the form of a huge MP 
pension. That was noticeable by its absence.
<P>
	Will the member acknowledge that when the debate was going 
on about my leader's $30,000 receiptable expense allowance, the 
newspaper accounts also pointed out that his leader received 
$400,000 a year from the party, absolutely unreceiptable in the 
form of an entertainment allowance? Will he acknowledge that the 
empties from that entertainment allowance would be more than 
enough to make most people happy?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Madam Speaker, the member made the exact point I 
was hoping he would make.
<P>
	I never said there was anything wrong with giving the leader a 
slush fund, if that is what they want to call it. They do not want to 
call it the suit allowance, so we can call it a slush fund, an 
entertainment allowance or whatever. I understand that as the 
leader there are many other activities involved which involve a lot 
of expense that average members of Parliament would not have to 
deal with.
<P>
	My issue is with the sanctimonious attitude of the member 
across the way. He pretends that no one in the Reform Party would 
ever have the gall to do anything like that. Just admit that there are 
certain things to being an MP that are necessary, that funds have to 
be allowed for them and then we can get off this little 
sanctimonious trip his party is on.
<P>
	I have seen this before. I come from the labour movement. I have 
listened to the NDP for years and years and years with their pie in 
the sky kind of attitude and their sanctimonious attitude toward 
how government is run. Then we brought in our good friend Bob 
Rae in Ontario where I come from. Then the people really saw what 
it was like and what the NDP was capable of doing and not doing.
<P>
	The people of Canada should be careful not to buy into this 
nonsense across the way and giving them the chance to run this 
country. They will do what Brian Mulroney did. They will do what 
Bob Rae did. They cannot give us the kinds of policies they are 
proposing without completely raising Cain and ruining Canada's 
economy. I am very fearful that someone will buy into this rhetoric.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>

<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	About my pension. The member said I got a raise in my pension. 
I have been here since 1988. I am on my eighth year. My pension 
was cut by 33 per cent. The member across the way does not have 
to worry about that because he will not get elected again and he 
does not have a pension. However I have a pension which is fine. I 
have a family. I have a young child at home and a wife who does 
not work. In this job it is pretty tough for my spouse to work when I 
am on the road. I represent one-fifth of Ontario's land mass.
<P>
	What I dislike the most is when a member stands up and suggests 
that I got a raise when in fact I got a 33 per cent cut. I am not saying 
I am underpaid, but at least be honest. If the pension is too lucrative 
for his liking, then we will give him another cut in pay. If he wants 
to work for less than we do, we will oblige him. He can send us a 
letter from his House leader and we will see what we can do 
through a private member's bill.
<P>
	My friend from North Vancouver likes to sponsor private 
members' bills that do not make much sense. Bring one in that says 
the Reform Party will work for free and we will pass it in a big 
hurry.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> In one day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> We will pass it in one day. It will not take us long. I 
would vote for it because I do not think Reformers are worth the 
money they are being paid. I know I am because I have one of the 
largest ridings in Canada. I have 80 communities, 46 reserves. I 
would like to bring my little friend from Medicine Hat on a three or 
four week trip up north on a float plane. He would come back a lot 
skinnier than he is now.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that that sanctimonious attitude is the 
reason this country is in trouble now. We are working very hard to 
clean it up. Canadians will not buy into his party's nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will add my voice to the proceedings to touch upon the 
issue of honesty within government.
<P>
	The Reform Party is also known as the son of Brian. When 
Reformers need ideas they go south of border and huddle with 
Newt Gingrich and Pat Buchanan. Then they come back thinking 
this is the United States of America. I will go beyond that to talk 
about decisions and standing by what one says and there are several 
examples.
<P>
	After the budget presentation the first person who stood up to 
applaud the budget was none other than the Reform finance critic 
from Capilano-Howe Sound. Five minutes later he was out of the 
House. Later the Reform defence critic said that the Minister of 
Finance cut too much. Still later the member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands said that we went too far. We do not know if we are cutting 
enough, if we are going too far, if we are not  going too far. 
Reformers cannot make up their minds which way to go.
<P>
	When Reform members talk about pensions it is really insulting. 
There are members in the Reform Party who are so-called double 
dipping. One of the first things we did as a government in our 
commitments was eliminate double dipping as well as the cuts 
which were mentioned earlier by my colleague.
<P>
	In Reformers' own ridings, 55 per cent of their constituents have 
stated that the Reform Party is too extreme. This is from their own 
constituents whom they say they represent. Their constituents sent 
them here to represent them. They vote against their own 
constituents. Consider the gun issue. They were sent here to vote 
against it and they voted for it. They cannot have their cake and eat 
it too.
<P>
	It is no coincidence that the Reform Party membership is down 
by 65 to 70 per cent. I ask myself why. It is simple: Nobody wants 
to be associated with the extreme views of the Reform Party. 
Nobody wants to be associated with the Newt Gingriches of this 
world who look at the esoteric picture as opposed to the global 
relationship we have.
<P>
	There are certain expenditures but they do not talk about the the 
leader of the Reform Party who has gone from the $44 a night 
Travelodge Hotel to one that is $165 per night.
<P>
	I could go on and on, but I think I have made my point. 
Reformers should be honest with the people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (QuÃ©bec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate this opportunity to speak to this well written motion 
put forward by the Reform Party. I fully agree with the motion, 
which points out the Prime Minister's Liberal government did not 
keep its many promises.
<P>
	There were frequent reports in the press about the promises that 
were made, like those the Prime Minister dared to make before the 
election. For example, the promise on free trade was abandoned, as 
well as the one on job creation. An attempt was made with the 
infrastructure program, which created a few jobs. Few jobs have 
been created since then. In fact, the government did not even keep 
its promise to make job creation the focus of its budget. On the 
contrary, everything was done to try to protect wealthy families, for 
example, rather than to help the poor, as this government took all 
kinds of measures to go after the most disadvantaged and the 
weakest, as we well know. We know all about this.
<P>
	To this we can add the famous promise to scrap the GST, which 
was not kept. Ms. Copps had to resign  because of this unkept 
promise, a promise that, unfortunately, did not bear fruit. In fact, 
her resignation seemed to mock voters. When Ms. Copps promised 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3178"> 3178 </A></B>
<P>
to resign, she was supposed to resign for real and not stand for 
re-election again the same day.
<P>
	There is much to say, and the evidence is there that this 
government is very dishonest when it comes to its promises, as 
well as very hypocritical.
<P>
	There is one promise that few people will remember, except you, 
Madam Speaker, and francophones outside Quebec. It is a promise 
the Prime Minister made in Acadia, not before the election but in 
August 1994, when he was already Prime Minister.
<P>
	Mr. ChrÃ©tien came to the Acadian convention, where he 
solemnly promised that part VII of Canada's Official Languages 
Act would be implemented. As he said himself in his August 12, 
1994 speech, he was making that promise not only as Prime 
Minister of Canada but also as the former member for BeausÃ©jour. 
Therefore, he seems to know the situation of francophones living 
outside Quebec.
<P>
	In his speech, the Prime Minister said: ``It is always a good thing 
to remember that there are over one million francophones living 
outside Quebec''. There is a minor mistake here, since we all know 
that, given the current rate of assimilation, there are no longer one 
million francophones living outside Quebec but, perhaps, only half 
of that figure.
<P>
	The Prime Minister added: ``Therefore, the federal government 
will not stop here: it will continue to protect and to promote the 
rights of French speaking minorities everywhere in Canada. This is 
one of the major principles I have defended throughout my political 
career and it will remain a priority for the government of which I 
am the leader''.
<P>
	This is a very solemn commitment. The Prime Minister then 
added that the Minister of Canadian Heritage had announced 
earlier that same day, during the same event, ``how, from now on, 
the government will ensure that all federal institutions likely to 
play a role in the development of French speaking communities 
take into account the particular needs of these communities''.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you are from Acadia and you will surely 
remember that, in making this statement, the Prime Minister 
effectively pledged to establish the implementation process for part 
VII of the 1988 Official Languages Act.
<P>
	Earlier that same day, the heritage minister had said very clearly: 
``Therefore, I am pleased to announce that cabinet has approved a 
corporate policy regarding the participation of federal institutions 
in community development, as well as a work plan''. The minister 
was also referring to part VII of the Official Languages Act, which 
had been approved in 1988, but which six years later, in 1994, 
remained an unused part in the statutes of a government claimingto be very concerned about the survival of French speaking 
communities outside Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	For those concerned with this question, it is a very serious 
problem affecting a number of communities, as we know. In 
addition, it is part of the symbol of a bilingual Canada. This is why 
the Prime Minister, of all people, has repeatedly referred to himself 
as the champion of francophones outside Quebec.
<P>
	The problem is a serious one, when you think that not only is the 
rate of assimilation of francophones outside Quebec very high, but 
it is also increasing rather than declining. The Official Languages 
Act was passed in 1969 for the very purpose of slowing down the 
assimilation of francophones.
<P>
	Another part of the Official Languages Act of 1969 was also to 
ensure that Quebec is respected as a French speaking province in 
Canada. This is another promise not kept by several prime 
ministers, including Mr. ChrÃ©tien, the current Prime Minister, but I 
will not go into that.
<P>
	Not only is the situation of francophones living outside Quebec 
precarious, but it is steadily worsening, despite the solemn 
promises made by this Prime Minister. As the minister has just 
said, separation will obviously not help matters.
<P>
	This government, as the Prime Minister and certain of his 
ministers have often done, is using francophones outside Quebec as 
pawns in a game against Quebec. He says that francophones 
outside Quebec will disappear if Quebec separates, when they are 
already disappearing because the Government of Canada, in the 
most scandalous display of hypocrisy, is doing nothing to 
implement the Official Languages Act in Canada, including Part 
VII. I could also mention other parts of the Official Languages Act, 
but the most glaring omission is Part VII.
<P>
	Reformers are not perhaps as sympathetic to francophones living 
outside Quebec as are members of the Bloc Quebecois or the 
people of Quebec. Like the people of Quebec, we respect French 
culture in Canada and it is in our interest to see that francophone 
communities, whether they are located in Canada or in the United 
States, survive. This is an obvious and fundamental principle for all 
those who respect the French culture.
<P>
	Ministers and members in this House who say that francophones 
outside Quebec are a symbol of the survival of this country should 
look at what is happening to them. Once again, not only is the rate 
of assimilation very high, but it is on the increase. This means 
therefore that the situation is not improving for francophones 
outside Quebec. There are a number of reasons for that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3179"> 3179 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand: </B>If members were a little quieter, I could talk 
to you about it. The rate of assimilation continues to climb. In 
the 20 years between 1971 and 1991, it has increased. I could 
provide official statistics from Statistics Canada, which indicate 
that this is the case in all provinces, including yours, New 
Brunswick.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Order, please. 
The hon. member has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Thank you, Madam Speaker. The rate of 
assimilation is nonetheless a serious thing, basic. Francophone 
communities outside Quebec are going through this ordeal. It is 
true. There is no doubt. Statistics confirm it very clearly.
<P>
	I could, obviously, give you the rate of assimilation in all the 
provinces outside Quebec, but you know about that, Madam 
Speaker, because you are Acadian. Assimilation is happening and 
is on the rise in all provinces outside Quebec. New Brunswick is, 
perhaps, the sole exception, with a rate of assimilation of between 8 
per cent and 10 per cent. In Ontario, for example, the rate is 35 per 
cent to 40 per cent. In western Canada, it is over 70 per cent.
<P>
	This rate of assimilation is bad, because francophone 
communities outside Quebec, the symbol of Canadian 
bilingualism, are being destroyed.
<P>
	Just last week, another Statistics Canada study was published. It 
concerns young people and indicates that there are fewer and fewer 
young francophones outside Quebec and that francophones are 
producing fewer and fewer children, thus contributing to the 
tendency of francophones living outside Quebec to disappear.
<P>
	In its report, Statistics Canada says, and I quote just one 
sentence: ``Unless the situation changes or the number of 
francophones increases through migrational activity, the size of the 
francophone population outside Quebec will decrease in the 
future''.
<P>
	This is from a study published two weeks ago by Statistics 
Canada. When Statistics Canada publishes a report, it uses neutral 
language. This marks the condemnation, so to speak, of the future 
of francophone communities outside Quebec. When young people 
leave, when there are fewer and fewer of them, when they no longer 
have access to French schools, when their numbers keep going 
down and the trend continues, this portends a very dark future for 
francophone communities.
<P>
	The government knows this. We have been saying so long 
enough. Even the spokespersons for the association of 
francophones outside Quebec said so in a report entitled ``The 
Heirs of Lord Durham''. This report is worth reading. I could even 
give a copy to the members of the Reform Party. Its subtitle in 
English is:  ``Manifesto of a vanishing people''. One paragraph at 
the beginning of the report from the association of francophones 
outside Quebec reads as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``Our dreams have been shattered. We are going through a severe 
crisis which may even have been planned and deliberately 
cultivated. Francophones outside Quebec are like a family whose 
home has been destroyed by fire. We are without shelter, our eyes 
fixed on odd belongings scattered here and there, but we are still 
alive''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That was in 1977, 20 years ago. The problem has gotten worse 
and, only two weeks ago, the FÃ©dÃ©ration des communautÃ©s 
francophones et acadienne, which published this report in 1977, 
wrote in another report: ``The FÃ©dÃ©ration des communautÃ©s 
francophones et acadienne du Canada expects elected 
parliamentarians to carry out the mandate entrusted to them by the 
Canadian people. The urgent situation faced by members of our 
communities is unacceptable. The government, and especially its 
officials, does not seem overly concerned about the fact that the 
assimilation rate increases from one census to the next''.
<P>
	This report was published by the FÃ©dÃ©ration des communautÃ©s 
francophones et acadienne after the Prime Minister made his 
solemn promise to the Acadians in August 1994.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Application of part VII of the Official Languages Act is just a 
manifestation of the government's commitment to promote the 
development of francophone communities. That is absolutely 
normal. If the Canadian government, and the Prime Minister first 
and foremost, portray themselves as the champion of francophones 
outside Quebec, committed to the survival of the French language 
in Canada and the symbol of a bilingual Canada, then they have all 
the more reason to react swiftly when the very communities which 
form the basis of this symbol are threatened with disappearance.
<P>
	The act was passed in 1988 and the Prime Minister made his 
promise in 1994. Nothing has been done in the intervening six 
years. And since the Prime Minister took office, two years ago, I 
must tell you that, with regard to enforcing part VII of the Official 
Languages Act, nothing has been done, nothing at all. That about 
sums up the action taken by the Prime Minister in terms of his 
solemn undertaking to implement part VII.
<P>
	These are not my personal observations. The facts speak for 
themselves. I read and quote the report of the commissioner of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3180"> 3180 </A></B>
<P>
official languages, who is supposed to be impartial in this matter, 
although I doubt that seriously, because it seems to me that he 
sometimes plays the government's game of covering up the fiasco 
involving  francophones outside Quebec. Time permitting, I will 
get back to this point.
<P>
	The commissioner has examined everything the government has 
done in relation to part VII. In his detailed study released this year, 
two years after the promise made by the Prime Minister before the 
Acadian congress, in August 1994, the commissioner stated that, 
according to his study, nothing indicates the existence, even after 
August 1994, of a systematic effort to ensure compliance with 
section 41, that is to say part VII, in the restructuring process of the 
government's institutions and programs. Instead, notes the 
commissioner, this restructuring was sometimes done in a way that 
reduced, instead of increasing, support to the development of 
minority official language communities.
<P>
	After solemnly promising to defend and support francophone 
communities outside Quebec, communities now confronted with a 
difficult and disastrous situation, not only did the Prime Minister of 
this country not make any effort to ensure the law was enforced, but 
the commissioner, himself almost in the Prime Minister's pocket, 
was forced to admit that nothing has been done. What is more, the 
situation has actually deteriorated.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has no right to claim to be the champion of 
francophones outside Quebec when he is not doing anything. Not 
only did he not enforce the law, but he is cutting back the resources 
allocated to programs supporting francophone communities. This 
year, in some cases, cuts in subsidies have been as high as 50 per 
cent. For some, this represents a death sentence.
<P>
	There is a francophone community in Saskatchewan and this 
community has been treated very unfairly because, as you know, 
legislation contravening the Canadian Constitution was passed in 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta, prohibiting the teaching of 
French. Several Supreme Court rulings were made, telling these 
provinces they had to respect these rights.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	When they complied with the Supreme Court's decisions, the 
provinces received certain amounts from the federal government to 
try to encourage communities to make up the ground they had lost 
over the past century.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying briefly that, in Saskatchewan, 
subsidies for francophones were cut by 50 per cent. Had I had more 
time, I would have read you the letter of a 12-year old girl. It was 
handed to me just minutes ago. This 12-year old wrote Mr. 
ChrÃ©tien, asking him: ``How can you say, Mr. Prime Minister, that 
you care about francophones outside Quebec, like us in 
Saskatchewan, when you are cutting our subsidies by 50 per cent?''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I had a 
difficult time following the member's debate based on the Reform 
motion. Nonetheless, I would like to ask him a fairly obvious 
question.
<P>
	As separatists, his party is advocating that Quebec leave Canada. 
At the same time he is spending a lot of time complaining about the 
non-existence of the French language outside Quebec.
<P>
	The province of Ontario, the province of Quebec and all other 
provinces control their educational system. Quebec controls 
immigration. It also controls labour markets, labour market 
adjustment and training. We are now in the process of transferring 
that area to the province of Quebec.
<P>
	The province of Quebec has all the tools to protect its French 
language. The premier of Quebec has stated categorically that he 
would protect minority rights in Quebec, which means that English 
would still be a part of Quebec's culture, unless they are suggesting 
everyone who is English leave.
<P>
	I would like to know from the member, as a separatist, where he 
is coming from. Is there a fear that French will disappear if Quebec 
stays in Canada? Is there a fear that unless things are done 
differently the French fact in North America will not exist? Can he 
explain to me what will be better under a separate country as far as 
the ability to keep the French fact in North America?
<P>
	Why does Quebec not have a policy to help French speaking 
people in the rest of Canada? Why does Quebec not seem to have 
an interest in French people outside Quebec? Why does it continue 
to tell its population that in provinces such as Ontario there are no 
French people? We know that is not the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Madam Speaker, the member is from 
Kenora-Rainy River. Not many francophones live in that area of 
Ontario but there are francophones in Ontario, especially in 
northern Ontario.
<P>
	What I noticed in what he said is there is a lot of 
misunderstanding with respect to language laws. That is probably 
one of the major problems in the country. People do not really 
understand the application of language laws and the situation of 
francophones versus anglophones.
<P>
	The member said francophones in Ontario control their school 
boards. That is not true. Francophones in Ontario have been 
fighting for years to get adequate schools. Only recently have they 
been enabled to control four school commissions out of a possible 
15. Ontario is very resistant to the survival of the French language. 
It could have been a province that had been bilingual like New 
Brunswick. There are 5 per cent to 10 per cent francophones in 
Ontario. Ontario has mistreated the francophones more than other 
provinces because of the number of francophones living in Ontario. 
Francophones of Ontario do not control their school boards.
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Coming back to the members questions of what will happen to 
francophones if Quebec leaves and why Quebec does not help 
francophones, we cannot have the situation both ways. 
Francophones outside of Quebec are being assimilated at a very 
dangerous rate. They are losing their schools, they are losing the 
foundations of their survival in a country that is said to be 
bilingual.
<P>
	Quebec also suffers from the discrimination which is practised 
against francophones. One form of discrimination, particularly in 
Ontario, is that francophones cannot automatically provide funds 
for their own schooling. In other words, whenever they pay school 
taxes those go automatically to English language schools.
<P>
	If you are a francophone and you really want to have French 
schooling for your children you have to go out of your way and 
assure yourself that your tax dollars are to be served for French 
language schools. For example, in Ontario in a business with 15 
employees, 14 of whom are francophone, where do the school tax 
dollars go? They go to the English school board, not to the French 
school board.
<P>
	There is a form of discrimination against francophones, 
translated in Quebec as well. Everyone knows Quebec has a long 
history of discrimination with respect to its survival as a French 
culture. That is proof and the reason Quebec has come to the 
conclusion that the French language is not respected in so-called 
bilingual Canada. It is proof that Francophone rights throughout 
Canada have never been respected. Even today francophones rights 
are not respected according to the charter of rights and freedoms of 
1982, article 23.
<P>
	After 15 years every province in Canada should have granted 
proper schooling and control of school boards to francophones, but 
that has not been done. It has not been done in B.C., in Ontario or in 
Newfoundland, despite the fact we are most likely to pass a motion 
that will provide for the premier of Newfoundland to change the 
school system. He has not spoken about granting the rights to 
francophones to control their own school system. That is against 
the Constitution. These are provinces that have not respected the 
Constitution of Canada in granting rights to francophones, and that 
is a serious problem.
<P>
	It is natural that because the situation is so disastrous Quebec 
looks at its own survival as a French language and culture, as they 
are far from being guaranteed.
<P>
	There are other reasons but one cannot stand in the House and 
say Quebec is not trying to do the utmost to help the survival of 
francophone communities. Quite the contrary. That is why we are 
working for sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, the member is wrong 
when he says you cannot put your tax dollars toward a French 
school. I have a house in Ottawa. I bought it a couple of years ago. I 
put my tax dollars  toward a French separate school system. They 
came to the house and asked which system I wanted to be under and 
I put it there. The member is factually wrong and should stop 
saying that.
<P>
	If the member is so concerned about bilingualism nationally why 
is it that Quebec is not bilingual? Quite frankly, it is grossly unfair 
to suggest we have a bilingual country but New Brunswick is the 
only bilingual place, and Quebec is not.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> A very short 
answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Madam Speaker, there is no such thing as a 
short answer to that comment. Canada is not a bilingual country. 
The public service in Ottawa is not a bilingual public service. 
Ottawa is the capital of the country and it is not a bilingual town.
<P>
	I might have committed an error with respect to the school taxes. 
What I was trying to say is that in Ontario you can provide your tax 
dollars to the French school system. I am not saying the contrary. It 
is just that you have to go out of your way to assure yourself those 
tax dollars are put into the French language school system, 
otherwise they go automatically to the English school system. It is 
discriminatory in Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to be speaking today in support of this motion which 
severely criticizes the government because it does give me the 
opportunity to talk about all the broken promises.
<P>
	I bring up some matters mentioned by the member for 
Kenora-Rainy River. He mentioned the importance of voters 
selecting a party based on facts, not fiction. Let us get something 
very clear. Fifty-one of fifty-two Reform MPs in the House gave up 
their right to any pension. Therefore nobody can point a finger at 
us. All of the greed is on the other side of the House.
<P>
	I am getting a bit sick of having my constituents attacked as 
racist, bigoted, homophobic, extremists or any other derogatory 
adjective these Liberals keep bringing up. Just because my 
constituents do not believe in Liberal tax and spend policies does 
not mean they are intolerant. Every time the member puts a label 
on us or our policies, which incidentally have not changed since the 
1993 election, he is attacking our constituents. More than two 
million people, 20 per cent of the voters of Canada, voted Reform 
in the last election. Therefore every time he gets up arrogantly to 
use those labels I suggest he give a little thought to what he is 
doing.
<P>
	I continue with the latest set of broken promises from the 
government. Canadians will remember that about a week ago the 
Prime Minister in western Canada said Canadians will have to live 
with high levels of unemployment. By admitting failure on the job 
front the  Prime Minister has confirmed that neither he nor any of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3182"> 3182 </A></B>
<P>
his government employed for life colleagues have the slightest idea 
how real jobs are created.
<P>
	The Prime Minister claimed during the 1993 election campaign 
that his $6 billion job creation infrastructure project would create 
all sorts of wonderful jobs and we would return to the days of low 
unemployment. He had this theory that all the people employed by 
the program would spend the money in their communities and that 
this would then reduce unemployment.
<P>
	However, anyone with business experience could see that the 
plan could not work from day one. The reason was the government 
was not creating long term, meaningful jobs. It was buying jobs 
using taxpayers money and borrowed money, and those sorts of 
jobs are only short term.
<P>
	Frankly, if running deficits and accumulating a $583 billion debt 
could create jobs we would each have at least three by now. Instead 
the overspending has led to punitive levels of taxation. It has driven 
businesses out of the country. It has reduced the amount of 
disposable income in the pockets of consumers. Debt and deficits 
have caused unemployment. Until the people on the other side of 
the House-and we can laugh at this right now-come to grips with 
that we will not make any progress.
<P>
	Although governments cannot themselves create meaningful 
jobs, they can create the climate that permits private enterprises, 
the private sector, to create those jobs. The steps to success would 
require the federal government to balance its budget as quickly as 
possible so that those who are to be affected by the changes can 
adjust as quickly as possible and then immediately get into tax 
reductions to put more money into the pockets of consumers. With 
that money in their pockets, consumers will spend more, 
stimulating the demand for products, increasing the demand for 
jobs and subsequently lowering the unemployment level.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	These steps were the foundation of Reform's zero in three plan 
for balancing the budget, which we used during the 1993 election 
campaign. We are three years down stream from that now. If the 
government had taken our plan the day it came to office, we would 
today be running surpluses and arguing about what to do with the 
surplus money instead of arguing which social program we are to 
cut next.
<P>
	We would not be talking about disassembling CPP and cutting 
the transfers to medicare. We would have a surplus and would be 
talking about enhancing those programs.
<P>
	I come from New Zealand. New Zealand politicians were forced 
by a fiscal crisis in 1984 to take exactly the steps I just detailed. 
Today the New Zealand unemployment rate is below 6 per cent. It 
has large  budget surpluses. It is applying those surpluses to 
expanded health care programs, better social programs, and at the 
same time workers this week received a $100 per month reduction 
in income taxes.
<P>
	Imagine if the Minister of Finance had been able to stand in the 
House in his last budget and announce a $100 per month reduction 
in income taxes. The government side is always paying lip service 
to eliminating and reducing poverty. The best way to make that 
happen would be to get taxation down so that there is more money 
in the pockets of consumers.
<P>
	New Zealand has proven that a dollar in the hands of an investor, 
a business person or a consumer will be spent more wisely and will 
create more jobs than that dollar in the hands of anyone on the other 
side of the House. We can have jobs, jobs, jobs if we want them but 
first we need to get a few MPs in the House who understand how 
jobs are created.
<P>
	The sad thing is that even though there are methods for job 
creation that have been proven in other countries, one must ask 
why we cannot not get that in the House.
<P>
	The basic problem is there is a party unwillingness on the other 
side to admit that any idea that comes from this side might actually 
be worth considering. That problem stems from the fact that 
Parliament in its present form is much more suited to the enactment 
of a party agenda than it is to the enactment of sensible policies or 
the will of the people.
<P>
	In blunt terms, the $125,000 plus to run this place every hour 
gives us little more than a charade of meaningless debates and 
answerless questions. The outcome of every vote on every 
government bill is known in advance, before the first speaker even 
gets up. The government knows every one of its bills will pass. The 
problem is that to change that sort of thing we will need a lot of 
sacrifice by those in power. At the moment those people are the 
least willing to sacrifice the power they maintain.
<P>
	Despite their resistance I can feel the tide turning. I feel the tide 
of Canadian support turning against those traditionalists. The 
progress of the revolution can be measured at the ballot box. It 
certainly manifested itself in tremendous uncertainty for the 
traditional parties over the last five years or so.
<P>
	We need look only at the success of the Reform Party of Canada, 
which jumped from one seat in Ottawa prior to the 1993 election to 
52 seats. It was contrary to the predictions of the pundits and 
despite the vigorous, completely unfounded media attacks against 
the party. It used to use the old labels of racist and bigoted, but 
those long ago lost their effect because they were not true.
<P>
	Let me give a personal example. My riding was held from the 
middle of the 1970s until 1993 by Chuck Cook, a Progressive 
Conservative. In the vote of 1993, I received a higher number of 
votes than Chuck Cook ever  had in his entire history in this place, 
votes paid to any suggestion that this party is a reincarnation of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3183"> 3183 </A></B>
<P>
PCs. Through our policies I took 18 per cent of the NDP vote to 
Reform. That happened in Reform ridings throughout western 
Canada.
<P>
	The truth is voters saw through the attacks, the labels attracted to 
the party. What they saw they wanted, a populist set of policies 
based on their input and a promise that MPs would represent the 
will of constituents in Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Perhaps this is an appropriate time for me to mention again that 
my constituents are getting fed up with hearing Liberals in the 
House continually implying, through their personal attacks on 
Reform MPs, that the millions of Reform voters and supporters 
across the country are racists, bigots, homophobes and extremists 
simply because they do not agree with Liberal policies and because 
they do not agree with the way bills are rammed through the House.
<P>
	They are not racists, bigots, homophobes and extremists. They 
are caring, responsible, compassionate Canadians, and they are 
sick and tired of being attacked by the politically correct who sit on 
that side of the House. It has to stop because it is unacceptable. It 
would do well for those taking part in the smear campaigns to 
remember that every time they stand in the House to make those 
kinds of accusations.
<P>
	This morning I had a call from a constituent who watched the 
television coverage of yesterday's extensive ceremonies involving 
MPs. I ask members to put themselves in the shoes of ordinary 
Canadians who watched that yesterday. They saw former members 
of Parliament honouring themselves by unveiling a series of wall 
plaques listing their names in the House of Commons. They saw 
them heading off for a cocktail party at the governor general's 
residents.
<P>
	Those taxpayers were asking who was paying for all of this 
self-glorification. Do they not have big enough pensions already? 
Do they not have a big enough trough already? Do they not take any 
responsibility at all for what they have done to the country? Are 
they proud of the $583 billion debt they left for our children and 
our grandchildren? Are they proud of the highly excessive taxation 
levels forcing people to deal in the underground economy? Are 
they proud of a justice system that cannot protect us? Are they 
proud of the Young Offenders Act which lets young offenders roam 
out of control in gangs, not accountable for the crimes they 
commit?
<P>
	They are the ones who caused all the problems. Why are they 
honouring themselves? It was because of them that millions of 
Canadians voted in 52 Reform MPs in the last election, a party with 
ethics that would stop wasting taxpayer money on gold plated 
pension plans and would restore some common sense to 
government.
<P>
	The truth is the real extremists in our political system are sitting 
on the opposite side of the House. They are the traditional 
politicians who flocked to this place yesterday to admire their 
names on the gold plaques on the walls. They were the ones who 
before they began dismantling the CPP for ordinary Canadians 
voted themselves a gold plated pension plan that would be illegal in 
the private sector.
<P>
	They were the ones who ignored the will of ordinary Canadians 
and rammed their politically correct legislation through 
Parliament. They are the ones who invoked political correctness so 
that Canadians are afraid to speak openly about the issues that 
concern them. As a Reform MP I have had to live through a lot of 
attacks from special interest groups which see their funding 
threatened.
<P>
	On this latest attack that we have heard over the last couple of 
months, this extremist label that has popped up, the public sees 
labels for what they are, a smear campaign without foundation. As 
the constituent who called me this morning said, we have only to 
look at the actions of the traditional parties to see who the real 
extremists are.
<P>
	Their $583 billion debt is extreme. Their punitive tax rates are 
extreme. Their decision to let dangerous offenders out of prison 
after a few years of sentence is extreme. Their actions in ramming 
special interest group bills through the House are extreme. Closing 
off debate on important bills is extreme. Their thousands of annual 
patronage appointments and grants to special interest groups are 
extreme. Most extreme of all is the legislation they passed for their 
own pension schemes.
<P>
	All these things were achievements of the people like those on 
the opposite side, the traditional old line politicians who ignored 
what the people wanted them to do and enacted the will of the 
special interest groups instead. Yesterday they celebrated their 
achievements and people watched on television. Members should 
have heard the comments they made.
<P>
	The people on the opposite side of the House are slow learners. 
There is no doubt in my mind that we have now reached the point 
where any party, federal or provincial, which does not listen to the 
voters and start enacting the will of the voters is going to find itself 
subject to elimination by the voters of the information age. We can 
already see the evidence that it is happening by looking at matters 
in the provinces and even at the federal level.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	It is only the social engineers who still cling to the belief that 
people are too stupid, too mean, too intolerant, too lacking in 
compassion to govern themselves. Those social engineers are 
resisting change.
<P>
	The traditionalists think they are the sole possessors of 
compassion, understanding and tolerance and that the voters can 
only be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3184"> 3184 </A></B>
<P>
trusted to make a decision once every five years about which 
benevolent dictatorship will govern them next. I know for certain, 
and every MP in this House must know, the public notices how 
every party when it gets elected says how clever the voters were to 
have selected it to run the country. Any time the public will is 
against one of its bills the first thing the party does is label the 
voters as ill-informed, mean-spirited, racist, homophobic, 
extremist. No wonder the voters have become cynical about their 
governments. They have good reason.
<P>
	Let us look at an example which happened in the House just a 
couple of weeks ago. The member for York-Simcoe stood in this 
House and criticized the member for Yorkton-Melville who made 
a statement on behalf of a group of Cree Indians. Leonard Iron, a 
Cree of the Canoe Lake Band had handed a letter to my colleague 
from Yorkton-Melville and asked him to read it in the House. 
That is exactly what that member did. Then last week the member 
for York-Simcoe said in her statement in the House:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Once again a member of the Reform Party has lashed out against a minority 
group, this time Canada's aboriginal community. This Reform member made 
derogatory remarks about Canada's native leadership when he said that its 
leadership will turn native self-government into fascist states.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	After she made the comment I walked across the floor of the 
House and I said to the member: ``When you read that statement, 
did you know that my colleague was reading it from a letter from 
the Cree nation?'' She said to me: ``Yes, I did''. I said: ``What sort 
of person does that make you?''
<P>
	I can respect differing opinions in this House. I am prepared to 
argue for the policies that I stand for but I have no respect for 
people who set out to destroy others by not using the facts.
<P>
	Here is another example. I have been waiting for the answer to a 
question I put in this House in March of last year. I realize there has 
been a prorogation but anybody with an ounce of common sense 
knows that if any work had been done on the question it could 
continue after the House came back. Since March 1995 the 
question is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the Squamish Indian Band in North Vancouver, what has the 
federal Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development determined to 
be (a) the total number of band members living on the reserve, (b) the total 
amount of funding provided to the band in each of the years from 1990 to 1994 
from all federal government transfers, including but not limited to, transfers and 
grants for any purpose, government leases of land from the band, housing costs, 
education and training, special purpose funding and income from Park Royal 
South Shopping Centre lease collected on behalf of the band?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have been waiting for an answer to the question for my 
constituents for more than a year. It is a disgrace the way this 
government conducts itself.
<P>
	Unfortunately our parliamentary system has made it possible for 
the MPs of the traditional parties to be unaccountable between
<P>
elections and to ride to election on the coattails of a dictatorial 
leader who will tell them how to vote in the House. In my opinion 
this has the potential to rob them of their dignity, their decency and 
their morality and could reduce them to the level of trained seals.
<P>
	Unfortunately those who hold the reins of power presently pay 
lip service to consultation and input. It is very rare for anything to 
change in their plans as a result of that input.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has done nothing to rectify this problem 
despite the promises of free votes. If he truly believed in 
democracy, all he would have to do is rise in the House, the way 
Pierre Trudeau did when the present Prime Minister was the 
minister of finance, and state that a vote lost on a government bill 
does not mean the defeat of the government but should be followed 
by a confidence vote to restore confidence. This would allow 
democracy to prevail. It would allow meaningful debates in the 
House in which members would have a chance to talk openly and 
freely to perhaps convince one another to vote a different way.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	The problem is there is no accountability. There is the same lack 
of accountability by ministers. For example, the minister of 
immigration answers letters from my constituents with ridiculous 
statements which I do not have time to read.
<P>
	It is very depressing to see what happens here. I support the 
motion of my colleague and I hope others will also vote in favour 
of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
paid attention to the hon. member's speech. Why is he so bitter 
about life as a parliamentarian? It seems that you question the 
importance of public service, when you cannot enjoy a historical 
moment like the one we had yesterday when the names of people 
who have contributed to the history of this country, who have given 
of themselves to the improvement of our society, that somehow 
you would view that-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I do not know if the hon. member is 
addressing the other member directly, but I would prefer he address 
the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, it was an initiative that you 
initiated as a Speaker. I wonder why the hon. member would feel 
that somehow it is an abuse of power to respect history. The names 
that appear on those plaques are of people who have been nation 
builders. They helped create the social security system, medicare, 
Canada pension plan. The modernization of our nation has 
occurred because of the input of so many members of Parliament 
who have practised their faith in the country here in this Chamber. 
You 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3185"> 3185 </A></B>
<P>
do a great disservice to this nation by saying that members of 
Parliament do not play an important role.
<P>
	I will return to some of the issues you raised.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, you must address me, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will return to some of the issues 
the hon. member mentioned. He sees nothing good coming out of 
this session of Parliament. He feels that the world is falling apart, 
that Canada is nowhere.
<P>
	This country has been named by the United Nations as the 
number one country. We have one of the best employment records, 
job creation records in any of the industrialized countries. Over 
604,000 jobs have been created. There has been a reduction in 
unemployment. Past governments stated that we would not have 
single digit unemployment in Canada for a long time. They said it 
would be double digit for a number of years. That has been 
reduced.
<P>
	Consider the deficit. Not only has the government met its target 
but has even improved on its projection. The hon. member said that 
things are so bad in this nation that absolutely nothing is working 
right. Yet there are so many positive indicators that the government 
is moving in the right direction, that Canada has a great opportunity 
to remain as number one in the entire world.
<P>
	The member talked about having a Prime Minister who is a 
dictator. I do not know which House of Commons or which 
Parliament he is in. On many occasions the Prime Minister has 
expressed the will of the party in very democratic ways. There have 
been free votes in the House. I have seen how many times there 
have been free votes on the other side. The hon. member ought to 
pay a little more attention to what is going on.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Is it part of being a member of the Reform Party that you have to 
be bitter about life in general and bitter about anything that 
governments are doing to bring about positive change? Why is it 
that you cannot see the positives that are occurring throughout the 
country? Have you not been around long enough?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Once again I urge members to address the Chair at 
all times, not one another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would like 
to deal with the issue of free votes. As the critic for democratic 
reforms for the party this is my area of specialty. I would like to put 
on the record that every vote which is held in the House is a free 
vote for the Reform Party. It is just that our definition of free votes 
is a little different than the other side's.
<P>
	The way we define free votes is that a member must show that in 
order to vote contrary to the general principles of the party there 
must be support from constituents. We do have a process which a 
member must go through in order to demonstrate that the way he or  
she is voting is actually representative of constituents. There is a 
process. Every single vote that we have is free.
<P>
	In terms of whether or not I am bitter, I would prefer to call it 
passionate. I am passionate on behalf of my constituents who are, 
very rightly, cynical about what this government does. It is 
cynicism which led to the dumping of the PCs at the last election 
and the voting in of 52 Reform MPs.
<P>
	The people came to the Hill yesterday to honour themselves and 
to look at their names on plaques. The member says they built a 
great country. I will admit that they contributed to the country, but 
in ways in which a lot of people would disagree with. Most 
Canadians are not satisfied with the way the justice system treats 
them or protects them. They are not satisfied with the level of debt.
<P>
	The member mentioned what a wonderful job they had done in 
controlling the deficit. The fact is, they have cut $9 billion out of 
government spending at the same time as they added $9 billion in 
interest payments. The finance minister, with great credit, has 
walked along a tightrope right down the middle, but he has kept us 
on the treadmill. The problem is still not solved. The debt is still 
rising dramatically. In the last hour in which we have been 
debating, the debt has risen another $2 million. That debt is a 
millstone around our necks which will continue to erode our social 
programs.
<P>
	I would like to deal with the names on the gold plated plaques. I 
never intended any disrespect to our Speaker. I am well aware that 
the plaques were funded with private money. Really, that was not 
the point. The point I was trying to convey on behalf of my 
constituents was how that exercise looked when someone was 
watching it on a television set in western Canada. I believe I was 
successful in making that point because of the reaction of the 
member.
<P>
	My constituents would have no problem whatsoever supporting 
plaques in the House of Commons showing the names of everyone 
who has served here if they thought they were getting value for 
their money, if they thought MPs were not ripping them off, if they 
thought MPs were following the will of their constituents. There is 
not a scrap of evidence that ever happens. Every piece of evidence 
that every constituent has is that nobody gives a darn for their 
opinion from the day of the election until six weeks before the next 
election. That is the way this place operates.
<P>
	I have a letter which was sent to me by the minister of 
immigration in response to a letter I sent asking her to deport yet 
another group of criminal refugees who are committing crimes in 
my riding. I have had a plethora of them over the past year. I cannot 
get rid of these people. They are a menace to society. I wrote to her 
again on March 18. She was kind enough to reply on May 15. She 
said, basically, that she does not want to deport anybody in lieu of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3186"> 3186 </A></B>
<P>
sentencing because she wants to make sure they  realize they 
must serve their sentences and that simply deporting them 
would be to diminish the severity of their crimes. Frankly, that is 
a load of rubbish.
<P>
	The way my constituents look at it is that these people will get 
out on early release to wander around in the community. Early 
release and probation are considered to be a part of sentencing. 
There is no accountability. These people should be deported at the 
time they are convicted.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Cooperation, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, today we are 
debating a very weighty subject which is the origins of cynicism. I 
do not know if we pursued the debate to its final conclusion we 
would have to have a debate on the human condition, but I suppose 
we would have to do it with the political conditions we find before 
us today.
<P>
	I suppose one could ask who is putting the question about 
cynicism and perhaps ask them a couple of questions back. I want 
to start with something rather specific that was said by the member 
for Medicine Hat. In his speech he raised a litany of things which 
he said would be the source of cynicism about our government. I 
was curious at his roll call.
<P>
	One detail leapt out of his speech on which I decided to do a little 
research. The member informed the House that the Canadian 
Bankers Association in Vancouver received from the Government 
of Canada a grant of $105,000. This was cited as an example of 
waste. Of course there were no details provided so I decided I 
might try and help out the hon. member by finding some details 
myself.
<P>
	It turns out that this much criticized grant which the hon. 
member referred to was used exclusively to train aboriginal 
students and persons with disabilities. They would be better 
prepared to enter the workforce, get off social assistance and 
expand their skills so they could access entry level positions within 
the banks.
<P>
	The banks themselves provided on the spot training and all sorts 
of support significantly over the period of the grant to help these 
aboriginal people and disabled persons. There were 55 students 
from 1991 to 1994. Forty-seven of them graduated and 30 of them 
were hired by the banks.
<P>
	I only raise this seemingly minor point simply to ask: If the hon. 
member had done the research and had found out what I found out, 
would he have made the point? If he had made the point knowing 
what he knew, would that not have contributed to the cynicism 
which surrounds the political process, that he might have 
deliberately suppressed the most crucial information about the case 
he cited?
<P>
	There are broader reasons for political cynicism which can be 
laid directly at the door of the Reform Party. One might ask what 
the source is of cynicism about public institutions, governments, 
politicians and the political process.
<P>
	I suspect that if one examined the very origins of the Reform 
Party itself, one might say it is an anti-political political party. I 
dare say Reformers would not disagree with that. These are 
politicians who say they hate politicians. Indeed, the entire Reform 
Party platform is based on catering to a fundamental dislike which 
human beings have of public institutions, governments, politicians 
and the political process itself. Therefore, if one likes, the Reform 
Party was constituted on a principle of self-loathing as a political 
party.
<P>
	The origins of those ideas of course are to be found south of the 
border and across the Atlantic. The origins of those ideas come 
from that bundle of concepts which could be described as 
Ronald-Thatcherism. It is a strange view of the world which 
basically states that governments are not neutral actors, they are 
bad actors, and that for all of the major social and economic issues 
of our time the marketplace should decide and the individual must 
reign in complete freedom. Those are the major tenets of the 
Reform Party and they belong to a larger school of intellectual 
thought which we saw active in the 1980s.
<P>
	There is also a certain connection, which I dare say they would 
deny, between that chain of ideas and the ideas of the predecessor 
government to our own. The previous Prime Minister, Mr. 
Mulroney, very much subscribed to the Ronald-Thatcherite school 
of thinking with its libertarian ideas. He also subscribed to the 
notion that the model for society was the United States. He used to 
state so simply about Canadian foreign policy: ``I know who my 
friends are''.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I suspect that the cynicism which Canadians feel about the 
political process which was certainly accelerated during the 
Mulroney years comes from two sources, not one. The obvious 
source was the suggestion of favouritism and patronage. But more 
subtly the source was a fundamental belief by the leader of the 
country that the model was somewhere else, that headquarters were 
somewhere else and we would be very well off if we could emulate 
those values and that kind of society. That was a subtle 
undermining of the political process and a major contribution to 
cynicism. The Reform Party has contributed to the continuation of 
this cynicism.
<P>
	It was interesting to observe the Winds of Change conference 
over the past weekend. There was such a clear distinction between 
what I would call true Conservatism, which I do not think Mr. 
Mulroney embodied, and the kind of radical rightist thinking which 
is characteristic of the Reform Party. I entirely sympathize with the 
Reform Party because of course there can be no true union between 
true Conservatives and radical rightists.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3187"> 3187 </A></B>
<P>
	What do radical rightists believe? Jeffrey Simpson put it very 
nicely the other day in an article:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These radical rightists are essentially libertarians with little sense of 
community. As such, they represent the antithesis of genuine conservatism, 
which emphasises the organic nature of society, tradition, pragmatism, order 
and reciprocal obligations. A society that values cohesion and order must have a 
sense of obligation, of what we owe each other, but a libertarian society is 
founded on the idea that we owe each other nothing except the ability to protect 
individuals from interference in the unfettered enjoyment of their liberty and 
property.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is the radical rightist or Reform world view. Of course, it 
represents cynicism not only about governments, politics, 
institutions and the like referred to in Reform's motion, but it 
represents-and here I echo the remarks of the member for York 
North-a cynicism about the human condition, about human 
beings. It is a meanspirited view of humankind. It is a distrust of 
society. It is, as I have said, a kind of political and social 
self-loathing.
<P>
	One might ask what the alternative is to this and why would our 
alternative Liberalism be of a different order. There are five 
principles of Liberalism which help to dissipate cynicism, which 
give people hope and differentiate us not only from the radical 
rightists of the Reform Party or of Mr. Frum. They not only 
differentiate us in some sense from the traditional Conservatives, 
although we would be closer to them, but also from the New 
Democratic Party, whatever that is.
<P>
	The first important distinction which separates us from the pack 
is a dedication to innovation. It is true, particularly in this century, 
that the Liberal Party has been innovative in economic reform and 
innovative in social reform. The Liberals are innovative now in 
recognizing that when institutions which were created for one 
purpose, such as unemployment insurance and the health care 
system, now find themselves in a different situation, we are not 
afraid to innovate again by going back to the fundamental 
principles of what it is we are trying to achieve with the social 
system in question, be it the health care system or social support for 
individuals. Innovation is at the heart of what we did in the red 
book and what I hope we will be able to do in the remainder of our 
mandate.
<P>
	A second distinguishing characteristic, which is almost a 
psychological tone if I may say, is optimism: optimism about 
human beings, optimism about society, optimism about the future 
of the world. It is an optimism which is not to be taken for granted 
but to be worked on through innovation. We have to be optimistic 
about this country, about our families, and about business if we are 
to make a go of it. We cannot start from the principle that it is 
dreadful and getting worse. We have to be optimistic.
<P>
	A third important strand, and here we connect up with some of 
the other ones I have referred to, is a concern for the individual's 
welfare, not ignoring vast numbers of  humankind because they are 
not our kind. It is a concern for the individual.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	A fourth distinction-and this one really does separate us from 
the others-is a view of the state which says on the one hand, 
unlike the NDP, we do not think the state can do it all. On the other 
hand, unlike the radical right, we do not think there is no role 
whatsoever for the state. It is a view which says sometimes it is 
useful and sometimes it is not.
<P>
	I wish to pick up on some remarks made by the Minister for 
International Cooperation. More important, the state now has to be 
in a partnership with all elements of society. We no longer speak of 
nations in a sense and we no longer speak of states; we speak of 
societies which compete collectively as state-sharing vessels.
<P>
	Sometimes I agree with the language of Mr. Bouchard when he 
talks the language of social solidarity. It is all of the elements 
coming together to compete. It is the Team Canada approach 
internalized which will advance the cause of this society. We 
cannot command and control this economy or this society, but 
neither can we neglect it.
<P>
	We have to use our convening power to bring together all the 
elements of Canadian society to advance the technological agenda, 
to advance the social agenda because no one person, no one 
institution, no one situs, in sociological terms, can do the job alone. 
That is a distinguishing characteristic: that we view the state as 
having an active but not dominant role. That is the fourth condition 
of Liberalism.
<P>
	Finally, and I think this is crucial as well, Liberals do not see 
themselves either as individual members or collectively as 
representing the interests of one group of Canadians or one social 
group as in contradistinction to another. It is the difference between 
what has happened in Ontario in recent elections where the ins 
under the NDP represented a certain group of people: the trade 
unionists, the environmentalists, very worthy people. Then 
suddenly there was a swing and the new ins represent the country 
club set and reject the views of labour and all the rest of it.
<P>
	Liberals do not play that game. Liberals say they protect all 
those interests and attempt through society to harmonize their 
interests to a common purpose. That is the distinction between 
what we do and what the Reform Party does. That is why I think 
Canadians have a great deal less to be cynical about as they think 
about the Liberal Party than as they think about the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member for Don Valley West talks about what a Liberal is. It 
seems to me, especially in the last two and one-half years I have 
been here and when I participated in my first election campaign, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3188"> 3188 </A></B>
<P>
the definition of a Liberal is to say anything you need to to get 
elected and then do what you want when you are here.
<P>
	The Prime Minister himself exemplified that statement when he 
said: ``Ask me after I am in government. I will tell you how I 
govern after I get elected''. Make any kind of promise you want 
and then get here and do what you want. In my speech I will talk 
about the broken promises.
<P>
	The member claims that the Liberal Party has a social 
conscience and it is looking after health care. How do the Liberals 
look after health care, education and welfare? They lumped it all 
together, said that they did not know how to do it, so they just took 
$7.5 billion and cut it. They cut $7.5 billion form established 
programs financing and the Canada assistance plan and that is how 
they solved it.
<P>
	Is that a solution? Is that responsible government? Is that the 
way the member thinks that his party has a social conscience, by 
downloading health care, education and welfare on to the provinces 
so that the Ontario legislature gets the rocks thrown at it and not 
this building?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godfrey:</B> Madam Speaker, I spoke of the importance of 
innovation. If the hon. member for Calgary Centre were to read the 
chapter in the red book on health, he would discover a radically 
new way of thinking about health care which would link it to our 
social programs, to the way in which we view education and 
training and indeed to the way in which we view universities. That 
is what I mean by innovation.
<P>
	There was a time when we concentrated on health care. The most 
advanced thinking in the field is to concentrate on the determinants 
of health itself. Surely health is what we hope to be the outcome of 
a health care system, but it is not the outcome of the health care 
system. Health is the outcome of what happened to us earlier in 
life, in early childhood for instance.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	It is our position that we have to work with the provinces 
because we do not, as the hon. member well knows, have the 
constitutional responsibility for the things he mentions. We should 
work together as partners in a Team Canada approach that looks at 
how all these issues are connected.
<P>
	If we get it right with early childhood, from birth to the time 
children enter the school system, the positive outcomes will not 
only affect health status of adults, the learning status of adults, but 
will radically improve crime statistics, which the hon. member is 
worried about.
<P>
	What I am suggesting is that they will continue to go up until we 
take a holistic view of how these things hang together. That is what 
I mean by innovative thinking and a willingness to rethink old 
problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must 
address some of the assumptions the hon. member was making 
about the Reform Party. He talked about the radical right and all 
that kind of nonsense.
<P>
	There are many people on this side who believe in a very organic 
way of looking at the world, a conservative way of looking at the 
world, but we view it a little differently than the member opposite.
<P>
	We believe good common sense, an organic view of the world 
and slow growth come from people and not from the government. 
That is why we reject Liberal government social engineering. I will 
give a good example that ties in precisely to the example the hon. 
member used about the subsidy that goes to the banks, the 
$105,000 I raised in my speech.
<P>
	The member mentioned that the $105,000 that goes to the banks, 
which made $5 billion in profits last year, is used to hire 
aboriginals and people with disabilities. What the member failed to 
mention is that his own government has put into place social 
engineering in the form of affirmative action that forces banks and 
others to hire visible minorities, women, people with disabilities 
and aboriginals.
<P>
	Therefore what we have in this situation is legislation that forces 
the banks to do something. The banks make $5 billion in profits 
and then the government gives the banks $105,000 to fulfil the 
legislation they have set out.
<P>
	Would the member acknowledge that perhaps what the Reform 
Party really stands for is allowing people to make a lot of the 
judgments themselves because they are the ones who are truly 
socially conservative, the ones who create a sense of community, 
not the government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godfrey:</B> Madam Speaker, that was a very confusing 
question. Let us start with the $105,000 that went to the bankers 
association to train aboriginals and disabled people. It was intended 
to do precisely that, to allow people who would not otherwise be in 
the workforce to cease to be liabilities and to become social assets 
by entering the work force. They did. The program worked.
<P>
	The member used the language of force. The banks, he 
suggested, would not have done that. They were forced to take on 
board, because of equity legislation, these kinds of people and were 
therefore forced to train them. What if they had not been forced? Is 
he telling me they would not have done it, that it was not 
worthwhile doing it in its own right, that somebody in this society 
should not take care of aboriginal people and disabled people to 
integrate them into the workforce?
<P>
	He may well say if we would let the banks do it on their own, but 
that is not what he suggested. He suggested they were forced to do 
it. The implication was that they would not otherwise have done it. 
If they would not have done it, who would have done it?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3189"> 3189 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Madam Speaker, the member's comments betray 
his attitude toward the people. The point that I am making is 
people will make good judgments about how they treat other 
individuals. The reason I say that is in the situation the member 
refers to he forgets there are a complex set of variables involved.
<P>
	We have a bank industry that is very tightly regulated. There is 
no competition among banks. We have all kinds of very high tax 
levels. We have high payroll taxes. There is actually a disincentive 
to hiring all kinds of people.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	We have high unemployment due in large part to the fact that the 
government has intervened so heavily in the economy that it 
actually provides a disincentive to hiring.
<P>
	That means banks and other groups hire people who come best 
prepared. That is not a surprise to me. It may be to the hon. 
member. When we look at it at the local level, when people have a 
choice people are more than willing to help out their neighbour. 
They are more than willing to help out people down the street who 
may come from a disadvantaged situation.
<P>
	The hon. member has forgotten a huge part of this equation. 
There are all kinds of factors he did not consider such as 
interventions from the government that provide disincentives to 
hiring some of the people he talked about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godfrey:</B> Madam Speaker, in this case it comes down to 
this. If there are people who are disadvantaged in society how are 
we to ensure to the maximum that they will cease to be 
disadvantaged, that they will as individuals, which I stressed in my 
talk about Liberal principles, have the best possible chance of 
access to jobs?
<P>
	I do not discount what the hon. member said about the virtue of 
community and the importance of individual initiative or 
community initiative or company initiative. I do not discount that 
in the slightest. It is a crucial part of the social fabric of the country. 
I do not think it is only the role of government to do that.
<P>
	What worries me in that analysis is what happens to the people 
who are not the neighbour at our gate. What happens to the people 
who are the strangers in our streets? In the case of aboriginals, 
many of them are. Look at our large urban cities. Look at who those 
people are and how disconnected they are from our 
neighbourhoods and our families and our communities.
<P>
	If it is not society acting through its state, working with its 
partners, the private sector and communities, that will take care of 
those people in some kind of fairly systematic way, then not only 
will we be an unkind and uncaring society, we will be an inefficient 
society. We will be forced to use more of our resources for security 
guards and prisons and deal with people who drop out of schools 
and all the rest of it.
<P>
	It is in everybody's interest to behave in a collective manner and 
to recognize the potentially positive role of government in doing 
that. We are not saying government is any better than the private 
sector or individuals or anything else like that. We are simply 
saying it is no worse. I say this as an economic historian. Its track 
record in worrying about the betterment of humankind is 
considerably better over time than that of the business community.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in favour of our motion.
<P>
	I refer to the Prime Minister's 1993 election commitment that 
``there will not be a promise I do not keep''. I went through the red 
book. I researched the red book. I found in the red book 187 
promises. I found also, as I checked them off with some help from 
some researchers, that 46 have been kept. That is drastically less 
than the 75 per cent bragged about in the testimony of the Prime 
Minister a couple of weeks ago in the House. The Liberal 
government has 121 promises to go if it wants to keep the promises 
in the red book.
<P>
	The Prime Minister also challenged any Canadian, not just MPs, 
``any time hold up the red book and ask me where I am on this 
promise''. I would like to review some of these promises and 
maybe I will ask him where he is on some of these promises.
<P>
	To get elected, as I mentioned to the member for Don Valley 
West earlier, this government when in opposition, when out on the 
hustings, used rhetoric, language and words to get elected that are 
so far from the reality of what it is doing today that it really brings 
into question integrity and accountability. Those are the two areas I 
will touch on.
<P>
	We have even had a deputy prime minister resign because of the 
promise she made. The finance minister admitted they cannot keep 
the GST promise. The only person left who will not admit he 
cannot keep it, will not keep it, will not kill it, will not get rid of it, 
will not scrap it, is the Prime Minister.
<P>
	He still thinks he is keeping his promise, that he will replace it. 
He says read page 22. I read page 22. It says they will replace it 
with a system of taxation that generates equivalent revenues. It 
does not. It will cost $1 billion in three provinces alone. ``It will be 
fairer to consumers and businesses''. It is not. To small business 
only it is fairer. For consumers it increases taxation on those goods 
and services that the PST did not apply to.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	The reality is the government has not replaced the GST. What it 
has done is replaced the PST. Is that what it campaigned on? Did it 
say replace the PST with the GST? It has entrenched the GST into 
our lives forever. It has now become a 15 per cent GST. It is now to 
be there for all future generations. We will never get rid of it now 
unless a new government comes in and abolishes it with  a new 
system of taxation. This was a big promise made to get elected, a 
big promise the government has failed to keep. It smacks of 
duplicity and exaggerated claims.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3190"> 3190 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Finance, the minister of myth, is now trying to 
brag about how he has done everything in the world to make this a 
better place to live. I have never yet seen a finance minister or a 
chief executive officer of any corporation in the private sector, of 
which I was a part for 25 years before I came here, stand up before 
a board of directors or shareholders and review the balance sheet of 
that corporation or the balance sheet of a nation and brag only 
about one side of the ledger, about how the deficit is coming down.
<P>
	The finance minister gave an 80 minute speech to the 
shareholders of the country and not once did he mention the word 
debt. Look at his speech and find where he talks about the debt, the 
interest costs to service the debt or how much the debt is going up. 
He brags about six, five, four, three and hopes for two, one, zero, 
but will not make a commitment to it and does not talk about the 
debt, how the interest is rising on that debt and how that interest 
cost will suffocate the very social programs the member for Don 
Valley West brags about in terms of helping the disabled.
<P>
	As much as they brag about how much they are helping, we 
subsidize and give $8 billion to aboriginals and he still claims they 
are disabled. Through five different programs in the expenditure 
system we have, we give $9 billion for children one way or the 
other and we still have a million starving children out there. That is 
a poor job and it reflects on the government.
<P>
	To get elected the government promised to introduce an 
infrastructure program that would create jobs, jobs, jobs. There are 
still 1.5 million Canadians unemployed. Where are the jobs? The 
Prime Minister has now admitted once again that he cannot deliver 
on that promise of jobs. The infrastructure program has helped in 
some areas but overall it has been a failure. It has created 100,000 
interim jobs and maybe 30,000 full time jobs at a cost of $6 billion. 
That is $60,000 a job. Is that worth it? I do not know.
<P>
	The government also promised to reduce UI premiums to help 
businesses have money for investment and growth. Today we had a 
statement from the minister that they have reduced premiums, 
one-twentieth of one per cent. How much will that help businesses? 
How much will an entrepreneur reinvest? How many people will he 
hire on that basis?
<P>
	What the government also did is increase the taxes on part time 
employees. Now when a business hires part time people it has to go 
to the trouble of filling out these UI forms. It is another tax. It 
increased payroll taxes by 7 per cent on part time employees, which 
inhibits and hurts. Businesses do not want that. No, the government 
wants more revenue. The minister talks about no taxes. That is also 
a myth.
<P>
	There was talk about the Young Offenders Act, what is the root 
of increased crime and what is the problem in society. We have to 
empower people, but if we are to empower people we have to do 
two things. We have to leave more money in their pockets so they 
can look after their families and themselves and we need tougher 
rules for those people who do the crime. If someone does the crime 
they should pay the time. I do not care if they are 12 years old. I 
have been to public schools talking to kids in grades 6, 7, 8 and 9. 
They all say that if they do the crime they should pay the time.
<P>
	However, the Minister of Justice, this soft hearted Liberal, does 
not want to do that. He talks like he is doing a lot of stuff but he is 
not. Crime is up.
<P>
	What has the government promised on health care. It stated it 
would have a national forum and get to the bottom of health care. It 
would solve the problem and guarantee that every Canadian will 
have free health care.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	Is health care free? The Prime Minister thinks it is free. He says 
it is free and he is going to protect it. The government and the 
provinces had one meeting in two and a half years and they broke 
up. What happened next? We are not going to hear about it until the 
next election. So much for health care.
<P>
	The government reduced the funding for health care and 
education. It said to the provinces: ``We are going to give you less. 
You handle it. But we will guarantee that five years from now we 
will always give you $11 billion. We will do that for you, but you 
handle this cutback. We do not know how to handle it''.
<P>
	The Liberals also said that they would restore integrity in 
government and bring in an ethics counsellor who would be 
accountable to Parliament. That is another broken promise. I even 
forget the name of the ethics counsellor, we have not heard of him 
for so long. He is responsible to the Prime Minister. That is not a 
watch dog. The ethics counsellor is a lap dog. That is not the 
integrity about which the Prime Minister spoke. It is an example of 
the rhetoric the Liberals used to get elected. The facts are different 
than the rhetoric. I am asking Canadians to recognize that.
<P>
	The Liberals said they would cancel the Pearson airport deal. 
Yes, they did. They kept that promise. It has cost us half a billion 
dollars so far. It has been kicked around in the Senate. Guess what? 
It is coming back here. They will do another study to show that if 
they had gone ahead and privatized it those people who would have 
been taking the risk would have lost X amount of dollars. How 
silly. Do something with it. If it is to be cancelled, then cancel it. 
Handle the lawsuits and get rid of it. No, this government does not 
know how to do it. So far it has cost us half a billion dollars and it 
will cost more.

	The Liberals said they would get rid of the EH-101s. They were 
going to cancel the helicopter deal. There were 55 or 54 EH-101s. 
Kim Campbell knocked the number down to 45 to try to save her 
butt and get re-elected. However, she was not re-elected. The 
Liberals said they would save that $5.8 billion. They said the 
country did not need the helicopters. Guess what? The department 
of defence needs more helicopters.
<P>
	Did the Liberals tell us door to door that they would cancel this 
deal but spend $2 billion on another one? No, they did not say that. 
The rhetoric they used to get elected is different from the facts and 
what they are doing. The definition of a Liberal: ``Say anything you 
want, do anything you want, be anything you want to get elected. 
Once you are there, do what you feel like doing''.
<P>
	As far as accountability goes, the Prime Minister said: ``They 
can vote for me or not vote for me in the next election''. He does 
not care. It is just one day every five years that he wants to be held 
accountable.
<P>
	In opposition members of the government railed, ranted and 
raved about closure. When the Tories used closure the Liberal 
opposition said it was anti-democratic and dictatorial. This 
government has used closure on numerous occasions. It has limited 
debate on important issues that all Canadians should know more 
details about. It has invoked time allocation which has limited the 
amount of members who can speak. The government has impeded 
our freedom of speech. It has restricted the amount of time that 295 
members can speak on controversial bills in order to get them out 
of the way. Canadians do not know both sides of the issues. That is 
what debate is all about. That is what democracy is all about. That 
is how the House should work. We must have proper time to debate 
both sides of the issue before we vote. Time allocation is 
anti-democratic. The Liberals said that when they were in 
opposition.
<P>
	When they were in opposition they had integrity. When they 
were here they had values. What happened when they went over to 
that side of the House? Why did they lose it? Why do they no 
longer do the things they said they would do when they were in 
opposition? I do not understand it. I guess I never will.
<P>
	Let me talk about travel. When Mulroney travelled the world 
there was a headline in the media every day. When this Prime 
Minister travels it is Team Canada and it is good. What did the 
Prime Minister do to the media? How did he get the media on his 
side? This Prime Minister has travelled more than Mulroney did in 
his first four, five or six years. In two and a half years this Prime 
Minister has travelled more. Nothing is being said about it.
<P>
	We talked earlier about the patronage appointments to the 
Senate. Where is the integrity when a prime minister of this 
country stands up and talks about appointing senators? I know that 
is our system. We want senators to  be elected. That is what this 
party stands for. We want a Senate which is effective, elected and 
equal. We think there should be two Houses in the country.
<P>
	The system is patronage. The people who they think will do a 
good job are appointed. There are rules as to where the senators 
come from. Should a senator not be appointed to represent the 
region? I think so.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	There are people on the other side who are well studied-I see 
two of them across from me-who are well learned and probably 
have impeccable credentials when it comes to the meaning 
democracy and political values. They know more about it than I do. 
I am just a businessman. I know the two members across from me 
know this.
<P>
	Is it not important for the Prime Minister to simply say: ``I 
appoint this man because I think he will do a good job for Alberta'', 
instead of, ``I will appoint a Liberal and he will represent my party 
in the Senate?'' Is that democracy? That is not right. I know it is not 
right. The Prime Minister knows it is not right, yet he does it and he 
gets away with it.
<P>
	I will get back to the GST by reading from two letters. In 
opposition and even in government, what some of these members 
have done with the GST and harmonization is replace the PST, 
which was not in the red book, with the GST. They entrenched it 
into our lives forever.
<P>
	When the Liberals were in opposition they said such things as: 
``The GST is to be applied to reading materials. How do we expect 
to have another generation of people who can know more and can 
compete in the a world around us?'' This question was asked by the 
former Minister of Health in 1990.
<P>
	``Thousands of other Canadians are appalled that the government 
decided to tax books, magazines and newspapers. We in the 
opposition objected specifically to the inclusion of these products. 
We continue to oppose it''. This was said by the member for 
Kingston and the Islands in 1993 when the Liberals were in 
opposition.
<P>
	``The government is proposing to add GST by taxing the printed 
word. It strikes a blow at learning, the transfer of information''. 
This was a statement made by the current member for Willowdale, 
the chairman of the finance committee.
<P>
	They all said that it is wrong to tax reading. They all said that it 
is incorrect to tax reading. They all talked about, but what did they 
just do with harmonization? They increased the tax on reading by 7 
per cent. I give up, that is enough on that topic.
<P>
	The minister of myth, the Minister of Finance said: ``We have 
produced three budgets and we have not increased personal taxes in 
the first, second or third''. He has said it so often that I can almost 
do an imitation:  ``We haven't increased personal taxes, we haven't 
increased corporate taxes, we haven't increased excise taxes. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3192"> 3192 </A></B>
<P>
fact, we haven't increased taxes''. Wrong, wrong, wrong. I will 
point this out.
<P>
	Here is one example, a letter from a senior in South Surrey, Mr. 
Sidney Martin:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Do we now have a government that blatantly lies to us? We were told that 
there would be no change in income taxes, 1994-1995.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On line 301 of the income tax return a non-refundable tax credit of $3,482 is 
available to those over 65 years of age-subject to certain limitations. In 1994 a 
minimum credit of $1,741 was allowed, but in 1995 this has been reduced to 
zero dollars.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although my taxable income is down $1,244 in 1995, my income tax, as a 
result of this change, has increased by $138. In other words, I am suffering a net 
loss of $1,382 in 1995.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As a World War II merchant navy veteran I question, is this the type of 
government we deserve after defending our country from 1939 to 1945?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Is this the kind of finance minister we deserve, one who stands 
up and blatantly misrepresents what he has done in his budget when 
he claims that he has not raised taxes? There are two ways to raise 
taxes: raising the personal rate or broadening the base and reducing 
deductions. That is what he has done. That is clearly a tax increase.
<P>
	On May 7 the Prime Minister claimed that the Liberals have 
managed to reduce the deficit with no tax increases. This is untrue. 
It is blatantly untrue. On the same day the Minister of Finance, the 
minister of myth, stated that in the last three budgets the 
government did not raise personal taxes. This is also untrue. This 
letter is evidence that he raised taxes for this gentleman by $138. 
This is proof.
<P>
	The following facts about the three budgets of 1994, 1995 and 
1996 are for the minister of myth and his Department of Finance 
that keeps feeding him these wonderful lines to use to try to fool 
the Canadian public. Economists agree there are two ways to 
increase taxes: explicitly raising the tax rate from 26 per cent to 29 
per cent, or 17 per cent to 20 per cent or by broadening the 
definition of taxable income to include previously excluded 
income. The federal government has relied on the latter method 
because of its stealth characteristics.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	Taxpayers do not see an increase in their tax rates and hence are 
fooled into believing that their tax liability stayed the same. It is on 
that basis that this minister of myth claims no tax increases. 
However, at tax time that taxpayer's tax liability will increase just 
as surely as if tax rates had been specifically raised. Once again, 
this is a specific example of how that works.
<P>
	Excluding changes to the Income Tax Act designed to improve 
compliance and crack down on the underground economy, the 
government has instituted 14 revenue  positive changes to personal 
income taxes; 15 positive changes to corporate income taxes and 2 
revenue positive changes to excise taxes for a total of 31 revenue 
positive changes to taxes, which means 31 tax increases. Yet the 
Minister of Finance stands before the Canadian public and says: 
``No tax increases''.
<P>
	I have just shown that he has raised taxes 31 times. These 
increases add up to $10.5 billion in extra revenue over four years. 
The truth is, what Liberals say and the rhetoric they use does not 
match the facts.
<P>
	Liberals have increased taxes 31 times and taxpayers will pay an 
extra $10.5 billion. As much as the Liberals claim they are 
reducing the deficit, the debt is growing faster, the interest costs to 
service the debt is growing. Since they came to power it has gone 
from $40 billion to $50 billion and the debt is up by $70 billion. 
When they leave this Chamber in the next election, they will have 
increased the debt by $112 billion. That is the true financial picture 
of the country. We need a finance minister that will address the 
problem of the debt and the service cost of that debt.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International 
Cooperation and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I was astonished to hear the hon. member tell us 
that the government has done nothing right since it was elected. I 
would like to know if there is anything that it has done right? Just a 
little thing. It would be good for the Canadian public, the viewer 
who may be watching, to see that there are some things to hope for 
in this country, which I love very much.
<P>
	In a more and more global world, can we honestly blame the 
Prime Minister of Canada who travels the world with business 
people to create jobs by helping business people to develop 
contracts.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member what he thinks about 
international affairs and what he thinks the government should do 
concerning international trade, given the fact that so many present 
and future jobs depend on it. We have an extraordinarily good 
record as far as job creation related to international trade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
First, I never said that the government does nothing right. He must 
remember that I am in opposition. My job is to hold the 
government accountable. Therefore, by holding the government 
accountable I point out the areas where it is deficient: 121 promises 
yet to be kept, 46 broken promises. It is my job to point that out.
<P>
	The one thing the government has done right which has helped 
the respectability of the country, is setting a deficit target to GDP, 
even though it is low, and meeting the target and appearing that it is 
doing better all the time is a positive, good message for the 
economy. It is good for everybody and good for the finial markets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3193"> 3193 </A></B>
<P>
	There is your compliment. I gladly give it. However, having 
given it, the problem is the debt. By concentrating on the deficit 
and not making a commitment to get to zero, not to get to a 
surplus, the government is focused in the wrong direction. It is 
my job to point that out. The focus should be on the debt, the cost 
of servicing the interest on the debt. Therefore, the increases in 
the revenue have to be greater than the growth of the debt and 
the service costs on that debt. That is my advice, that is my 
recommendation which has been ignored by the government for 
two and a half years.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	There is no question with respect to international affairs that 
there is a time when the Prime Minister should travel and there is a 
time when there is a need to travel. The first trip he took to China 
was a necessity because of those deals. The member now claims 
the finance minister has signed and closed those deals as if he is the 
one responsible. Let us tell the truth. He is not responsible for that. 
These were deals and negotiations that have been going on for two, 
three, four and five years by private and public sector and 
government to government as well.
<P>
	There comes a time when certain people in politics in Asia have 
to see that the politicians here are behind and backing and would 
shore-up. That trip was worthwhile. That was one trip, five days, 
but how many other days has the Prime Minister been out of the 
country? It is 176 days. How many other jobs has he created with 
those other trips? My point is this gentleman made a lot of 
promises to get elected. He should be in the House more. He should 
be leading his party because it needs to be lead. The ranks are 
pretty thin.
<P>
	Then he had to fire all his parliamentary secretaries, fire a couple 
of cabinet ministers and bring in two rookies from Quebec to help 
him handle that province, which the finance minister almost lost. 
He had to bring in two experts from Quebec. That is the kind of 
depth that party has and that is a sign of weakness, although the two 
members he brought in are outstanding in their field.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am forced to ask the member a question. It seems this 
entire motion and the member's remarks are very self-serving 
especially when the member says ``my position is to oppose and I 
can recount some of the good things you have done, but I would put 
a motion on the floor that calls for non-confidence in you because 
you are not doing what I would like you to do''.
<P>
	It seems that if he is putting forward our positive record, if the 
member is telling of some of the things we said we would do and 
did, there could be some other ways in which the member can find 
opportunities to work with us to ensure that some of his good ideas 
connect with our good ideas and that we do the best we can for 
Canadian society.
<P>
	Would good ideas does the member have that could match some 
of the good things we laid out and some of the paths we are 
working along for the benefit of all Canadians? How can he work 
with us to ensure that agenda becomes the best possible one?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I can help the government by the 
very method I am using here today.
<P>
	It is not what we promise but what we say. I am only criticizing 
the red book. We and other people took a look at the red book. 
There were 187 promises made in the red book. I have said the 
government has kept 46 of them. There is the compliment. It has 
121 to go and only one year left before an election. It had better 
crank it up.
<P>
	How we in opposition help the government is to hold the 
government accountable to those policies and principles it uses to 
get elected. The Liberals promised to protect the civil service. They 
fired 44,000. They promised stable funding for the CBC. When we 
came out with our first budget and said we would cut spending on 
the CBC by $330 million guess what? The Liberals broke that 
promise. They called us slash and burn and draconian for 
recommending that. They slashed the CBC to the tune of $337 
million, $7 million more than what we said. Where is the slash and 
burn now? Where is the draconian budget cutting now?
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Our job is to to exactly what we are doing, holding the 
government side accountable, questioning integrity and showing 
incompetence if there is any because taxpayers have invested in 
295 people to look after their interests. The government can brag 
about what it has done and done right. I wish it would not distort 
the truth, though.
<P>
	I wish the minister of myth would use reality rather than fiction. 
I have to point out what he is doing wrong. That is wrong. It is 
wrong to talk to Canadians that way. What is right is to talk about 
the whole picture. A true financial picture has assets and liabilities. 
People have to talk about their liabilities and not only their assets. 
Although he has done well on the deficit, what the government 
should be doing is targeting the debt as a percentage of GDP.
<P>
	On a federal basis currently that is running at 76 per cent. Our 
debt at close to $600 billion is 76 per cent of our GDP. If the 
provincial debts are combined with that, we are at a trillion dollars. 
We are at 104 per cent debt to GDP. That is very high and the credit 
rating goes to risk.
<P>
	Control over finances is not in our hands when 40 per cent of that 
debt is outside the country. My contribution to the government is to 
make it aware of the facts, remind it of the facts and hope it 
addresses the facts. That is how I help.
<P>
	The government, the finance minister and the Prime Minister 
have the power to act. We do not. There are so many things the 
government is missing that it may sound  like a diatribe on poor 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3194"> 3194 </A></B>
<P>
government, but for me to talk about all the good ideas that we 
have would take another week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to support the Reform supply motion on government 
broken promises.
<P>
	I refer to the Prime Minister's statement in 1993 during the 
election that ``there will not be a promise I do not keep''. Those 
words ring very clear in my mind given that during the campaign in 
my riding of Calgary Northeast it was a very heated time.
<P>
	It became very intense over one issue in my riding, criminal 
justice. There was a calling to account from all the candidates 
about what they would do about the crime problem in the country. 
There was concern about the Young Offenders Act, early release, 
what is happening in our prisons and why the police are not able to 
enforce the law adequately and uniformly.
<P>
	Of course the Prime Minister and the red book reflected how safe 
the streets would be under a Liberal government. The problem at 
that time was the streets were made unsafe by previous Liberal 
governments. Another Liberal government came forward with 
statements that it would make people feel much more safe and that 
it would look after the violence that was increasing in society.
<P>
	I refer to 1962 stats and compare them with stats of 1994. In 
1962 there were 221 violent incidents per 100,000 population in 
Canada. In 1994 the violent crime rate increased to 1,037 per 
100,000 population. That represents a 369 per cent increase in 
police reported violent crime over a 32 year period.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	I was a police officer during those years. I could see crime 
increase over my tenure with the Calgary city police force. Nobody 
here, especially those on that side of the House, could ever tell me 
or the people in this country that violent crime has not increased by 
at least that percentage, regardless of what Statistics Canada is 
telling everyone here, and those on the government side believing 
violent crime and crime in general are going down.
<P>
	Let us look at the broad picture. In 1962, 221 violent crimes per 
100,000 population as opposed to 1,037 in 1994. That speaks for 
itself. Most of that is a result of Liberal policy initiated by not only 
this government but the two previous governments.
<P>
	Let us look at some of the statements regarding the present 
policy as passed by this Liberal government. The government 
started with a bang. It started with the gun control bill. The 
government said it will among other measures counter illegal 
importation of banned and restricted firearms into Canada and 
prohibit anyone convicted of an indictable drug related offence, a 
stalking offence or any other violent offence from owning or 
possessing a gun. That is quite a mouthful.
<P>
	Go to Cornwall and see what kind of importation is going on. Go 
to Cornwall and find out what the smuggling problem is in that area 
of the province. There is a smuggling problem there and it includes 
illegal firearms.
<P>
	The Liberal government keeps nattering about what a great job it 
is doing clamping down on smuggling, especially the smuggling of 
firearms. It is a joke. The government is doing absolutely nothing 
to counter the smuggling problem. It is happening in several areas 
across the country on the border of the United States.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How do you know that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> I have been there. I tell you to go there.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I remind the 
hon. member to put his remarks through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Madam Speaker, I will do so. I tell that member to 
go there if he questions whether there is a smuggling problem in 
this country. Either that or the Liberal members as always are 
burying their heads in the sand if they cannot realize there is a 
problem relating to smuggling. It is not just firearms but drugs and 
alcohol. Ninety per cent of the illegal alcohol being smuggled into 
the country comes through that area over by Cornwall. There are 
cigarettes and other contraband.
<P>
	The Liberal government is ignoring the plight of many people in 
the country who are really being burdened by this type of crime in 
their communities. I refer to another area, Ipperwash, where the 
law is not enforced adequately or equally. There is an entire 
community in Pasangquet whose property values have decreased to 
such a degree that it does not know how it will survive after 
investing considerable sums in those properties. The government 
sits on its duff. The solicitor general sits on his duff and does 
nothing to intervene. This is a crime in itself. It is falling on the 
shoulders of this government and the solicitor general for not doing 
something about it.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	People not only in those two regions I just mentioned but also in 
urban Canada are very concerned about their safety. They are very 
concerned that the law is not adequately applied. I will turn to 
Toronto, Vancouver and the lower mainland. I suggest to the 
member for Halifax that she go to those two regions to see for 
herself just how the people in those cities are being victimized. 
They feel so much tension because of the crime in their cities. It all 
comes down to the enforcement of the law. People desire that. They 
seek government intervention in the whole area of safety. It is the 
responsibility of the government to ensure it happens.
<P>
	I know many government members cannot grasp this, but it is 
unfortunate there are areas in our major cities where crime is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3195"> 3195 </A></B>
<P>
unchecked. The safety of many people is being jeopardized. The 
government talks about safe streets and safe homes. Nonsense. It 
has done nothing to make our homes and our streets any safer.
<P>
	I will briefly touch on the Young Offenders Act. My colleague, 
the member for Crowfoot, is doing a more than adequate job in 
researching the Young Offenders Act. The government has had two 
and one-half years to straighten it around and it still has done 
nothing to address the major concerns people have. People want the 
age for young offenders lowered. They want those 11-year olds 
who commit rape charged. They want to see those who commit 
violent crime charged and tried as adults. They want to see 
punishment in the system. It does not exist. It is a joke.
<P>
	Government members are reluctant to face reality. The member 
from Don Valley forgot to add reality to the reasons for being a 
Liberal. He did not refer to the reality that people's lives are being 
jeopardized, many by a very small element, the young offenders 
who are not being punished.
<P>
	Government members should look at the detention centres and 
prisons across the country. The justice minister and the solicitor 
general can talk all they want about making things tough but it is 
only rhetoric. They are doing absolutely nothing to tighten up the 
problems which exist within our prison system or our detention 
centres.
<P>
	As an example of some recent problems we could look to the 
women's detention centre, or jail, in Edmonton. I call it a 
retirement home, a comfort cottage. The prisoners in that home 
murdered another prisoner. The warden was told there would be a 
major problem if one particular woman was integrated into the 
regular population. The warden ignored the advice. Corrections 
ignored any advice it was given.
<P>
	It was a philosophy which was supported by the solicitor 
general. It was decided to create that type of incarceration, that 
type of facility. The programs which followed were suggested by 
CSC. The minister supported it. As a result, a few weeks after the 
prison opened, one person was murdered and one-quarter of the 
prison population walked away. I say walked because all they had 
to do was step over a four-foot fence and walk away.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The government claimed it was going to make our streets and 
our homes safer. Where is the safety? The philosophy adopted by 
the cabinet, the solicitor general and the justice minister is to 
contrary. They say one thing and do another. Our streets are no 
safer. In fact it is the opposite.
<P>
	Given the fact that facilities such as the women's prison in 
Edmonton can have those serious problems within a few short 
weeks of opening just shows the mentality of what is really 
happening within that system.  This should be of concern to all of 
us. The reality is that crime is not being punished. Our streets are 
not safe and our homes are being jeopardized even more every day. 
Individuals have to lock themselves up in their own homes while 
the criminals run around free.
<P>
	The Liberal government talks about the rehabilitation of sex 
offenders. It has expressed concern about releasing sex offenders 
into society. If we look at some of the recent releases it is clear that 
individuals who are being released are not being punished. They 
are not being rehabilitated. They are refusing to participate in any 
form of treatment and are refusing to co-operate with prison 
officials. They are refusing to follow the minimum requirements. 
This is despite the warnings that if released these individuals will 
reoffend.
<P>
	They are serious sexual offenders and that is what is happening. 
They are being released back into society and are jeopardizing the 
communities in which they are placed. As a result, many of them 
are reoffending. Efforts have been made to stop this process or at 
least to identify those who are being released. What has happened 
instead? The government has ordered the RCMP not to release any 
information about these individuals to the communities or to any 
groups that want to protect their communities. This is insanity.
<P>
	Right now Liberal members are laughing. This is not a laughing 
matter. This is serious business.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> No one is laughing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> I am appalled at their actions sometimes.
<P>
	Those are just a couple of points which really make it clear, and 
it should be clear to Canadians, that the government is not serious 
about doing anything with regard to making our homes and streets 
safer. The government is not serious about punishing offenders. It 
is not serious about making those offenders more productive when 
they are released. It is absolutely astounding.
<P>
	Probably for the most part the majority of members on that side 
of the House have never been inside a prison.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Probably not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> It is certainly a learning experience.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> How long did you spend there?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> A member across the way just asked how long I 
have spent in the prison system. I have spent the last two and 
one-half years visiting the majority of this country's prisons. I 
invite members on the other side of the House to do the same.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	A recent study done by the Fraser Institute identified some 
economic factors revolving around crime, public safety and 
security. It put together a list on the costs of crime which included 
victimization, policing and private security, court and legal 
proceedings, corrections and  shattered lives. The total costs 
incorporated in the list I have just stated are estimated to be $37 
billion

annually. That is almost one-third of the annual budget. The costs 
of the social impact of crime are almost one-third of the annual 
budget. The Liberal government has not done anything to make our 
streets and homes safer. It is another broken promise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, in his 
remarks the member made suggestions about two systems of law 
and that in certain parts of the country alcohol and firearms are 
being smuggled in. Those are serious allegations.
<P>
	The member has some background in the legal system and in law 
enforcement. I would be interested in knowing whether he has 
proof of these allegations. If he does, why has he not brought it 
forward or is it just more Reform rhetoric, taking it to the extreme? 
There is some smuggling, which is probably true but to make it 
sound like it is coming in by the truckload to Cornwall, I think is a 
little far fetched.
<P>
	Would the member tell us where he is getting his statistics and 
whether there is any validity to them? Could he also tell us which 
communities he is referring to? He is being somewhat careful with 
his wording. My understanding is that he is referring to aboriginal 
communities. If that is right, then why not come out and say so?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Madam Speaker, I will be pleased to relate any 
information which reflects on certain communities in the country. 
One of course is the Cornwall area.
<P>
	If the member will recall, approximately six months ago a police 
report, a joint forces report, was presented to Parliament. It 
reflected the very point that alcohol, cigarettes and other 
contraband are being smuggled through those areas. Guns were 
also included in the list. I am not speaking out of school and I am 
not speaking off the top of my hat. It was in the police report. There 
have also been references to such in the news media from time to 
time. If the member so desires, I can pick up those press releases 
for him.
<P>
	Am I referring to a particular group? In this case the member 
mentioned aboriginal people. Let me put it this way. I am referring 
to organized criminals. It is a well-known fact that Cornwall is a 
gravitation point for organized criminals of all stripes because it 
happens to be a point of entry for contraband.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	My concern is with the effects of organized crime and the 
influence of organized criminals in those regions. That is one and I 
could reflect on others if the member so desires.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member chastised the government for its failure 
to live up to what he says are its promises when he knows there is a 
list of enactments the House has dealt with concerning law 
enforcement issues, some of which he has supported and some of 
which he has opposed. All have been brought before the House in 
accordance with the promises made in the red book.
<P>
	I am surprised that with a motion of this kind that does not 
mention law and order issues he would bring this up. This is one of 
the areas in which the government has been most active. It has dealt 
with changes in the criminal law of the country. We have changes 
in the criminal law itself. We have had changes in the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act and so on. We have had many 
legislative changes in respect of young offenders. Ongoing work is 
being done in committee in this area as we speak.
<P>
	I am surprised the hon. member raised this subject. Perhaps he 
did not clear it with his leader. Could the member tell us whether he 
is still advocating caning as a means of stamping out crime in 
Canada? If so, perhaps he could tell us the results of the studies he 
has conducted in this regard and whether he made it to Singapore to 
get the true facts on this subject.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands for the question which gives me an 
opportunity to clarify a lot.
<P>
	It is important for the House and those watching to recognize 
there is a concern about punishment in this country. People are 
concerned that offenders who have committed all kinds of 
offences, some violent, are not being punished. I have been to 
many town hall meetings across the country. The member for 
Kingston and the Islands has spent much of his time in his own 
community and has not wandered much beyond its borders. There 
is a concern that criminals are not being punished for the acts they 
commit. The matter of corporal punishment has come forward 
several times.
<P>
	At no time have I ever advocated corporal punishment. At no 
time have I ever advocated caning, but I have suggested we study 
the issue of corporal punishment. That matter has only lately been 
removed from the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The member has given me a book on Singapore and the corporal 
punishment issue there. He is obviously supportive of it because 
the book is supportive of it. I suggest the member pursue the matter 
a little further.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I really do 
not want to change the subject but I would like to get back to the 
topic. I read the resolution put forward by the hon. member from 
the third party. The resolution shows the hon. member is certainly 
talking through his riding name, Medicine Hat.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3197"> 3197 </A></B>
<P>
	There a number of things that need to be addressed in response 
to this opposition motion. I will discuss job creation, which the 
third party seems to think is a broken promise. I will throw a few 
words around like infrastructure. The number of infrastructure 
projects in my riding alone has created an incredible number of 
jobs over the last two years, water and sewer projects, highway 
projects, bridges, et cetera.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	I will not talk about in Halifax the construction of the new 
Neptune Theatre which is not just creating jobs but a magnificent 
cultural centre in the Atlantic region. I will not even talk much 
about St. George's Church, one of the great historic sites in Canada 
that was nearly destroyed by fire. Through a variety of funding 
sources, and not an inconsiderable source from the federal 
government, jobs were created in Halifax in the north end of 
Halifax where jobs are crucial and necessary. We created very 
special jobs, bringing back old trades, old arts and crafts and 
artisanship that we would have lost in Atlantic Canada and in 
Canada across the board. The department of heritage was really 
doing something to ensure this part of our heritage was preserved.
<P>
	I want to talk for a minute when it comes to job creation, in 
which the member for Winnipeg Transcona is interested, about 
ACOA in my region, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, 
which has created 80,000 jobs in our region in the last two and a 
half years. Again, the hon. member is clearly talking through his 
head covering.
<P>
	The same money from ACOA that created 80,000 jobs has seen 
over the last two and a half years a two dollar return in taxes in 
Atlantic Canada for every dollar spent. I ask everyone in this 
House, is that value for money? I'll say it is. Is that good 
investment? I'll say it is. Is that keeping our promises in Atlantic 
Canada? I'll say it is.
<P>
	I have two words for hon. members across the way about safe 
streets, gun control. I could not be happier that I was a part of the 
party and the government that saw that law passed to increase the 
safety of Canadians on our streets and on our country roads.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Why is crime up?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I remember on television somebody asking who 
will you believe, me or your own two eyes? The words are, crime is 
not up in Canada, it is down.
<P>
	That does not fit their agenda. They do not like it. It only 
happens to be the truth. To get back to my mutton, what have we 
done on safe streets? We passed the hate crime legislation, which 
they did not support. We passed amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act, and the justice committee as we speak is going 
around the country consulting with Canadians to see how we can 
better-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> We are home.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Yes, I know. I was being alliterative. I know the 
hon. member opposite and other members of the justice committee 
will soon be travelling again, listening to and consulting with 
Canadians on further amendments to make the Young Offenders 
Act a better act and to ensure we make the kinds of interventions 
that stop young people before we lose them entirely.
<P>
	Crime overall is decreasing in Canada, but that is not a good 
news agenda our colleagues in the third party want to hear about. 
When it comes to things they note in this unusual and rather silly 
motion, I and a lot of other Canadians are getting a little tired of 
this. We have a government in which ministers are responsible to 
the country, who consult with the country, who listen to Canadians 
and who respond. They even respond to some of the unusual and 
bizarre questions put forward by the third party. Let us talk about 
integrity in government. Let us talk about Sheila Copps.
<P>
	The promise that was made in the red book was kept. I am tired 
of the members opposite and their bad news agenda. I am tired of 
sanctimony. I am tired of judgmental attitudes and a meanspirited 
reaction to any and all people who do not share their narrow, rigid, 
blinkered view of this country and its people.
<P>
	Did Sheila Copps go far during her campaign? Yes, she did. Did 
she go further than the red book promised? It can be suggested she 
went too far. The hon. member over there called her toast. I suggest 
the hon. member wait until the day after the byelection. We will see 
who is toasted the day after the byelection.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Those of us who are proud to call Sheila colleague know that her 
energy, her commitment and her sheer exuberance can sometimes 
cause her to say and do things that may be over the top for the 
duller of wit and slower of eye that sometime sit in the House. I say 
God bless Sheila. God bless her fearlessness. Without her the 
country would be without a powerful, articular and courageous 
advocate.
<P>
	With regard to her action in the wake of her own private promise, 
perhaps those in the Reform Party do things without consulting 
their executives, their colleagues and their families. Sheila made 
her decision, the correct one, after consulting and informing those 
people who were, are and will be in future part of her team. She did 
it right. She marched to her own drummer. She said she would 
resign. Because she could not keep the promise she made, she 
resigned. She never said she would not reoffer, because the people 
of Hamilton deserve and have a right to the best representative they 
have ever had and every could have.
<P>
	To the member for Medicine Hat, the author of this funny little 
motion, I will wager anything he would care to wager, name it, that 
Sheila Copps with her great heart, with her great spirit, with her 
courage, her  determination, most particularly with her horror of 
bigotry, with her horror of racism, with her horror of injustice, will 
back in the House. She will shine in the House when the third party 
<P>

is a dusty footnote in a dusty textbook on a forgotten bookshelf. I 
leave my wager open to the hon. member for Medicine Hat.

	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
talk about an important measure the government has taken, a 
concrete measure to create jobs.
<P>
	Industry Canada together with Dalhousie University and the 
Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada has begun the 
student connection program. This program will send out 2,000 
senior university students across the country to introduce small and 
medium size businesses and voluntary organizations to the 
Internet. They will train people in middle and upper management 
in these businesses to use the Internet to support their own decision 
making processes. They will be taught how to use Internet sites like 
Strategis, the largest Canadian source of information on business 
on the information highway.
<P>
	All Canadians are concerned about jobs, especially the young. 
This program is aimed not only at helping business use information 
technology but at creating jobs for young people, a very 
worthwhile goal.
<P>
	Since we took office as a government the economy has created 
636,000 new jobs in Canada. The student connection program 
alone will directly create 2,000 work term jobs.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
Minister for International Trade was mayor of Toronto, he was 
angered when the federal government designated Montreal and 
Vancouver as international banking centres while the city of 
Toronto was refused this status.
<P>
	The former mayor called the decision: ``Crass politics at its 
worst. All this adds up to is bad news for Toronto because we have 
been openly discriminated against by the federal government''.
<P>
	On June 8, 1994 during question period I asked the finance 
minister when the government would designate Toronto as an 
international banking centre. His answer: ``When we have 
completed the examination I will be delighted to respond to the 
member''.
<P>
	Three things are now clear. First, the minister has had nearly two 
years to examine the question, but this Liberal government is 
continuing to ignore Ontario.
<P>
	Second, with the election of a new government in Ontario last 
year, the province said it is open for business. Why will this Liberal 
government not insist in getting out that message.
<P>
	Third, although there are currently 94 Liberal MPs from Ontario, 
it is obvious that we do not need any more in Ottawa. Voters in 
Hamilton East have an opportunity to tell the Liberals what they 
think of ineffective representation.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
political culture of Canada took a step back from the prevailing 
dangerous imbalance when the NDP was re-elected in B.C.
<P>
	The truth of the matter, to use a hockey analogy, is that the right 
wing, neo-Conservative, neo-Liberal corporate agenda has been 
enjoying a breakaway in Canada since 1993. Federal Liberals have 
been out-torying the Tories, provincial Liberals in B.C. and New 
Brunswick look and sound like Reformers, Klein and Harris 
out-reform the Reformers and the provincial Tories in Manitoba 
quietly outdo them all.

<P>
	Reformers and Tories talk about unifying the right wing. The 
right wing is already unified under the Liberals. Liberals, 
Reformers and Tories, it is all the same agenda.
<P>
	The B.C. NDP ran against that agenda and won. There is 
somebody on the blue line and in the net after all. It is the NDP. The 
NDP is the alternative to the Liberal-Tory-Reform coalition and we 
will restore political balance to this place and this country come the

	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada is 
among the top 10 countries in the world when it comes to economic 
competitiveness, according to study of 49 countries released 
yesterday by the World Economic Forum.
<P>
	This reinforces the message to foreign investors that Canada is 
an excellent place to invest. It also offers a positive sign that 
Canada can expect continued strong economic growth over the next 
decade.
<P>
	Among its G-7 partners, Canada is ranked the second most 
competitive and much of the credit for this goes to this Liberal 
government. Since assuming office, the government has taken 
concrete steps to get Canada's fiscal house in order. Inflation and 
interest rates have remained low and personal taxes have not been 
raised. Furthermore the deficit is on its way out.
<P>
	Further, the new national sales tax harmonization initiative will 
lower costs for businesses and increase the competitiveness of 
Canadian products and services in the global marketplace. In short, 
the government is creating the ideal climate for real and sustained 
economic growth and job creation.
<P>

progress it is making in ensuring opportunity for Canadians and 
Canadian businesses all over the world.

Speaker, 125 years ago the Canadian Manufacturers' Association

an act incorporating the CMA with objectives to promote Canadian 
industries and to further the interests of Canadian manufacturers

Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt in the aftermath of Tuesday's 
school bus hijacking by two teenagers. The school bus was loaded 
with young students who were taken on a horrific journey from one 
part of my constituency to another. It was a relief for all of us that 
the incident ended without injury or loss of life.
<P>
	Canadians want the rights of victims placed above the rights of 
the accused in the justice system, but these two perpetrators are 
protected by the Young Offenders Act. Their identities are 
protected. Canadians feel that regardless of age, kidnapping, 
hijacking and the use of firearms in the commission of an offence

also how to behave like members of a society. The dedication of the

side in at least three ridings that were examined, but Mr. CÃ´tÃ© 
concluded that there was no national conspiracy to undermine 
democracy.

	More than 60,000 perfectly good ``no'' ballots were illegally 
rejected by sovereignist officials, but CÃ´tÃ© considered this less 
serious than freedom of expression at the Montreal rally.

parliamentary democracy to me as well, because I, too, am an 
immigrant and I, too, am a sovereignist.
<P>
	However, like my colleague, I realized that the federal yoke was 
preventing my adopted province from reaching the potential it 
could as a sovereign nation. Heeding the invitation issued to my 
colleague, the member for Bourassa, by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, I therefore decided to find myself another 
country. The country I picked was Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
24 jobs in Kelowna, 63 jobs in Vancouver, 145 jobs in Calgary, 43 
jobs in Edmonton, 89 jobs in Winnipeg, 61 jobs in Ottawa, 64 jobs 
in Toronto, 109 jobs in Hamilton: 595 Canadian jobs provided by 
Greyhound Air. Will it fly? ``Can't do it'', says the NTA. 
``Regulatory restrictions'', shrugs the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	The Liberal government has had three years to make changes 
that would give Canadian business an advantage and ensure fair 
competition. Why has it not been done? Why must businesses like 
Kelowna Flightcraft go to court to prove it has the right to do 
business in its own country?
<P>
	Clearly too many lawyers and not enough business people are 
running this country. That would change under a Reform 
government.
<P>
	Economic recovery, opportunity and jobs. Those were the 
promises. By hijacking Canadian business with regulatory 
restrictions? By forcing Canadian businesses to take a nosedive? 
That is not acceptable. We do not think so.

	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today in Ottawa we have 10 Canadian children who have been 
named Children's Miracle Network champions by the Children's 
Hospital Foundation.
<P>
	Sierra Harrold, who is nine years old, is the B.C. champion and 
resides in Fort Nelson. Sierra has Gaucher disease, a rare metabolic 
disorder which causes ongoing bone thinning, liver and spleen 
damage, anemia, susceptibility to infections and the likelihood of 
brain damage.
<P>
	Sierra has been treated at the B.C. Children's Hospital for the 
last seven years. She will continue to be treated, but she is 
improving and remains a champion through lengthy, painful 
treatments. Sierra and her other champion friends will go to Disney 
World, an award to honour her bravery and that of the other 
champions.
<P>
	During the weekend in Vancouver I co-hosted the Italian B.C. 
Children's Hospital telethon. The Italians donated about $100,000 
to the cause. This money will be presented to the B.C. Children's 
Hospital Foundation on June 1 and 2 during the annual telethon.
<P>
	Today I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating Sierra Harrold and the other nine Canadian 
Children's Miracle Network champions.

would like to take this opportunity to welcome some true Canadian 
heroes to the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1415 )</B>
<P>
	Ten children from across Canada have been chosen as Children's 
Miracle Network champions and the Speaker and Prime Minister 
will be presenting them with special medallions this afternoon in 
recognition of their triumphs over illness and life challenging 
problems. The champions are accompanied by two other 
well-known Canadian champions, Rick Hansen and Mark 
Tewksbury.
<P>
	The 13 CMN hospitals in Canada specialize in the treatment of 
children with a wide variety of afflictions such as cancer, birth 
defects, heart and muscular diseases as well as accident victims.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to particularly congratulate 10-year old 
Chris Stephens, a CMN champion from my riding of 
Lanark-Carleton. Best wishes to all of you. Let us all support the 
Children's Miracle Network so it can continue to provide help for 
Canadian children everywhere.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Human Resources Development has just 
this morning released a document presenting his manpower policy. 
Briefing Note No. 2 describes the post-negotiation arrangements 
with the provinces as ``enabling the provinces to deliver active 
employment measures funded from the employment insurance 
fund''.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Are we to conclude from this statement that the 
federal government reserves for itself the responsibility for 
defining policy with respect to active employment measures?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, no. Obviously I hope that we 
shall succeed in finding ways of meeting the requirements of all 
provinces and territories. There will be differences, no doubt; the 
agreements will differ from one province to another. Certainly, the 
available resources, the wishes, the systems in place to deliver 
programs will differ.
<P>
	The objective, however, is to ensure that, where provinces wish 
to take over in this sector, we will be able to reach an arrangement 
based on negotiations, on a true agreement characterized by 
partnership and collaboration. It is not our intent to impose 
conditions and to drive a hard bargain in these negotiations. We 
want to obtain something that will work well, so as to prove to 
Canadians that federalism works.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you will understand our concerns when the document 
refers to allowing the provinces to deliver active employment 
measures. It does not refer in the same terms to defining policy.
<P>
	My second question for the minister is this. By reaffirming in 
these documents his responsibility to ``ensure that funds are spent 
effectively and efficiently'', does the minister confirm that the 
federal government is thus retaining responsibility for monitoring 
results and for final assessment of the programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we believe that, through these 
negotiations, we can arrive at the kind of results we all want. We 
will proceed via negotiation, via agreement. No province would 
accept our simply forcing our criteria on them, deciding how our 
programs should be delivered, nor our deciding unilaterally what 
results we would like to obtain.
<P>
	These are all elements which will enable us to reach agreements 
with provinces such as Prince Edward Island, in which resources 
and the ability to deliver programs might be far more limited than 
in Ontario, for example.
<P>
	The entire undertaking is based on the willingness of the 
Government of Canada to find means of co-operating so that we 
may, in the case of Quebec for instance, respond to the consensus 
we know exists in that province between the unions, the Conseil du 
patronat, the chambers of commerce and the Government of 
Quebec. All Quebecers have a vision of the way they would like to 
see this sector of active measures operate. I believe that we will be 
able to get results that will match those needs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has just confirmed that the federal 
government's plans depend on an agreement between the federal 
and the provincial governments.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Will the minister admit that, failing an agreement with a 
government, the Government of Quebec for instance, the new 
Employment Insurance Act will apply, which is more or less like 
saying that the minister has set all the conditions for a negotiation 
where he is holding all the cards? In reality this comes down to 
saying ``Negotiate and reach agreement with me, or else I apply my 
legislation''. That is the situation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker. In this area, I believe that 
there will be an attempt to do things so that the results will, I think, 
match what everyone wants. It will be difficult, without a doubt. 
Negotiating bilateral agreements with ten provinces and the 
territories will be complicated.
<P>
	Finally I believe, and this is obvious, that whether in Quebec or 
anywhere else, governments, members of parliament, ministers, 
first ministers, all have one objective. More than a million people 
in Canada, including Quebec, have no jobs. At the end of the 
exercise, when all of the negotiations are concluded, it is my hope 
that everyone will be trying in good faith to find solutions to allow 
men and women in search of a job to find one, and to prepare them, 
while they are searching for a job, to be good employees.
<P>
	That is the object of the exercise, and I believe we have taken a 
giant step forward today by demonstrating that Canada can be open 
to new ways of doing things.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is also for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. I say to him that, for things to go the way he has just 
said, the past cannot be assumed to guarantee the future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	We were stupefied this morning by the government's 
announcement of its withdrawal from manpower training and the 
subsequent end to financial assistance in this area.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that, after the three year period, 
financial assistance for manpower training will end and that the 
provinces will be forced to assume the cost of it on their own?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the federal government has long 
been asked to withdraw from manpower training. We announced 
nothing new in this area this morning. We have already said, on 
many occasions, including in the throne speech, and the Prime 
Minister has announced it, that the Government of Canada would 
be withdrawing from manpower training.
<P>
	Moreover, we have always indicated in our budget forecasts that 
funding for all these programs would drop to zero at the end of 
three years. We have already considerably reduced the amount of 
money earmarked for training.
<P>
	Since we have to withdraw from this sector, because 
employment insurance and manpower training are two fairly 
different things, we are withdrawing and have been continuing to 
reduce the funding to zero.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
means no compensation for respecting exclusive jurisdiction.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that the money invested by the federal 
government in training comes from the unemployment insurance 
fund and that the provinces, which do not have access to this fund, 
will be forced to take over responsibility on their own using their 
own resources?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, certainly there were programs 
where training was financed out of the consolidated fund. What we 
are saying is that we have been easing out of training in the area, 
for example, of the direct purchase of space in CEGEPs and 
community colleges and in the purchase of training contracts from 
the private sector. We have planned for some time in all our budget 
forecasts not only to participate less in this sector but to cut funding 
as well.
<P>
	That said, with part II of the Employment Insurance Act still 
before Parliament and with our upcoming negotiations with the 
provinces that would be interested in pursuing the proposal we 
tabled today, I hope that we will continue to find the means to 
provide job training throughout the country to those who need it.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The defence minister thinks it is acceptable to hand out pork 
barrel contracts to campaign pals to do political work, all at 
taxpayers' expense. The minister broke Treasury Board guidelines 
by contract splitting. Canadians found this kind of patronage 
unacceptable from Mulroney and Canadians find it unacceptable 
now.
<P>
	Why will the Prime Minister not raise his ethical standards to at 
least the level of Brian Mulroney's and put an end to this patronage 
budget abuse by his Minister of National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Secretary of State 
(Veterans)(Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister will be back in the House tomorrow. He will 
respond to questions involving the individual who handled the file 
for the Greek community across Canada.
<P>
	It is important to note that the changes that were brought about 
by the 1995 budget brought the War Veterans Allowance Act back 
to its original intent. That was not to pay resistance fighters from 
foreign countries. It was to pay the allied veterans who became 
Canadian citizens and our Canadian veterans. This move saves $30 
million for the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence has been caught abusing his 
budget and breaching Treasury Board guidelines, all to reward 
campaign pals. Let us look at the facts. Two contracts that the 
minister issued overlapped and amounted to $50,000. The work for 
each contract was the same. Last week the deputy secretary of the 
Treasury Board stated that it is not acceptable to contract split and 
when it happens, disciplinary action must be taken.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister obey the rules set down by 
Treasury Board and discipline the Minister of National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
rules about contract splitting are clear. They indicate that if a 
contract is for the same purpose, the same object and if the contract 
is given at the time when it should be above $30,000, it should not 
be the sole source. The rules also indicate that if the contract is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3204"> 3204 </A></B>
<P>
below $30,000 and is for an object that at the time the  contract is 
given is believed to be studied within the $30,000, this is according 
to the guidelines. This is what I understand happened in this case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my second supplementary is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence violated Treasury Board 
guidelines. The Prime Minister cannot escape the facts. The 
defence minister issued four contracts to Karabekos. Some of the 
contracts overlapped.
<P>
	The work on the contracts was the same. This is one of the most 
blatant examples of contract splitting we have ever seen. Senior 
officials from Treasury Board have said that disciplinary action 
should take place.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister again: Will he take immediate action 
and discipline the Minister of National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the President of the Treasury Board studied the problem. 
It was within the guidelines established by the Treasury Board. 
There is no need to discipline the minister.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	In a ministerial statement yesterday, the Minister of Justice 
indicated that he was responsible for ensuring the independence of 
the judiciary and the integrity of the justice system. Yet the 
minister refused to order an inquiry into the actions of the two 
federal court judges who have violated their duty to remain neutral 
and impartial. His inaction has now prompted the judicial council 
to open an inquiry into the actions of Justices Isaac and Jerome.
<P>
	Why did the Minister of Justice skirt his responsibilities under 
the Judges Act and not order himself an inquiry into this serious 
matter calling into question the impartiality of the chief justice of 
the federal court?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the first instance based on the 
facts of this case as I know them, I do not believe it is an 
appropriate circumstance for me to ask for an inquiry under section 
63(1) of the Judges Act.
<P>
	On the other hand, the judicial council has jurisdiction to 
consider the matter. Anyone is at liberty to file a complaint with the 
judicial council. What is more to the point, I now understand that 
the chair of the judicial conduct committee of the judicial council 
has asked Chief  Justice Isaac to explain the circumstances of his 
communications with Ted Thompson of the Department of Justice. 
The judicial conduct committee, based on the explanation 
furnished by Chief Justice Isaac, will decide whether further steps 
are required.
<P>
	The public can be satisfied that the judicial council itself has 
initiated a process in this matter which will result in an 
adjudication by judges of the appropriateness of the conduct of 
Chief Justice Isaac.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> It is true, Mr. 
Speaker, that anyone can file a complaint with the judicial council, 
but the difference is that, when the complaint comes from the 
Minister of Justice of Canada, the council has to initiate an inquiry. 
That makes quite a difference.
<P>
	I would like the minister to tell us why he is still refusing to file a 
complaint, in his capacity as justice minister, against the chief 
justice of the federal court. Could it be that he is afraid of having to 
appear before the board of inquiry? Does he have a guilty 
conscience?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just came from an appearance 
before the justice committee of the House on which the hon. 
member sits. If I can face the justice committee, I can face any 
tribunal in the land.
<P>
	The fact is that our focus, my focus as minister, arising from this 
event has been on the litigation because we have three important 
revocation cases before the federal court. We do not want to see 
those cases lost or stayed and we have been arguing that they 
should not be. That matter I know is before the court. Then I turn to 
the matter inside the department and the question of how a senior 
justice official acted. I spoke to that issue yesterday. We have a 
process in place to deal with that.
<P>
	When it comes to the chief justice, it seems to me that the matter 
should be left to the judicial council. I have not felt it necessary or 
appropriate to require an inquiry. I have already told the House that 
the judicial conduct committee of the council will be considering 
the circumstances of this case. I have every confidence it will do so 
thoroughly and objectively and that any required action will be 
taken by that council.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting to note that there are three offices of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs located in Toronto. One of them, the Toronto north 
office, is actually located in the defence minister's own riding of 
Don Valley East. The job of that office is to explain veterans affairs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3205"> 3205 </A></B>
<P>
to veterans. Apparently the minister did not trust his own 
departmental employees to do their job and instead hired a 
political hack.
<P>
	When he has such direct access to his own departmental 
professionals, why did the minister have to hire a music conductor 
to explain veterans affairs to veterans?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Secretary of State 
(Veterans)(Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I indicated, the minister will be in the House tomorrow 
and will respond to any questions dealing with the gentleman who 
dealt with the file on the Greek community across Canada.
<P>
	There are a number of veterans affairs offices across Canada 
which deal with specific issues. This was a major change in 
legislation that affected a lot of people. That is why this individual 
was hired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
apparently the qualifications for these political appointments are 
not as important as how you conducted yourself during the last 
election campaign. The main qualification seems to be that you had 
to be a worker on the defence minister's own campaign staff. 
Incredibly the defence minister says that is just the way it works 
here in Ottawa.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister do something? Will he refer this issue to 
the ethics counsellor? Will he ask that the defence minister pay 
back the $150,000? Will he discipline the defence minister in some 
way, or is this really the way things are done in the ChrÃ©tien 
government?
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would encourage you not to use our 
names in here. We should use our titles when we are addressing 
questions and also when we are giving answers.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel MassÃ© (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have explained already the fact that there are two types of budgets. 
Departmental budgets are there in order to study and implement 
government policies. There are strict rules of employment. There 
are also exempt staff budgets. They are called that because the staff 
is exempt from certain rules. These rules exist as much for 
members of Parliament as they exist for ministers. There are hon. 
members by the way who have their campaign managers on staff 
and I can name them.
<P>
	Under exempt staff rules the minister can employ staff who have 
a partisan relationship, and they are exempted by the rules from the 
normal rules that apply to the public service.

	<B>Mr. FranÃ§ois Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	In a ministerial statement yesterday, the Minister of Justice 
commented on a serious case of undue interference by an assistant 
deputy attorney general with the chief justice of the federal court. 
Faced with such a flagrant case of interference in the judicial 
process, the minister announced that an inquiry would be held.
<P>
	Can the minister assert from his seat that he was not aware in any 
way of the representations made to the chief justice of the federal 
court by his assistant deputy attorney general?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I can say plainly and 
unequivocally that I did not know until after the event that Mr. Ted 
Thompson had visited, communicated with or spoken to the chief 
justice about these matters.
<P>
	Within a couple of weeks, and I think it was within a week of the 
meeting of March 1, I learned from the deputy minister that the 
associate deputy attorney general had had the communication with 
Chief Justice Isaac. At that point we ensured that the documents 
were put into the hands of counsel for the three parties. Indeed, it 
was at Ted Thompson's order that it was done and then matters 
went forward from there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. FranÃ§ois Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
circumstances, does the minister have any objections to releasing 
the report of the inquiry into this matter?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker. I have already said that we will 
make public the actions that are taken as a result of the internal 
inquiry by Mr. Dubin. The former chief justice of Ontario has 
agreed to meet with justice officials who were involved. Indeed I 
met with him over the lunch hour to respond to his questions. We 
have opened up the files. We have invited him to speak to 
whomever he wishes. I look forward to his report.
<P>
	I recognize that the Department of Justice above all departments 
of government should demonstrate a standard of conduct that is 
entirely above reproach. By asking for this advice from Mr. Dubin 
we hope to demonstrate that we are committed to doing just that.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the justice 
minister learned about this meeting between his senior official and 
Chief Justice Isaac a week after it occurred, could he please tell 
the House when he ordered the inquiry into the activities of his 
senior official?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if my hon. friend refers to the 
appointment of former Chief Justice Dubin, that was done within 
the last week.
<P>
	I can tell my hon. friend and the House that the minute the 
deputy minister told me the meeting had occurred I asked for his 
assurances that we were going to find out what the facts were, have 
a complete internal investigation and that was done.
<P>
	From the moment that it came to the attention of justice officials 
that Ted Thompson had been to see the chief justice, steps were 
taken to find out exactly what happened, to get copies of the 
correspondence and put them in the hands of the lawyers involved 
in the three cases. The department prepared materials to respond to 
the motion brought in court to stay the cases. More recently the 
department arranged for the appointment of former Chief Justice 
Dubin and his terms of reference.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
minister for his response. If there was an internal inquiry done, as 
the minister has assured the House, could the minister please tell us 
who authorized this meeting between Mr. Thompson and the chief 
justice, and who authorized the written correspondence that 
followed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Charles Dubin has just begun his 
work and I know those are among the questions he will be 
addressing.
<P>
	To my knowledge Ted Thompson was acting entirely on his own 
in going to see Chief Justice Isaac and following up with 
correspondence. That is my understanding of the facts.
<P>
	Former Chief Justice Dubin will look at all the facts and will 
make up his mind based on the record, and I will share it with the 
House.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	In its report on the coverage of the referendum, the CBC justifies 
its unfair treatment of the sovereignist side during the referendum 
campaign by saying that public opinion in English Canada was 
opposed to Quebec sovereignty.
<P>

Mr. Speaker, the CBC is an institution that is independent from the 
government, and it is up to its board of directors to take action on 
the CBC's policies on the basis of the reports they received from 
their ombudsman.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
are we to understand from the minister's answer that, in the next 
federal election, the CBC should base its coverage on the fact that 
only 30 per cent of the Quebec population still supports the Liberal 
Party of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and Acting Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, unlike the Bloc Quebecois, we are not haunted by the 
fear of the next referendum; this government deals with the real 
needs of all Canadians, including the men and women of Quebec.

	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of International Trade.
<P>
	The United States government has sent a letter to a Canadian 
company threatening to ban its officers and shareholders from 
entering the United States simply because this Canadian firm has 
an operating business in Cuba.
<P>
	Would the minister report to the House on the NAFTA 
consultations re the Helms-Burton Bill and how Canadian 
businesses operating in Cuba are affected by it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it comes as no surprise that a letter was sent. 
The Helms-Burton law provided for that, although I must say it is 
only one letter. The State Department in the U.S. says there may 
well be more letters. These letters do not even say exactly what 
they will do. They say the guidelines are coming later.
<P>
	We are still protesting this legislation. We believe it is 
fundamentally wrong. It is a unilateral action of the United States 
plying its foreign policy extraterritorially on Canada and other 
countries. That is fundamentally wrong and we will continue to 
protest under NAFTA, as the European Union is doing under the 
World Trade Organization. We are also examining our options in 
terms of our own domestic law to protect Canadian interests and 
Canadian companies doing lawful business in Cuba.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today the 
Minister of Human Resources Development announced a $2 
billion, three year proposal to share employment training with the 
provinces. The $2 billion will come from an estimated surplus in 
the UI fund of the $5 billion paid into it by employees and 
employees of this country.,
<P>
	Why is the government using its taxing and spending power to 
maintain its position in labour market training even though the 
government has already recognized provincial responsibility in this 
area?
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. Let me address its two parts.
<P>
	First, the $2 billion being spent is not calculated in the surplus 
that is developing after quite a long period of deficit in the 
unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	With respect to the proposal the Government of Canada made 
today to the provinces and the territories, we believe we are 
responding to very legitimate and longstanding requests from the 
provinces to have more control, in some cases almost complete 
control, of the active measures they wish to put in place as they so 
desire.
<P>
	This money is raised through premiums paid for by employers 
and their employees. We believe, as do most of the provinces if not 
all, that it is absolutely essential we find means to provide 
opportunities for people who are the passive recipients of 
employment insurance to get back into the workforce either by job 
creation or by providing wage subsidies, upgrading of skills, 
various techniques which we are very confident the provinces will 
take up and do a good job of administering.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister said earlier in response to a Bloc member's question that 
the $2 billion is coming out of the consolidated revenue fund, of 
which $18 billion comes in from UI and $13 billion is going out. 
There is a projected net profit of $5 billion.
<P>
	The federal government has a valid role in employment 
initiatives such as portability of payment at a national employment 
registry. However, a major obstacle to the portability of persons is 
the lack of common qualification standards and licensing from 
province to province.
<P>
	What initiative has the government taken to ensure Canadians 
will be able to work in any province regardless of the province a 
citizen has earned their qualification in, like the problem between 
Ottawa and Hull?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises an 
extremely important question. It goes far beyond the proposal we 
were able to put on the table today to the provinces.
<P>
	The question of labour mobility is one my colleague, the 
Minister of Industry, has addressed. There is no question we have 
to rely on the provinces. If appropriate we would like to play some 
role as a catalyst in bringing the provinces together. We would like 
to set up arrangements which would allow for the mobility of the 
Canadian workforce.
<P>
	As we function in a global society with NAFTA, free trade 
arrangements and all the rest, I think the hon. member will 
recognize it is a major challenge for Canadians, the federal 
government and the provincial governments to find ways to ensure 
complete labour mobility within the Canadian Confederation.

question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The Coast Guard is now holding consultations regarding fees for 
pleasure craft. The pretext is water safety, but it is clear that the 
Coast Guard's real objective is to recover $14 million, the objective 
set by the Minister of Finance in the budget, from recreational 
boaters.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that the Coast Guard intends to impose 
fees that could go as high as $35 for each pleasure craft, including 
rowboats, canoes and pedal boats?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure why there is applause. The hon. member 
would agree that his party has constantly been after the coast guard 
to ensure that we recover fees, do what is proper, have services at 
the right level and charge the right fees for the right services.
<P>
	He also would agree that safety is paramount in boating and that 
there will be a requirement for safety which will address the serious 
loss of life we have in every province of the country.
<P>
	While the final decision has not been made in response to the 
recreational boating community, we will proceed to ensure safety is 
achieved. There will be a price but the price has not been 
determined yet.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-RiviÃ¨res, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
distinction should perhaps be made between a rowboat and a real 
pleasure craft.
<P>
	How can the minister justify imposing fees on pleasure craft 
sailing on lakes and rivers where the Coast Guard does not provide 
any service to them, that is to say, the vast majority of lakes and 
rivers in Quebec and in Canada?
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is precisely because there may not be enough search 
and rescue services in the area to cover every single boat, 
recreational and of every size, in Canada that it is the responsibility 
of the coast guard to make sure safety is maintained.
<P>
	It is precisely for the reason that the hon. member brought 
forward that we will ensure proper instruction is given and proper 
safety precautions are taken so that search and rescue facilities can 
be used for those areas which include the open seas and a number 
of larger vessels so that for the smaller vessels the inherent safety 
that would be instilled would act as a control mechanism. This is in 
response to the recreational boaters.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
couple of months ago the finance minister suggested there would 
be no new taxes in his budget. It was kind of the Canadian 
equivalent of ``read my lips''.
<P>
	Yesterday we pointed out the minister's harmonization 
agreement would mean a 100 per cent increase in the GST cost on 
gasoline in Atlantic Canadian provinces that have harmonized. 
That would work out to an average of $4.30 for a tank of gasoline in 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Can the finance minister explain how this 100 per cent increase 
in the GST on gas meets his promise of revenue neutrality found on 
page 22 of the red book?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is simply wrong. There is no increase in the GST. 
The GST rate of 7 per cent stays the same and it applies to the same 
base. The member is simply wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
the minister should explain that to the people who will be paying 
that much more when they purchase gas in Atlantic Canada once 
this agreement kicks into place.
<P>
	The Government of Nova Scotia has pointed out in its budget 
document that consumers will pay $84 million more once this 
agreement comes into effect.
<P>
	Considering there is only one taxpayer in the country, not two for 
every level of government, will the minister explain to people how 
this extra $84 million in taxes meets his two-month old promise 
that there would be no new taxes as he suggested at budget time?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member opposite has an enormous amount of difficulty 
understanding the obvious. There is no increase in the federal tax. 
The federal tax stays the same and it applies to exactly the same 
base.
<P>
	There will be across the board reductions in Atlantic Canada in 
the rate, which has been set out at between 4 per cent and 5 per 
cent. The overall rate to the consumer as a result of substantial 
savings to small and medium size businesses will mean a lower rate 
to consumers.
<P>
	Yesterday the hon. member stood up in the House and basically 
said the increase in gasoline taxes we have seen over the course of 
the last couple of months were due to the harmonization 
agreement. I pointed out to him the harmonization agreement has 
not taken effect and that it was very difficult to blame increases in 
gas taxes a month ago on an agreement to take place in the future.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (QuÃ©bec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In August 1994, in Moncton, the Prime Minister solemnly 
announced that 27 federal agencies would prepare action plans to 
meet the needs of francophones living outside Quebec. This week, 
the Commissioner of Official Languages concluded that the 
government had not delivered. So much for the Prime Minister's 
solemn promises.
<P>
	How long will the Prime Minister continue to pretend to be 
doing something for francophones living outside Quebec? Is he 
waiting for them all to be assimilated?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and Acting Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Bloc member seems to forget that the Canadian 
government has programs to support minorities, not only 
francophones outside Quebec, but anglophones in Quebec as well.
<P>
	The government made a very firm commitment to implement 
sections 41 and 42 of the Official Languages Act. During the year 
that just ended, efforts were made by every department concerned 
by sections 41 and 42 of the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (QuÃ©bec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
unfortunate that the Prime Minister himself does not rise to defend 
his solemn promises, leaving the task to the heritage minister. Her 
department did not do much to implement section 41. The Prime 
Minister should read the commissioner's report.
<P>
	Assimilation of francophones is on the rise. In fact, the number 
of young francophones living outside Quebec dropped 35 per cent 
over a 20 year period. Just last week, Statistics Canada confirmed 
that one third of young francophones had become anglicised.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. What will the Prime 
Minister do? What will it take for the Prime Minister to finally 
admit that the situation is critical?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very rare that I do not rise to answer questions. The 
first thing we do to protect French speaking minorities is to ensure 
that they will enjoy the support of Quebec francophones by keeping 
Quebec in Canada. Indeed, should separation be achieved, 
francophones outside Quebec would be hardest hit of all 
francophones in America.
<P>
	We will continue to apply the Official Languages Act. We will 
support the Commissioner of Official Languages, unlike Bloc 
Quebecois members who said last week that he was incompetent, 
but who are now using his recommendations to attack the 
government. The best  way to help francophones outside Quebec is 
to ensure that the French language has its place not only in Quebec, 
but everywhere in Canada.

course of the meeting of a letter sent by the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs when he was on the opposition side. He called on the 
Conservative government to halt military exports and foreign aid to 
Indonesia in protest of the treatment of the leader of the East 
Timorese and the human rights violations in that country.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Foreign Affairs tell the House whether he is 
prepared to live up to the commitments he made while he was in 
opposition? Will he declare an arms embargo and a halt to foreign 
aid to Indonesia until such time as the leader of the East Timorese 
is freed and human rights violations stop in that country? Is he 
prepared to work toward an international arms embargo against 
Indonesia until they smarten up in East Timor?

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak on this motion.
<P>
	The motion is deliberately written in a very broad fashion to 
bring attention to many deficiencies in the government's actions to 
date, the many promises it has broken and not followed through on. 
There were many things the Liberals campaigned on so 
vociferously during the last federal election. There have been many 
failures to deliver on what many Canadians thought were sincere 
attempts to deliver the goods on politicians' promises.
<P>
	It is no wonder as we put together this motion and put together 
the list of promises that were broken that it turned into quite a 
project. We started out with the obvious ones such as Sheila Copps' 
nationally televised GST promise which eventually led to her 
resignation. There were some in my own riding. I remember during 
the election campaign the Liberals promised they would not sign 
the GATT agreement without a strengthened and clarified article 
XI.2(c). Remember that one? Of course that one has gone by the 
wayside. We remember some of the other promises that were made.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Many of us thought we would put together this supply day 
motion to bring this to the attention of Canadians. There would 
probably be a couple of other things which would come to mind. It 
ended up being a major research project. We started it on the 
broken promises and it turned into a major research paper. We 
could write Ph.D. on this.
<P>
	The motion states that given the Prime Minister's 1993 election 
commitment ``that there will not be a promise  I do not keep'', and I 
remember him standing in front of the cameras saying: ``Every day 
you can check in the red book and see where I am''. It has rapidly 
become one of those things which has accounted for the astounding 
21 per cent drop in the approval rating of the Prime Minister over 
the last year. It is an astounding drop. Maybe he feels proud that his 
approval rating is still up around 48 per cent but one-third of the 
people who supported him a year ago no longer do. They have run 
out of patience.
<P>
	Today the Minister of Natural Resources came before the 
committee. I reminded the minister again that although she is a 
very engaging person and talks a good line, people are getting 
impatient with the lack of follow through. For example, what was 
promised a year ago July, an energy chapter to the internal trade 
agreement, has now become a broken promise. There was a 
promise from the Minister of Industry last December to streamline 
regulations in the mining industry. It is now almost June and still 
there is nothing. There was the promise of jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	The rhetoric was good but the follow through just has not cut it. 
That has largely accounted for the 21 per cent drop in the approval 
rating of the Prime Minister. I also think it accounts for some of the 
paranoia I see on the Liberal side when they talk about many of the 
issues of the day after a week back in their ridings. They are 
starting to get the message from Canadians. Promises are fine but 
the follow through is what counts.
<P>
	There was the GST debate during the last election. It has gone on 
here now for a couple of years. We all remember the actions of the 
Liberals, the ringing of the bells, the playing of the kazoos, doing 
whatever it took to raise the profile of why they were not going to 
approve the GST.
<P>
	At all-candidates meetings my Liberal opponent was telling the 
world how they were going to abolish the GST. I remember saying: 
``That is not a serious proposal. You have no alternatives. 
Something cannot be abolished which brings in $17 billion. Let us 
be realistic about this''. The promises were made. In my riding of 
course people did not believe it but they did in many other ridings, 
especially in Ontario where the Liberals won 98 of the 99 seats. 
However, the GST promise has now come home to roost.
<P>
	Think also of the other specifics of the GST and how it has been 
handled. In 1990 a Liberal member in the House said that the GST 
was to be applied to reading materials and how could we expect to 
have another generation of people who could know more and 
compete in the world if the GST was applied to reading materials? 
Now the Liberals have harmonized the tax in Atlantic Canada and 
made it 15 per cent across the board. Lo and behold it is being 
applied to the very products they said three or four years ago they 
would not support.
<P>

<P>
	Canadians are beginning to see. In Sheila Copps' case the GST 
brought down the minister. It caused her to resign and go door 
to door right now saying: ``Please trust me this time''. I think she 
is going to have a hard sell back in Hamilton East.
<P>
	Where do we go? I am not sure which broken promise you are 
particularly interested in, Mr. Speaker. How about the CBC 
funding? During the election campaign the Reform Party had the 
zero in three plan which we said would balance the budget. We had 
to make some tough decisions. We said we would be tough with the 
CBC. Doggone it, we would cut $365 million from CBC funding.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	For saying that the Liberals got up on their high horse and started 
in with: ``What kind of a draconian feature is that?'' They were 
going to provide stable funding for the CBC. As the member for 
Kingston and the Islands so readily noted, we promised to cut $365 
million from CBC funding. Members can check in the zero in three 
plan.
<P>
	The member for Kingston and the Islands has been busy with 
constituency work lately. He has a lot of time for that as he does not 
have many parliamentary duties to get in his way. When he goes 
home I am sure he will be interested in talking to his constituents 
since he has a lot of time to do that. They will ask: ``What about 
this promise of stable funding for the CBC? What did that Reform 
Party promise?''
<P>
	The Liberals have cut more from the CBC than the Reform Party 
proposed. To date the Liberals have cut $377 million from CBC 
funding. Our proposal is in the Reform Party's taxpayers budget, 
which I am sure the member called slash and burn at the time. He 
can get a copy of our proposals. I would be happy to send him one.
<P>
	We said to cut $365 million. Did we want to cut $365 million 
because we thought that would be the end of the CBC? No. 
However, we were honest with the Canadian people, unlike 
members opposite who said one thing to get elected then broke 
those promises once they were in power.
<P>
	I am sure the member for Kingston and the Islands will be 
interested in another broken promise, which sprung to mind as I 
was considering him and his busy constituency work. He wrote on 
revamping, modernizing and democratizing this place. His little 
report, which he wrote with a couple of other members from the 
Liberal Party, was attached to the red book as an appendix on how 
they were going to democratize the House of Commons.
<P>
	I am not sure if you are ready for this, Mr. Speaker, but one of the 
proposals from the member for Kingston and the Islands concerned 
your very own position which he said should be held by members 
of the opposition  parties. That was his proposal, not a particular 
campaign promise from myself. I will defer to his experience.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I find you to be a very credible, very fair and an 
excellent Speaker, as you were in your former occupation. The 
member said that from his experience, in order to bring credibility 
to the Chair it was not good enough just to find a fair person; we 
had to have someone from the opposition parties. Do you 
remember the promise?
<P>
	When we got into the House of Commons and went through a 
couple of sessions, some of the Chair positions were switched 
around. We brought this to the attention of the member for 
Kingston and the Islands and asked: What happened to the promise 
in the appendix of the red book to elect the deputy speakers from 
the opposition ranks?
<P>
	I am not sure which person on this side would run but it is an 
instance of a broken promise. He wrote the report. He promised it 
to the Canadian people. He said it would help make this place more 
credible. It was not my proposal. It was a promise made by the 
Liberal Party of Canada which has not been fulfilled. It is a broken 
promise. It is another broken promise.
<P>
	Another issue was the ethics counsellor. When I think of broken 
promises I think of the ethics issue. The Prime Minister has gone 
on at some length as to the appointment of an ethics counsellor. He 
found a person he felt he could trust, and we can take that anyway 
we like. He felt he could trust the ethics counsellor to give him the 
verdicts he wanted, the work that he wanted or whatever. The 
Prime Minister put him in the position. Instead of reporting 
through the House of Commons to the Canadian people, where 
does the ethics counsellor report? He reports to the Prime Minister 
himself.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	When the Prime Minister appoints an ethics counsellor he finds 
someone he has worked with for 20 or 30 years for the position. 
The ethics counsellor is told to investigate whatever the Prime 
Minister wishes. When the investigation is finished the ethics 
counsellor hands the report to him to read at 24 Sussex Drive. 
Depending on what the verdict is, the report may or may not be 
shared with the Canadian people. That is not an answer to a 
promise for an ethics counsellor; it is an ethics lap dog.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor does not report to Canadians but only to 
the person who hired him. A hired person is not independent if he 
must report to the person who is paying the bills. In our opinion 
that is what has happened to the position.
<P>
	I return to the GATT and the NAFTA. During the election 
campaign the Reform Party said that we must sign the GATT. It 
was going to happen. One hundred and fifty nations of the world 
wanted to sign the GATT. We were going to sign it. We said that we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3213"> 3213 </A></B>
<P>
should be up  front with Canadians. We thought we should sign it. It 
was becoming a worldwide, rules based trading economy. We 
should sign the GATT and get on with it.
<P>
	I can remember the Liberal candidates in both Chilliwack and 
Abbotsford in my riding saying that they would lay down on the 
railroad tracks before they signed the GATT without a strengthened 
and clarified article XI.2(c). I am not exaggerating. The supply 
managed people had nothing to fear. The Liberals would never sign 
such an agreement. They would lay on the railroad tracks before 
they would sign that deal.
<P>
	Within a month of the election, before Parliament even sat, the 
Liberal government had signed the GATT. I am not surprised. It 
was the thing to do. We in the Reform Party campaigned on it. We 
told the truth to the Canadian people. The Liberals said one thing to 
get elected and did another thing once they were in power.
<P>
	The same thing happened with NAFTA. The Liberals railed 
against that in opposition. They were going to renegotiate the 
NAFTA. It was a mess. Mulroney had botched it. We wondered if 
there was anything to salvage. They were going to renegotiate the 
NAFTA. Again, they got in power and they signed the NAFTA. I 
am not upset with the decision. That was the thing to do. I 
campaigned on it. I told the truth. The Liberals campaigned on one 
thing and did another.
<P>
	The list is growing. Mr. Speaker, you will notice the list is 
growing. I am sure you are as alarmed as I am that lists of broken-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With great resistance I rise, 
certainly not to participate in the debate, but simply to-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Please do, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> No, even at the invitation of 
the minister I will resist.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. member that although his 
intervention, like all interventions, should be made through the 
Chair, no one should expect the Speaker or the chair occupant to 
respond. I realize that sometimes we may be somewhat useful in 
debate, but I would ask for the hon. member's co-operation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course I was not impugning motives 
or anything. I am trying to direct my conversation through you. As 
I said, I know you, even from your previous occupation, as being 
one of those fair people that I want to chat with.
<P>
	I will return to the issue of broken promises. Issues of integrity 
have arisen since the last election campaign. Promises made by the 
government have not been fulfilled. I must bring up the issue of MP 
pensions. We were promised in the last campaign that the MP 
pension plan would have a major overhaul. On this side of the 
House we put it down in black and white. We were going  to scrap 
the MP pension plan. When we ran in 1993 there was no way it was 
a fair pension plan.
<P>
	We got a slightly revised MP pension plan from the government. 
People qualify only after six years. They start to draw at the age of 
55. It is fully indexed. At the same time people on pensions and 
OAS have been told to stay tuned. In three or four years their 
pensions will not be what they are today. Pensioners will start to 
lose their pensions in three or four years. The government 
campaigned on no problems. However, it will start to cut back on 
seniors' pensions while it guarantees itself a lavish MP pension 
plan the likes of which no one else in Canada could possibly 
qualify for. I feel like an old timer.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	During the last campaign our budget balancing proposals 
included an idea for pensions. We said that the old age supplement 
should be targeted toward those most in need. What is most in 
need? We decided the cut off on OAS would be the national 
average family household income, $53,000. We said if someone 
makes more than that then they do not need help from the federal 
government on OAS. We are not talking about CPP which people 
contribute to, but about the non-contributory plans.
<P>
	From the reaction of the Liberal I campaigned against one would 
have thought we had commissioned a study to spread-eagle people 
on anthills and pour honey on them. We had done a terrible thing, 
but what are the Liberals' proposals now? The cut off for the OAS 
is $53,000. It is exactly what the Reform Party campaigned on in 
black and white. We were up front and honest, telling it like it is.
<P>
	Members over there said: ``That Reform Party, what a slash and 
burn bunch it is''. Yet when they got in what did they find? They 
found the Reform Party's proposals were pretty doggone good. 
They used our dollar figure for their own cut off, which is 
remarkable.
<P>
	Imitation is the ultimate flattery. In that sense I am flattered. 
However, I would rather feel flattered about being up front. I would 
rather be imitated on the honesty and integrity of my party than I 
would on a particular issue, although it is nice to be proven right 
once again.
<P>
	The government has a case of selective memory when it comes 
to fulfilling its promises. It is a case of: ``When I was on the 
opposition side I chastised that Mulroney character. I called him 
every name in the book. I did whatever it took to be a rat packer and 
throw the dirt on him, but when I got over here my memory became 
selective. My promises became slurred and garbled. My vision 
became Ottawa depth perception instead of looking at the whole 
country'', which is too bad.
<P>
	This behaviour lends some credibility to the views of people who 
were surveyed in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> recently. They said that they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3214"> 3214 </A></B>
<P>
held politicians in the lowest  regard of almost any occupation in 
Canada. It is because of broken promises and lack of integrity.
<P>
	I am reminded of a story in which three people were arguing over 
which of three occupations had been around the longest: doctor, 
lawyer or politician. I think it is a true story. The first guy was a 
doctor who said: ``Our occupation has been around the longest. The 
Bible tells about how in the beginning God took a rib out of Adam 
and made a woman. Therefore the doctoring skill has been around 
since the beginning of time''. The lawyer jumped in and said: 
``Hold it. It says even earlier in the Bible that in the beginning it 
was all chaos, and God had to put the laws of nature in place. That 
is a lawyering skill, so lawyers have been around forever''. The 
politician, who was Liberal, jumped in and asked: ``Where do you 
think the chaos came from?''
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sorry, the member's 
time has lapsed. Let us now move to questions or comments.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is hard to 
take the previous member and his party seriously when one looks at 
the opposition day motion.
<P>
	Let me first express some regret because when the Reform Party 
was first elected to the House its members promised to do politics 
differently. That really has not been the case. They probably 
represent the worst in partisan politics. The electors in British 
Columbia know that as they only elected two out of seventy-five 
Reform members in the very recent election.
<P>
	The leader of the third party said: ``I will not accept a chauffeur 
and a car from the government. I am going to be different''. Then 
we find out that the chauffeur supplied by the Reform Party is 
subsidized by Canadian taxpayers. Later we find out that there is a 
suit allowance which provides clothes for the leader of the Reform 
Party. People within the party who raised these matters were 
subject to criticism.
<P>
	We also have the case where the members of the third party 
waxed eloquently when we were dealing with one of the members 
in our caucus for opposing the government on a matter of 
confidence. What does the Reform Party do? It suspends two of its 
members for voicing concern over its policy, which is a matter of 
freedom of speech. It drove a third member out of the party, one 
who is regarded by most people as a moderate Reformer.
<P>
	The motion ends with ``cynicism about public institutions, 
governments, politicians and the political process''. Surely the 
member recognizes that by Reform members cynical actions 
during the referendum campaign, where they tried to undermine 
the very integrity of this country, they are the ones who have 
promoted cynicism about public institutions and politicians in a 
way that has not been done in the history of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if the member is from 
Atlantic Canada or not but that is a bunch of codswallop. That is a 
diatribe of the worst kind.
<P>
	Sometime when he wants to walk home with the leader of the 
Reform Party I can arrange it because member for Calgary 
Southwest does not have a chauffeur to this day. The hon. member 
should know that.
<P>
	Without getting into the gutter with the member opposite, I will 
quickly go through some things. Why did the B.C. Liberal Party, 
along with the B.C. Reform Party and the independents capture 60 
per cent of the vote in British Columbia? What did they promise? 
They promised to resign if they did not do the following Reform 
things: Go for referendum and recall, reduce taxes, balance the 
budget, bring in fixed election dates, reduce the number of MLAs 
in the legislature in Victoria, eliminate the MLA pension plan. The 
B.C. Liberals said that maybe they would renegotiate the Nisga'a 
contract. It goes on and on with an entire Reform Party package 
that captured 61 per cent of the vote in British Columbia.
<P>
	The B.C. Liberal Party has nothing to do with the federal Liberal 
Party of course. When he appeared before it, this caucus over here 
booed the B.C. Liberal guy out of town. He was happy to do it 
because he said: ``I have nothing to do with that bunch. They don't 
stand for anything I stand for''. He did not say it but he stands for 
almost the same package of reforms that this federal party, the 
Reform Party of Canada, stands for.
<P>
	That is why many people supported the B.C. Liberal Party or the 
B.C. Reform Party in the B.C. election. Together they had a vast 
majority of British Columbians who stood for none of this 
nonsense over here, but stood for all the things I just mentioned.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard 
the hon. member mention the committees during his speech. It 
brought to mind that during question period today the Minister of 
Justice mentioned that if he could withstand appearing before the 
justice committee, he could face any tribunal in the land.
<P>
	I have a letter from the Minister of Justice to a committee that I 
sit on called the Joint Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of 
Regulations. I think that the member will appreciate the frustration 
and be able to confirm it. The committee is not a high profile one 
but it is pretty important. It determines which government 
regulations are appropriate. It is really sort of a community watch 
dog. It can even disallow regulations so it is pretty important.
<P>
	The committee wrote to the minister in February 1995 with 
regard to Bill C-84 with some questions and suggestions. The 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River who is sitting opposite 
was a signatory to that letter to the minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3215"> 3215 </A></B>
<P>
	On May 3, 1996, more than a year later, the minister sent back 
a reply so far off topic, so full of incorrect information, that the 
only conclusion that could be reached was that he either thought 
we were a bunch of idiots or he never read the letter that he signed. 
Now we are placed in the position of having to call the minister 
before the committee in September to find out if he even knew 
what he was signing.
<P>
	If the minister thinks that the worst thing he has ever faced is the 
justice committee, wait until he comes to the Joint Standing 
Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations. That is the sort of 
frustration and idiocy that goes on in this place that produces the 
cynicism that so many voters out there feel.
<P>
	Does the hon. member agree that these sorts of frustrations occur 
in committee?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought earlier when he was talking 
about the two possibilities for the minister, it would be a tough call. 
I am not sure whether he did not read the letter or he just did not 
care. It does highlight some of the frustrations in committee and in 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	I have sat on a committee where members have passed 
amendments to bills without allowing a vote on the amendment. I 
have been refused the ability to submit amendments because I did 
not have them in both officials languages even though they were 
properly typed. I do not speak French, I did not have time to get 
them translated and so other members refused to hear them. There 
have been occasions where they have just moved to closure 
immediately without giving anyone the right to debate the issues.
<P>
	The government regulations committee, as the member correctly 
points out, is a very important committee that really is the nuts and 
bolts of how government enacts its legislation. Committee 
members had to wait a year first of all for a response and second the 
response had nothing to do with the original request.
<P>
	The member for North Vancouver should be relieved in a sense 
because the regulations that went with Bill C-68, the gun control 
legislation, were so ill-prepared and not understandable that the 
justice minister tabled the regulations and then withdrew them in a 
week because they were totally unworkable even by federal Liberal 
standards.
<P>
	The hon. member's frustrations are understandable. The reform 
of committee work is basically a make work project for backbench 
Liberal MPs. That is what it is and that is another reform that has to 
happen. I hope that will happen before the Canadian people get 
more cynical and distrustful of the process, but also before the 
Liberal backbenchers do.
<P>
	Just another little aside, they say that laws and sausages are the 
same. You should not watch either one being made. I was wishing 
that we could at least watch laws being made without getting ill at 
ease.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to participate in this opposition motion which has been put 
forward by my colleagues who represent the third party.
<P>
	Unaccustomed as I am to participating in debates in this 
Chamber, I thought I would go back and review for members, as 
well as for those who might be viewing the proceedings on 
television, the fact that at another time I was responsible for putting 
forward opposition motions. One of the things we learned while in 
opposition was that it was very valuable to the debate if the motion 
being put before our colleagues was very focused. Unfortunately 
today is not that kind of a day.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	The motion put forward by my colleagues representing the 
Reform Party is very long. It is a whining, snivelling bunch of lines 
which really does not come to any substantive focus in what it is 
supposed to do.
<P>
	One of the things that struck me while I was sitting in my place 
and listening to the member opposite wax, somewhat eloquently I 
might add, his flippant use of the word ``integrity''. We heard that 
from the leader of the third party well before the election in 1993. 
We heard him during the campaign and we have heard him since he 
became member of Parliament and leader of the third party in the 
House. Without qualification, on every issue that hon. member 
refers to he likes to use the word integrity.
<P>
	I am not as well read as all those members opposite, therefore I 
need the guidance of a dictionary. I have looked at page 616 of <I>The 
Concise Oxford Dictionary</I> where I found the definition of the word 
integrity. This is what it states: ``moral uprightness; honesty, 
wholeness; soundness''. That is what integrity means.
<P>
	This was the party and these were the representatives who, 
before the election, during the election campaign and since that 
time, have used that particular word. Now they have to confront 
their own rhetoric.
<P>
	Here is what the leader, or as some in Nova Scotia would refer to 
him, the extinguished leader of the third party, but that would be 
rather unkind, so I will just refer to him as the leader of the third 
party, said on October 24, 1993. I think these words are rather 
telling: ``We want to position ourselves in that Parliament not just 
as a whining, sniffling opposition group but as a constructive 
alternative to the government itself''.
<P>
	What has happened since October 24, 1993? Have we seen 
constructive policies come forward from the Reform Party as it 
relates to health care? Have we seen a proposal with regard to 
senior citizens? Have we seen a  proposal as it relates to a two-tier 
system of medicare and their opposition to it?
<P>
	The answer to all of those questions is that unfortunately the 
Reform Party, and I want members to recognize that in particular it 
is the leader of the Reform Party who has been bankrupt of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3216"> 3216 </A></B>
<P>
word that he used prior to his election to the House, during the 
campaign and since that time of his own word which is integrity.
<P>
	I say that about the leader of the Reform Party. Mr. Speaker, you 
know it is not in my character to say those kinds of things about the 
hon. member opposite. However, we all know that the leader of the 
Reform Party is going down.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	He is going down in the polls and he is going down as the leader 
of the Reform Party. They will make it so difficult within the 
Reform Party itself to sustain a bankrupt leader in the leader of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	Let us come back to integrity. Let us come back to what the 
leader said on October 24, 1993. Let us compare not a year and a 
half ago but to October 1995 and ask ourselves what have the 
members of that party been saying about the position the leader 
took in 1993.
<P>
	Here is what we find by the member for Macleod: ``I will do 
anything I have to do in the House of Commons, even stand on my 
head on the bench and hold my breath if it is necessary. That, I 
guess, is an indictment of my original approach, which was to 
come here and to be dignified''.
<P>
	This is the word the leader of the Reform Party talked about 
before he was elected during the campaign and since that time, 
integrity. His own colleagues have abdicated their support of the 
leader of the Reform Party. They are now in the gutter where all of 
their policies seem to be formulated.
<P>
	I only have great regret and disappointment for the hon. 
members of the Reform Party. There are some who would like to 
put forward constructive alternatives but they do not get that 
opportunity. There are those in the Reform Party who would like to 
make meaningful suggestions. Because a large group of individuals 
within that party and are so inconsistent they cannot get a cohesive 
policy to come forward.
<P>
	I do not take exception to any of the hon. members in the Reform 
Party, none at all. This is their Parliament too. They have the right 
to stand in this place and echo their sentiments and their views in 
any way they wish.
<P>
	If they wish to make fools of themselves, as they have done 
consistently since October 1993, so be it. I take great exception, 
strong exception to the leader of the Reform Party. He is the person 
I wish to direct my comments to, not those members who fall at his 
feet.
<P>
	I want to go to the source of the Reform Party, the raison d'Ãªtre 
of the Reform Party, the leader. I make the  prediction that this hon. 
member as the leader of the Reform Party will not be here after the 
next election for two reasons. I ask the co-operation of the House 
so I can demonstrate that my thesis about his absence after the next 
election is based on not only sound information but on probably the 
best political evidence anyone could ever gather.
<P>
	That is and that will be the downfall of the leader of the Reform 
Party. As we have seen in recent weeks, members want him out. 
Wait for the big show on June 6 and June 7. They will have a
<P>
convention. They will have flags. They will wear sweaters. They 
will say ``we love Preston, he is so wonderful, he is our leader, he is 
the best thing that has ever happened to us''. Reformers have gone 
down in the polls ever since they came to Parliament in October 
1993.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	For these members opposite, but more important for the leader 
opposite, the greatest opposition he must face is his own political 
party. I respectfully suggest the other reason he will not be here 
after the next election, as hon. members know, is his bankrupt 
substantive policy alternatives.
<P>
	This is a person who has assumed a high office as the leader of a 
third party. No leader in Canadian history has demonstrated such a 
lack of understanding of the nation, of its people, of its resources 
and of its history as the leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Any time, anywhere, on any occasion, on any issue members on 
this side of the House, members on that side of the House and even 
members of the Bloc Quebecois would be happy to debate any 
substantive issue the hon. member raises.
<P>
	However, we have seen in the last two and a half years, for 
example on issues of health care, how he tries to duck them. If they 
are issues concerning aboriginals, he ducks them. If they are issues 
of safe streets, he ducks them. On economic policy he will submit a 
budget one year and not submit a budget the next. In terms of job 
creation they have a plan but nobody knows where it is at. It is one 
of these: ``We will put it this way here''.
<P>
	It is amazing to think that Canadians will be gullible enough to 
be sold on the bankruptcies of the policies of the leader of the third 
party. We on this side of the House and on that side of the House 
will not take an aggressive position in relation to the Reform Party; 
we will take a position to the Canadian people. We will 
demonstrate beyond a shadow of a doubt that the bankruptcy other 
members may label Reform with is not only there rhetorically but 
is there in reality.
<P>
	I find it passing strange that hon. members opposite would stand 
in their places today and have the unmitigated gall to suggest this 
government, which has not completed its mandate, has not fulfilled 
a good  number of the commitments we made in the red book. To be 
clear, I provide a few examples.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3217"> 3217 </A></B>
<P>
	We promised to cancel the EH-101 helicopter. We did that. We 
said we would privatize Petro-Canada. We did that. We reduced 
government subsidies to business, transportation and agriculture, 
the Western Grain Transportation Act, the Atlantic region freight 
assistance and the maritime region freight assistance.
<P>
	We have wound up over 70 agencies and done away with 600 
governor in council appointments. We reviewed all government 
programs and agencies to reduce the waste and have done so not 
only in government departments but in each and every agency of 
the Government of Canada. That is what we have done.
<P>
	We met our economic targets set by the Minister of Finance not 
once, not twice but three times, which is very significant in terms 
of meeting our economic targets.
<P>
	Unemployment is staggering in my region. In terms of the 
national levels it has been reduced from 11.2 per cent to 9.3 per 
cent.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Are you happy about that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> No, I am not happy about that. I will tell the hon. 
member opposite that I am not happy with the leader of the Reform 
Party, who tries to play on fears of those Canadians who are 
unemployed by offering, not in the House of Commons but while 
he is on the stump, whether in Newfoundland, in Hamilton or in 
western Canada, all the answers in relation to job creation. No 
substantive program has come forward from the leader of the 
Reform Party. I suggest to the hon. member he ought to be ashamed 
of his party and particularly of the leader of that party.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	There are other initiatives we have taken as a national 
government. We created the Canada Lands Corporation to dispose 
of surplus federal properties. We introduced the direct deposit 
program which saves Canadians over $28 million. We restored the 
court challenges program and we created and implemented the 
national infrastructure program.
<P>
	The hon. member laughs, but I recall with great clarity a day in 
the House, and I stand to be corrected by the hon. Speaker, when 
the hon. member with eloquence and fervour told the minister 
responsible: ``I am not in favour of the national infrastructure 
program''. The minister then stood in his place and read a letter 
from the hon. member which said: ``Would you please support 
these projects in my constituency''.
<P>
	Let us go back the word integrity. I ask the hon. member is that 
integrity? Is that the Reform Party's idea of the definition of the 
word integrity? One thing is said in the House and then hopefully 
the minister would be slipped a little note which will not come up 
in his briefing book and then their constituents can be told:  ``I had 
to say that. I do not support the national infrastucture program 
because the leader does not support it. I had to ask if he would mind 
putting those projects in my riding''. Is that Reform Party's 
definition of integrity? I think it is; say one thing but do the exact 
opposite.
<P>
	I am sure the House would want to give me extra time to 
complete my remarks. Let us come back to the national 
infrastructure program. What was the national infrastucture 
program?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A $6 billion waste of money. A boondoggle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member opposite 
said it is a boondoggle and a $6 billion waste of taxpayer money. 
Municipalities all across the country, from the urban centres of 
Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver to villages and towns, have all 
benefited from the national infrastructure program. It put in 
communities infrastructure that in most instances would never 
have been done.
<P>
	I am ashamed and appalled the hon. member opposite would say 
to the residents of Goose Bay, Sydney, Nova Scotia, Sudbury or 
Sault Ste. Marie or Saskatoon that money to give them quality 
water for children, mothers and fathers is somehow a bad policy for 
the Government of Canada. I say to the hon. member that it shows 
the leader of the Reform Party is bankrupt of ideas, bankrupt of 
programs and bankrupt of knowing what Canada and Canadians are 
all about. That is very clear.
<P>
	We announced funding of $315 million over three years to help 
young Canadians get their first job, $60 million of which will go to 
increasing summer student employment in 1996. The only person 
opposed to that is the leader of the Reform Party. He says to middle 
class Canadians who work hard to put food on the table and to 
educate their kids ``no, we do not want the state to help your son or 
daughter get a summer job''. That is the party of the rich. That is 
not the party that supports the working middle class of the country. 
I say to the hon. member with his computer on his desk and his 
colleagues beside him that the leader of the Reform Party should 
clearly examine the definition of the word integrity and should do 
the honourable thing and find another vocation.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems 
the minister is holding a bit of a grudge over the attacks on his 
highway project. I certainly would like to hear a little more on that.
<P>
	The minister did say specifically that he does not take exception 
to hon. members of the Reform Party as individuals. Then he 
followed up and said the policies are in the gutter. I would like to 
ask the minister then if the policies are in the gutter, and since the 
policies were produced by the public of Canada with its input and  
voted on by members of the Reform Party at convention, is he 
saying that the more than two million people who voted Reform in 
the 1993 election, 20 per cent of the voters of Canada, are stupid, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3218"> 3218 </A></B>
<P>
intolerant, bigoted and that they would be so stupid as to produce 
those policies?
<P>
	If that is what he is saying I would like him to repeat it so that 
anyone who wants to read it will know exactly what he thinks of 
them.
<P>
	With respect to the infrastructure program, in my riding I always 
select a random committee from the voter's list. I have no idea who 
they are or what political party they represent. They come, usually 
about 30 people, and they make the decisions about the grants in 
the riding. They make some pretty good decisions.
<P>
	It is not true that the leader or anybody else in this party tells me 
what to do about those grants. It is true that the majority of people 
out there feel it is a waste of money, that we are giving money to 
places which do not need the money to create the jobs.
<P>
	I will give an example. Morguard Properties, which runs a big 
shopping centre in my riding, is obliged to look after the gardens in 
that shopping centre. It would obviously employ students to do it 
because it is the least expensive labour. Yet year after year it 
applies for a grant. It is outrageous that we are giving Morguard 
Properties money.
<P>
	A better way to do it is through persuasion of the business 
community to give jobs. It always does if it is persuaded. It does 
not need the grants.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his two 
questions. I want to be very clear with the hon. member because I 
think he has asked serious questions with regard to the policies of 
the Reform Party and those members who allegedly make up the 
Reform Party and who have allegedly participated in the 
development of the policies. I have great respect for individuals 
who involve themselves in the political process.
<P>
	I want the member opposite to understand and accept that. I do 
not accept the leader of the Reform Party espousing one day a 
policy on health and the next day reversing himself and saying 
something different. To me that is not integrity. To me that is not 
good social policy. To me that is not good policy for the nation.
<P>
	This is the leader who says one thing on Monday and then the 
following Monday something else. It is evident as it relates to the 
health policy of the Reform Party, or the lack of health care policy 
of the Reform Party. I am sure most Canadians, as the polls indicate 
quite clearly, and wherever I travel and with my caucus colleagues, 
have overwhelming support for medicare. In excess of 70 per cent 
do not want a two tier system of medicine. They want a one tier 
system and they want one taxpayer to fund that system.
<P>
	The hon. member has gone out on a limb here. I hope I will have 
an opportunity to visit him in his constituency and to talk with 
municipal councillors. I hope I have the opportunity to go into the 
kitchens, as I do in my own constituency, and have tea and biscuits 
and tell senior citizens and various organizations they do not need a 
new water system, a new sewage system or an environmental 
clean-up of a particular problem in their community. I will be glad 
to discuss that with residents of his constituency.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party, in particular the bankrupt leader of the 
Reform Party, are very envious of our national infrastructure 
program. It came from the municipalities and we, as a national 
government, thereafter supported it. They are envious that we as a 
national political party supported and have implemented that 
program. It has been overwhelmingly successful all across the 
country.
<P>
	Have there been examples in a program of $6 billion where we 
probably would have had a different view on a project at any given 
point in time? I say to the hon. member he is correct in that 
intervention. However, the overwhelming success of the national 
infrastructure program has meant jobs for Canadians. It has built up 
the infrastructure in the country, which has been in great need. The 
hon. member knows it has been successful. We as a national 
political party have had that success. The hon. member's bankrupt 
leader is now having to suffer the consequences for opposing the 
national infrastructure program.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine DubÃ© (LÃ©vis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
listening carefully for the past few minutes to the Minister of 
Health, who, I must say, has livened things up somewhat in the 
House today. He has brought a little life to the place, and should be 
congratulated for doing so.
<P>
	However, he is avoiding the motion by attacking the Reform 
Party and particularly its leader. He neglects to say that the motion 
in question talks about keeping promises. I will remind him of a 
few of them.
<P>
	When it was in opposition, the Liberal Party promised to 
eliminate the GST-it did not. I do not know whether he was here 
at the time, but the people in his party criticized the unemployment 
insurance reform proposed by the former Conservative minister 
when they were in opposition. However, they went a lot further: $2 
billion in additional cuts. They had promised to reduce, indeed 
eliminate duplication in the field of health care. I would like his 
response to that, as that is his particular concern.
<P>
	I am a new member of the Standing Committee on Health. I have 
been on it for only a month and have discovered a series of 
duplications. Could he tell us what he plans to do during the time 
he has remaining as minister, between now and the election, about 
eliminating duplication in the area of health?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3219"> 3219 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, he spoke of integrity. He was Minister of Public Works, 
he knows the rules, because there are lots of rules, but we could 
go a lot further. For example, we know that there are rules for 
contracts of $30,000 and over, however in the case of contracts 
under $30,000, to encourage greater public confidence in the 
system of public administration, would he support, as an example, 
legislation on the funding of political parties by individuals rather 
than by corporations, as is currently the case?
<P>
	The traditional parties are receiving considerable funding from 
big business and the banks. Six of the major funders of the political 
parties are banks. Does he consider this normal? In the interest of 
integrity and at the invitation of the Reform Party would he support 
legislation limiting the funding of political parties to that provided 
by individuals?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to give the House the 
impression that I am attempting to be meanspirited toward my 
colleague. Obviously he missed the first part of my intervention.
<P>
	I said the motion before us is not very focused and is very 
widespread. I was able to indicate to the House some of the words 
being used in the motion, such as the word integrity, which seems 
to be a synonym for all of the things the bankrupt leader of the third 
party was using before the election in 1993, during the election and 
thereafter. Therefore I am speaking to the motion. It is members of 
the third party who are attacking us as a national government, 
saying we have not fulfilled our commitments.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I say to the hon. member opposite that our mandate is not 
complete. We still have a number of months and maybe even years. 
God, it might be even decades before we complete our mandate.
<P>
	The hon. member talked a bit about overlap and duplication. I 
have worked very closely with provincial governments not only in 
this portfolio but in other portfolios to rid ourselves of overlap and 
duplication. In most instances it was a clear road ahead in terms of 
ridding ourselves of overlap and duplication. We will continue to 
work with governments.
<P>
	However, the phrase overlap and duplication should be put in 
context. Where there is overlap and duplication one has to vet out 
the respective responsibilities of the different parties and come to 
some sort of consensus in terms of which level of government, if 
that is the case, or a third party might be able to do the service or 
produce the product in question.
<P>
	With regard to UI reform, the hon. member comes from a great 
province, la belle province du QuÃ©bec, where there is high 
unemployment. There is also high unemployment in my region. 
However, if the hon. member is suggesting we should not have 
modernized the unemployment insurance, I think he is wrong. I 
think the vast majority of Canadians wanted to see the 
modernization of the unemployment insurance.
<P>
	The hon. member can debate a provision of the UI changes 
which have been brought in by my distinguished colleague, the 
Minister for Human Resources Development, who members 
opposite support wholeheartedly, as I look across. Those reforms 
have been predicated on the sense of fairness and what is right.
<P>
	In terms of political contributions and amendments to the 
elections act, all of those matters can be discussed at a more 
appropriate time in terms of committee or other institutions which 
may be reviewing them from time to time. I do not really think this 
is the place for me to debate today.
<P>
	We on this side of the House have attempted to fulfil the 
commitments we announced in the red book to the best of our 
ability. We have a period of time remaining in our mandate and we 
will endeavour over the months or years that are left to achieve all 
of those things we believe to be important. However, we need the 
co-operation of people in all parts of the country, including the 
province of Quebec, the western provinces, the Atlantic region and 
Ontario.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Shefford, the Somalia inquiry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak today to the motion presented by the Reform Party on this 
opposition day. We are looking at the extent to which the Liberal 
government elected in 1993 has failed to keep the promises it made 
in its red book.
<P>
	These unkept promises are numerous. For example, on page 86 
of the red book, it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At a time when racial intolerance and ethnic hatreds are in resurgence around 
the world, a Liberal government will take measures to combat hate 
propaganda-In addition, a Liberal government will encourage ``tolerance and 
mutual understanding'', and will make efforts to combat racial discrimination 
in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development showed 
intolerance last Monday when he asked me to find another country, 
if I was not happy with his government's immigration and refugee 
policies and if I continued to promote sovereignty for Quebec.
<P>
	This has been a trying week for me, a difficult week. As 
politicians, we are almost all accustomed to being the  target of 
attacks, but I was not prepared for the extent and aggressiveness of 
the attack by the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3220"> 3220 </A></B>
<P>
when he clearly asked me to leave, to find another country because 
I do not share his views or the views of his government.
<P>
	Following these discriminatory comments, I received telephone 
calls and letters from people with racist views, telling me they are 
ready to buy my plane ticket so that I can leave Canada as quickly 
as possible, and offering to pack my bags to speed me on my way.
<P>
	First of all, I thank my family, who have been very supportive 
this week, particularly my wife, who was in the visitors' gallery. I 
thank my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois who have given my 
their unanimous support. I would particularly like to thank the 
Leader of the Opposition, the leader of my party, who took my 
defence to heart.
<P>
	I was deeply wounded, I admit. I was not expecting attacks on 
this scale. The statements made by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development are discriminatory and offensive. These 
remarks encourage the Canadian public to be xenophobic and are 
an insult to all immigrants and refugees.
<P>
	The minister is sending an unacceptable message to Canada's 
ethnocultural communities and to the public at large that there are 
two kinds of citizen in Canadian society: those who were born here 
and those who came from somewhere else. It is particularly 
worrisome when the minister, in the House, or outside, mentions 
``real'' Canadians.
<P>
	Who are real Canadians, in the minister's opinion? Are they 
people who agree with his ideas and with the government's 
positions? Who are not real Canadians? People like me, who 
criticize his views, his positions. Barely a few months have passed 
since the end of the International Year of Tolerance declared by the 
United Nations. Throughout the world, there were activities to 
promote tolerance, including in Montreal North in my riding. I 
marked the end of the year with a large brunch on behalf of 
tolerance, with the participation of the police, ethnic, economic and 
social groups, and the general public.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The minister's comments are worrisome as far as Canadian 
rights and freedoms are concerned. He is jeopardizing freedom of 
opinion, freedom of speech, the right to secede. I would like to 
quickly quote two sections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. Section 6 (1) on mobility states that ``Every citizen of 
Canada has the right to enter, remain in and leave Canada''. The 
minister wishes to deprive me of that basic right.
<P>
	Section 15 on equality rights reads as follows: ``Every individual 
is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal 
protection and equal benefit of the law  without discrimination and, 
in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or 
ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical 
disability''. It is very clear that the charter protects all citizens, 
even if they were not born in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to quote here a sentence that had a profound effect 
on me when I was experiencing political difficulties in my country. 
Voltaire, the great 18th century French philosopher, said: ``Je suis 
en profond dÃ©saccord avec tes idÃ©es, mais je donnerais ma vie pour 
que tu aies le droit de les exprimer''.
<P>
	If that is not clear in French, let me repeat it in English.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I may disapprove of what you say but I will defend to death 
your right to say it''. Everyone knows that in the United States this 
quotation has been used often. It is one of the most famous 
quotations from Voltaire and one of the most popular quotations 
among American civil libertarians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I fled the terrible dictatorship of General Pinochet in February 
1974. During the dictatorship, hundreds, thousands of people were 
murdered or disappeared in my country. Human rights violations 
were flagrant and systematic. I came here because of that 
dictatorship. I did not want to leave my country, and I would 
probably still be in Chile, had there not been a dictatorship.
<P>
	I came to Canada, to Quebec, a profoundly democratic country, 
and I thank Canada, I thank Quebec, for having taken us in, myself, 
my wife and my two children, who were two and five at the time, at 
a very difficult period in our lives.
<P>
	As the Minister of Human Resources Development said, this 
country welcomed us with open arms, with generosity, but I must 
tell you that it was primarily Quebec that did so. I arrived in 
Montreal, Quebec, and it was the Quebecers in particular who 
welcomed me with enormous generosity, with understanding, with 
unfailing solidarity.
<P>
	Since our arrival we have, like thousands of immigrants before 
us, tried to make a contribution, to give something back to 
Canadian society, to Quebec society. I have always worked, I have 
never been on unemployment insurance or welfare. My wife has 
always worked. As for my two children, today one of them is an 
economist working for INFORUM at the Montreal World Trade 
Centre, a respected economist. My other son works for the Quebec 
National Assembly. I am very proud of the work Gonzalo does. He 
is a communications graduate and has a very popular radio 
program in Montreal.

<P>
	I am satisfied with what my family has done here. We pay taxes 
like all other Canadian citizens, and like all other immigrants as 
well, and therefore we, all the immigrants and refugees, are entitled 
to the same rights.
<P>
	But we still have a way to go, in this regard. Before I became a 
member of Parliament, I was an advocate of individual rights and 
freedoms in Montreal on behalf of immigrants and refugees, 
because this issue is very important to me. This is why my party 
gave me the job of citizenship and immigration critic.
<P>
	I was elected in Bourassa through the francophone and the 
immigrant vote. The francophones were incredibly open to 
someone from another country, who does not speak French with a 
local accent, who arrived here at the age of 35, who was educated 
elsewhere and whose habits, sometimes, and traditions are 
different. I am proud to represent my riding of Bourassa in 
Montreal North, which is typical of Quebec and Canada, where 
francophones, anglophones and immigrants understand each other.
<P>
	My name is neither Bouchard nor Tremblay, it is Nunez, and 
everyone knows I am a hispanophone. I was elected to Parliament 
to defend the interests of Quebecers, which I do vigorously. I work 
hard and I demand a lot of myself. I also here to promote the 
sovereignty of Quebec along with all my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois, the party that took me into its ranks.
<P>
	I am also here to promote social justice, equity and solidarity, to 
try to create a better place for immigrants and refugees in this 
society. I visited Canada, I met with cultural communities, I met 
with anglophones, and I explained why I am a sovereignist. I know 
that it is an emotional issue.
<P>
	I understand when there is opposition, when there are vicious 
attacks, but I do not understand when a senior minister, an 
important minister in this cabinet, goes so far as to make 
discriminatory and offensive remarks. That I cannot accept.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DubÃ©:</B> With the Prime Minister's blessing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, I say to you, I am not the slightest bit 
intimidated by the minister's remarks. They only strengthen my 
cause, my decision to continue the fight, my sovereignist 
convictions. He will not stop me. He will not drive me out of this 
country. He will not tell me what to do. I have already survived a 
dictatorship. I can survive here for years and years, even if the 
attacks are tough, personal, discriminatory, and even racist.
<P>
	This is not the first time I have been attacked by members of the 
Liberal Party of Canada. My former adversary in the riding of 
Bourassa, Denis Coderre, never accepted defeat. Last year, at a 
public meeting, he made some disagreeable remarks about me, in 
the presence of the Minister of Labour. He never dissociated 
himself  from these remarks. My former adversary wants to bring 
back the deportation act and get rid of me, because I do not espouse 
the federalist cause. He accused me of spitting on the Canadian 
flag.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Let me tell you, I have never spat on anyone's flag. I have great 
respect for flags, particularly the Canadian flag, because it is the 
symbol of a country and is close to people's hearts, they love it.
<P>
	Why is this Minister of Human Resources Development making 
such comments? The present Minister of the Environment and 
former Minister of Immigration is not from here. He was born in 
Argentina and is a member of the Italian community in Canada. I 
do not recall the Conservatives ever asking him to leave Canada 
because, in his criticism of them as a member of the official 
opposition, he did not share the views of the Conservative 
government then in power.
<P>
	I profoundly regret the silence of the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration in this matter. It is her role to promote tolerance. And 
what has she said to date? Nothing.
<P>
	I profoundly regret the silence of the parliamentary secretary to 
the Minister of Immigration, who has also had nothing to say. I 
profoundly regret the silence of the hon. member for Saint-Denis, 
who is also the chair of the Citizenship and Immigration 
committee, also of ethnic origin, and has not dissociated herself 
from the remarks made by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	There is much to be understood from their silence. I would like 
them to react, as they did when Mr. Parizeau made improper 
remarks about the ethnic Quebecers.
<P>
	I must also frankly acknowledge the solidarity of certain Liberal 
members who have come to see me and have, discreetly, expressed 
their support. They have told me that they are not pleased, and 
cannot support the views and the attacks of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development against me.
<P>
	I am also pleased that this incident has triggered a debate on the 
place of the cultural communities in Canadian society. Are 
immigrants and refugees full-fledged citizens, or are they not?
<P>
	Fortunately, there have been newspaper articles and editorials in 
a number of papers, including the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, which is not a 
sovereignist publication.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``But Mr. Young was out of line this week when he singled out 
Osvaldo Nunez, the Bloc Quebecois MP for Bourassa, to criticize 
him for supporting Quebec independence. Mr. Nunez has the right 
to support independence. Citizens, old stock and new, enjoy equal 
freedoms. All have the right to express their views and to be 
politically active. Mr. Nunez has the right to voice his opinions just 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3222"> 3222 </A></B>
<P>
like any other Canadian. If freedoms are to  have value they need 
the respect of all Canadians. Mr. Young should apologize''. This is 
from the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<I>Le Devoir</I> and <I>La Presse</I> devoted editorials to the question. I 
thank all those who sent me their support. The FTQ, by labour 
federation, sent me a message this morning. The Canadian Jewish 
Congress does not support my sovereignist ideas, but is fighting so 
that all citizens may enjoy the same rights, particularly the freedom 
of speech.
<P>
	The B'nai Brith Canada League for Human Rights, the Chilean 
and Latin American community, the American multi-ethnic centre, 
the premier of Quebec, who condemned the remarks of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development and a Montreal 
lawyer, Richard Kurland, have all expressed support. If I may, I 
would like to quote from the lawyer's letter, because it speaks for a 
lot of people who are concerned by the minister's remarks. 
Unfortunately, I cannot find it.
<P>
	I would not want a repetition of this incident, because it damages 
the reputation and the image of Canada and of all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	I was given a mandate by the people. I want to continue to fulfil 
this mandate, to fight for justice, equity and a pluralistic society 
more open to immigrants and refugees.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
begin by saying that I stand to make these comments today as a 
proud Canadian and as a proud Greek Canadian, my two heritages.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bourassa stated that we did not keep the 
promises which appear on page 82. He mentioned racial 
intolerance, hate propaganda and racial discrimination. I do not 
know where he was when we voted on Bill C-41 which covered this 
entire area. Maybe he did not support it.
<P>
	I know the hon. member for Bourassa has been abroad on 
various committees. He has heard, as have I, people in different 
countries saying: ``We cannot understand what you people are 
doing in Canada. You are working toward splitting the best country 
in the world which has been recognized not once but twice by the 
United Nations''.
<P>
	I do not understand it when he talks about tolerance. There is not 
a country on the universe which has exercised more tolerance than 
Canada. I am proud to say so. The member said that they pay taxes. 
Just paying taxes does not give anybody the right to split the 
country. We all pay taxes.
<P>
	I was not born in this country, but I cannot accept anybody who 
works toward splitting it. The member stated that he came from a 
country which had political difficulties. When he arrived in the 
country it was not Quebec that welcomed him, it was Canada that 
welcomed him. It was Canada that gave him citizenship. It was 
Canada that gave him the opportunity to sit in this honourable 
House, as I have that opportunity.
<P>
	He talked about honouring flags. As long as this country is one 
united country, the Bloc Quebecois and the province of Quebec 
should respect the flag and put it in their offices and in every 
institution in Quebec. It is a shame they do not. It is a shame they 
have falsified Canadian history and continue to do so.
<P>
	I stand behind what the Minister of Human Resources 
Development said. We have an obligation to defend this country. 
He took an oath. I took an oath. We all took an oath. Part of that 
oath was to ensure we would keep the country strong and united. 
When it comes to rights and freedoms, we do not have the right to 
split the country. I will work along with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and every other colleague in the House to 
ensure the country remains united and a beacon of hope to the 
world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, the situation is more worrisome than I 
said earlier. That a member would back the racist and 
discriminatory remarks of a minister hurts me deeply.
<P>
	When the minister made his remarks last Monday, he received a 
standing ovation from his colleagues. All the journalists are saying 
that he made a mistake, that this government has committed a 
monumental error. Reform members applauded him-at least they 
did not stand up to do so-because they also share the minister's 
views. What country is this? Did any journalists defend the 
minister? Did any editorial come to his defence? None did. On the 
contrary.
<P>
	I will read a letter-I received numerous letters of 
support-from the Centre de recherche-action sur les relations 
raciales. Mr. Fo Niemi, the director general, says: ``Mr. Young's 
excessive remarks demonstrate a flagrant lack of-''
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I would 
remind all members that just as we may not name another member 
directly, neither may we do so indirectly. Therefore, when reading 
something written by someone else, members must replace the 
name of the member or the name of the minister by his title or 
riding.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I know this requires more effort, but it is the rule of 
parliamentary debate and I ask for and encourage the co-operation 
of the member for Bourassa. This is already a very emotional 
debate. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3223"> 3223 </A></B>
<P>
nonetheless hope that we can  go on respectfully, according to our 
parliamentary tradition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I shall continue with my 
quotation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The hotheaded comments by the Minister of Human Resources Development 
demonstrate a flagrant lack of respect toward thousands of Canadians and 
Quebecers who have chosen Canada as their adoptive country and who wish to 
exercise in complete safety, freedom and dignity all of the rights, duties and 
privileges conferred upon them by Canadian citizenship.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would encourage you not to stand for this type of xenophobia which is 
unworthy of our parliamentary traditions and our fundamental values as a 
pluralistic, fair and democratic society. The minister in question must be made 
to apologize.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Continuing with another quotation, from the Ligue des Noirs du 
QuÃ©bec:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>La Ligue des Noirs du QuÃ©bec is totally scandalized by the words of the 
federal Minister of Human Resources Development concerning Bloc Quebecois 
MP Oswaldo Nunez. We find his words insulting, discriminatory and 
profoundly racist.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	They are calling for a public apology to all Canadians who have 
been deeply offended by these statements.
<P>
	This morning's <I>Le Devoir</I> contained an article which said the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We must not hesitate in condemning the words of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development concerning the Quebec MP of Chilean origin. To state, 
as the Minister of Human Resources Development did, that a new Canadian MP 
ought not to be allowed to criticize Canada's immigration policy and that he 
ought to find another country, smacks of xenophobia.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who just spoke 
comes from Chile. In the early seventies until the change to 
democracy it was a country that gave 40,000 to 80,000 lives to 
preserve democracy.
<P>
	He says he is not paid anything or receives anything in Canada. I 
might remind him he is paid to be a parliamentarian in the 
Parliament of Canada and well paid.
<P>
	He says he is here for harmony. I come from Italian ancestry on 
my maternal side. What kind of harmony does he bring to this 
country from Chile if he would separate the 450,000 Italian 
Canadians in Montreal from the one million Italians in Toronto? 
They have one thing in common. They are Canadian.
<P>
	What kind of harmony does he bring to this country if he would 
separate the five million francophones of Quebec from the 600,000 
francophones in Ontario? Would he do that in Chile?
<P>
	They have Yugoslav communities in Chile. They have aboriginal 
communities in Chile. They have Hispanic communities in Chile. 
Would he go back to Chile and split Spaniard from Spaniard, 
Yugoslav from Yugoslav?  Would he do that? If he is prepared to do 
it in Canada, then perhaps he should be prepared to go back to 
Chile and do it there.
<P>
	I might remind him that it was not P.E.I., Newfoundland or 
Ontario that saved his hide. It was Canada that gave him his 
passport. May I remind this member, that yesterday when we 
celebrated 14 Parliaments, on that podium were five French 
Canadians: the Speaker of the House, the Speaker of the Senate, the 
Governor General, the person who sang the national anthem and 
the Prime Minister. Only one of those French Canadians came from 
Quebec, two came from Ontario, one came from Manitoba and two 
from New Brunswick. Would he split that type of spirit?
<P>
	May I end with this. This hon. member sat with other Bloc 
members during the national anthem with five French Canadians 
up there trying to keep this country together. They did not sing a 
word, some of them sat with their arms crossed. Is that the kind of 
harmony that he would bring from Chile to Canada?
<P>
	I say to this hon. member that he should be ashamed of himself if 
that is his stated goal. It is certainly not demonstrated by the party 
he has joined which incidentally does not think highly of 
immigrants, if we look at what Mr. Parizeau said after the 
referendum.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	I suggest to the member that he should be ashamed of what he is 
doing to Canada. He should be ashamed of what he is doing to the 
immigrants who do not support his position.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true that I have a Canadian 
passport, like all of my Bloc Quebecois colleagues, but I hope one 
day we shall be able to have a Quebec passport.
<P>
	The minister refers to his Italian roots. I would reply that all of 
his Italian friends, at least all those I know in Quebec, are not in the 
least pleased with the comments made by his fellow minister. On 
the contrary, they are unanimous in their condemnation. I have not 
seen a single article today in the press defending the untenable, 
unsustainable, unbelievable, unparalleled comments made by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	I have here the editorial by Mrs. AgnÃ¨s Gruda in today's <I>La 
Presse</I>. She sees the Minister of Human Resources Development's 
words as a ``reflex that ends up stigmatizing the 'Other', the 
foreigner, for the political problems one has not been successful in 
solving''. She adds: ``Before sinking any further into this 
quagmire, with its slight scent of xenophobia, it would be in the 
Prime Minister's best interests to acknowledge that the immigrant 
in question has had Canadian citizenship for donkey's ages. Let his 
party respect the rules of democracy. The hon. member for  
Bourassa is fully grown, has had all his shots, and is entitled to his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3224"> 3224 </A></B>
<P>
opinions. And his political commitment is as legitimate as the next 
person's''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to participate in the debate this 
afternoon.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have before us a motion presented by our friends in the 
Reform Party, a motion, which, incidentally, is not votable, and in 
which Reformers tell us that the promises made in the 1993 
election campaign were, in their view, not kept, particularly with 
respect to the GST.
<P>
	They refer to the resignation of the former Deputy Prime 
Minister, who will be re-elected, I predict, in very short order with 
an overwhelming majority. Then the Reform Party condemns the 
government, if you can believe it, for betraying the trust of 
Canadians, and so on. They finish with a comment about the harm 
done to public institutions, governments, politicians and the 
political process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is not much truth in that. First, let us talk about the 
commitments of the government which can be found in the red 
book. Mr. Speaker, I am sure you are very familiar with that book 
and you will listen to this with the objectivity, neutrality and the 
unbiased view that Mr. Speaker gives to these things. Let me read 
from page 22 of the red book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will replace the GST with a system that generates 
equivalent revenues, is fairer to consumers and to small business, minimizes 
disruption to small business, and promotes federal-provincial fiscal 
co-operation and harmonization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Remember the word harmonization. What did the Minister of 
Finance propose some months ago? He proposed exactly this: a 
system to harmonize the tax with the provinces. That is exactly 
what was said in the red book. Not all provinces have opted for that 
yet and I regret that. The Minister of Finance has announced that he 
regrets that. But Mike Harris, the premier of Ontario who had 
previously said he was in favour of harmonization, will have to 
answer to that in the future and that is very unfortunate.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The member across the way asked why the Deputy Prime 
Minister resigned. I will get to that in a minute. I ask him to be 
patient, the way people should be. He will find in very short order 
that his party is wrong, just as wrong as the Reform Party.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will probably know that the finance committee 
had hearings on the issue of the GST. Do you know what the 
Reform Party members recommended? They had a dissenting 
report and in it they recommended that the GST be replaced with a 
harmonized system with  the provinces. Would you believe that? 
No less than the member for Calgary Centre signed those 
recommendations.
<P>
	The member for Calgary Centre is not just anybody. The 
member for Calgary Centre is someone we know very well. At one 
time he was the whip. He was the second whip for the Reform Party 
in this Parliament. Some people will recognize him as the fourth 
whip because the Reform Party has had five so far. He was the 
second and fourth whip. Anyone who can hold that office twice 
within the same Parliament and not be there on two other occasions 
is obviously someone who knows what he is saying, otherwise why 
would he have the confidence of his party so many times?
<P>
	This is the member for Calgary Centre speaking here. Page 118 
of the document states: ``We commend the government on its 
attempt to harmonize the tax with the provinces''. Let me read that 
again. This is amusing: ``We commend the government on its 
attempt to harmonize the tax with the provinces''. This is the 
member for Calgary Centre speaking. That is enough to make hon. 
members across the way in the Reform Party blush. Even worse, it 
is enough to make them silent. The Reform Party document goes 
on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>John F. Bulloch from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business put 
the harmonization issue into stark terms when he said on March 8, 1994:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``-you do not have a technical problem. There is nothing that is not known 
about this tax. You have one big political mess on your hands-the problem is 
how to build a political consensus''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
It goes on to say that they support the need for harmonization of the 
tax. Who said that? The member for Calgary Centre.
<P>
	That is precisely what the government did. I know we followed 
the advice of the Reform Party. We do not do it very often but this 
time we did and we promise not to do it too often in the future.
<P>
	Having done that, the Reform Party came back to the House and 
said that the Deputy Prime Minister had not lived up to her promise 
and therefore she should resign. They asked for her to resign and 
she did. I hope that she will shortly be re-elected. Then they 
criticize her for having resigned which is what they asked her to do 
to start with. She resigned because her government adhered to the 
policy that the Reform Party had proposed. That is another 
contradiction.
<P>
	It gets better. The Reform Party blue sheet said on taxation: 
``The Reform Party will work toward a simple, visible and flat 
system of taxation''. Later on they proposed the flat tax: ``The flat 
tax is not new to Reform nor is Reform following the American 
lead. Quite the opposite. The Reform initiative led the way on 
American tax reform, ahead of the Americans and way ahead of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3225"> 3225 </A></B>
<P>
any other political party''. This is the member  for Calgary Centre 
who said that harmonizing the tax for the province was a good idea.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The member for Calgary Centre also said a number of very good 
things that are worth quoting. He spoke about the way other 
Reformers were behaving. This is an article from the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> 
dated May 13, 1996. I am again quoting the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre who said: ``Would you vote Reform, for a party as 
disorganized as this?'' He was talking about the fact that the leader 
of his party had asked the member for Calgary Southeast to resign. 
She was booted out of the caucus or put in some sort of purgatory.
<P>
	This is what happened. The leader of the Reform Party found 
that remarks from two Reform MPs were unacceptable and that 
they should be turfed out. However, the member who pointed out 
that the remarks were unacceptable was turfed out because she said 
that the remarks were unacceptable even though the leader agreed 
and did throw them out.
<P>
	This is a little hard to follow but this is the way it worked. If 
Reform Party members denounce something that is wrong, they are 
criticized for denouncing that which is wrong even if the leader 
recognizes it himself by turfing out those who were wrong to begin 
with.
<P>
	Here is what occurred next. The member for Calgary Southeast 
then said that since they were going to turf her out for a little while 
she did not want to be part of the gang at all and she walked away. 
The member for Calgary Centre looked at all that and exclaimed: 
``Would you vote for Reform, for a party as disorganized as this?'' 
The member for Calgary Centre was quoted in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> and 
if it is in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> it is obviously true, as we all know.
<P>
	Let us quote some more about the Reform Party. This is the party 
that today talked about ethics and so on. I have in my hand a little 
book. I will not put it in front of the camera because I do not want 
to use it as a prop. It is the little green book of reform. I want to 
read a few quotes from the book because some of them are pretty 
good.
<P>
	There is a little quote by the member for Beaver River. She said: 
``Women are just trying to lift themselves up to the detriment and 
expense of men''. Let us find another one here. This is good stuff 
on the ethical behaviour of MPs and so on. Here is a great quote 
from the leader of the Reform Party: ``It is a mistake to meet 
immigrants at the boat or plane and offer them a grant to preserve 
their culture''.
<P>
	Let us move a little further. We now have the member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound. This is what the member said: ``Having 
programs in support of single mothers causes mothers to be single 
and in need of support''. Let us have another one. The MP for New 
Westminster-Burnaby when he was running in his campaign said: 
``Old age security is welfare for the aged''. It gets better. I will read 
some more. It really gets good here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> He got elected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I know, this is enough to make Reformers heckle.
<P>
	Those are not labels, they are quotes. I know it is unfair to quote 
hon. members across the way using their own words. Unfair as that 
is, thems the breaks as they say.
<P>
	The Edmonton <I>Journal</I> wrote about that gang in 1989. Writing 
about Reformers it said they were shrill and intolerant. The Calgary 
<I>Herald</I>, not exactly a bastion of Liberal support, said the Reform 
Party was strident and repugnant. The <I>Globe and Mail</I> said about 
the Reform Party in 1989 that it was narrow minded and disturbing.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> I want to hear more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> My colleagues are urging me on. I was going to 
stop but I will continue at the encouragement of my colleagues.
<P>
	Here is what <I>The New Canada</I> said. This book was written by the 
leader of the Reform Party. He said: ``Why should a few extremists 
and eccentrics have more influence with you than I do? Why 
should they have more influence than the large number of 
Reformers who are neither extreme nor eccentric?''
<P>
	This is one of the member for Beaver River's most famous 
quotes, and it is a good one: ``I am basically a Tory''. Mr. Speaker, 
how would you like to make that admission? I ask that rhetorically 
of course. I would not expect you, being the neutral person you are, 
to answer a question like that.
<P>
	The member for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia said: 
``I have been called a red neck. It is a label I wear with considerable 
pride''. The Prime Minister answered him after thinking it was an 
insult: ``As long as it is on the record and he is proud to be a red 
neck, I will honour him by calling him a red neck. That is what he 
wants to be''.
<P>
	Let us continue with a few more quotations from the little green 
book. The former senator from the Reform Party said: ``The 
Canadian government is the kind of organization that would fund 
the black lesbians from Dartmouth''. This is from the only senator 
the Reform Party has ever had.
<P>
	These are quotes from that gang, from those people before and 
after they were elected, and they are reprimanding others? They are 
talking about issues of ethics and so on?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> In English only.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3226"> 3226 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> On the contrary. I say to the hon. member across 
the way, who is criticizing me for having committed this terrible 
crime, as it appears to him, of having addressed the House in 
English, there is no reason for me to apologize. I was fortunate 
enough to represent and to have lived in a community where I can, 
I think, use one language or the other, with equal, or almost equal, 
facility.
<P>
	I have other examples here of quotes from the Reform Party, and 
we could go on for a long time, but I would prefer, in the few 
minutes remaining, to tell you about our government's 
accomplishments. This could keep us going for a while, because 
our government has accomplished some very wonderful things.
<P>
	Allow me to remind you of just a few. First, the government has 
reached the deficit reduction targets. This has to be said. We 
restored the confidence of the market and created a climate 
propitious for lowering the interest rate and creating employment. 
The unemployment rate dropped from 11.2 per cent to 9.3, still too 
high, but over 600,000 more people are working today than on the 
day we were elected.
<P>
	What is more, today we see an atmosphere of confidence in the 
investment field. The people who heeded us and invested in the 
Canadian stock market will know just how confident people now 
are in the Canadian economy.
<P>
	The Canadian economy is picking up. There is, of course, still 
too much unemployment, and we are in the process of looking at 
this area. Today, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
has tabled an initiative on manpower training.
<P>
	We could talk of the deficit, which has dropped from 6.6 per cent 
to 3 per cent of GDP in three years, something no other G-7 country 
has accomplished. Just today we saw news reports on the 
productivity levels of our country, and the improvements that have 
taken place. At this very moment, according to the OECD, we are 
more productive than Germany, France, Taiwan and a number of 
other industrialized countries. And why?
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. DubÃ©:</B> Fifteenth in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> My colleague opposite says we are the 15th most 
productive country in the world. In fact, depending on the study, it 
varies between 8th and 11th-but nevertheless. I say to him that it 
is still not so bad in terms of productivity. We are talking about our 
level of productivity and not our standard of living. If the member 
opposite wants to talk figures, in terms of standard of living and 
human development index, I would say to him-
<P>
	<B>Mr. DubÃ©:</B> There are also one million poor children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> -in terms of the human development index, the 
UN has decided three years out of four that Canada is the best place 
to live.
<P>
	I ask the Bloc Quebecois member why they said this, and I just 
heard someone talking about his sovereignty, yet again. The 
members across the way think that all they have to do is sprinkle a 
little sovereignty on an issue to make it more palatable in their 
riding. I say to them that they are mistaken.
<P>
	They can sprinkle sovereignty all over the place, but that will not 
change the facts, that will not alter what the UN said, that will not 
stop the rest of the world from envying Canada's position, and the 
inhabitants of most other countries from wanting to live here. The 
hon. member knows that, the members across the way all know 
that. They wanted to discuss numbers a while ago, but now that we 
have some numbers, they do not want to hear them.
<P>
	What I have told them is true. The members across the way, 
whether they are Reformers or members of the Bloc Quebecois, 
should work with this government to make this country, which is 
the best in the world, even better, not just for us, but for our 
children and our children's children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine DubÃ© (LÃ©vis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we need to 
remember a few things. The government whip got carried away. He 
began by talking about numbers, but these same people who tell us 
about numbers also tell us that, right now in Canada, one child in 
five is living under the poverty line. One child in five. He spoke to 
us about the rate of unemployment, which has dropped slightly 
since the Liberal Party came to power.
<P>
	However, what he does not say is that the welfare rolls jumped 
by 40,000 in Quebec because of the UI cuts. This government has 
cut spending on social programs by $7 billion since coming to 
power. Seven billion is not negligible.
<P>
	He boasts that the government has managed to reach its 
budgetary targets, but how? By slashing social programs, 
particularly UI.
<P>
	I would like to ask him the following question: concerning the 
GST, if the government was so good at keeping its promises, such 
as those in the red book, we heard the Prime Minister, during the 
debates and on television, and it was reported in the papers, say that 
he would scrap the GST, meaning eliminate it. Eliminate does not 
mean replace or change.
<P>
	Soon after this promise, the Deputy Prime Minister said that if 
they did not eliminate the GST, she would resign. And she did. But 
she is running again, and says she will be re-elected. The Liberal 
whip is no doubt well aware of what it will cost to clear her 
reputation and show that she kept her promise to Canadians. We 
will perhaps see her again in the House, and I hope we do. I am not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3227"> 3227 </A></B>
<P>
opposed to her coming back, of course, that is up  to the people in 
her Ontario riding and has nothing to do with me.
<P>
	So what does he think of that? That is good enough, you break 
your promise, you resign, you run again in a byelection, you come 
back, and there you go, everything is taken care of? I would like to 
have his comments on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to say first of all that I 
find the hon. member's comments rather interesting, since he says, 
on the one hand, that the government has not fulfilled enough of the 
red book promises, although indeed we have.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	On the other hand, he accuses the government of having done 
precisely what it said in the red book with respect to the GST. I 
have just read that into <I>Hansard</I> already. We also tabled a copy of it 
a while ago. Are we to conclude from this that the hon. member 
wants us to adhere to the red book when it suits him, and not to do 
so when it does not suit him?
<P>
	Second, I find the comment on the former member for Hamilton 
East-and the future member, I hope-rather interesting. The hon. 
members opposite are the ones who forced her resignation. And 
resign she did. From that very moment on, the job of finding her 
replacement does not belong to the hon. members across the floor, 
but strictly to the voters in her riding.
<P>
	As for those who question Ms. Copp's right to run again, I would 
say they need to have more respect for democracy. It is the people 
who choose. I am willing to bet that I know already what the people 
in her riding have in their minds, but they will be the ones to have 
the final say and they will decide. When their decision is made, the 
hon. members over there will have to pipe down and respect the 
people's choice, as they ought to have respected the choice of the 
people of Quebec in two referendums when they said no to the 
sovereignty the people across the way were proposing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the negative comments of 
the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. He quoted a 
lot. He quoted some Reform statements which I would support. 
However, most of what he quoted was totally out of context, 
including the dissenting report on the GST. He said that Reform 
supported harmonizing the GST.
<P>
	Harmonization by its very nature means that the provinces and 
the federal government must be in agreement. We do not have 
harmonization. The Liberals have not kept their promise of 
harmonizing the GST. Only three provinces have agreed to 
harmonize the GST at the expense of taxpayers in the other 
provinces. They have even refused to compensate the province of  
Quebec, which had previously harmonized the GST federally with 
its provincial sales tax.
<P>
	The member is totally out to lunch. He is not making any sense 
at all. The harmonization which he talked about will raise taxes.
<P>
	The hon. member quoted Reform members. I have a letter 
written by the government whip regarding the GST. The letter was 
in response to a constituent from Ontario and was dated March 1, 
1995. I do not think the hon. member wants to hear his own words, 
but he is going to hear them anyway.
<P>
	He wrote one paragraph on the GST: ``Lastly, concerning the 
GST, our government did promise to do away with it''. Those are 
the words of the government whip. This is a member who has some 
credibility in the House because of his position. The government 
whip said: ``Our government did promise to do away with it''. Not 
to harmonize it, but to do away with it. It is written on this piece of 
paper. The letter continues: ``However, we still have four years left 
in our current mandate to fulfil this promise and, like the others, it 
will be kept''. Like the others it is being broken.
<P>
	The Liberals are not talking about doing away with the GST. The 
hon. member himself will admit they are not talking about doing 
away with the GST. They are now talking about harmonizing it. 
They are not really harmonizing it because there is no harmony 
between the federal government and the provinces. It is a bunch of 
balderdash from the member.
<P>
	He quoted Reformers out of context. He should look at his own 
words and decide if he should resign. At least the former hon. 
member for Hamilton East kept her word. She resigned when she 
was unable to fulfil her promise to Canadians. Maybe the member 
did not promise to resign. Maybe he does not think it is important 
to resign when he fails to keep his word.
<P>
	Here it is in black and white: ``Our government did promise to 
do away with it''. The hon. member is not fulfilling the promise he 
made in his own correspondence to a constituent, which is wrong. 
Would the hon. member consider resigning and going back to face 
his constituents? He did not even have the courage to face 700 of 
his own constituents on the gun control bill. He did not even have 
the courage to go to the meeting to talk to his constituents.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before I give the floor to the government whip of 
course no one's courage is in question in the House, as we 
mentioned the other day. I would admonish all of you please. Do 
not question each other's courage. It is a given in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. member across the 
way is equally courageous.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3228"> 3228 </A></B>
<P>
	When that party was elected it talked about keeping promises. 
They said they would have a new way of doing politics. They are 
the worst hecklers in the place. They are the most disruptive 
people. They got kicked out of the Chamber for bad behaviour 
and everything else. They talk about breaking promises. They are 
on thin ice.
<P>
	Let us talk about the letter given to Rick Anderson's relatives 
which was brought to the attention of the House by the hon. 
member when I said that the government would do away with the 
tax and replace it with something else. I believe that we are 
replacing the system with one that is harmonized with the province.
<P>
	I will repeat what it says on page 22: ``A Liberal government 
will replace the GST with a system that generates equal revenues,'' 
so it is not a matter of having no tax at all, ``equal revenues, is 
fairer to consumers, a harmonized tax that collects money from 
consumers once, that is fairer to businesses'', it achieves that, 
``minimizes disruption to small business''. It is less disruptive to 
have one system than two, ``and promotes federal-provincial fiscal 
co-operation and harmonization''. That is what we have offered.
<P>
	So far only four of the ten provinces have joined. It is true to say 
that Reform MPs approved, and I read from the report of the 
committee that it was their solution as well. They wanted to replace 
the system. I read again to them: ``We commend the government on 
its attempt to harmonize the tax with the provinces''. ``We 
commend'' says the Reform member for Calgary Centre with his 
usual eloquence. That is precisely what the government proposed.
<P>
	The members across the way can change their minds five times, 
ten times or as the health minister said, change their position every 
single Monday. It will not matter. The Canadian public knows that 
we live with that promise as we do with all others.
<P>
	Finally the member accused me and my party of doing exactly 
what we promised to do on gun control. That is what it means to 
keep a promise. That is what we would like to do with not only the 
gun control promise, the GST promise but all other promises as 
well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
may I welcome you back after your reception with the 21 
scholarship winners of the Canada Trust scholarship for special 
community service. I met them this morning at the Governor 
General's residence where the Canada Trust official presented the 
scholarships. It was a wonderful experience to meet with these 
beautiful young people.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this afternoon you would have been treated to 
probably one of the most theatrical performances of the Minister of 
Health, the member for Cape Breton-East Richmond. I have 
never seen anybody come forward with such rhetoric and such 
oratory and with such theatrical excitement as we heard here. In 
fact  there was one point at which I thought he should be joining 
some kind of a ministerial association because he was really 
bringing about fire, brimstone and everything else that could 
possibly be perpetrated on the people of Canada.
<P>
	He also demonstrated extreme skill as a debater. The people of 
Canada will be the judge of whether or not he spoke the truth.
<P>
	Similarly, we just heard a performance by the hon. whip of the 
government. He took certain quotations very selectively from 
certain documents and made it abundantly apparent to everybody 
concerned that if one wants to prove a particular point and take 
words out of context one can prove virtually anything.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	The point that needs to be recognized is that in the House, 
members first responsibility is not necessarily to debate for the 
sake of debating, but to debate to get the best possible decision, the 
best possible policies, the best possible laws for the benefit of all 
Canadians. They are not here to prove each other stupid or make 
each other look like they do not know what they are talking about 
or that they are not consistent in the things they say. That is the 
issue.
<P>
	Sometimes things happen in this place which should not happen. 
Members fail to recognize that while they debate and are concerned 
about the big and lofty issues in the House, the people in the 
constituencies are concerned about the safety of their streets and 
whether their concerns are being dealt with. They are concerned 
about their pensions, their health care. There is uncertainty 
developing in Canada today.
<P>
	I cannot help but refer to the hon. whip who just a moment ago 
seemed to be so proud of the fact that Canada ranks eighth or 
fifteenth in the world in the productivity of the people. Why cannot 
we be first? The United Nations has declared Canada to be the most 
desirable country in the world in which to live. I think that is 
wonderful and I am proud of it. However, Canada should also be 
number one in productivity. But it is not. Some people are satisfied 
to rank eighth or fifteenth in the nations of the world. We can 
become first, but we need to make some changes.
<P>
	I want to refer to a letter I received a year ago from 12-year old 
Joshua Goode of Winfield. ``My dad says that Canada is more than 
$500 billion in debt. Is that true? It worries me because that means 
one day I will have to pay for it and I did not have a choice in the 
matter of spending it''.
<P>
	What can I tell him? I have to tell him that not only is it $500 
billion but as of this morning it is $582 billion and rising. For Josh 
and the rest of the constituents of Okanagan Centre, I want an end 
to unnecessary government spending and I want a balanced budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3229"> 3229 </A></B>
<P>
	The constituents of Okanagan Centre are debt weary. They are 
tired of talking about the debt. They want to see results. They want 
light at the end of the tunnel. Empty words that sound nice do 
not do any good when it is discovered the truth lies somewhere 
else.
<P>
	I was in a grade 12 class not too long ago and we went through 
what the Minister of Finance indicated so clearly. He said: ``Look, 
our deficit is going down''. The students looked at it and said: 
``That is wonderful. The deficit is going down each year''. Then we 
looked at the fact that each year's deficit is added to the previous 
year's debt. As the deficit is going down the debt is rising. As the 
debt rises the interest charges against the debt also rise. That is the 
natural predator of our social and other programs that people want 
assurances will continue.
<P>
	Members need to recognize that things have to change in order 
for us to give Canadians the assurances they need. The people of 
Canada know only too well that governments cannot keep spending 
more than they take in without some day finding that the freedom 
which is enjoyed today will be placed in jeopardy because of 
previous commitments and there is no longer the financial freedom 
to do the things they want to do. People are being asked through a 
decision by this government to surrender their personal freedom in 
the future in order to pay the debt which is growing on a daily basis.
<P>
	They do not want to face the prospect that this 12-year old Josh 
Goode should have to worry about the debt. My constituents want 
no more deficits. They want to see tax and debt relief so that their 
household incomes will stop being eaten away. They want a 
reformed tax system which is fair and rewards success, innovation 
and productivity.
<P>
	What about social well-being in the future? Here I refer to Mrs. 
Laursen of Kelowna who writes: ``I am so very angry hearing about 
the waste of government spending, when my husband, a senior, and 
myself have to live on a small amount of income, to make repairs, 
pay rent, pay gas, hydro, medical bills. My advice to the 
government is, you had better learn to adjust. We have. You do 
too''.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	If the seniors in my riding can adjust, why cannot the 
government? I submit that it can. Why should Mr. and Mrs. 
Laursen and people like them have to carry the debt? They do not 
have to. Something can be done. Something should be done. 
Something must be done.
<P>
	My constituents want greater personal security. They want to be 
assured that the level of support they have for social programs will 
continue to exist. They want their pensions to remain at the level 
where they are today and not threatened to be reduced in the future.
<P>
	They want the quality of their health care to be maintained. They 
want access to income support  programs in periods of 
unemployment. They want them to be there in sickness and in other 
personal hardship. They do not want them reduced. They want 
them to be maintained.
<P>
	Unless some changes are made in the current fiscal situation, not 
only will these programs not be maintained where they are but they 
will be cut back. We will not be able to afford them.
<P>
	Our young people should have no fear about growing old, to feel 
that they will not have the security that they need. It is terribly 
unfair for the government to leave them hanging, wondering what 
they can look forward to.
<P>
	I want to suggest to members opposite that we must stop. We can 
no longer justify unnecessary spending like the most recent 
invitation to Magna International, a highly profitable company, to 
be offered $2.4 million for a training program. Who is paying for 
that training program? It is the taxpayers in Kelowna. It is the 
taxpayers in Okanagan Centre, the businesses with whom Magna 
International is sometimes competition. Their tax dollars are going 
to pay for a training program that Magna International can well 
afford to do on its own.
<P>
	What I want for my constituents is courageous leadership that is 
not afraid to say what needs to be done and then acts quickly to 
avoid further erosion of our social net in Canada.
<P>
	Elimination of the deficit is the absolute number one 
requirement and then retirement of the debt through expenditure 
reduction, not increased taxation, will give assurance to retirees.
<P>
	What about justice? I refer to Mr. Oliver who is a resident of 
Okanagan Centre and lives in Kelowna. He is an ex-officer of a 
police force. He says: ``The death of Margaret Shoup of this city 
formed part of a series of crimes committed by a 17-year-old youth 
who blatantly ignored the fact that he had earlier been found guilty 
of serious crimes and who continued his recklessness and 
threatening escapades, thumbing his nose at the law at every turn.
<P>
	``Were the justice minister to tackle the problems of crime, 
especially juvenile crime, with half as much vigour as has been 
directed toward gun control, citizens might be inclined to show 
respect.
<P>
	``As a former police officer, I hold every sympathy for citizens, 
especially the elderly, who see the continual erosion of the justice 
system in our country and who, in many instances, are terrified of 
continuing violence and the puny measures that our government 
insists on levelling to combat the same''. The justice system is a 
disgrace according to this ex-police officer.
<P>
	May I refer to an article that appeared in the <I>Globe</I> this morning. 
It is a front page news story. I do not have time to read the whole 
thing. It concerns one of the boys who murdered some of these 
other young people. The  article states that the boy who is well 
known to police said to the arresting officers that they cannot do 
anything to him because, under the Young Offenders Act, he is not 
old enough to be charged with a crime. Why is this so? This is 
probably one of the most serious statements I have read in a long 
time, on May 29, 1996.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3230"> 3230 </A></B>
<P>
	Dr. Louis Morissette, age 41, who is working with some very 
seriously disturbed people says this. ``Youth today have less hope 
for the future than we did. When I was growing up, I never thought 
about the future. The future was there for me to take. It is not true 
today. It is not true for the jobs. It is not true for the family. It is not 
true for security in a general sense. It is not true for sexuality, 
because you can get AIDS and things like that.
<P>
	``Young people are growing up too soon, too fast and with too 
little love and encouragement. They do not feel for other people 
because they have the impression that other people do not feel for 
them. I do not excuse them. As a society, we have to look at how we 
take care of our children''. That should be our concern. We need to 
love our children. We need to encourage them, we need to give 
them role models. By having legislation that deals with young 
offenders in such a way that they have no respect either for the 
arresting officer or for the punishment levied will not give the kind 
of support and direction our young people need.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	My constituents want to feel safe on their streets. They want to 
know that appropriate punishment will exist and will fit the crime 
and that communities are all taking responsibility for our young 
people to prevent crime. That is not just a matter for the 
government, it is not just a matter for the social agencies, it is a 
matter for everyone of us.
<P>
	We must place the rights of victims ahead of the rights of 
criminals, eliminating statutory release provisions for high risk 
offenders and changes to the parole board so that qualified 
correctional officers and not political appointees make the 
decisions.
<P>
	I refer to unity. I read extensively from a letter I received from 
two of my constituents. Mr. and Mrs. Sprecher wrote the following 
on December 8, 1995, addressed to the Prime Minister:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You are making a big mistake. Your proposals for distinct society for Quebec 
and constitutional vetoes are not sources for unity of Canada. They will divide 
Canada. Meech Lake and the Charlottetown accord were both soundly defeated 
by the people. You have no mandate to offer them to Quebec again. You 
obviously want to sacrifice western Canada to appease Quebec. Are you 
prepared to alienate B.C., Alberta and Ontario? These are the three provinces 
that supply the money for the transfer payments so you can buy your votes in 
Quebec. Canadians do not want a distinct society. We want our country united. 
You might gain Quebec for a short time, then lose the rest of Canada because of 
it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You have not been listening to Canadians. There is no need for special status or 
veto powers to be granted to any province. Canadians are giving you a strong 
message that they want fair laws applicable to all equally. You are being grossly 
misinformed if you believe that an overwhelming majority of Canadians are ready 
to make concessions to appease separatists and to reward Quebecers for their no 
votes during the referendum. Canadians are fed up with the eternal costly ranting, 
whining and threats from Quebec. We are fed up with the huge amount of money 
spent on bilingualism and repeated concessions made to pacify Quebec. It is time 
for Quebecers to learn the truth about our country. They should be told they will 
not be allowed to break up Canada. They should be told that they are not distinct, 
not part of France, and told once and for all that they are Canadians. There is one 
terminology, we are all Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If Quebec wants change the rest of the country must also benefit from change. 
Any change that gives Quebec an advantage over the rest of Canada is not 
acceptable. The federal government must know that we will not stand for any 
additional Quebec handouts, no rewards for staying in Canada with the constant 
threat of yet another round of separation talks in the future. We do not want 
another Quebec referendum, ever. No one ethnic group should be treated any 
better than others. This includes Quebec, native Indians or any other group that 
think they should receive special status and their own government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is high time we recognize we are together in this nation. I was 
so proud of my colleague from Scarborough who said so clearly 
what Canada meant to him as an immigrant to this country. That 
was a wonderful message coming from the heart of that individual. 
I identified completely with the message he was giving to 
Canadians and to me as another member of Parliament.
<P>
	I am proud to be a parliamentarian. I am happy we can have 
altercations back and forth across the House. What makes me sad is 
when people take things out of context deliberately to prove a point 
which was never the point what was intended to be made. The truth 
ought to stand, and that is integrity. It is not a mark of integrity to 
take things out of context to prove a point which was never the 
message in the first place.
<P>
	Many constituents of Okanagan Centre condemn the government 
for betraying their trust. Because of the lack of promises being 
filled there is now developing a cynicism about public institutions, 
about government, politicians and the political process.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	There are two encouraging points. They are willing to help. I 
quote a letter from Bruce Eckhoff to the Minister of Finance:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am willing at any time to assist you in determining a constructive means of 
performing this task.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I wish to advise you that I can no longer tolerate any increases in taxation. In 
addition, I will not tolerate anything less than meaningful reductions in 
government spending.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By increasing taxes you are forcing more Canadians to the underground 
economy. You are taxing the incentives to work out of this country. Many of my 
co-workers no longer believe it is  possible to get ahead, as the government will tax 
any additional effort away.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is time to wean the corporations and special interest groups off the 
government payroll. I am fed up with out of control spending by government. It 
is time for you to leave the money in the hands of the individual taxpayer and let 
them make choices on how to spend it. Government has gone too far.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Please do not place any additional burden on the future generations of this 
fine country. It is time to get the house in order. I am willing at any time to assist 
you in determining a constructive means of performing this task.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No more taxes. Enough is enough.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is willingness to co-operate and willingness to help. There 
is more.
<P>
	Peter Greer, a columnist with the Winfield Calendar writes: ``I 
am going to vote. I want to vote for a politician who shows true 
leadership; one who leads, not one who merely wants to manage. I 
want to vote for someone who truly cares for his fellow man''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3231"> 3231 </A></B>
<P>
	There have been special little demonstration of that caring in the 
House in the legislation presented in the last two years. Not enough 
caring has gone on. Not enough caring has been demonstrated by 
the speeches made here today.
<P>
	We have seen feeble legislation dealing with justice. We have 
had legislation of a harmonization program of the GST, which 
really is not an elimination of the GST, which has been so aptly 
illustrated by a number of my colleagues. The results of that 
harmonization will not help. It will add additional taxes and 
additional requirements. People will pay more as a result of this. 
Other provinces will have to add more to the transfer to those 
provinces which are being bribed into harmonization.
<P>
	Canadians do want to help and that is why the Reform Party 
came into being. However, there can be no help if government is 
not prepared to listen. None are so blind as those who will not see. 
None are so deaf as those who will not hear.
<P>
	May this resolution draw our attention and awaken all of us to a 
challenge that we as Reformers are prepared to endorse, that we 
will bring about a better society for Canada, that we can be the best 
country to live in, that we can be the most productive country in the 
world where we listen to the people and we will bring to the people 
of Canada that which they look for, and that is what we will give to 
the country when we form the next government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard the 
member say that it was time the west stopped making sacrifices for 
Quebec. I would like to point out to him that Quebec made 
sacrifices for at least 75 years to develop western Canada. He 
should perhaps remember  his history. We paid for the railways, the 
St. Lawrence Seaway, and so on.
<P>
	The hon. member belongs to the Reform Party, a party that 
supposedly wants to reform the British parliamentary system, to 
improve things. I am partly in agreement with that. I think some 
changes are required in the British parliamentary system.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	It is still somewhat worrisome to see polls showing that barely 
14 per cent of Canadians still trust parliamentarians. It is an 
important question that must be asked, and I think the Reform 
Party is right to want to make changes with respect to the British 
parliamentary system, I grant it that.
<P>
	The principal method they have chosen, which, in my view, is a 
good method, is the free vote. In the last few election campaigns, 
we have seen that governments make promises, they have 
platforms, they try to please the public with these platforms and 
these promises, and they win elections on them.
<P>
	What we are noticing is that, after the election, and this is what 
the motion presented today by the Reform Party is all about, after 
getting elected, most of the time the government does exactly the 
opposite. Unfortunately, as government members have to vote 
along party lines, the government does pretty much as it pleases.
<P>
	If members had the possibility of a free vote, governments 
elected on the strength of promises and platforms would have to 
deliver on them. I know that the majority of government members 
are often not in agreement with the government. They often feel a 
bit dishonest voting against the very issues that led them to run for 
office.
<P>
	When I ran for the Conservatives in 1984, I had looked at the 
Conservative platform and felt that it was the best match with my 
aspirations. It is very important for me to be able to continue to 
promote the aspirations which I have and which I have undertaken 
to promote with the party for which I ran.
<P>
	I find there is a major flaw in the British parliamentary system, 
and this is it: the Prime Minister has so much power, has all the 
power. He has the power to appoint ministers, parliamentary 
secretaries, committee chairs indirectly, so most of the time he is 
involved in blackmail, rewarding or punishing his MPs. This 
creates a system which, when it comes down to it, does not match 
the public's perception of their MPs. That is one of the reasons for 
MPs' very low popularity; 14 per cent of the population believe in 
their credibility.
<P>
	As parliamentarians we should be counteracting that. I am 
asking the Reform Party, which has set out to reform the 
parliamentary system, to go still further. Each time the members of 
that party vote, they should point out that they are voting freely. If 
there are two, three, four,  five MPs who vote nay, great. Vote 
against, if you are not in agreement. This parliamentary system 
must be reformed, slowly of course, but it must be done so that one 
day some of the public trust will be regained. Otherwise, the 
parliamentary system will end up being unacceptable; people will 
no longer believe in us. They barely do now.
<P>
	I am anxious to see that day come. I know that parliamentary 
systems cannot be changed over night. I know that it takes a fair 
amount of time to change old habits, but I hope that the Reform 
Party will put a great deal of stress on this and will make MPs both 
more responsible and entrusted with more responsibility, so that 
the day will come when our governments will be more responsible. 
When they go before the people seeking a mandate to govern the 
country, they will have a platform, and it is on the basis of that 
platform that the government will defend the interests of the 
public.
<P>
	I am asking the Reform Party to continue its efforts to reform the 
British parliamentary system, particularly this aspect of it.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
endorsement on changing the democratic process and the system in 
the House. I would like to expand on it one step further because it 
allows me to make some very specific suggestions. One has to do 
with a vote of confidence.
<P>
	Not long ago in the House a government member voted against 
the budget. The Prime Minister interpreted it to be a vote of 
non-confidence.
<P>
	I think that is false. I recommend the parliamentary system be 
changed. The Reform Party recommends that with regard to any 
government bill, including a financial bill, it should be possible for 
members, including members of the ruling party, to vote against a 
bill. Then following that if they really have no confidence in the 
government it should be a separate motion which could be voted on 
separately. Much better decisions would be made, better legislation 
would be passed and the wishes of constituents could be expressed 
more clearly.
<P>
	Another area concerns the other place which is populated only 
by individuals selected and appointed by the Prime Minister 
without consultation with his caucus, constituents or the House. We 
suggest those people be elected in their respective provinces and 
that each province should have the same number of senators so 
there could be a balance of representation across Canada and there 
would be an appropriate balance of regions and effective powers.
<P>
	There needs to be a checks and balances in the way decisions are 
made in Parliament. If members of the other place were elected 
they could carry out the responsibilities of that place the way they 
should be done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
afternoon what we got from the member for Okanagan Centre is the 
usual mantra, the usual tirade, the usual fearmongering from the 
Reform Party and the usual attacks on certain Canadians, as 
aboriginals and Quebecers.
<P>
	Members of the House know I hold no grief for separatists and 
separatism. Members of the Reform Party go around-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Tell the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Do you want to listen?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not if you are going to lie like that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> This is the place for debate 
but we should conduct it in a parliamentary fashion. Please make 
all interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was trying to point out the Reform 
Party would like one day to be a national party. It says someday it 
would like to govern the country. Yet there is hardly a day when 
members of the Reform Party do not try to sully the province of 
Quebec. Not a day goes by that they do not try to sully 
francophones How do they ever expect to govern the country when 
they tarnish and besmirch and sully the citizens of the province of 
Quebec? There is no way a they can govern a country if they choose 
to attack one group of people day in and day out.
<P>
	These people who pretend to be such model democrats should 
actually be very ashamed of themselves for that kind of behaviour.
<P>
	The member for Okanagan Centre talked about wanting to adjust 
the economy. Of course we want to adjust the economy for the 
better. He does not say anything about the job creation that has 
taken place since the fall of 1993. It never crossed his lips that 
636,000 jobs have been created since the fall of 1993. He does not 
mention that whatsoever.
<P>
	There have to be changes. He talked about the country only 
being only eighth in productivity. Maybe we are only eighth in 
productivity but we are trying to be number one and we are aiming 
that way. He said the deficit was too high. Has he noticed the deficit 
is coming down?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.49 p.m., 
proceedings on the motion have expired. The House will now 
proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business as 
listed on today's Order Paper.

	The House resumed from May 15 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-205, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the 
Copyright Act (profit from authorship respecting a crime), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I please to speak in the House today and support Bill 
C-205, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Copyright Act to 
prevent criminals from profiting by selling stories of their crimes.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	One of the first lessons we learn in life is that crime does not pay. 
We are taught that justice always prevails and criminals are always 
punished. As we grow into adulthood we realize this is not always 
so. We learn that crime sometimes does pay and that justice does 
not always prevail. This is wrong. That is why we need legislation 
like Bill C-205 which will ensure crime does not pay.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3233"> 3233 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill is based on two principles, the first being that no 
criminal should ever profit from telling the story of his crime. This 
is not an outrageous statement. This is the common law that 
societies have existed on for centuries. This is why a man who 
murders his wife cannot collect her life insurance, even as the 
named beneficiary. However, should that same man make a movie 
or write a book about killing his wife and make profits from that 
sale, there is no law that prohibits this. This is unjust. Surely 
receiving payments for writing a book is as much profiting from 
the crime as collecting the insurance money.
<P>
	This bill will put a stop to profiting from authorship respecting a 
crime. Bill C-205 amends the Criminal Code to include in the 
definition of proceeds of crime any profit or benefit gained by a 
person or a family member from the creation of a work based on 
the indictable offence for which that person was convicted. 
Therefore the government would be able to seize such profits under 
the current Criminal Code provisions respecting search for and 
seizure and detention of proceeds of crime.
<P>
	This alone would not help if as an example a criminal sells his or 
her story to a movie or book producer in the United States who then 
deposits the criminal's payment into a U.S. bank account. In order 
to deal with such a possibility Bill C-205 will amend also the 
Copyright Act to provide that the sentence for an indictable offence 
is deemed to include an order that any work based on this offence is 
subject to a new section in the Copyright Act.
<P>
	The bill amends the Copyright Act to provide that in such a work 
the copyright that would otherwise belong to the criminal becomes 
and remains the property of the crown forever. This would permit 
Canada to bring action in any country of the world which is a 
signatory to the Berne Convention on Copyright to enforce its 
rights, including seizure of funds paid to the criminal or injunctions 
to halt the sale of books, movies, videos and the like.
<P>
	Many people will say the bill goes against society's belief of 
freedom of speech. This is not so. The second principle of the bill is 
based on the fact that criminals have the right of freedom of speech 
and expression provided they do not profit from it. The bill is not 
imposing a gag order on criminals. It is saying they cannot make 
money from their criminal activities.
<P>
	The province of Ontario recently became the first Canadian 
province to pass a law similar to that of Bill C-205. Under the law 
criminals and people wishing to capitalize on crime must notify the 
province's trustee of any deal struck. All profits going to the 
offender must pass through the trustee's office. The trustee will 
ensure the money is first used to satisfy awards to the victims. The 
state of California also recently passed such a law following the 
notorious Simpson case.
<P>
	Bill C-205 will also provide much needed protection for victims 
of crime and ensure their pain and suffering are not exploited. 
Imagine dealing with the grief of losing a child, a loved one, only 
to be revictimized by the killer's making stories and profiting from 
his activities. The effect of such exploitation on victims is 
overwhelming and unacceptable. Canada must do more to protect 
victims of crime. This bill will ensure victims' rights and freedoms 
are respected as well.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	We live in a sensationalist society where criminals are quickly 
elevated to almost a hero status. Even the most horrendous crimes 
are considered glamorous. One need only remember the Jeffrey 
Dahmer case in the United States. In 1991 Jeffrey Dahmer was 
convicted of the deaths and dismemberment of 17 men and boys. 
While serving his time in prison Mr. Dahmer received over 
$100,000 from his so-called fans around the world. Even today, 
after Mr. Dahmer's death, there are several web sites dedicated to 
him on the Internet. How tragic.
<P>
	One does not need to look south of the border to find another 
example of this type of sensationalism. In Canada one need only 
look at the infamous Clifford Olson. Mr. Olson has managed to 
provoke publicity over the past 14 years since he pleaded guilty in 
1982 to murdering 11 young people in British Columbia. He has 
established a network of pen pals and groupies around the world 
and has written stories about his crimes. Recently he has made 
videotapes entitled ``Motivational Sexual Homicide Patterns of 
Serial Child Killer Clifford Robert Olson''. Mr. Olson has even 
gone as far as to  register a copyright on the videos. My heart goes 
out to the families of these victims. How horrible it must be to 
relive the crimes through these videos. These families are being 
victimized over and over again.
<P>
	Bill C-205 will not stop Clifford Olson from telling his story and 
seeking more publicity. However, it will certainly prevent Mr. 
Olson from ever making a cent from these tapes. Perhaps that alone 
is enough to help ease the pain of the families.
<P>
	I urge all hon. members to support the bill. It will help to ensure 
victims and their families are not further victimized by criminals. It 
will also reaffirm the principle inherent in the Canadian criminal 
justice system that crime does not pay. It is of paramount 
importance that this bill become federal law in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to add my support to this bill. Essentially, what the member 
for Scarborough West is attempting to do with this bill is prevent a 
person convicted of a crime from benefiting from the crime 
through a book, a video or some other work. It would be 
inconsistent to condemn an act and yet allow someone to benefit 
from it. I therefore support the intent of this bill, which is to correct 
an uncommon situation, but one we saw recently in the Olson case 
and which could arise again at any time.
<P>
	It is indeed fairly rare that a person who has committed a crime 
has the gall to display it in the full light of day in a video or a book. 
However, since the law currently contains no provision against 
such behaviour, there is a gap to be filled, and this is what the 
member for Scarborough West is proposing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3234"> 3234 </A></B>
<P>
	Our role as members of this House is to propose or support 
measures intended to bring our laws into line with reality. When a 
member sees a gap and takes the initiative to introduce legislation 
to correct the matter, we must put aside our differences and vote in 
favour of his bill.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, in his 
speech on May 15, applauded the motives that led the member to 
want to amend the law to prevent criminals from writing the story 
of their crime or threatening to do so in exchange for money.
<P>
	He went on to say, and I quote: ``The very idea that a criminal 
who has committed a violent act or a series of violent acts, such as 
in the Bernardo case, could actually benefit financially from the 
recounting of his or her criminal acts is extremely offensive to 
many. If the victims of those crimes are made to be subject to those 
accounts, are they not being victimized again?'' He added: ``It is 
therefore something which I believe should be addressed and I 
commend my colleague for attempting to do so through this bill''.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	However, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice 
is against this bill because it would unduly limit freedom of 
expression in a free and democratic society, as stipulated in the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	In our opinion, we can answer this by saying that section 1 of the 
charter allows for the restriction of certain rights within reasonable 
limits that can be justified in a free and democratic society. It is 
under section 1 that courts can justify random vehicle searches to 
check the drivers' blood alcohol level.
<P>
	Section 163 of the Criminal Code prohibits the publication of 
something obscene or a crime comic. The Supreme Court 
recognized that this violation of the freedom of expression was 
justifiable.
<P>
	While it is true that the bill before us restricts freedom of 
expression by depriving a person of copyright royalties, there is a 
rational link between this restriction and the widespread 
disapproval generated by the release of a video or a book by an 
offender. This bill seeks, among other things, to protect the privacy 
of witnesses and victims, so as to encourage them to report a crime 
and to testify before the courts.
<P>
	We feel that such an objective justifies restricting the freedom of 
expression of an offender. Many measures seeking to protect 
witnesses actually violate certain basic guarantees, but are deemed 
acceptable by the courts, including provisions allowing witnesses 
to testify outside the courts or in camera. Even the right of the 
accused to cross-examine a witness can be restricted in order to 
protect the victim. In certain situations, the court can also ban the 
publication of any information that could lead to the identification 
of the plaintiff or a witness. As you can see, the Criminal Code 
already provides for several restrictions on freedom of speech in 
order to protect the witnesses. The restriction proposed in this bill 
seems to have a similar intent, in my opinion.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary has also opposed this bill because 
this matter is under provincial jurisdiction, dealing as it does with 
civil rights, specifically the right to write a book and make a profit 
from it. I can understand this objection, but the intent of the bill is 
not to regulate artistic creation, but to preserve the anonymity of 
witnesses in criminal proceedings and deter crime. To the extent 
that the objective sought is obviously within the jurisdiction of this 
Parliament, it can decree all the ancillary provisions necessary to 
ensure that its legislation is effective and complete.
<P>
	That is precisely what this bill does, and I will therefore vote in 
favour, despite the fact that the member for Scarborough West 
objected to my witness protection bill. I have tried not to be 
influenced by this in my comments today, and especially in my 
analysis of his bill.
<P>
	Finally, one final argument raised by the parliamentary secretary 
in opposition to this bill runs along the lines that the creation of a 
work by the author of a crime cannot be added to the list of 
proceeds of crime, since the simple fact of writing a book is not, in 
itself, a criminal act, even if this book is a recitation of criminal 
activities for which the author has been sentenced. In this regard, I 
do not share the view of the parliamentary secretary. I do not see 
why the definition of ``proceeds of crime'' would not include 
money arising from the publication of a work describing a crime. 
The advantage of using this definition is that the product of the 
publication can be seized and confiscated.
<P>
	This is therefore an entirely appropriate technique in order to put 
some teeth into this legislation, which is an improvement to the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak this evening on Bill C-205, the proposed legislation which 
would amend the Criminal Code and the Copyright Act to prohibit 
a criminal from profiting by selling, authorizing or authoring the 
story or details of a crime.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	Copyright refers to a system of legal rights that has been 
developed to acknowledge and protect the intellectual labour and 
works of authors and creators of every nature: literary, artistic, 
dramatic, musical. Copyright allows these individuals to control 
the exploitation of their works, to profit from their works and to 
protect the integrity of their works. Copyright should not be unduly 
interfered with, only under exceptional circumstances. Bill C-205 
is one of these circumstances.
<P>
	This bill amends the Criminal Code to include the definition of 
proceeds of crime as any profit or benefit gained by a person 
convicted of an indictable offence, or his family, from the creation 
of a work based on that offence.
<P>
	This amendment extends to such profits or benefits in the 
existing provisions of the Criminal Code respecting search for, 
seizure and detention of proceeds of crime. It provides that a 
sentence for an indictable offence is deemed to include an order 
that any work based on the offence is subject to a new section in the 
Copyright Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3235"> 3235 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill amends the Copyright Act to provide that in such a work 
the copyright that would otherwise belong to the convicted person 
becomes and remains the property of the crown even after payment 
of any fine or service of any period of imprisonment. The bill does 
not prevent any person from creating or publishing such a work but 
prohibits any profit or benefit that might accrue to the convicted 
person or to his family.
<P>
	There is an interesting paradox in Canadian society today. On 
one hand the public decries it should have the right to know the 
details of a crime. We saw the outrage surrounding recent 
publication bans with the infamous Homolka trial. On the other 
hand, many of the same people say that the rights of victims and 
their families should be paramount. I happen to agree with the 
latter sentiment. No criminal should ever profit from relating the 
story of their crimes.
<P>
	It is clear that the groups representing victims of violence and 
crime strongly support Bill C-205. In the words of Mrs. Priscilla de 
Villiers of CAVEAT: ``Criminals and their families should never be 
allowed to accrue rich rewards for their offences anywhere, any 
time, any place''. I agree.
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association says: ``This bill will provide 
much needed protection for the victims of crime, and ensure that 
their pain and suffering is not exploited''. I agree. A press release 
from the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime stated: 
``This bill strikes an appropriate balance between the criminal's 
rights and the victim's rights''. I agree.
<P>
	Debbie Mahaffy said that despicable, unconscionable 
entrepreneurs and yes, even the public, were exploiting and 
profiting by selling their spin on Leslie's murder to the rest of the 
public which felt it had the right to know the details. The French 
family from my neighbouring community of St. Catharines said: 
``The fact that people want to profit from someone else's tragedy is 
disgusting but the fact that the criminals themselves can profit 
from crime is an outrage''. I agree.
<P>
	These quotes are overwhelming testimony to the revictimization 
that occurs when criminals profit financially from their crimes. I 
share this outrage.
<P>
	I support Bill C-205 for three basic reasons. First, this kind of 
legislation has been a long time coming and will go a long way in 
ensuring that crime does not pay. That principle is a longstanding 
value entrenched in the Canadian justice system and Canadian 
society.
<P>
	The deterrent aspect of such an amendment is of vital 
importance as criminals continue to be portrayed as heroes. If 
criminal acts continue to promise heroic status and financial profit 
both to the offenders and their families, the escalation of heinous 
crimes will never be deterred.
<P>
	Second, this bill would also help to ensure that victims and their 
families are not further victimized by criminals. The effect of such 
exploitation on victims is overwhelming and unacceptable. Canada 
must do more to protect victims and to ensure their rights and 
freedoms are respected.
<P>
	Third, this bill strikes an appropriate and difficult balance 
between the criminal's rights and those of the victim. There is 
concern that a criminal has the right under our Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms to  tell his story in any form, and to pocket the 
profits. We are faced with balancing the protection of victims and 
their families with the rights of criminals to freedom of speech.
<P>
	This bill provides that criminals need not be prevented from 
telling their stories, provided they do not profit from telling them. 
There are many of us who wish these horrible accounts could be 
silenced forever. The next best thing is to send a clear message that 
no criminal will ever profit financially from a crime.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	I commend my hon. colleague for Scarborough West for his 
research and thoughtful dealing with this issue. Part of this bill 
deals with changes to the Copyright Act. It provides that a sentence 
for an indictable offence is deemed to include on order that any 
work based on that offence is subject to a new section, that in such 
a work the copyright which would otherwise belong to the 
convicted person becomes and remains the property of the crown 
forever.
<P>
	The government could bring action in any country that is a 
signatory to the Berne Convention on Copyright to enforce its 
rights. This would include the seizure of funds paid to the criminal 
or injunctions to halt the sale of books, movies, videos, et cetera.
<P>
	Our world is an ever expanding universe of technology with the 
ability to transfer money abroad. Criminals can access this 
technology. The enormous financial cost Canada incurs in 
enforcing law and order and public safety affects the community as 
a whole. It is only fitting that any proceeds from the exploitation of 
such crimes should revert to the crown to recompense society for at 
least part of those expenses. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support 
the provisions for the seizure of such profits.
<P>
	I wish to address my hon. colleague's comments regarding the 
ability of Canadian consumers to make choices on these goods. 
Murder, violence, degradation, dehumanization and pornography 
are currently being marketed in novels, electronic games, slasher 
movies and videos. It could go on and on and must be stopped.
<P>
	There is already an array of horrific material available. I do not 
see signs that publishers and directors are being sent a clear 
message from the public that this is unacceptable. Quite the 
contrary. It took legislation by this House to limit the sale and 
import of the macabre serial killer cards.
<P>
	I thank my colleague again for his efforts to protect the victims 
and their families and ultimately all Canadians who do not want to 
see criminals being allowed to profit from their crimes. It is time 
that our society examined more opportunities to have criminals pay 
for what they do to victims and to society. The criminal must pay 
for the crime, not the victim, nor the victim's family.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3236"> 3236 </A></B>
<P>
	Public confidence in a just and safe society depends on societal 
values being reflected by the justice system which is exactly what 
this bill does. I urge all my colleagues in the House to support this 
most worthy bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak in support of Bill C-205. On behalf of the Reform 
Party I want to express my strong support for this bill.
<P>
	I would also like to extend congratulations to the member for 
Scarborough West for his hard work in bringing this proposal 
forward and in gaining acceptance and support from all sides of the 
House.
<P>
	As the member discovered in the last hour of debate, the 
Minister of Justice's representative is one of the few members who 
does not support this measure. The minister and his representative 
think it is okay for criminals to profit from their crimes. We should 
not be surprised that he is the same minister who has failed to get 
tough with criminals since the opening of this Parliament. I believe 
that the will of the people will be done here even against the 
minister's wishes. We are going to send a message that crime does 
not pay.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that we must consider laws like this, but it has 
become a sad reality in today's Canadian society that fascination 
with violence and crime provides a profitable opportunity for 
publishers, entertainers and the media.
<P>
	How did we get to such a sad place in Canadian history? What 
has happened to Canadians that so many take an interest in the 
violence and the sickness of criminality? How did we come to a 
place where we believe that crime should pay? Some might like to 
say that the cultural industry of crime and violence which 
Hollywood likes to export into our living rooms and our movie 
theatres has provoked the change. We cannot blame it all on 
Hollywood. The problem is deeper and it is home grown.
<P>
	I have an explanation with regard to leadership in Canadian 
society. It is about the kind of leadership that is being offered in 
this Parliament by the justice minister and the Prime Minister. For 
the past few decades we have followed leaders whose philosophy 
was: Do whatever feels good and do not worry about the 
consequences. These leaders have failed to encourage personal 
responsibility.
<P>
	The proof is in front of this Parliament every day. We are dealing 
with a massive debt problem because we would not take the 
personal responsibility to pay for the programs we wanted. Instead 
we borrowed. We decided to make it somebody else's problem to 
pay the money back.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	We have massive social programs like UI which send the 
message for those who are job hunting: Go out and do your own 
thing and if you get into trouble it is not your fault; the government 
will bail you out.
<P>
	We have taken that approach with our criminal justice system 
too. We said capital punishment was just too harsh for those who 
deliberately took the life of another. Then we said that a life 
sentence in prison was too hard to serve and that 25 years should be 
adequate. Then a more recent Liberal government with the member 
for Notre Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce as justice minister decided that 25 years 
was still too harsh. It gave us section 745, the opportunity to get out 
of jail free after 15 years.
<P>
	The story of crime and punishment with respect to first degree 
murder is representative of the decay in the rest of the justice 
system. Even when the majority of MPs in this House attempt to 
reverse the trend, as with the proposal to repeal section 745 or as 
with this bill, the minister and his support in committee oppose the 
democratic will of the people. They give us leadership but in a 
direction we do not want to go. They say that crime should pay.
<P>
	There are many other examples of decay in our justice system. 
This decay has been accelerated by the charter. The charter is 
responsible for people literally getting away with murder. Whether 
it was the recent drunk defence cases or the Askov cases where 
thousands of criminals awaiting trial were freed because their 
charter right to a free trial had supposedly been violated, the 
criminals' rights had become more important than the rights of 
victims in society.
<P>
	Our immigration system also displays the same philosophy. We 
knowingly bring terrorists and other undesirables into Canada so 
that they will escape so-called persecution back home. None are 
held accountable for their actions once they arrive here. For these 
supposed refugees, Canada is the land of escape from personal 
responsibility.
<P>
	We have mandatory parole for violent criminals. There is no 
truth in sentencing. Even if a judge gives somebody the maximum 
sentence, the criminal can still be back on the streets courtesy of 
the parole board after serving a fraction of the sentence.
<P>
	It would not be possible to examine the underlying philosophy of 
our justice system without examining the Young Offenders Act. 
Here is the example of justice we provide for our children. No one 
in this House can deny that young offenders escape taking personal 
responsibility for their actions. Their names are not published and 
their sentences are laughable. Their parents are not held 
accountable either.
<P>
	If the young offenders are under the age of 12 then they are 
completely free to do whatever they want with total immunity from 
the law. If anyone wants proof, talk  to the parents of the 13-year

<P>
old girl who was violently raped in Toronto recently. Her attacker 
will never be punished because the justice minister does not believe 
that 11-year olds will commit crimes. Where is the personal 
responsibility in the Young Offenders Act? It does not exist.
<P>
	We have been living with a justice system that for 30 years has 
continually gone softer on criminals, shrinking their sentences, 
supplying their cigarettes and cable television, paying for their 
university education and paying their green fees on the Corrections 
Canada golf courses. We have sent them and indeed all Canadians 
the message that crime can and does pay.
<P>
	It is time to reverse that trend. We can do that in part by making 
sure that crime will not pay financial dividends to those criminals 
who try to profit from sensationalizing their lawlessness. If we as 
political leaders in Canadian society can send a strong message that 
crime does not pay, then we start to reverse the trend we now see in 
society. We need to develop a philosophy and personal 
responsibility in society. As one of my constituents said to me, if 
you do the crime, you have got to do the time.
<P>
	Crime cannot be a paying proposition any longer. We must start 
punishing those who are entering the system as teenagers. Young 
offenders need to get the message that the consequences of 
criminal actions are not worthwhile.
<P>
	If we prevent the Paul Bernardos and Clifford Olsons of this 
country from profiting from their crimes, we send a strong message 
that crime cannot and must not pay. Just as we confiscate the 
proceeds of drug trafficking, we should confiscate the profits of 
those criminal entrepreneurs. If we as legislators can offer real 
leadership in reversing the trend toward lawlessness, then we can 
also encourage others to join in, including the media. Instead of 
sensationalizing crime we can stigmatize it. Instead of encouraging 
criminality, especially among our youth, we can set a trend toward 
respect for the law, authority and our institutions.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Canada's Constitution says that we should foster peace, order 
and good government. I believe this bill reflects all three principles 
and I encourage all members to support it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will begin by thanking my hon. colleague from Scarborough West 
for giving me the opportunity to speak on this most important and 
timely initiative.
<P>
	Bill C-205, an act to amend the Criminal Code and Copyright 
Act, will prevent criminals from profiting from authorship 
respecting a crime. This legislation is long overdue. If passed, 
criminals will no longer be able to make money off the backs of 
their victims. They will be prevented from adding to the pain and 
misery they have already caused their victims and their families.
<P>
	To allow a person convicted of a crime, especially murder, to 
receive compensation for his or her story is obscene. How do we 
explain to the victims or their loved ones that the person who 
caused them so much grief is now adding to their humiliation by 
profiting from their crimes?
<P>
	We should follow the lead of the province of Ontario. In 1994 a 
private member's bill was passed which gives victims the first right 
to any profits earned from work produced by a person convicted of 
a crime. Before any deal is struck by a convicted person, the Public 
Trustee's Office must be notified. Subsequently, all moneys 
generated by the work go to that office.
<P>
	This is the kind of law all Canada needs and must have. The 
federal government must follow suit with legislation of its own so 
it will be right across the country and not just in one province. Bill 
C-205 would accomplish this. Surely if the province of Ontario 
sees fit to pass such legislation, I believe the federal government 
should do the same.
<P>
	I find it hard to believe that this type of legislation has not been 
adopted in the House in the past. I understand that proposals of this 
kind have been introduced before, but all have failed to be acted on. 
Therefore, I urge all members of the House to act unanimously to 
ensure that Bill C-205 is pursued successfully.
<P>
	Bill C-205 will guard against further public humiliation of 
victims and their families. Most important, Bill C-205 will take 
away the criminal's right to profit from his or her story.
<P>
	There will always be television shows, movie producers or book 
publishers who will be willing to pay, and pay well, to get a story. 
That is fine. We cannot take away that right, but we can dictate 
where that money goes. How we can justify a person convicted of a 
crime making a profit from their illegal actions is beyond me. That 
is exactly what this bill addresses.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we cannot prohibit a criminal from telling his or 
her story to the press or other media outlets. However, we can take 
away the incentive. Hopefully they will be less willing to offer their 
story to the media if they know they will not see a dime for their 
efforts.
<P>
	Do we really need to hear the full story of how Clifford Olson 
committed his horrible and sick crimes, or how Karla Homolka 
assisted in the murders of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy? I do 
not want to see these crimes sensationalized by the media. I do not 
want my children and all the children of the world to have access to 
these horrific tales. The thought of having the authors of these 
stories profiting from the proceeds makes me sick.
<P>
	How any responsible journalist, television or movie producer, or 
book publisher can possibly justify profiting from another person's 
pain is beyond me. These stories do nothing but glorify violence. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3238"> 3238 </A></B>
<P>
Some paint false pictures of the victims and their families and 
basically succeed in sensationalizing crime.
<P>
	It is sad, but there will always be some element of the general 
population that is interested in hearing or reading these warped 
stories. That is why we see the market inundated with the so-called 
true story movies and biographies of infamous criminals and the 
even more perverse serial killer trading cards and board games. To 
allow these items on the market is one thing. To allow the criminals 
responsible for the crimes glorified in them to profit is another. 
This we cannot morally allow.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	Take for example the story that would be told by serial killer 
Clifford Olson. Do we really need to hear details of how he brutally 
murdered those poor innocent children? No we do not. However, as 
I said before, there will always be someone who is willing to print, 
produce or buy his story. Since we cannot prevent that from 
happening, we must at least prevent Clifford Olson from profiting 
from his horrible crimes.
<P>
	Bill C-205 would amend the Criminal Code to prohibit a 
criminal or members of his or her family from profiting by selling 
the story of his or her crime. By taking away any moneys he or she 
may have made in the future, the incentive would be totally taken 
away from them.
<P>
	Perhaps the crown could see fit to put the moneys generated by 
these movies toward various victims rights groups. It is high time 
that criminals really paid for their crimes in the true sense of the 
word.
<P>
	This bill will further amend the Copyright Act to provide that the 
copyright of any work based on a crime where the work was 
created by the convicted person becomes the property of the crown. 
What this means is that when a book, a movie or other work based 
primarily on a crime is produced by a person convicted of that 
crime, Canada would become the sole owner of that work. Any 
proceeds from that work would go directly to the crown. Further, 
any sales or distribution of the work would be at the discretion of 
the crown, meaning that Canada would have the right to prevent 
future sales and distribution which is very important.
<P>
	Also, seeing as Canada is a signatory to the Berne convention, 
which deals with the copyright and ownership of works, this bill 
would not only have a national scope but an international one as 
well. Canada could conceivably block any sales or distribution of a 
work in any country which is also a participant to the convention.
<P>
	If passed, this bill will go a long way to preventing the 
sensationalizing of crime and violence not only in Canada but 
indeed in other countries as well.
<P>
	Some opponents of this bill would say that it would limit the 
right to freedom of expression as put forth in  the charter. On the 
contrary, let me emphasize this bill does not prohibit a person from 
telling his or her story. An individual who wishes to share his or her 
story is free to do so. All this bill simply states is that the individual 
would not be able to profit from the sale of the story. Society is 
always quick to ensure the rights of the offender are upheld. It is 
about time that we all stood up for the rights of the victim. This bill 
will ensure that the victim's rights do come first.
<P>
	As I stated before, many organizations support this bill. The 
Canadian Police Association has stated that this bill would provide 
much needed protection for the victims of crime and ensure that 
their pain and suffering is not exploited.
<P>
	CAVEAT, which represents Canadians against violence, also 
supports this bill. It stated that the enormous financial cost incurred 
by Canada in enforcing the law affects all Canadians. CAVEAT 
goes on to say that it is only fitting that the proceeds from the 
exploitation of any crime should revert to the crown.
<P>
	One of the biggest supporters of this bill is an individual who 
stands to suffer a great deal if this bill is passed. Deborah Mahaffy 
is a director of the victims rights group ACTION. She is also the 
mother of Leslie Mahaffy, one of the young school girls who was 
violently abused and murdered by Paul Bernardo and Karla 
Homolka. Deborah Mahaffy and her family have endured enough 
pain and sorrow to last a lifetime. We need to ensure that her grief 
is not further exploited by her daughter's killers.
<P>
	In closing, I would again urge all members of the House to 
support Bill C-205. Let us put our political differences aside and 
vote in favour of this bill. We must use this opportunity to reinforce 
the old adage that crime does not pay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member for Scarborough 
West on his efforts in Bill C-205. I will deal with some of the 
problems I see in the bill. I agree with the comments made by 
previous speakers about individuals not profiting from their 
crimes, such as in the Bernardo and Mahaffy matter. However, we 
have to take a look at the bill to see what it does.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	First, let me give a summary of how copyright works in Canada. 
Copyright is a legal system of rights developed to reward authors 
for their intellectual labour and thus encourage them to continue 
creating original works for the benefit of society.
<P>
	Copyright is made up of statutory, economic and moral rights 
that allow authors to control the exploitation of their works, to 
profit from their works and to protect  the integrity of their works. 
Copyright protects the expression of the work and not the idea 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3239"> 3239 </A></B>
<P>
embodied in the work and comes into existence as soon as an 
original work has been fixed in a medium.
<P>
	Categories of protected works as defined by the Copyright Act 
are literary works such as books, poems and stories, or artistic 
works which are paintings, sculptures, photographs, dramatic 
works such as plays, television programs, movies, scripts and 
musical works, for example, notes transcribed on paper or song 
lyrics.
<P>
	The Copyright Act gives authors of works exclusive economic 
rights and these are the right to authorized reproduction, 
performance in public, publication, communication to the public 
by telecommunication, adaptation of certain works, commercial 
rental of computer programs and exhibitions of certain artistic 
works.
<P>
	Moral rights protect the work's integrity and author's reputation. 
Moral rights can be waived but not transferred. They are the right 
to the integrity of the work, the right to be named as the work's 
author or the right to remain anonymous and the right to prevent 
the use of the work in association with a product, service, cause or 
institution.
<P>
	The author is normally the first owner of copyright in a work, but 
employers normally own the copyright in works produced by 
employees in the course of employment and copyright ownership is 
alienable by assignment or succession.
<P>
	Canadians recognize the importance of allowing authors to earn 
a livelihood from their works. They understand the benefits to 
society that derive from the creation of works such as cultural 
identity, private enjoyment of books, music, art and television and 
the wealth of information that is distributed through these works.
<P>
	The issue becomes difficult when society, and this includes 
victims of criminal acts, believes that a work has been created by 
someone who does not deserve to make money from such works. 
More specifically, convicted criminals who write about their 
crimes and profit financially from their publication.
<P>
	Bill C-205 offers one solution to the problem: to take away the 
copyright and proceeds of copyright from authorize who are 
convicted of indictable offences when they write about the offences 
they have committed. However, the proposed amendment to the 
Copyright Act runs the risk of contravening our international 
obligations under the Berne Convention for the Protection of 
Literary and Artistic Works. The spirit of the Berne convention 
limits the state regulation of copyright in the criminal law.
<P>
	In addition, Bill C-205 is too far reaching. It extends beyond the 
incarceration period throughout the lifetime of ex-offenders who 
have done their time and to their  family members for 50 years 
following an ex-convict's death. For example, take someone 
convicted of drunk driving. This bill covers many offences, not just 
murder, manslaughter or sexual offences. It covers thefts, mischief, 
prostitution and drunk driving.
<P>
	Should a person who has been convicted of drunk driving decide 
in his old age to write his memoirs, he could not write about the 
offence without losing copyright or proceeds from the work, even 
if the work decries drunk driving. His family would also be 
disinherited although they did not commit the crime. The same 
applies to individuals who may have been convicted of possessing 
marijuana and then at a later time writing about their experiences 
and the bad effects of drugs, could not benefit from such writings.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	It is the same for individuals who have been involved in the 
prostitution trade. Neither the men or women who have been 
involved and who have been victimized in that trade could write 
about it years later, damning that type of trade because the 
copyright would be with the government. It is not a matter of them 
writing and not being able to profit. It is a matter of them not being 
able to publish it because the copyright is in the name of the state 
and the state must consent to publication.
<P>
	Canada is not a country that is in the habit of taking away rights. 
It is a country with a strong charter of rights and freedoms that is 
respected worldwide. There are other solutions to this problem that 
do not involve the expropriation of rights or discrimination against 
ex-offenders and their families. Rather they involve choices made 
by the Canadian public and the respect of the rights of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Books written by criminals about their crimes often appeal to the 
curiosity of the population. Canadians can choose to buy them or 
not to buy them. Those who choose to buy them do so knowing that 
copyright proceeds may go to the author. Those who choose not to 
buy or read the works of the offenders who write about their crimes 
are making a statement. If enough Canadians boycott a particular 
account of a criminal then that person will not benefit financially 
from copyright.
<P>
	Let us put our trust in Canadian consumers that they will make 
the decision for themselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was not planning to speak on this bill but I listened to the 
people speaking before me and they certainly made it very clear 
that Bill C-205 is a very important piece of legislation.
<P>
	However, I think I can add to the debate on a very sombre note. 
Over the past few weeks I have been reading a series of Alfred 
Hitchcock mysteries. I have been reading this series of mysteries, 
which are short stories, in French as a way of practising that 
language.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3240"> 3240 </A></B>
<P>
	As it happens one of those stories deals with a plot wherein a 
novelist is very successful in writing various kinds of crime stories. 
The plot revolves around the fact that he gets the sense of 
verisimilitude or the sense of reality by actually committing the 
crimes himself. He does a number of murders. He also attempts 
suicide and the twist of the story is that in order to get the reality for 
his novels he kills his own child. He is subsequently murdered by 
his wife as a result.
<P>
	That may seem a very improbable scenario, just fiction and 
crime and mystery fiction at that. I draw the House's attention to a 
reality that has come today. I find it difficult to even speak of it 
because it is the Bernardo case in which Canadians learn through 
the reporting of the court case of the torture and murder of two 
young girls. One aspect of that case that was revealed was the fact 
that the murderer, Paul Bernardo, took videotapes of the actual 
torturing of these two young ladies. He did not actually film the 
murders but he certainly did film the rest.
<P>
	I am someone who has been in the communications business for 
a long time. In talking to my friends I learned that behind this 
business of videotaping a crime, and a terrible crime at that, is an 
international trade in what are called snuff films. Because of the 
advances of technology it is possible to very cheaply produce high 
quality films on video. There has become a very lucrative trade in 
movies and videotapes which involve the actual torturing or killing 
of people. This is a trade that is active worldwide.
<P>
	Obviously this is the sickest of the sickest types of crime, a 
crime that is motivated by the crass profit of killing somebody and 
marketing the film. It is a very lucrative trade.
<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
	The advantage to Bill C-205 is that it directly addresses this 
terrible problem in that it will make it impossible for a murderer 
who is convicted of the crime to take advantage of the proceeds of 
the film that might be for sale as a result of a murder. I am 
suggesting a murder that is conducted solely for the purpose of 
creating a film for sale. This is the type of crime I am talking about.
<P>
	Unfortunately there is a downside to not having capital 
punishment. The type of individual who would be so depraved as to 
kill someone in order to film it and sell it is the type of person who 
would stop at nothing short of the prospect of capital punishment. 
This is a person who, when caught, would still be in a position of 
going to jail and yet theoretically would have the film and still be 
able to sell it on the international market.
<P>
	Bill C-205 in my mind adequately addresses this terrible 
prospect not only because it changes the Criminal Code and makes 
it impossible for the convicted killer to profit from his crime but 
more important because it addresses the copyright issue.
<P>
	Because the crown takes possession of the copyright of any such 
film, play or novel that is based on an actual crime done by the 
person who would otherwise owned the copyright, it prevents this 
type of activity from occurring in Canada. It would discourage 
someone participating in easy money in creating a film of this 
nature.
<P>
	I am not talking about something that is really very improbable. 
We learned in the news only recently of events on the high seas 
which demonstrated that the value of human life in other 
jurisdictions is held very low.
<P>
	We also learn that there is international traffic in child 
prostitution and that kind of thing. These things are going on and 
are part of the really negative costs of the global economy that we 
are entering.
<P>
	I support Bill C-205 very much. I took note of the criticisms of 
the member for Saskatoon-Dundurn who pointed out that there 
were problems with the Berne convention when other countries 
might take exception to Canada ruling that criminals cannot have a 
right to their own copyright and market it abroad. I answer that by 
saying that Canada leads the way in so many things. This is a case 
where we should not look abroad for instruction. We should lead 
the way ourselves. In that sense, I support 100 per cent the 
initiative of the member for Scarborough West.
<P>
	This is a fine piece of legislation. I would like to see it get the 
unanimous support of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take 
great pleasure in speaking to Bill C-205, which is very important 
legislation. I felt really confident this afternoon after listening to 
many of my colleagues both on this side and on the opposite side of 
the House giving their support to this measure.
<P>
	If there is something that our country needs at this point, it is 
assurances to the people on our streets, our families who have 
children walking our streets, that the streets are safe to the degree 
that we believe they are.
<P>
	Much has been said about the fact that when criminals break the 
law, basically they do not do very much time. There ought to be a 
recognition that the real victims of crime are the ones who have lost 
family members in many cases, those who have been robbed 
perhaps of their property. There is not a community in this country 
that is exempt from those kinds of things taking place.
<P>
	In my community a week and a half ago, two break-ins took 
place where there was a tremendous amount of property stolen. The 
report from the police was that they would not likely find those 
people. If they did, their property would never be recovered. The 
real victims are the ones who have lost property and, more so, those 
who have lost family members.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="3241"> 3241 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	There was a murder in our community two years ago. Recently 
someone was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. It is a 
terrible thing that none of us can really appreciate unless we know 
someone who has gone through the experience. Perhaps there are 
those within the House who have experienced it within their 
families.
<P>
	It is important to appreciate that sensationalism attracts people's 
attention. In arcades we find young people entertaining themselves. 
Where do they entertain themselves mostly? In those machines 
where there is a great deal of violence. Our young people are very 
much subjected to crime and violent acts, even from a very young 
age. It is my contention that we ought to be doing much more than 
we are in terms of cleaning up the kind of material being given to 
our children for viewing on television.
<P>
	There has been much support for this measure. For the record, I 
read what has been said. The Canadian Police Association stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canadian Police Association is pleased to announce its support for Mr. 
Tom Wappel in his efforts to prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes. 
Mr. Wappel's private member's bill will ensure convicted criminals will not be 
permitted to profit financially through writing a book or selling their story. This 
bill will provide much needed protection for victims of crime and ensure that 
their pain and suffering is not exploited.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime is pleased to announce 
our support for Mr. Tom Wappel's private member's bill concerning the 
proceeds of crime. If successful, this bill would prevent criminals from 
profiting from their crimes if, for example, they write a book detailing their 
criminal activities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This kind of legislation has been a long time coming and will go a long way in 
ensuring that crime does not pay. That principle is a long standing value 
entrenched in the Canadian justice system and Canadian society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	CAVEAT stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We would like to thank you for this private member's bill which addresses the 
spectre of convicted offenders who stand to profit by exploiting their crimes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Public confidence in a just and safe society depends on societal values being 
reflected by the justice system. Canadian society views violent offences in 
particular with revulsion and distaste. Criminals and their families should never 
be allowed to accrue rich rewards for their offences anywhere, any time, any 
place.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mrs. Deborah Mahaffy, the mother of Leslie Mahaffy, wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I endorse and fully support this innovative, resourceful and compassionate 
bill that recognizes that criminals must pay for their crimes, not the victims, who 
pay over and over again. Crime will continue to pay if we continue to let the 
criminals run our country and our courts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We cannot afford to not support Bill C-205. Mr. Wappel has done his research 
and the Government of Canada and the people of Canada shall reap the benefits 
of prohibiting criminals from profiting from their crimes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This mother certainly knows what crime is. This mother will 
forever have in her memory that she at one time had a daughter. 
She no longer has that family member. I sympathize with that 
situation, as do many others in the country.
<P>
	It would behove all of us to give serious consideration to 
unanimously endorsing this kind of legislation. It is the kind of 
legislation which would give credence to the kinds of things which 
we believe are important. It is important for us to support this 
legislation. I thank the opposition members who have given voice 
to that support this afternoon. I look forward to their support when 
we vote on this bill at a later time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the 
Order Paper.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOMALIAINQUIRY">SOMALIA INQUIRY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Corporal 
Michel Purnelle was arrested on April 26, 1996 in order to prevent 
him from providing any information to the Somalia inquiry being 
carried out by Mr. Justice Gilles LÃ©tourneau.
<P>
	Seven charges were laid against him. He was placed under 
surveillance for six months. He was relieved of his military duties 
until June 15, and faces the possibility of permanent suspension or 
other sanctions. He has been prevented from publishing his book 
<I>Une armÃ©e en dÃ©route</I>.
<P>
	And why was he harassed in this way? Simply because he had 
the courage to defy the orders of a superior who wanted to prevent 
him from speaking out, from telling the entire truth about the 1993 
incidents in Somalia involving the Airborne Regiment. He is 
accused of having given unauthorized interviews to the media and 
of having taken unauthorized leave from his job.
<P>
	What is the message that the Canadian Armed Forces are giving 
to their members? If you tell the truth, if you co-operate with the 
Somalia inquiry, you will be hauled up in front of a court martial, 
relieved of your duties, and subjected to blackmail, even 
intimidation. Sad but true.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3242"> 3242 </A></B>
<P>
	Justice LÃ©tourneau issued a strong warning to the armed forces 
when he learned of the decision of military authorities to lay 
charges against Corporal Purnelle. He pointed out that this decision 
sent a contradictory message to soldiers who perhaps had relevant 
information. This message is in sharp contrast to the official 
encouragement given soldiers to co-operate in any way possible in 
fulfilling the mandate of the commission. Double talk.
<P>
	The minister refuses to co-operate. He says to anyone who will 
listen that no members of the armed forces have been prevented 
from providing information. Now it is time to shed light on this 
whole incident. I remind you that a man died in Somalia. This is a 
source of shame to Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	As you know, before these unfortunate events, Canada enjoyed a 
spotless reputation as a peacekeeper. In any peacekeeping mission, 
our soldiers and especially their leaders, who represent us and who 
are our ambassadors, must act with dignity and professionalism. 
Their behaviour must be beyond reproach. They must not 
disappoint us. Such incidents must never happen again.
<P>
	This is affecting our troops' morale. As long as the Canadian 
Forces are led by people who are more concerned about their own 
personal careers than about the reputation of our armed forces, 
such situations may come up again. Were our soldiers justified in 
losing confidence in their leader? Are their leaders worthy of our 
trust? Is the Minister of National Defence still credible? Who is 
leading the Canadian Forces? The minister has a duty to shed light 
on all the cloudy aspects of this unfortunate tragedy. He is 
accountable to Parliament and to the people of Canada for our 
armed forces and he must assume this responsibility. If the minister 
no longer has any control over the armed forces, he can no longer 
run the department.
<P>
	It is time for the minister to take his responsibilities. The Bloc 
Quebecois, representing the official opposition in this House, 
demands that the minister do all he can to ensure that witnesses like 
Michel Purnelle will be able to give evidence freely. The minister 
must not allow any attempt to muzzle or threaten witnesses in any 
way, so that light can be shed on the unfortunate and tragic incident 
in Somalia.
<P>
	Again, the people of Canada want the truth.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question and for allowing 
me the opportunity to elaborate on this very important issue, 
Canadian forces members' responsibilities with regard to the 
commission of inquiry and with regard to the ongoing 
responsibilities of Canadian forces members under their code of 
discipline.
<P>
	As the minister stated, the commission of inquiry was 
established precisely to get to the bottom of all incidents that 
occurred during the Canadian forces tour in Somalia. I am very 
confident it will do that.
<P>
	The Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces 
headquarters have and will continue to encourage people with any 
information which may be of interest to the commission to bring it 
forward to the commission.
<P>
	It has been stated on several occasions in the House that 
members of the Canadian forces have the right, the duty and the 
obligation to bring forward any evidence they may have related to 
the Somalia incidents.
<P>
	This does not, however, relieve members of the Canadian forces 
of their obligation to respect their code of discipline. If they choose 
to disregard their code of discipline they expose themselves to 
administrative or disciplinary measures.
<P>
	While soldiers have a duty to come forward with any evidence 
relating to Somalia, they also have a duty to serve at their post. The 
two are not contradictory. All a soldier has to do is inform his or her 
commanding officer that he or she wishes to give evidence and 
obtain permission to go. It is a simple process.
<P>
	What a solider cannot do is abandon his or her post on a whim 
without informing his or her superiors. That is very 
straightforward. For example, soldiers on peacekeeping duties in 
Haiti or in Bosnia implementing the peace accord cannot simply 
walk away from their posts.
<P>
	I stress that discipline is a very important component of a 
military system. Discipline must be maintained without exception, 
for only with properly disciplined troops can we be assured of 
obedience in times of crisis.
<P>
	Members of the Canadian forces must be held accountable to 
respect the code of discipline at all times.
