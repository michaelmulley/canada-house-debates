<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—FREE TRADE AREA OF THE AMERICAS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ) </B>moved: 
<A NAME="LINK16">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the 
government put in place an open and ongoing process to keep 
Parliament informed of negotiations to establish a Free Trade Area 
of the Americas so as to allow parliamentarians to debate it and 
civil society to be consulted before Parliament approves it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to inform you, 
and our excellent clerks at the table, that for the duration of 
the allotted day, that is until private members' business, the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois will be dividing their time into 
two ten-minute speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> Madam Speaker, I believe everyone 
will agree that to build a free trade area of the 
Americas, which will be at the service of the peoples of the 
Americas, the wall of distrust must be broken down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, this past weekend in Quebec City the 34 heads of 
state did not succeed in breaking down that wall.  Why? Because, 
in my opinion, despite the extremely significant efforts made in 
recent weeks to appear more transparent, the process of 
negotiation remains insufficiently so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reasoning 
behind the motion I am introducing this morning on behalf of the 
Bloc Quebecois.  It is intended to remedy some of the democratic 
deficit and lend greater transparency to the entire process.  I 
will reread it to the House if I may. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government put in place an open and ongoing process to 
keep Parliament informed of negotiations to establish a Free 
Trade Area of the Americas so as to allow parliamentarians to 
debate it and civil society to be consulted before Parliament 
approves it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, the process of negotiating the free trade area 
of the Americas has so far lacked transparency.  I will give just 
a few examples of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were promised documents after the meeting of the 
international trade ministers at Buenos Aires in early April. The 
promised documents have still not been made public and, in this 
connection, we would like to know sometime today when the 
Minister for International Trade plans to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no guarantee either that we will regularly get these 
documents, especially since, as we know, these texts will change 
with time, before ministerial meetings, so we can judge the 
fairness of the Government of Canada's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know Canada's position at four of the five sectoral 
tables.  We do not know its positions on such important issues as 
investment, investment protection, services, dispute resolution 
and intellectual property.  This too is a source of confusion and 
concern.  It was apparent in the hours following the end of the 
Quebec City summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of investments, for example, we know for a fact 
that the Minister for International Trade said on several 
occasions, including before the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade, that there was no question of 
copying chapter 11 of NAFTA on the protection of investments, 
because there was in fact an imbalance between the rights of 
investors and the rights of governments to protect public health 
and public services the population wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade therefore intimated clearly 
that chapter 11 of NAFTA was not a valid basis for negotiation in 
the context of the free trade area of the Americas. So, a few 
hours after the conclusion of the Quebec City summit, the Prime 
Minister of Canada announced that chapter 11 presented no problem 
for him and that it might be an interesting basis for 
negotiations on the free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The websites of the Government of Canada and the Minister for 
International Trade indicate that the main problem with 
investments is the conflict resolution mechanism.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at all these contradictory and confusing positions, 
it seems extremely important to me to raise the issue of 
transparency, and to have the government quickly state its 
positions in the House and make them public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two elements I just mentioned cause confusion and show 
that the process still lacks transparency. This lack of 
transparency and democracy is primarily due to the fact that 
parliamentarians and civil society are still not closely 
associated, on an ongoing basis, with the negotiations on the 
free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two days ago, the Prime Minister said that opponents to the 
current negotiations on the proposed free trade area of the 
Americas simply had to get elected to have an opportunity to 
express their point of view. We members of this House were 
elected, but we cannot express our point of view, even though we 
want to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 15, I tabled a motion in the House asking that any 
final agreement on the free trade area of the Americas be brought 
before the House to allow parliamentarians to debate it and to 
vote on it. That motion had the support of all the opposition 
parties, but was rejected by the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was before the Quebec City summit, before the 34 heads 
of state made a formal commitment to strengthen representative 
democracy. The government and the party in office 
must now accept the obvious and agree that in order to strengthen 
representative democracy in Canada, we must begin by allowing 
members of the House of Commons to debate any agreement on a free 
trade area of the Americas and to vote on it before it is 
ratified by the executive branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, Canada can draw from other countries where parliaments 
are playing an active role in the approval of international 
treaties, and British tradition parliaments like ours. In Great 
Britain and in Australia, when an international treaty agreement 
is signed, it has to be approved by parliament and then ratified 
by the executive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion today seeks to ensure that this also be the approach 
of Canada, the House of Commons and the Government of Canada with 
respect to the free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still a bit anxious because in the final declaration signed 
by the 34 heads of state, there is no mention of the role of 
parliamentarians in the process of negotiating the free trade 
area of the Americas. To me it is an inconceivable oversight, 
especially since reference was made repeatedly, and rightly so, 
to consultation and inclusion of civil society in the negotiating 
process. I entirely agree with all that. However, I have a hard 
time understanding why nothing is being said about the role of 
parliamentarians, who are the elected representatives of the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might argue that parliamentarians are mentioned in the 
action plan, but not in relation to the negotiating process. We 
are talking about parliamentarians participating in an exchange 
process, a co-operative approach to democratic processes. It 
comes under transparency and good governance, but it is far from 
being enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must set an example by having parliamentarians play an 
active role in the whole negotiating process, and this is 
precisely the purpose of this motion; it asks that the government 
put in place an open and ongoing process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, something else seems unacceptable, and raises some 
doubts in my mind about the good faith of the government. In the 
final statement by the 34 heads of state, there is only one 
reference to a parliamentary association, the interparliamentary 
forum of the Americas, FIPA. There was never any reference to the 
conference of parliamentarians of the Americas, COPA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this a little strange as FIPA was established only a 
month ago, a few countries met here in March to establish it, and 
it represents only national parliaments, while COPA, created in 
1997, represents all parliaments, whether they are national, 
provincial, federated, regional or subregional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that this omission of the conference of parliamentarians 
of the Americas will not prevent the heads of state from calling 
upon it because this forum is extremely rich, independent and 
pluralist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, parliamentarians must have an active role to play in 
the decision, as I think everyone will agree, and the motion 
includes this, because we are accountable to the people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Civil society must also be involved, before a decision is made, 
by contributing to the debate and informing parliamentarians 
before they make a decision. Civil society must also be involved 
after the decision is made in order to implement it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, at the forum of 
parliamentarians that took place within the people's summit, 
described the process very well. I invite all members of the 
House to take note of his contribution at this forum. The roles 
of the different players are thus very clear, but they are 
complementary and necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I will say that besides transparency, two other 
elements, and we will have the opportunity to get back to this 
because the negotiations will end by 2005, are required to ensure 
that the free trade area of the Americas meets Quebecers' 
expectations. First, Quebec must be part of Canadian negotiating 
teams. It must have a say on all its jurisdictions, whether they 
are shared or exclusive. Second, in the agreement on the free 
trade area of the Americas, a specific reference must be made to 
the protection of fundamental rights, whether they are human 
rights, labour rights or environmental rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, I invite all members of the House to agree to the motion 
that I just brought forward on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. It 
seems to me that, if the motion is agreed to, this would 
demonstrate the willingness of parliamentarians to play their 
role effectively, that is as representatives of the population 
and advocates of the public interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member, not having to do 
with the motion as much as with what is not in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is very much concerned with process and seems to 
assume that the conclusion of a free trade agreement of the 
Americas is at some level a good idea but it has to be done 
properly.  It has to be done with the inclusion of civil society 
and with parliament playing a proper role, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the motion that indicates any substantive 
opposition whatsoever to the free trade model or the free trade 
paradigm that is on the table at the FTAA, that is already 
enshrined in NAFTA, and that we find also at the WTO and in the 
MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member indicate what the Bloc's position is not with 
respect to process, not to how we come to a free trade agreement, 
but on whether we should come to a free trade agreement?  The 
position of the Quebec government seems to be very much pro-free 
trade.  That is consistent with the position of Quebec 
governments in the past, both sovereignist and non-sovereignist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the thousands of Quebecers who were on the streets last 
weekend making up a large portion of the march against free 
trade, would he say whether or not they still find themselves in 
the position of not having a single Quebec MP who is willing to 
stand and say that he or she is against free trade as it is now 
understood in the FTA, NAFTA, WTO, et cetera?  What is the 
position of the Bloc? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> Madam Speaker, it is really a shame to 
still hear such prejudice against the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Quebec government and a good part of Quebec's 
civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Beaudoin said it in Washington, we are in favour of free 
trade but not at the expense of losing our soul. This is the 
position of the Bloc Quebecois and of the Regroupement québécois 
sur l'intégration continentale. We agree on opening up the 
markets to improve, I would say, commercial transactions, but 
neither at the expense of losing our sovereignty, and in 
Quebec's case we wish to gain it, nor at the expense of having 
rights trampled on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the proposal I have put forward deals with the 
process to allow debate here in the House on the various concepts 
of open markets we have.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the NDP often refers to fair trade. Let us talk 
about it. I think its position is very close to that of the 
Bloc Quebecois, which wants to see included in the trade 
agreement some reference to fundamental rights that must be 
respected so that we can reap the benefits of the agreement. If 
those fundamental rights are not respected, we are not part of 
the free trade agreement as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, we must hold that debate. We must have the texts to be 
able to do so but we must have 
the opportunity to hold that debate. We still do not have them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By bringing forward the motion for the Bloc Quebecois, 
we are taking advantage of the momentum created at the summit of 
the Americas, where the heads of state said that their main 
concern was to reinforce democracy, to ask the Canadian 
government to take some real measures in favour of representative 
democracy by giving parliamentarians the possibility to debate 
these negotiations regularly and to give their approval before 
the government ratified the resulting document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am ready to discuss with the member the whole process, 
but we must have an opportunity to do so.  I know that in the 
motion the accent is more on process than on content, but I am 
also very eager to debate content. I am not sure we will agree on 
everything, but I think that members' views will converge on some 
extremely important points and that will contribute to improved 
negotiations and perhaps to an improved final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the member that if we do not find the elements we 
are seeking in this agreement, the Bloc Quebecois will oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I do not want to prejudge the outcome; I want 
us to have all the necessary tools for the democratic debate to 
be held and I want us to have all the opportunities to bring 
about an agreement that will promote co-operation among the 
countries of the Americas, which in turn will promote the 
betterment of all peoples of the Americas.

Speaker, my question is for the member.  I want to congratulate 
him for his decision to initiate this debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important debate.  Unfortunately we did not have an 
opportunity to do this in advance of the meeting in Quebec City. 
However, when one looks historically at these types of agreements 
in the past and at the original debates, one sees that we did 
have an opportunity not only to debate it in the House but to 
actually have an election on the issue, it was of such great 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not fair to say that the position of the Bloc is one of 
concern that is consistent with other Canadians, that we want to 
know in advance, in a transparent way, the position the 
government is taking on a whole array of issues: environmental 
issues, trade issues and civil rights issues?  We want to know 
prior to the government signing these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic to note that if this were held in Quebec City in 
1988 the government would have been on the other side of the 
fence.  Would the member agree with that comment?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to reply to the 
question.  What I mean is that it is in the interest of all 
parties and members present in this House that this motion be 
adopted so that the people of Canada and of Quebec not only have 
the impression, but truly feel that their elected 
representatives are playing the role they are supposed to play, 
which is to defend the general interests of Canadians and 
Quebecers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am very pleased to take part in this morning's debate, which

congratulate, by the way, on his excellent work in connection 
with the whole FTAA issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by saying that I have some questions regarding the 
NDP member's criticism of all forms of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have trouble understanding how the NDP, which claims to be 
progressive and to want to improve the general lot of the peoples 
of the three Americas, can object for even one instant to our 
being able to sign a co-operation agreement, a free trade 
agreement which, along with the appropriate mechanisms, social 
clauses, and policies for redistributing resources among the less 
fortunate countries, could improve people's living conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never understood why the NDP was so opposed to the idea 
of free trade and misrepresented what Quebecers and Canadians 
really thought.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of free trade but not under just any 
conditions.  We are opposed to free trade, for example, if it is 
going to favour only major transnational companies.  We are in 
favour of free trade because we are convinced that, at the end of 
the day, if the job is done well, if the government is able to 
show some openness, transparency and intelligence in its 
negotiations, everyone stands to gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, however, we have remained dissatisfied.  Why so? Because 
we do not know what is going on with these negotiations.  That is 
the purpose of the motion by my hon. colleague from Joliette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must give us parliamentarians access.  We are not 
elected without a purpose.  If we are, it ought to shut down. 
Let it shut down parliament.  If we are serving no purpose as 
parliamentarians, as representatives of the people, let it shut 
down this parliament.  It is no longer appropriate, perhaps, in 
the context of globalization and the requirement for 
supranational forums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until we have proof to the contrary, however, parliamentarians 
are necessary.  They are the representatives of the people.  We 
cannot allow negotiations to be held on free trade agreements or 
the WTO multilateral plan without the public being brought into 
the process, without it being consulted, and without the elected 
representatives of the public being brought into the process to 
analyze the draft agreements and to authorize ratification by the 
government at the end of these negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to return to a point raised by my colleague from 
Joliette on investments, on chapter 11.  Of course, this is 
something one could hardly be against. Yesterday, I heard the 
Minister for International Trade say “We stood up for investors, 
in order to protect investments”.  We never said we opposed 
protecting investments, but there must be conditions for 
protecting investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 11 in NAFTA could well be recycled in the agreement on 
the free trade area of the three Americas.  It is a very 
dangerous business, given the governments' capacity to intervene 
in certain sectors. It is very dangerous as well because 
complaints could be lodged with the governments of the 34 
countries when the free trade area of the three Americas is 
established, by major corporations. Under chapter 11 of NAFTA and 
their narrow interpretation of it, they could find a way to 
obtain compensation in the government's coffers, paid out of the 
taxes of the people of Quebec, Canada and the United States, as 
well. They find a way to get compensation for the potential 
profits they say they would have enjoyed had the government not 
been present in the market they wished to operate in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is serious enough to have raised some doubt in the mind of 
the Minister for International Trade, of the chief negotiator and 
of most experts who considered the question. 
So great is the concern that, not too long ago, the Minister for 
International Trade said that he would not sign an FTAA agreement 
if it contained provisions similar to those in NAFTA's chapter 
11, which is already causing problems for the Canadian 
government.  The problems are not insubstantial and I will come 
back to this in the final minutes of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventeen companies have already filed complaints under the 
environmental protection laws and are jointly claiming several 
billions of dollars in compensation from the Canadian government, 
based on a very broad interpretation of chapter 11 in connection 
with expropriation and unrealized potential profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 13 of last year, not ten years, but a few months 
ago, the Minister for International Trade said: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not sign a deal if it includes a chapter 11 equivalent. 
That is my position.  I am very preoccupied with this. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said he would not sign an FTAA agreement containing 
provisions equivalent to those in chapter 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day before yesterday, at the end of the summit of the 
Americas, the Prime Minister said that he had no problem with 
chapter 11, despite the fact that 17 large corporations have 
filed suits against the Canadian government for compensation on 
the basis of a narrow interpretation of chapter 11.  The Prime 
Minister did not see a problem.  As we know only too well, this 
is not his money; it is taxpayers' money. 
The government is currently being sued for several billions of 
dollars. It is not concerned about how chapter 11 is being 
interpreted.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the Minister for International Trade gave us another 
interpretation. He said there was no problem with the wording, 
but that there could be some problems with the implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know where the government stands. In fact, there is a 
fourth position within the Canadian government. That position is 
stated on the Internet site and reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not advocating the replication of NAFTA investor-state 
rules in the FTAA and has not supported the proposals made so far 
by other FTAA countries to include such a type of dispute 
settlement mechanism. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is from the government's Internet site. Therefore I will 
repeat my question to the government. There are four government 
positions on chapter 11 on investment. Which is the right one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it that of the Minister for International Trade, who said 
that he would not sign any free trade agreement involving the 
three Americas if it includes provisions similar to those found 
in chapter 11? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the Prime Minister's position, who says there is no 
problem with chapter 11? According to him, there is no problem 
with that chapter but taxpayers could run into problems. Also the 
governments' ability to get involved in economic, social and 
cultural sectors, and even in health, could be compromised 
because of chapter 11. However the Prime Minister says there is no 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the position stated on the Internet site? Is that the 
government's position, or is it the latest find of the Minister 
for International Trade? It is important to know that. This is 
why we need transparency. This is why we need to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, could the narrow definition found in chapter 11, 
which could be replicated in the FTAA, allow an American investor 
who is currently investing in health, because the private sector 
plays a significant role in health in the United States, to 
demand that governments withdraw from health, or that he be 
compensated, given that the profits which he could potentially 
make would be jeopardized because of a provision such as the one 
in chapter 11? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The free trade agreement between the United States, Canada and 
Mexico has only been in effect for three years and 17 complaints 
have already been filed. Seventeen court actions have been taken 
by major companies against the federal government, and this could 
end up costing Quebec and Canadian taxpayers billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this going to be extended to all 34 countries in the free 
trade area of the Americas?  Is that what they have in mind? With 
an agreement covering three countries there have already been 17 
suits by Canadian businesses against the federal government. 
When there are 34 countries, the potential number of businesses 
that could be launching suits against the state coffers, which 
could demand compensation, will be multiplied with such a limited 
definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government presence in certain sectors also be at risk? 
Just taking the example of the Caisse de dépôt et de placement, 
could the Chase Manhattan Bank come along some day and say that 
the Caisse de dépôt et de placement, a semi-governmental body 
governed by Government of Quebec regulations and a statute, is 
preventing the bank from making a profit in the Canadian market? 
It could go as far as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain companies are involved in suits. For example, Ethyl is 
suing the Canadian government for $250 million, Metalclad, for 
$150 million.  In all, when all the companies are combined, the 
figure is $17 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must question the capacity of the government to provide us 
with real information, to take a real position on fundamental 
questions, if only on this single issue which lays open to 
question the integrity of governmental tax bases and their 
ability to fund such areas as health.  The lack of transparency 
must be challenged.  This transparency must be demanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose an amendment to my colleague's motion: 
<A NAME="LINK20">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “consulted” and substituting the following thereof: 
“before official ratification by the government, authorized by 
Parliament”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all my colleagues will support this motion which is so 
important for democracy, the future of parliamentarians and the 
well-being of civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> I declare the 
amendment is in order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I wish to pursue the debate with my Bloc colleagues. I 
congratulate the member for bringing forth the motion and for 
providing us with an opportunity to talk about the FTAA and the 
process that attends it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the response to me earlier and in the remarks of the 
hon. member who just finished, the Bloc says that it does want to 
prejudge the outcome.  Members already know what the outcome is 
in the sense that we know what NAFTA is.  NAFTA is not something 
that one has to prejudge.  NAFTA is something that we have had 
since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member does not have to prejudge the FTAA.  He can judge 
NAFTA, not in a prejudging way but on the basis of eight years of 
experience with various things like chapter 11, about which the 
member spoke very eloquently and thoroughly.  These are things 
that are part of the agreement now and they are intended to be 
part of any future agreement.  That is one of the reasons the NDP 
is against these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member tell the House what the position of the Bloc is 
with respect to the North American Free Trade Agreement?  I 
cannot understand why people who are concerned about issues of 
sovereignty cannot see that in these agreements there is a real 
and serious threat to the sovereignty of democratically elected 
legislatures and parliaments.  There is a threat to the 
sovereignty of the Quebec National Assembly, whether it continues 
to be a provincial assembly or whether some day, as my Bloc 
colleagues hope, it may become a national parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless, there is a question of sovereignty here.  Many other 
people have made the judgment that these agreements affect the 
sovereignty of these particular legislatures, not to mention the 
FTQ, which was out marching alongside the NDP in Quebec City on 
the weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are they wrong?  Have they prejudged the FTAA or is there 
something in the nature of these agreements that no amount of 
good process and no amount of openness can fix, because the 
underlying agenda of these agreements as they are now understood 
is in fact to replace democratic rule with corporate rule? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not understand the NDP 
members' insistence on opposing something they are not familiar 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me the first logical thing to ask for is what we are 
asking for and that is to see what is being negotiated and how. 
Is there a way to improve things so that these agreements play a 
redistributive role somewhere?  We do not want to end up in a 
situation in which people are denied a better standard of living. 
I am not speaking here of a few millionaires or of a few 
transnationals worth billions, but of people in general.  Is 
there a way to provide for mechanisms that would ensure fair 
treatment and the possibility of a better standard of living for 
workers in Mexico, as has been the case in other countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1957, since the Treaty of Rome, they have been building 
Europe, and the standard of living has increased.  Even the small 
countries that were having difficulties, such as Portugal or 
Greece, can become partners in this great body.  People's wealth 
has increased, not just that of multinational or transnational 
companies.  Can they understand that on the other side? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot be closed and not demand that members of parliament have 
a role. 
We must demand that this government open its books. We must take 
our responsibilities as parliamentarians, something which Liberal 
members opposite are not doing. We must demand to see the 
documents and take part in the ratification process on behalf of 
the people, as did the 30,000 who rallied in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois was there and it was even among the organizers 
of the summit for parliamentarians. These 30,000 people, who 
represented the public, along with parliamentarians, must feel 
comfortable with any agreement. They must not be ashamed of it. 
They must feel that their leaders are serving them well, unlike 
the Prime Minister, who looked condescendingly and contemptuously 
on them at the end of the summit and said “Get elected if you 
want to oppose or debate the FTAA”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were elected, and we did not even have a say in the drafting 
of the basic texts. We do not even have a say in the ratification 
process. What is the use of this parliament? Members opposite 
should ask themselves such questions. Why are they here?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member who 
just spoke had a number of comments to make, and rather loudly at 
that.  This is the latest in several opportunities that members 
of parliament have had to discuss the FTAA.  I will be splitting 
my time with my colleague, the hon. member for Scarborough East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the great success of the Quebec summit. 
I would also like to indicate how consultations with Canadians 
contributed to that success.  I was very honoured as 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Trade 
to be present, along with some other colleagues on our side as 
well as the other side, to meet with parliamentarians and leaders 
from a number of countries and to talk with some of the peaceful 
protesters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During Canada's chairmanship of the FTAA negotiations from May 
1998 until November 1999 it was instrumental in establishing the 
committee of government representatives on the participation of 
civil society.  This committee meets regularly as a consultative 
body in the negotiations and serves as a forum for input from 
citizen based groups, the business community and NGOs.  It is an 
unprecedented step in international negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for transparency and I would indicate that 
there has never been a more transparent trade negotiation process 
in history.  A lot of what the member calls for has already been 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As host of the FTAA ministerial that took place in Toronto in 
November 1999, Canada supported a civil society forum.  It was 
organized by hemispheric organizations to parallel the American 
business forum.  As my colleague opposite knows, a record 22 FTAA 
ministers and country representatives were present to hear civil 
society's views and recommendations on trade investment, labour 
standards and the reduction of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, at the recent trade ministerial in Buenos 
Aires the Minister for International Trade took the lead, as he 
has for months, and was able to convince his counterparts to 
release the draft text of the FTAA agreement.  It was agreed that 
soon after the conclusion of the summit these texts would be 
released.  They are in translation now.  The summit only 
concluded on Sunday, and today is Tuesday.  The texts will be 
released in the near future, as was agreed to through the 
outstanding leadership of the Minister for International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard the Prime Minister state in the House that he would 
very happily release the texts, but he was not prepared to do so 
unilaterally until there was an agreement.  That agreement was 
achieved through the efforts of the Minister for International 
Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw, as Canadians saw, the Prime Minister doing an outstanding 
job in chairing this very important multilateral meeting in 
Quebec City.  We can all be very proud of the efforts that were 
made by the government, by civil society and by the peaceful 
demonstrators who expressed their views in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the summit of the Americas this past weekend the government 
provided some $300,000 in funding to help the parallel summit 
take place.  Labour leaders in my own city have said that the 
government has no interest in civil society and that it will not 
listen to them.  That is just ludicrous when the government has 
put forth taxpayer money to help the very people who are 
levelling that criticism participate in a parallel summit.  It 
cannot be both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some 20 countries and five international institutions 
that met on the weekend with more than 60 representatives of 
civil society networks, groups and associations.  These 
representatives who have been closely involved in the development 
of the summit's action plan came from across Canada and the 
hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec City summit was a resounding success.  In signing the 
declaration, the 34 leaders committed themselves to furthering 
democracy and to making democracy an essential condition for 
participation in the FTAA process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a quantum leap forward from the few short years ago when 
a lot of the leaders of this meeting, if it had taken place, 
would have marched in in jackboots, epaulettes and military gear 
because they were dictators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought not to dismiss so lightly the tremendous progress that 
has been made in this hemisphere toward democracy.  Many experts 
would say that the democratic election of the Mexican president, 
Vicente Fox, is in no small part due to the liberalization of 
that society, which is also signified and enhanced by its 
participation in NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same spirit, the leaders made a commitment to more 
specific support for the efforts being made by Haiti towards 
democracy through the good offices of the OAS and the CARICOM. 
There is great concern about Haiti.  The Prime Minister and the 
other leaders have indicated that they want to do everything 
possible to support that society on its path to democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the summit the leaders decided, in order to ensure 
equitable distribution of the benefits and prosperity resulting 
from economic growth, to pursue discussions on the economic 
integration of the Americas and to continue negotiations to 
create a free trade area of the Americas, the world's largest 
free trade area, by the end of 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leaders also approved a series of measures to promote 
participation by citizens in the social, economic and political 
life of their countries in order to fully realize their human 
potential.  This inclusive plan of action is targeted at 
everyone, including groups that all too often find themselves on 
the margins of society such as youth, seniors, women, persons 
with disabilities and aboriginal people, and ensures a full and 
fair opportunity to be properly included in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leaders went on to reach an agreement on a declaration of 
connectivity, which is a clear statement of their political 
intent to bridge the digital gap, and on the use of information 
and communications technology to achieve the summit's objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada again showing its leadership also announced the 
establishment of an institute for connectivity in the Americas 
which would make it possible for us as Canadians to share our 
world renown expertise in this field with other poorer 
countries of the Americas, which simply have to be given the 
wherewithal to fairly participate in this FTAA.  Canada is quite 
prepared to do everything to make that possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, supported by the multilateral development banks 
and other international institutions, satisfied itself that the 
necessary resources were available to support the objectives set 
by the leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who participated in the summit in a violent way, and 
unfortunately some small minority did, created quite a bit of 
tension and damage to the beautiful city of Quebec.  However 
they knew nothing about democracy nor did those who condoned such 
violent actions.  It simply was not necessary for that to take 
place.  There has never been a more transparent trade negotiation 
that Canada has been involved in.  There has never been such a 
wide consultation for months and months and which will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member's motion calls for is being done now, has been 
done for many months and will continue to be done as we move up 
to the conclusion of this treaty in 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec City summit also provided an unprecedented 
opportunity for people right across Canada to be involved.  I 
believe what the peaceful demonstrators helped to do was focus 
attention on the summit.  Unfortunately, I suppose some would say 
that was achieved really by the violent demonstrations.  I regret 
that that view exists because all it did was detract from the 
very real and important debate that was taking place in Quebec 
City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to just conclude by indicating that I would be 
remiss in not saying that the Minister for International Trade 
worked diligently on this file.  Indeed the member from Joliette 
has shown consistent interest in the file.  I know that. I worked 
with him at committee and we debated in the House.  I believe 
this is his second motion already as a new member on a very 
important topic in the House.  I do not know how it could be said 
that there was not been ample opportunity for members to be 
involved.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a lot of opportunities.  No, the texts are not 
yet public.  However, through the leadership of the Minister for 
International Trade and the Prime Minister, an agreement was 
reached that they would be made public in the very near future. I 
await that with alacrity, as I know the whole House does. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary said that the process was the most 
transparent ever seen. It may be so but I do not know, because I 
am not an expert on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I find it difficult to understand how the process can 
be considered to be transparent when members of parliament cannot 
have their say on the issue. This is why I hope the government 
will support the motion I have introduced, as well as the 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also remind the government that members of parliament 
have a role to play, which they have played, though, 
unfortunately, within the limits imposed upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to what I call the basic texts issue, I remind 
the parliamentary secretary that, at first, it was almost 
suggested to us that those texts did not exist. We were referred 
to the website on the Canadian government's negotiating 
positions. Then, the government admitted that those texts 
existed. Later on, under the pressure of the opposition parties 
and the questions asked, the Minister for International Trade 
promised to ask his counterparts to make those texts public. To 
his own surprise, the other parties accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the House not played its role, I am convinced that the 
Minister for International Trade would not have played his own 
role within that forum. It is, therefore, of the outmost 
importance that all members of parliament be involved in the 
negotiating process, to ensure that the goals are being met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to know very precisely is whether, in Buenos Aires, 
the international trade ministers agreed that the texts of 
what has come to be known as the draft agreement be regularly 
made public before ministerial meetings. I insist on the phrase 
“before ministerial meetings”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, first I would like to 
address some of my colleague's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the transparency of this process.  He may have 
been present when I repeatedly put the question to expert 
witnesses at committee.  I put the question to the NDP party, the 
only party in the House speaking against this, to give us just 
one example of any trade negotiation that was even anywhere close 
to as transparent to this one.  Nobody replied.  So there was an 
acknowledgement by their silence that this was certainly been the 
most open and transparent trade process to date.  The government 
is working very hard to make it become more transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the hon. member's point that parliamentarians have not had an 
opportunity to participate, quite frankly I do not know how he 
draws that conclusion.  As I said, this is the second motion that 
he has put in the House causing a full day of debate, a very 
important and useful debate, and I congratulate him for it. 
However he must realize by having this debate today he is having 
some of the participation which he says he was denied.  I do not 
understand the logic there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member well knows that the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade has held extensive hearings on 
the FTAA and on the summit process.  Before the last election it 
held hearings it.  Those hearings were resumed after the election 
and started to include more and more of the summit process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a subcommittee on trade which is specifically tasked to 
deal with this issue and other trade issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this very Chamber I and I believe the hon. member opposite 
and other members participated in FIPA, the first forum of the 
interparliamentarians of the Americas.  It was a very useful and 
extensive discussion.  There have been repeated opportunities for 
parliamentarians to be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke about our negotiating position.  For weeks and weeks 
five of our nine positions were available on the website.  Many 
Canadians visited that website to see what our position was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the member to go back some weeks and look up the 
comments of the right hon. the Prime Minister in the House of 
Commons.  He said he would be very happy to release the text but 
he was not going to do so unilaterally.  The for Joliette knows 
full well, because I asked him that at committee, that he agreed 
it should not be done unilaterally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Buenos Aires the Minister for International Trade showed his 
outstanding leadership in convincing the other ministers to 
release the text, which was supported by the Prime Minister. That 
is the kind of leadership that has made this transparency become 
even greater and that will continue in the future.

negotiating text.  The timetable of which I am aware is as soon

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I

the area and I have not studied trade issues at a university. 
Frankly, at times my understanding of these issues is something 
of a newspaper understanding, but like many Canadians I can get 
myself exercised about countervails, softwood lumber, P.E.I. 
potatoes and rail against American protectionism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can work myself up into quite a lather about American trading 
practices.  I could even give a bit of an historical view on how 
trade has affected this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing seems to animate Canadians more than debate about trade. 
Going back to Prime Minister Macdonald, he had quite some trade 
debates in his time, as did Laurier, Mackenzie and Prime Minister 
Mulroney.  Even our current Prime Minister has a few political 
scars about the issues of trade in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do Canadians get so animated about trade debates?  I would 
suggest that trade is in some respects more than merely economic 
relations that it goes to the very essence and viability of our 
nation.  No country in the world is more dependent upon trade 
than we are.  Something in the order of 40% of our gross domestic 
product is directly related to trade.  Compare that with our 
major trading partner, the Americans, where 20% of their gross 
domestic product is related to trade.  Our trade with the U.S. is 
a billion dollars a day, and 80% of all our trade is with the 
U.S.  The old saying goes that when America catches a cold we get 
pneumonia.  Seemingly try as we might to diversify, we still seem 
to go to our old trading partners, particularly the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are uniquely positioned to know how vulnerable we are 
on trade.  Therefore our trade vulnerability makes our 
sovereignty vulnerability even more open to us.  Sovereignty 
vulnerability in my view goes to the essence of who we are as a 
nation.  The irony is that the more we trade, the more we plant 
our flag worldwide and the more Canadian we feel.  Is that not an 
unique irony?  Ironically, in some respects we also give up a 
great deal of our sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that Chris Hadfield is doing as we speak?  He is 
planting a Canadian on the next frontier, the Canadarm.  How did 
he get there?  He got there basically because of a trade deal. 
Canadians in the family of nations are responsible for 2% to 3% 
of the overall cost of putting up the space station.  As a result 
we get to play in our area of expertise.  Our area of expertise 
is robotics and in some respects it is a quintessential Canadian 
trade deal.  We establish a niche, make it very important and 
expand from there.  Meanwhile we brand our product so that 
literally everyone in the universe knows that the Canadian 
astronaut up there is exercising Canadian expertise and planting 
it in the best advertising position in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a Canadian style trade deal because we are not big enough 
to do a meaningful space program on our own.  We end up giving 
away some of our sovereignty, our means to be independent and on 
our own, in order to take part in something that is larger and 
that we could not do on our own.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that the summit of the Americas reflects that kind of 
tradeoff.  At one level it is merely a trade deal.  I have it, 
someone wants it, what is the price?  At a more profound level it 
is a sovereignty tradeoff.  What level of national sovereignty 
are we prepared to give away in order to get a trade deal from 
someone else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think my speech is the most insightful in the world but 
generally they do not turn the lights out on me at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 11 is at its essence a simple tradeoff.  If I, the hated 
multinational corporation, for which, by the way, all our sons 
and daughters want to work at very good rates of salary, am to 
invest $100 million in a country I want to know what its rules 
and laws and regulations are.  I do not want Mr. or Mrs. 
sovereign nation to change its rules or laws after the fact to 
make my investment worthless.  At its core chapter 11 is that 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much sovereignty is a nation prepared to give up?  How much 
sovereignty, i.e. the right to make rules, regulations and laws 
unilaterally within a jurisdiction, is Canada or any other nation 
prepared to accede to a trade panel or to courts in a foreign 
jurisdiction?  The answer is a lot and nothing, simultaneously in 
contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a rule in tax law that the taxpayer is expected to 
arrange his or her affairs to maximize the benefit to himself or 
herself and to minimize his or her tax liability.  The courts 
recognize that rule.  Revenue Canada has volumes of rules and 
regulations that would choke a horse in order to minimize that 
taxpayer intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a sovereign nation enters into a trade deal the question 
is: What is it losing?  If a nation is powerful like the U.S. and 
gets to change the rules ex post facto, the answer is not much. 
For a large nation such as Japan which can culturally frustrate 
virtually any trade deal, the answer again is not much.  However 
leaders like Mr. Fox from Mexico or the prime minister of Costa 
Rica or Chile must make a bit of a Faustian bargain and hope the 
access they secure to the market is worth the sovereignty they 
must inevitably give up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lights have gone on so my speech must be very insightful at 
this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where it gets tricky because smaller nations, even 
nations such as Canada, have a lot of sovereignty to lose. I 
sometimes wonder whether those from the so-called civil society 
have appreciated that the more elements which are raised, i.e. 
environment, labour, working conditions, et cetera, the more 
difficult the equation becomes.  It is particularly difficult if, 
as with many small nations with minimal democratic traditions, 
one has virtually nothing to give. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitment by the 34 leaders in the hemisphere to strengthen 
democracy has significance beyond the appreciation of both sides 
of the debate.  It is something of a Trojan horse clause.  Can 
one imagine APEC entering into a similar clause?  Virtually half 
the nations in APEC are dictatorships or quasi-dictatorships. The 
situation is similar for the Organization of African States. I 
cannot imagine that hemisphere entering into an agreement where a 
democracy clause is a significant part of the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade deals only work in democracies where the rule of law 
prevails.  Therein lies the irony.  As nations mature in their 
democracy, trade increases.  When trade increases and democracy 
matures, sovereignty is a fact.  It is quite ironic that 
Canadians have become a nation of flag wavers in lockstep with 
trade deals which apparently devolve significant elements of 
their sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear to me that the status quo will not prevail.  A deal 
or deals will be made, be they bilateral or multilateral.  The 
process contemplated by the motion will happen regardless of the 
will of government.  The genie is out of the bottle and cannot be 
put back in.  My only hesitation is that the debate should be 
informed and that government should reserve unto itself some 
strategic room to negotiate in the best interests of the nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with a great deal of interest and I thought it was very 
interesting that the member who just spoke on the government 
benches reduced the debate around the FTAA to one simple 
question:  How much sovereignty are we willing to give up to 
enter into a trade deal?  I think <I>Hansard</I> will show that is 
what the member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member.  I will take a moment to 
outline the flip-flops that have occurred.  The trade minister 
created some optimism when he said that by endorsing chapter 11 
of NAFTA we would give up too much sovereignty.  He is on record 
as saying we would not sign such a provision in the FTAA 
agreement or in any other agreement.  He said that a year ago. We 
have seen a flip-flop on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has said that chapter 11 of NAFTA is working 
well and that we may review it, change it or even sign on to it 
in the year 2005.  What level of sovereignty are we willing to 
give up to enter into a trade deal? Does he feel chapter 11 of 
NAFTA would give up too much sovereignty?  If so, does he share 
the concern of growing numbers of Canadians with respect to the 
most recent flip-flop on the issue by his own government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, the question by the hon. 
member is well taken.  Chapter 11 has been somewhat problematic 
in both the FTAA and the NAFTA.  Sovereign nations are starting 
to face the reality of the sovereignty they gave up to get that 
deal.  The Prime Minister has acknowledged that chapter 11 is 
somewhat problematic for us.  In the event a free trade agreement 
is entered into in the hemisphere, chapter 11 or the successor 
version of it will likely get a great deal more attention from 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major frustrations in dealing with the Americans is 
that their trade rules apply for the initial period of the trade 
dispute and then we go to a dispute resolution mechanism, which 
is where we all wanted to be in the first place.  However the 
result of that mechanism is like an interim injunction.  It is 
all over once we have our interim injunction and the permanent 
injunction is somewhat useless after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore agree in some respects with the hon. member that the 
clause must be looked at carefully and that other mechanisms can 
be used.  I look forward to her contribution in that respect.

heard government members talk about space. I think they are way 
up in the clouds, and so much so that they do not see things 
clearly. Actually, they do not see a thing. They have shown a 
lack of respect for the Quebec government. This is a breach of 
the integrity and sovereignty of Quebec's jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will they allow Quebec to participate in the negotiation tables, 
in all the sectoral groups so that, at last, areas under 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction can be really represented, and 
their interests really looked after? They are showing us that the 
only way for Quebec, as well as Canada, to have international 
negotiations is for Quebec to achieve sovereignty.

necessarily at every table because it is well represented by the

been lost by the side opposite.  Quebec will be represented there 
by the federal government and seems to be doing very well, thank 
you very much.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I notice that members have been talking about 
Colonel Hadfield and his mission to space, although I did not

</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity last week to be in Cape Canaveral for the 
launch.  It was an extremely proud day for Canada.  I understand 
Colonel Hadfield has just completed his second space walk.  On 
behalf of all parliamentarians and people in my riding, I wish 
him great success.  We are extremely proud of his 
accomplishments.  I will leave my comments to that with respect 
to our astronaut currently looking down upon us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read the Bloc supply day motion so I can frame the 
debate. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government put in place an open and ongoing process to 
keep Parliament informed of negotiations to establish a Free 
Trade Area of the Americas so as to allow parliamentarians to 
debate it and civil society to be consulted before Parliament 
approves it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be recommending that my colleagues support the motion, 
although I believe there will probably be an amendment.  In 
general I agree with the process.  Parliament should be 
consulted.  We should have an opportunity to debate the agreement 
here and strengthen it.  Canadians across Canada should be 
consulted before it is approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about three or four things during my 10 minutes.  I 
will talk about free trade agreements in general.  I will talk a 
bit about NAFTA and transparency and I will conclude by talking 
about the Quebec— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is the hon. member 
sharing his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Madam Speaker, yes, I believe I am. 
I will talk a bit about the Quebec summit and the security that 
was there, as I had an opportunity to witness it firsthand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk first about free trade agreements in general.  I and 
my party believe free trade has been very good for Canada.  Under 
NAFTA, our trade surplus with the United States has been $95 
billion.  Despite some problems, our trade surplus has been 
skyrocketing under free trade.  I looked at some numbers 
yesterday.  I do not have them in front of me, but our trade 
surplus has gone up from 1995 to $110 billion or $115 billion.  A 
trade surplus of that magnitude is almost unheard of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an opportunity in Quebec to talk with trade ministers from 
34 countries in the hemisphere.  They are very excited about 
embarking upon free trade.  It will open up new markets for their 
small economies.  They will have access to the United States, 
Mexico, Brazil and other larger markets.  That is very exciting 
for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Bush and the Prime Minister said that free trade would 
bring democracy and greater human rights to these areas.  I do 
not think free trade in itself will bring these things but it 
will provide us the opportunity to attain them.  It will be up to 
us as parliamentarians to seize that opportunity.  The heads of 
state from these 34 nations have democracy and human rights very 
much on their minds.  As we negotiate these free trade agreements 
it will be incumbent upon us to ensure we seize the opportunity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do believe all the players will benefit.  The global 
economic borders are now evaporating before our eyes.  We are 
seeing that in the European Union as their trade barriers are 
evaporating.  It is important that we participate in this process 
and create a larger trading block in our hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot emphasize enough that the smaller economies, the 
smaller countries in the Caribbean community and Central and 
South America, will greatly benefit from this.  In fact, they 
will probably benefit most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that our experience with free trade has been very 
positive.  I know that some of my colleagues in the NDP have 
raised concerns and they do not believe in free trade.  Yes, 
there have been a few cases under chapter 11 on the investment 
protection measures.  There need to be some measures.  We can 
debate that.  We can have that ongoing public debate.  It would 
be very positive for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk a little about transparency.  The Bloc motion is 
really focused on the transparency issue.  I argued with the 
minister and I was with him in Buenos Aires when we were 
successful in getting the text of the FTAA released.  We should 
be proud of what we are doing.  We should not be afraid.  If we 
do not release it then some of the anti forces we saw in Quebec 
will be out there spinning it, turning it and not giving out the 
real information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our job as parliamentarians is to make sure we get the text out 
to the public, and in regard to the parts we do not agree with, 
to engage in that debate and put forward constructive solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that it be ongoing as negotiations progress 
in the next four or five years.  It is very important that this 
transparency not be just a one-off right now.  It is important 
that we get updates as negotiators scrap parts of the text and 
bring in new parts, because it will change very much as it 
evolves over the four or five years.  It is important that we 
engage the civil society in that open and public debate.  It 
would be very positive for all of the countries and would 
definitely result in a much more positive free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a little about what I observed in Quebec.  This 
needs to be said.  I had the opportunity to be in Quebec City for 
the summit.  I had an opportunity to speak with a lot of people. 
I had dinner with Don Evans, the U.S. secretary of commerce.  I 
had some very positive discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I watched the media all weekend long and all I saw were the 
protesters and demonstrators.  I first want to say that on 
Saturday in Quebec City I had a meeting outside of the security 
area.  When we came back in we were caught up in literally 
tens of thousands of demonstrators.  They were demonstrating very 
peacefully.  They were marching and expressing themselves in a 
very peaceful manner.  There were masses of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The picture painted of the protesters was that they were 
violent.  Some were very violent and I will get to that in a 
minute.  However, 98% or even more were demonstrating in a very 
responsible and peaceful manner, as they should in Canada and as 
they have a right to do.  We not only accept that, we encourage 
it, because that is how we get feedback.  These people are part 
of civil society.  We had part of the business community giving 
input as well as the demonstrators.  That was not said at all.  I 
was right in the middle of it.  They were having parades far 
away, and some quite close, but in a very peaceful manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about the 2%.  They were absolutely crazy.  I 
have no problem in saying that.  They were insane.  I watched 
them.  These people threw bricks, bottles and everything 
imaginable at the police.  The restraint shown by the police was 
phenomenal.  I absolutely applaud the security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some are trying to turn the summit security into a political 
matter.  My colleague for Burnaby—Douglas is calling for an 
inquiry.  I do not support that at all and I want to be on the 
record as saying that.  Security is not a political decision. 
Security is something we should leave to the experts and the 
police forces.  The RCMP, the provincial police in Quebec, the 
military and the municipal police force from Quebec City were 
working together.  They took proactive measures.

violent people who were absolutely crazy.  That is not acceptable 
in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our police should have taken action.  They should have taken the 
measures they did.  I watched them from a few blocks away as we 
went into the convention centre.  I want to be on the record as 
saying that they did an outstanding job.  It was very impressive 
and I support their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying I support the Bloc motion.  It is very 
important that parliament engage in this debate, that this is 
open and transparent and that we be proud of the agreement.  We 
need to engage in a positive dialogue in regard to the parts we 
do not like and we need to offer constructive solutions.  It is 
most important that the transparency and openness be ongoing.  It 
is most important to ensure that as negotiations move forward in 
the next three, four and five years, leading up to 2005, we keep 
this engagement and engage the business community, the NGOs, the 
civil society, all the people involved in this, and most 
important, the elected representatives of the people.  We need to 
listen to their concerns. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
so much for the official opposition.  After hearing the comments 
of the hon. member from the Canadian Alliance in the debate 
today, I must say that the difference between the positions of 
the so-called official opposition and the government is 
indistinguishable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting and ironic to note that both the 
government and the opposition are now hiding behind saying “This 
is good for you.  This is good for democracy.  This is good for 
the environment.  This is good for education, health care and our 
water”.  In actual fact, just the opposite is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is astounding to hear the line being peddled today by the 
government and the opposition, which is that the FTAA is so good 
for us. In a column that the leader of the Alliance wrote just a 
couple of days ago, he actually had the audacity to say that the 
FTAA also means good health, education, a clean environment, good 
working conditions, justice and human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where have these people been?  What have they been reading?  Any 
objective analysis tells us that the FTAA is about transferring 
rights to fewer and more powerful corporations.  It is not about 
the distribution of wealth among people.  It is not about a clean 
environment or labour standards or protecting our public 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member to explain to the Canadian public 
how his leader and his party can come to the astounding 
conclusion that somehow the FTAA is going to improve working 
conditions when there is nothing in the agreement that will 
actually lay out standards to ensure that workers' rights are 
respected in any of the countries that are now part of this 
agreement.  It seems to me that this line being peddled is 
exactly the same line the government is using and that the 
government and the official opposition are in cahoots on this 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Madam Speaker, let me start by saying that 
we just need to look at the record of NAFTA.  It has been very 
positive for Canada.  We have a trade surplus of over $100 
billion each year with the United States.  Mexico's economy is 
growing even more rapidly than Canada's.  Mexico started much 
further behind, but as a result of NAFTA the Mexican economy is 
growing incredibly rapidly.  Literally tens of thousands of jobs 
are being created in Mexico and people's livelihoods are 
improving.  Along with that comes health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about the rhetoric of the NDP member.  We live in a 
democracy.  We in the Canadian Alliance are very proud that we 
have been promoting free trade since the beginning of the Reform 
Party all the way through to today.  We are very proud of that 
and people elect us on the platforms for which we stand.  We 
stand in the House with 66 seats.  I would remind the hon. member 
that her party has 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Thirteen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Thirteen.  I apologize.  She is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind the hon. member that her NDP cousins 
in British Columbia are in the middle of a provincial election 
campaign.  The election will be held on May 16. 
Let us see how her NDP cousins make out in British Columbia on 
May 16, because they are standing on these policies and the 
people get to decide.

transparency are needed.  This has not been open and transparent 
up to now.  I appreciate that the text is about to be released,

will very proudly stand up in the next election and campaign by 
supporting the free trade agreement of the Americas, as the heads 
of state of all 34 countries are engaging in these discussions. 
They are all engaging in the discussions and are all very 
positive that this would support their countries.  They have all 
been democratically elected.  It is very encouraging to me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of 
Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to ask the member why, in their election 
campaign, the reformed Alliance people had absolutely zero in 
their platform.  What they did have was in section 96 of their 
leaked document, the leaked document to candidates, which was a 
so-called secret document.  They had some reference with respect 
to free trade in the Americas, but they had nothing, 
diddly-squat, in the election platform itself.  I wonder why they 
did that.  Is that typical of their modus operandi? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Madam Speaker, the way the question is 
framed and the language that is used is very indicative of how 
the member wants to play partisan politics.  I am trying to put 
forward constructive solutions.  Again, I emphasize that both the 
Reform Party and the Canadian Alliance have been some of the 
first people out there supporting free trade.  We are very proud 
of it.  We will continue to do so for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise to speak to this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the member from the opposite side who just 
got up that if he had some intelligence he could read the blues 
and everything and he would probably find out what our position 
was, which we articulated very well in the last session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On rising here I do not know who to take to task, the government 
or the NDP.  However, I will make my points and try to debate 
this issue more intelligently than has been done here with the 
rhetoric that has been going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globalization is here to stay.  It does not have to be a case of 
winners and losers.  I believe it can make winners of all of us, 
but for that to happen, our government, all the groups and all 
the international agencies must recognize their responsibility to 
educate and inform the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the motion talks about free trade of the Americas, the 
protests and the issues raised in Quebec City touched on the 
broader issue of globalization.  A lot of people were protesting 
and, I must say, protesting peacefully.  I will address my 
remarks to the issues of those who were protesting peacefully. 
They brought forth the concerns of globalization, which are part 
and parcel of the creation of a free trade zone.  They tried to 
lump everything under a trade agreement.  They felt all the 
concerns they had, created by globalization, should be addressed 
under a trade issue.  That is where we differ and that is where 
we feel the approach they have taken is not the right approach.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globalization is here to stay.  Groups and governments must 
recognize their responsibility to educate and inform the public. 
This world of information left by our governments, international 
organizations and business leaders have given footholds to 
non-governmental organizations and other organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These groups have banded together and have called themselves the 
civil society.  They have gained tremendous influence in the last 
decade.  The problem is that these are unelected, unaccountable 
and self-interest groups that have successfully tapped into the 
fields brought about by the uncertainty of global trade or 
globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example of the power of the so-called civil society is the 
government's $300,000 donation to the people's summit, the 
gathering of civil society to protest negotiations in Quebec 
City.  Similarly, the publicity given to protesters in Seattle, 
which I witnessed firsthand, demonstrates the powers of this 
organization.  I feel many of these organizations have legitimate 
concerns.  I would even agree that the NDP may at times have some 
legitimate concerns.  However, in general, where they are trying 
to address this issue under trade agreements is not the right 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended the WTO summit in Seattle in December and recently, 
with the Canadian parliamentary delegation, I spent many hours 
with international organizations in Geneva.  I met with officials 
from the ILO, the WTO, the United Nations Commission on Human 
Rights and the United Nations Commission for Refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I must say that I was a little disappointed with 
our representative in Geneva, Ambassador Sergio Marchi, who, in 
obtaining the position of ambassador, is supposed to be 
non-partisan.  I found him to be the most partisan ambassador I 
have ever encountered in my meetings with officials.  I feel it 
is disgraceful to be partisan when one is in that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, in my meetings with the United Nations' officials, 
and especially the international labour organizations, I came 
back with a very disturbing observation.  These are international 
organizations that have been mandated to address the issues of 
labour, environment and human rights and, in talking with them, 
my conclusion was that these organizations were 10 years behind 
what is going on in the streets of Seattle, Quebec City and 
anywhere.  They are not even addressing the issues of labour 
standards, the issues of environment or any other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the government has failed to hold these international 
agencies accountable, it has led to the rise of groups, which 
want to address these issues, taking these issues to trade 
tribunals and clouding the importance of the issue of free trade. 
Free trade has been in the world for a long time.  We have been 
trading with everyone and we will continue trading.  Nothing will 
stop us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We keep hearing our colleagues in the NDP say that they do not 
mind trade but then they suddenly do mind all the other issues. I 
say that they do not go hand in hand.  The labour issue needs to 
be addressed but they should campaign other bodies that will 
address those issues.  Instead they try to put the burden onto 
one body, which has become a successful body. If they do have 
questions they should hold the United Nations and those types of 
organizations accountable.  They should ask them to address the 
issues that need to be addressed and that they have been talking 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk for a second about the FTAA and the failure of 
the government to communicate what the FTAA is all about.  The 
debate we have had in the House has been nothing but huffs and 
puffs, where we stand up, we talk about it and the parliamentary 
secretary listens to it but no one cares.  The chairman of the 
foreign affairs committee, under whom I work, has held FTAA 
hearings and even WTO hearings. 
We have listened to the groups.  The Minister for International 
Trade said that he has listened.  However we know on this side 
who has been talking about these issues.  The Liberals have not 
listened.   They only allow others to huff and puff to let off 
steam.  The protests we have had are a message that something is 
seriously wrong.

agreement into the House so parliamentarians can discuss it and 
ratify it, and not just sign it and say that the deal is done? It 
should bring the agreement into parliament and let the elected 
officials, those who are the actual voices of Canadians, talk 
about it, debate the issues that are important and then say that 
we agree or do not agree with the agreement.  That is the 
commitment we want from the government.

agreement to parliament and allow parliamentarians to discuss it

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of 
Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened with some interest to the hon. member for 
Calgary East.  He of course challenged my intelligence, which I 
always find interesting.  Those are the kinds of extremist views 
and mud slinging that those reformed Alliance are prepared to 
stoop to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That aside, he admonished me for not checking the blues with 
respect to what the reformed Alliance people have been talking 
about on international trade.  I would like to inform him that I 
have in fact checked the blues.  In the recent history of this 
parliament, the only reference to international trade came from 
the trade critic, the hon. member for Saanich—Gulf Islands, on 
April 2 of this year.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government prepared to tell the Americans that our 
co-operation with respect to energy and on a pipeline from Alaska 
to the lower 48th state depends on a positive resolution of the 
softwood lumber issue? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member for Calgary East is simple.  Is 
he, along with his colleague, prepared to gamble away oil in this 
country and tie it strictly and solely to softwood lumber? He 
represents Alberta.  More to the point, he represents Calgary 
East.  Is he prepared to stand today and say that he is in 
agreement with the trade critic in linking those two issues in 
that kind of fashion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear his response because these reformed 
Alliance people always go on about how they think they know what 
negotiations are all about, how they think they know what trade 
is all about and how they think they know what is good for 
business.  Let us see whether or not they have the kind of acumen 
that justifies that kind of statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reference in the last little while was on April 2 of 
this year, and he says, “Oh, we have been on record for quite a 
while saying all kinds of things”.  I would like to ask him and 
challenge him, does he, representing Calgary East, agree with the 
hon. member for Saanich—Gulf Islands that softwood lumber and 
oil should be intricately linked in that kind of fashion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, what I said was that 
the hon. member should be listening at what has been said.  It 
would be my pleasure to say to the hon. member what I said 
publicly about trade when I was the international trade critic. 
It would be a nice debate over here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member said shows his ignorance.  We have 
discussed and talked about trade in the House.  He finds it 
difficult to even know what the Alliance has said.  We know from 
the past how partisan he is.  I do not think I want to debate 
with this fellow. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
noted with interest that the hon. member for Calgary East, who 
represents the Alliance Party, referred to and visited the WTO, 
and in fact talked with Sergio Marchi at the WTO, who is Canada's 
representative and the former trade minister for the Liberal 
government.  Mr. Marchi, interestingly I think in the context of 
this debate around FTAA, said that we should forget any 
opposition to MAI, the multilateral agreement on investment, 
which had Draconian measures in it, because “the train has 
already left the station”. 
In other words, he said that it is too late, that the MAI was 
going through no matter what and that we should just forget it.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It of course did not.  I suppose the view of the four other 
political parties in this House is that the FTAA is a fait 
accompli, the train has already left the station.  We cannot do 
anything about it anyway so why are we so concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member for Calgary East whether he had a 
chance to ask Sergio Marchi whether the statement made by the 
former director general of the WTO, which has sent shock waves 
through the veins of all people in this world that care about 
democracy, remains the kind of watchword and the driving force of 
the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here of course is that infamous quote “There is a surplus of 
democracy in the world which is interfering with the free 
movement of capital investment.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member for Calgary East indicate whether he had a 
chance to discuss that with Sergio Marchi and whether he is 
concerned about the fact that these trade deals are being 
negotiated under that kind of thinking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank 
the leader of the NDP for asking that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I alluded to in my statement, our ambassador at the WTO, who 
was a former international trade minister, is absolutely 
partisan.  Therefore, he will be holding the views of the 
government and is not over there as an ambassador listening to 
everyone else's views, including the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must understand that the members of the NDP are elected. They 
are in the House and are representing some portion of Canadian 
views that the ambassador should as well be addressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to what the leader has said about the statement 
made by the WTO regarding the democracy issue out there, I would 
say that there are many issues, such as democracy and health care 
issues, that have been brought to the table.  I agree that those 
issues should be discussed and addressed but I disagree with the 
NDP's approach that this should be addressed through the WTO and 
trade tribunals.  That is not where it should be addressed. There 
are other international organizations, such as the ILO and UNEP, 
that should be held accountable to address them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will 
be sharing my time with my colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Bloc on bringing forward, in its first 
opposition day, a motion concerning the Quebec summit so that we 
can deal further with the issues that are very much on the table 
with respect to the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read the motion very carefully and have listened to the 
comments made by members of the Bloc.  I have to say that I think 
the motion is eminently supportable.  It probably reflects the 
absolute bare minimum of the notion of what a democracy should be 
and why it is so reasonable for there to be a responsibility on 
the part of the government to bring it to parliament for full and 
open debate, what its position is on behalf of Canada, to share 
that with Canadians widely and for there to be no possibility of 
signing on to any such deal until there has been that kind of 
input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing that causes some concern but also tells us 
something about where the Bloc really is on the issues of free 
trade and fair trade, is that the final four words of that 
opposition motion, which calls for openness and keeping 
parliamentarians and civil society informed, goes on to say in 
its conclusion “before parliament approves it”, that is, before 
parliament approves the free trade area of the Americas 
agreement. I believe that is probably an honest expression of 
where the Bloc stands.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard with my own ears last week in Quebec City the leader of 
the Bloc saying quite proudly that nobody should question where 
the Bloc stood on NAFTA or the FTAA because if it were not for 
the Bloc we would not have NAFTA in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals were opposed to it, at least they said they were 
until they had the reins of power and then they reversed 
themselves.  And, as the leader of the Bloc said in Quebec last 
week, it was basically the provincial governments of Quebec and 
Alberta that made it possible for the NAFTA to go 
ahead.  One would have to say that they made it possible for the 
Liberals to flipflop on their previous anti-free trade position. 
I guess that is an honest admission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find distressing and puzzling is how members of the Bloc, 
who, to their credit, took a major initiative, for which I 
congratulate them, and brought parliamentarians together from 
throughout the Americas on the eve of the Quebec summit, could 
not understand how flawed the trade agreements are?  How could 
they have met and talked with those parliamentarians from many of 
those other countries in the Americas, go to sessions of the 
people's summit and not understand how fundamentally flawed NAFTA 
and the FTAA are? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now lived with NAFTA for seven years.  What we know for 
a fact from NAFTA is that we cannot take a leap of faith and say 
that it is hoped that people will be better off if they go with 
this trade model.  We know the outcome.  Despite the sort of 
vague notion that the people of Mexico would be better off under 
NAFTA and the FTAA, the reality is that seven years after NAFTA 
three-quarters of the people of Mexico continue to live in 
poverty.  The real wages of workers in that country are lower 
than they ever were.  Unemployment is rising and environmental 
degradation is totally horrifying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all of those conditions, instead of NAFTA doing something 
to assist in raising standards, it has actually had the effect of 
lowering the standards to the absolute bottom of the barrel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Bloc for giving members the opportunity to 
put their positions forward.  I want to say that the New 
Democratic Party takes seriously the commitment that we made when 
we went to the people's summit as a full caucus, all 13 of us, to 
participate in the people's march.  That commitment was that we 
would take the concerns that were expressed in Quebec City at the 
forums and on the streets, and that we would bring them back to 
parliament.  We would continue to push, not for unfettered free 
trade, which is what these trade deals are based on, but for fair 
trade.  We ran our campaign against the FTAA on that very 
concept, fair trade not free trade.  There is a world of 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to put forward very clearly that the our position is not 
one that is anti-trade and pro-protectionism.  It is not a 
position that is anti-internationalism and somehow 
pro-isolationism.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  That 
is why we welcome the opportunity to put our own position 
forward, not to have it distorted and represented by others as 
being somehow anti-trade.  That is ridiculous.  We know that 
trade is a critical part of our economy and that trade is a 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is one that rejects fundamentally the economic 
model under which these trade deals are being negotiated.  It 
rejects fundamentally the notion that we should make subservient 
to trade deals the democratic powers that we need to address the 
fundamental problems, the biggest problems that we face as a 
society and that every nation faces, and that is how to develop 
economies that are based on the notion of sustainability and how 
to develop economies that put trade, commerce and economic 
development at the service of people and that recognizes that 
trade is an instrument to achieve genuine human progress and 
social development.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are absolutely unapologetic and resolute in continuing to 
represent the widely shared concerns that growing numbers of 
people throughout Canada and the hemisphere have about the model 
for trade deals that is being embraced so uncritically by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The estimate of the numbers of people who made it to Quebec 
City, and many more would have been there had the opportunity 
been available to them, is 68,000 people.  The overwhelming 
majority of those people recognize the importance of trade but 
want to see a fundamentally different approach.  They do not want 
to see a model that says, based on the astounding description by 
one of the government members earlier, it is just a deal, that we 
give up a bunch of sovereignty and then hope that things will be 
better.  That is not the price we should pay to enter into a 
trade deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is categorically opposed to what is now contained in 
chapter 11 of NAFTA although it seems to be quite all right with 
the government.  The Prime Minister said earlier this week that 
chapter 11 is working well and that maybe the government would 
look at it and maybe it would not.  It may be in the final FTAA 
agreement as far as the government is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents an unprecedented transfer of power to 
multinational corporations that already have astounding power and 
particularly worrisome astounding amounts of power in developing 
countries.  The poorer countries of America need to be able to 
use democratic instruments to make progress and to raise their 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this has become a discussion about democracy itself. 
One does not give up democratic powers that one needs to deal 
with things as fundamental as acting in the public interest when 
it comes to the environment, health, education and so on.  Our 
party will continue to represent those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me sum up by quoting the Canadian Council for International 
Cooperation:

</I></B></P><P align=left>The world needs new rules to trade by, rules that reflect common 
concerns for the welfare of all the people and the sustainability 
of development and the environment.  We are all impoverished if

Speaker, I thank the member for Halifax for her interesting 
comments.  We are here today discussing the issue of our role as 
parliamentarians in the trade process and I would like to ask the 
member a question, given the fact that she is aware of the work 
that the foreign affairs and international trade standing 
committee has done in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been working on exactly what she says, putting trade in 
the service of people.  Our reports speak of the need to relate 
trade to the environment, to human rights, and to building 
democracy.  All of us in the House are seeking the best way to 
achieve those goals.  It may be that we differ in our direction 
in terms of the specifics but the goals remain the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of criticizing the summit process she should be saying 
that the Quebec summit was the first time that we had an 
opportunity in the Americas to address the very issues that she 
is raising here.  We got a declaration out of there that talks 
about a democracy clause.  We have a plan of action that talks 
about building health in the Americas and of financing it. 
Finally we have concrete proposals that look at issues of labour 
and the environment, and we are getting some real concrete action 
in this regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the member not come forward and say that there is good 
being done?  Why does the member not admit that the government 
has done great things here?  More needs to be done.  It always 
does.  Why do we not get some recognition for the positive steps 
being made? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the members sitting on this side of the House say that 
the government did a remarkable job of bringing together NGOs, 
civil society and parliamentarians to come up with an excellent 
result this time.  Why can we not work together to make that 
result better rather than being critical all the time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Madam Speaker, we accept that 
challenge.  That is why we are working with progressive 
parliamentarians and progressive representatives from civil 
society in Canada and across the hemisphere to look for a better 
approach, to search for a better model and to work together to 
try to achieve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to be very clear regarding some of the things that were 
announced.  Perhaps it was to provide sugar coating, to engage in 
PR, or to pave the way for the FTAA come hell or high water.  I 
did not hear much at the summit about the actual instruments to 
do something about addressing the issues affecting the 
environment or the problems of the growing gap between the rich 
and poor.  I heard a lot of lofty objectives and that is fine. 
However we cannot allow for the provisions of a trade deal to 
strip away the ability of democratic governments to raise 
standards to deal with these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not about lofty objectives and it is not about giving 
corporations rights.  It is clear that is part of the deal.  It 
also has to be about enforceable provisions to deal with the 
things that matter to people most in their daily lives.  People 
sit around the kitchen table and talk about real concerns such as 
their standard of living, their wage levels, their working 
conditions and whether they have clean air and safe water to 
drink.  People are concerned about whether they have education 
and health care for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in the model of free trade being pursued does anything 
to address the issue of ensuring that existing standards remain, 
and that those standards would be raised.  That is why we keep 
looking to the European example and we wish the government would 
pay attention to it.  It is based on a democratic process, 
through a parliament, that sets standards and ensures that trade 
deals do not erode those standards but in fact are based on the 
opposite concept.

problems we have in our society are caused by the opening up of 
markets, something that is happening anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by asking a question of the NPD leader. Did she 
not also conclude from the COPA meeting that parliamentarians, 
while extremely critical of the current process, should co-operate 
with governments in order to influence the choices that will be 
made? Does she agree with such a co-operative approach, even if 
she is extremely critical of the current process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B> Madam Speaker, once again I would like to 
congratulate the Bloc Quebecois for facilitating the debate and 
the discussions among the parliamentarians of the Americas. I 
think it is a very good idea, as well as an important concept of 
co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have to recognize that many of these 
parliamentarians have raised numerous problems with the free 
trade model put forward by the Liberals and by the other 
governments of the Americas. To me, a very important co-operation 
is the one we have embraced, that is the co-operation between the 
progressive forces in the Americas.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to participate in the 
debate today, because as some members will know I was up earlier 
asking questions of members of the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to explore the theme of democracy which we find in the 
motion in terms of trying to set out appropriate process and 
which we find in the ongoing nature of the debate.  The member 
for Toronto Centre—Rosedale just mentioned the democracy clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate today is all about democracy.  The democracy clause 
that was adopted in Quebec City, and which has been put forward 
as such a great accomplishment, is at a certain conceptual level 
a genuine accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing wrong with the United States of America and for 
all the countries of the FTAA area to say that they want all the 
countries who come to the table to be democratically elected. 
But the absence of military dictatorships is not a guarantee in 
itself of authentic democracy.  It is a bit simplistic, while at 
the same time being important, to say if they are not a democracy 
they cannot be at the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our claim is a much different and deeper claim about democracy. 
This is what I would like to try to explain and which other New 
Democrats have tried to explain over and over again.  It is not 
enough to just have elected democratic governments.  Those 
democratic governments must have a full range of choices 
available to them in terms of how they organize their own 
national economies, how they provide services to their citizens 
and what kind of demands they can put on foreign investors who 
are investing in their countries in terms of job performance or 
environmental regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a variety of things that democracies have had at their 
disposal traditionally, which if these free trade agreements are 
adopted, as some have already been, this range of options will 
not be available to these democracies.  We say that is not 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons there is this tolerance for democracy by the 
Americans in Central America and South America now is because 
they have the prospect of free trade agreements and because the 
free trade ideology has been generally accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they used to have to have an authoritarian right wing 
government in order to achieve, they can now do through a free 
trade agreement.  The world is now not safe for democracy, the 
world is now safe from democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can have all the elected democracies we like because these 
free trade agreements have drawn an ideological perimeter around 
what these governments are able to do.  What can they not do? 
They cannot get in the way of the patent rights of giant 
multinational drug manufacturers.  They cannot get in the way of 
the producers of various toxic additives to gasoline.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot get in the way of American media interests that do 
not like the way Canada has subsidized its cultural industries, 
in particular its magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot get in the way of the freedom of multinational 
courier companies to make profits.  In other words, they cannot 
do what Canada has done for years, which is to have a public 
monopoly of the post office and have that public monopoly 
subsidize other activities of that same post office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot get in the way of the ability of multinational 
corporations and others to exploit certain resources, whether 
they be energy or water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all fine and dandy to have democracies, but if these 
democracies have to behave in a certain way, and in a certain way 
only, and if they do not behave in that way they come up against 
sanctions built into the agreements either by virtue of chapter 
11 mechanisms whereby the democracies that do not want to behave 
in an ideologically correct way are sued or they are challenged 
in some other way by the agreements, then what is the point of 
democracy?  What is the point of democracy if the only thing we 
can do is what the corporations want us to do anyway? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose it is better on some level than not having a democracy 
but it is a pretty limited democracy.  That is our point and I 
think the point of so many demonstrators who were in Quebec City 
last weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough just to have elected democracies.  If those 
elected democracies are generally bought and paid for by big 
corporate donors in their respective countries, as is the case in 
this country and so many other places, and if even then they have 
to live by a certain set of rules set down by the corporations 
that are on the inside of the negotiations and have a very 
powerful say in what the trade agreements look like, then what 
kind of democracy is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost a ruse.  It becomes a kind of sham democracy 
because so many of the public policy options which were available 
to governments in the past, and which Canadian governments used 
in the past to build what most Canadians consider very important 
to the country, will not be available to the new democracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public policy options that have been established, which are 
contrary to the ideological correctness built into the 
agreements, subsequently will be whittled away.  They will be 
challenged through chapter 11.  They will be eaten away at 
through various other forms of harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our contention.  I would challenge Liberals to get up 
and say that they think that is okay.  Do they think that the 
threat to these public policy instruments that Liberal 
governments used in the past to regulate foreign investment, 
media and culture and now the emerging threat to our publicly 
owned health care system and our publicly funded education 
system, are acceptable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this really what they call democracy, or does democracy 
really mean having a much greater range of choice when it comes 
to policies than what the free trade agreements will permit when 
they are entrenched and what the ones that are already entrenched 
permit at the moment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear a lot of talk about choice.  My Alliance colleagues are 
always going on about choice, yet they are willing to support 
free trade agreements which almost eliminate choice; choice for 
everyone else except government and choice for everyone else 
except democracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democratically elected governments will have about this much 
room to operate because everything else will be prohibited by the 
free trade agreements.  I do not call that a democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
do not take issue with the hon. member's speech in some respects. 
I appreciate that he has identified some of the frustrations 
around chapter 11 and around recognition of the devolution of 
sovereignty in terms of going to free trade panels or some other 
dispute resolution mechanisms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he has not addressed is the central issue of large 
multinational corporations investing in nations and then having 
the rules, laws and regulations changed after the fact.  This 
could be any corporation or business, large or small, that has 
invested in a nation be it Canada or any other nation in the 
hemisphere.  They recognize there is some vulnerability in this 
investment and some form of legal regime, rules, laws and 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member address the issue of how a capital 
investment, large or small, could be brought into one of these 
agreements whereby there would be some comfort to the investor, 
yet still address some of the issues that he has legitimately 
raised? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a 
good point that goes to the heart of the matter in some ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are being asked to do in Canada is, in the name of 
protecting Canadian investors who are investing in other 
countries and that may run up against the very same public policy 
instruments that Canada has used in the past and in some sense is 
still using them to further the national interest or act in the 
public interest or in the interest of the common good, give up 
those public policy instruments so that Canadian companies will 
not run into those same instruments in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This specifically applies when it comes to GATS and health care. 
ln order to make it possible for multinational health care 
corporations, some of which may be based in Canada, to have 
access to what are essentially private health care systems in 
other countries we are being asked to give up our ability to 
protect our publicly owned health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say there has to be a way to have the rule of law in these 
countries, so that people do not get swindled and have their 
investments disappear overnight by virtue of some government fiat 
or arbitrary change in the rules or whatever.  There has to be a 
way to do that so it does not destroy the ability of a democratic 
country like Canada to employ the kind of public policy 
instruments which we have employed in the past and which we still 
employ.  To me that is a challenge that can be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, under cover of protecting investors' rights in other 
countries we are being subjected to an ideological battle here at 
home whereby a lot of the things that people have always been 
against they are now getting to eliminate under cover of 
protecting investors' rights in some other country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened with interest to my NDP colleague's 
comments, particularly to his reservations regarding democracy. I 
think he has raised very relevant questions in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask a question that might seem off topic, but two years 
ago, in August, I attended the New Democratic Party Convention. 
There I witnessed the adoption of a resolution about democracy, 
recognizing the Quebec people and their right to 
self-determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, I have also seen many of his NDP colleagues, except 
for two, support Bill C-20, a government bill which in fact did 
not recognize the right of the Quebec people to 
self-determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to explain this contradiction. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will make this short and 
sweet.  We have a fundamental disagreement with the member with 
respect to Bill C-20.  We did not think that Bill C-20 violated 
the rights of Quebec to self-determination.  If we thought that 
we would not have voted for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead what we thought it did was set out the process by which 
the Quebec people could in fact separate from Canada in a way 
that was fair both to the people of Quebec and to the rest of the 
people of Canada with whom they had this relationship with for so 
long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us it is a false accusation.  We alone for many years, as a 
political party and long before the Bloc Quebecois came along, 
were defending the right of Quebec to self-determination. 
That does not mean it happens in a vacuum.  It does not mean it 
happens without rules.  It has to happen in a certain way, and 
that was our understanding of what Bill C-20 set out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I 
begin debate, I would like you to know that I am planning to 
share my time with the hon. member for St. John's West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to stand today to speak to the Bloc Quebecois 
opposition motion that the government implement a continuous and 
transparent process by which parliament would be informed of the 
negotiations taking place with respect to the creation of a free 
trade agreement of the Americas, the FTAA, so that 
parliamentarians may debate and civil society may be consulted 
previous to its adoption by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly this is a motion the Progressive Conservative Party 
supports.  I would expect it is a motion that all 
parliamentarians in the House would support.  It calls for an 
open and transparent process in all debate going on around and 
about the FTAA, and it asks that we in this place, as elected 
members of all the regions of Canada, be able to debate this 
issue.  We would have not just a parliamentary committee looking 
at it, but we would actually be able to debate it and bring all 
points to the table.  Everyone would be represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no steel link fence several kilometres long around the 
Parliament of Canada yet, so surely in this place, if nowhere 
else in the country, we can have free and open debate.  Surely in 
this place we should be able to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada fully 
supports the Bloc opposition motion.  The Liberals' transparency 
on trade issues has been completely non-existent in the last few 
years.  The secrecy of the government, along with its avoidance 
of parliament on the issue, illustrates a demoralizing trend, 
which aids and abets the negative view Canadians have of 
government in general and, I would say, aids and abets the groups 
opposed to the free trade of the Americas who were in Quebec 
City, because they do not feel they have enough information 
before them to speak to this issue.  They do not see any format 
or any vehicle through which to express their thoughts, and that 
is the sole responsibility of the Government of Canada.  It has 
not provided an alternative vehicle for opposition to the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should not be any surprise, because the government has 
completely avoided any controversial issue.  It does not have 
open debate.  It does not have parliamentary committees that 
speak to the important issues in this country and that are 
actually able to come up with some concrete agreement among all 
the parties, between the government and all the opposition 
parties, which actually affects the direction the government 
takes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also very much part of another statement.  Where are the 
new ideas from the present Government of Canada?  Where are the 
new ventures?  Where are the bold initiatives that have been 
taken in this country since 1993?  I would challenge the 
government to stand up and name them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a period at the end of my 10 minutes for questions 
and answers, and I would be very happy to hear about the new and 
bold initiatives the government has taken to assure democracy in 
this country, to show what it has done on the trade front and to 
show us examples of where the government has not only shown an 
understanding of the issue but has taken a leadership position on 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec summit ended Sunday with 34 hemispheric leaders 
agreeing to pursue further free trade talks while agreeing to 
co-operate on a host of other issues.  Those are very small 
steps, but I and most members of the Conservative Party think 
those are important steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we need to be better briefed.  Yes, we need to have this 
debate in parliament.  Yes, there are things wrong with the free 
trade agreement which we can stand to take another look at. 
However, those issues are the responsibility of the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the responsibility of an opposition party to continue to 
point them out, which we do on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, 
but it is for the government to respond.  If we cannot get the 
government to move, it is very difficult to formulate new 
positions and for the government to take on new initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask ourselves what was accomplished at the summit of 
the Americas in Quebec City.  There were some small things 
accomplished, but without question the debate here should centre 
around what was not accomplished.  What were Canada's 
expectations going into the summit and what did we get 
accomplished coming out of the summit?  That is a fair question. 
I would like to hear the government tell us what was accomplished 
at the summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was accomplished for P.E.I. farmers?  We know that P.E.I. 
farmers have not been able to ship table potatoes since October. 
This is fairly simple math.  October shipments of potatoes from 
P.E.I. were stopped.  In November there were no shipments, in 
December there were no shipments, in January there were no 
shipments, in February there were no shipments and in March there 
were no shipments.  April will pass and there will be no 
shipments.  It is unbelievable that we can take six or seven 
months out of an economy that is very dependent on the potato 
crop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about the economy of P.E.I.  We have four Liberal 
members of parliament.  Where have they been and what have they 
done to promote the interests of P.E.I. and P.E.I. farmers on the 
potato issue?  The minister of agriculture was not even able to 
get into the summit.  We have asked questions and they have 
been real questions, unlike those of some of the members from the 
government side.  He was not even able to get into the summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade had a meeting with the 
secretary of state responsible for agriculture in the United 
States, but the minister of agriculture for Canada could not get 
security clearance.  That begs another question.  A minister of 
the crown, a minister of the state in this country, cannot get 
into the summit of the Americas held in Quebec City.  I am 
astounded and disgusted.  It is absolutely not acceptable.  It is 
not an acceptable practice on behalf of the government and it is 
not an acceptable practice in regard to the responsibility of the 
minister of agriculture who is in charge of agriculture and 
hopefully in touch with the export problems facing agriculture in 
this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was one issue.  No headway was made on it.  The Prime 
Minister's blatant and ineffectual reference to patates au gratin 
is an insult to P.E.I. potato farmers and to Canadians and 
parliamentarians in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the issue of water?  What discussion occurred on 
water?  The Prime Minister made a reference to water and 
hydroelectric power and said there would be more energy available 
for the United States.  Immediately following the Prime 
Minister's statement, the premier of Newfoundland said it would 
not be happening, that the negotiations had not reached that 
point yet and that there is no agreement with Quebec to transport 
power through Quebec.  This was phenomenal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to softwood lumber, the maritime accord was not 
recognized by the government.  It allowed a five year agreement 
to lapse and did not do any work to prevent the lapse of that 
agreement.  What work the government did do was too little too 
late and ineffectual.  Now we are facing countervail charges 
nationwide, excluding the maritimes.  We are facing anti-dumping 
charges nationwide.  We will see some Canadian mills facing 
anti-dumping charges, with the extreme risk of complete 
bankruptcy.  This is not an issue that the government can afford 
to look the other way on.  This is not an issue that the 
government can say free trade will deal with.  This is an issue 
that we should have been talking about with the Americans two 
years ago.

issues, but that is no excuse for not dealing with the issue. One 
deals with whoever is in power in a democratically elected 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is our agreement on energy?  Where is our agreement on 
water?  What pressure did we put on the United States to meet its 
commitments at Kyoto?  We have a huge and complicated issue on 
free trade of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sharing my time with the hon. member for St. John's West. I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
issued a challenge to our side that I would just love to take up. 
He asked the government side to respond with one thing that the 
government had done to show any leadership in trying to bring 
more transparency to this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Minister for International Trade of Canada who led 
the way in convincing his counterpart ministers from the other 
countries, at Buenos Aires, to agree to release the text.  That 
is leadership.  That is the first answer to his challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada provided $300,000 of taxpayers' money 
to help fund a parallel summit to involve civil society groups to 
create more transparency.  There is more leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has never been a trade deal where there has been greater 
transparency.  I issue a challenge to the hon. member.  I would 
like him to stand in his place and tell us one international 
trade negotiation that Canada has been involved in that has been 
as transparent as the current one.  We will be very interested in 
his specific answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been very wide consultations.  There have been 
hearings with the standing committee on trade.  There have been 
subcommittee hearings.  There was a meeting in this Chamber, at 
which I did not see the hon. member, where the parliamentarians 
of the Americas were here to speak about this trade deal.  I was 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about P.E.I. potatoes and softwood lumber. 
All of those issues were raised by the minister of trade and the 
Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps if the hon. member's leader had been there to support 
the minister and the Prime Minister, he would be aware.  He is 
obviously very ill-informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I am able 
to say this, but I think the hon. member gives hypocrisy a whole 
new meaning.  We have gone beyond what debate in this place is 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you want to look at our leader being there, our critic for 
international trade could not get in.  He asked long ago to be 
allowed into the summit in order to be an observer and to 
participate in the meetings that would be held around the issues. 
He was not allowed in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Why wasn't Joe there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  How much more petty can you guys get? 
You cannot get any more petty than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Answer my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Let me remind hon. members on both 
sides of the House that, first, the question or questions 
have been asked and I will hear the answers, but I want the 
answers to be directed through the Chair, not directly across the 
floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you are absolutely right. 
Through you, I will answer the hon. member's questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was about the Minister for International Trade. The 
only thing I have seen the Minister for International Trade do is 
contradict the Prime Minister.  Then the Prime Minister comes 
back and contradicts the Minister for International Trade. We do 
not know if we have an agreement on water.  We do not know if we 
are going to sign Kyoto.  We do not know if we have a softwood 
lumber agreement.  We do not know if the maritime accord will be 
left out.  The government of this country does not know where it 
is headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the hon. member about transparency.  Transparency 
was a Government of Canada that brought in the free trade 
agreement and that fought an election on it.  Those sitting 
government members fought tooth and nail to the bitter end and 
made a tremendous statement that they would not support free 
trade.  They ran an election on it.  They completely forgot their 
election promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that is about transparency.  That is about going to the 
polls in this country.  That free trade agreement the 
Conservative government brought in is the reason that we have the 
economy we have today.  If we want to look at the benefits of 
that and at the benefits from a Conservative government that 
brought in free trade, let us look at what happened provincially.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw an increase of 65% in exports for Newfoundland.  We saw 
an increase of 445% for P.E.I.  That was before the government 
refused to work on P.E.I. potatoes and bring in an agreement so 
farmers could do the job they do best, that is grow potatoes and 
have a market for them.  We saw an increase of 116% in exports 
for Nova Scotia, 149% for New Brunswick and 209% for Quebec.  I 
could go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the benefits of free trade.  That is democracy in 
place.  That was, without question, a clear and open process that 
we fought an election on in Canada.  The guys who were lucky 
enough to win in that election, who deluded the Canadian public, 
have not kept their promises.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my hon. colleague for sharing his time with me on this 
extremely important topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last Liberal member who spoke indicated his government's 
position on this issue.  Undoubtedly those members are very much 
in favour of the resolution.  He talked about transparency and 
continuous information which he feels the government has been 
giving.  There is no doubt about the fact that the party opposite 
as well as a couple of other parties on this side of the House, 
along with ourselves, will be supporting the resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If all of us think that the government has been doing such a 
wonderful job, why is it that the resolution was brought forth? 
We do have some concerns.  Perhaps in its disillusionment the 
government has lost sight of the fact that what it thinks is 
clear, continuous and transparent is not clear, continuous and 
transparent to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just witnessed a very interesting weekend.  People who 
watched the happenings in Quebec looked at them from two 
different points of view.  Maybe I should say they looked at them 
from three different points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One group looked at the deliberations that were under way among 
the leaders of the various democratic countries in the western 
hemisphere, realizing that if there is agreement in the next four 
to five years for free trade among all the countries all of us 
will benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is not one to decry free trade.  We were the party 
that introduced free trade, as my colleague mentioned, much to 
the chagrin of the present governing party that opposed it to the 
point where it convinced the people of Canada to defeat the Tory 
government and pass the reigns of power over to it because it was 
against free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we all know and history will show what happened when the 
Liberals took over.  It was the same as when they defeated the 
Clark government because they did not agree with the gas tax. 
They failed to say that they did not agree with the amount of tax 
placed on gas.  When they got in power they tripled the amount 
the Tories had suggested.  Consequently they again fooled the 
people but were in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is irrelevant where they stood at the time.  Right now they 
are supporting free trade and pushing for an agreement with more 
countries than we presently deal with.  That is good for us and 
good for my province of Newfoundland.  As the statistics quoted 
by my colleague show, we have benefited greatly from free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sometimes wonder if in pressing for free trade we overlook 
some of its implications.  If we asked government or many of us 
in the House about free trade, we would say that it eliminates a 
lot of barriers and creates a better economy in many of the 
countries involved.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the aim of governments such as ours.  The aim of 
politicians such as us is to try to create a better environment 
in which our people should live, a better environment 
economically but also a better environment socially, 
environmentally and in every other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we dwell on the economic side too much because many of 
the people who are heavily involved in free trade are people who 
benefit directly, the large conglomerates, et cetera.  There is 
nothing wrong with that because these are the people who invest 
and generate dollars that improve the economy generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is government's role to make sure that the economic 
stimulations that occur from trade benefit the other sectors we 
talk about in society.  In Canada we have done very well, even 
though there are pockets throughout the country that certainly 
need more assistance from a social perspective, our health care, 
education and social needs.  This is not because our economy is 
such that we cannot address these needs.  This is because the 
policies of the government opposite, the lack of foresight, and 
the lack of ability and will to address the social concerns allow 
these problems to exist in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the countries that are less well off than we are, where we 
see great social needs, free trade hopefully will generate the 
fiscal capacity of many of these governments to address the 
problems that must be met.  As they speak in the House these 
problems perhaps will be accentuated by members of the NDP who 
are against free trade because they think it is a negative toward 
helping people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is great to be idealistic socially.  It is great to talk 
about all we have to do for our people, but to be able to do 
anything for our people we must have the fiscal ability to be 
able to do so.  In order to spend money on health care, education 
and social problems, social needs, we must generate the dollars 
first.  We must make before we spend unless we do like NDP does 
quite often, which is spend and then let someone else pick up the 
pieces afterward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way we operate and certainly I have to say not 
the way the government is operating.  If in their policies, if in 
their moves toward a free trade state in North America they would 
be open and transparent, all the players could be involved.  We 
could pass along our ideas and suggestions for improvement to the 
government.  They will be talking to the various sectors, not 
only the huge conglomerates, the multinational corporations, but 
to the average person in the country, many of whom have some 
tremendous ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that had happened prior to Quebec we would not have seen what 
we did.  I said there were three different ways of looking at 
what happened in Quebec.  One is the from the business 
perspective.  Another is from the social perspective as the NDP 
and many other concerned groups across the country would look at 
it.  I respect their right to have concerns.  We also had people 
who just saw what nobody wanted to see: people throwing Molotov 
cocktails at police, throwing bricks, throwing chunks of 
pavement, acting disorderly, breaking windows, tearing shutters 
from windows and just making a nuisance of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were far and few between but unfortunately these things 
make the headlines.  These are the things people saw flashed 
around the world.  Canada is known as a tremendous country where 
we live together in peace and harmony and show leadership.  If I 
were outside the country looking at what we saw on television, I 
would be asking if this was Canada, this running from police and 
throwing rocks at police, et cetera.  Let me say again for the 
record that I thought the police did a magnificent job over the 
weekend.

been transparent and awake enough to know that some local issues 
like softwood lumber and potatoes could be addressed at the 
conference if we had the right people there, it would not be 
running at the last minute to try to get the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food through security.  It should have been 
taken care of.  There was a lack of foresight and vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are asking that in the future everything it does 
be transparent and clear so that all of us will know what is 
going on.  If all of us in the country knew what was going on, 
surely if it is good for the country it is good for the people 
and most of us would support it.  We would not need to have a 
fence around our leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Elect me so that you can fence me off because I am afraid of 
you”.  There is something wrong with that picture.  Leaders of 
this country or any country should be able to walk among the 
people they serve, and if the people knew what they stood for 
they would be able to do so.

hopefully in the future we will have learned from the mistakes of 
the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with some interest 
to the member but what I want to do right now is review the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January of this year, 21,000 new jobs resulted from trade. 
Let us look at the emphasis we placed on team Canada missions and 
what that produced.  We have gone from trading and exporting 30% 
up to 43% as a result of the good work of the government, the 
Prime Minister, the Minister for International Trade and the 
whole caucus in terms of where we are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at two years ago. In 1999 there was $36 billion of 
direct investment into Canada as a result of trade.  We are 
proactive and we have signed trade agreements with Pacific rim 
countries, with Central and Latin America, and with places in the 
Middle East.  We are proactive and have the best interests of 
Canada at heart in this very important issue.  This underscores 
the ability of the government to put the economic fundamentals in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member opposite that while we balanced the 
budget the Tories left us with a legacy of a debt of $42 billion. 
When we had unemployment of 6.9%, they had 11.4%.  The debt and 
deficit they left us were outrageous.  There were 37 tax 
increases from 1985 to 1993.  What have we done?  We have reduced 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those tiny Tories opposite are the last to lecture us about how 
to put the economic fundamentals in place.  They are the last to 
lecture us about how to create a vibrant economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it objectionable the way the hon. member talked about 
the leadership somehow not being there and as a result there was 
hooliganism and anarchy.  That is a terrible tie and I will 
explain why.  One cannot make those connections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an obligation to provide peace and order.  We had an 
obligation to protect 34 members and heads of state from around 
the Americas.  We had an obligation to ensure that those kinds of 
measures were taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the member make that kind of tie?  More to the point, 
where was his leader when he should have been there in the 
forefront doing what was best for Canada?  Instead, he was out 
gallivanting around the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must say I am not 
surprised at the type of question from the hon. member because he 
is very supportive of the party in which he sits.  I respect 
that, as he should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people go overboard and the hon. member certainly has.  I 
agree with him that free trade has been very good for the country 
and the world.  The government is continuously taking new 
initiatives, which is good.  However it is so caught up in 
patting itself of the back that it is forgetting what to do with 
the benefits derived from free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concern has been expressed by all the rest of us because 
with leadership we could have the best of both worlds in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me comment on the member's statement about the budget.  I 
remind the hon. member that when the Tories took over from the 
previous Liberal government they were saddled with a huge debt. 
They had two choices.  One was to throw up their hands, ask what 
they could do about it and make cuts to social programs to 
balance the budget.  That was not done.  They made sure social 
programs were not only continued but enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However a plan needed to be put in place to address the deficit. 
What was the plan?  The plan was the hated GST, which the hon. 
member's party campaigned against, won an election on and then 
moved in and took all the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing was free trade, which we are talking about 
here.  The member and his party were against free trade.  Free 
trade and the GST, good Tory policies, generated the profits for 
the Liberal government which helped it balance its budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the other way the Liberals balanced the budget and 
added to the surplus?  They cut the guts out of health, social 
and post-secondary education costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two good Tory policies and one terrible Liberal policy helped 
the government balance its budget.  It is in the black today, 
thanks to the foresight of the Tories.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to take part today in the debate on the motion 
moved by the Bloc and amended by my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. The amended motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government put in place an open and ongoing process to 
keep Parliament informed of negotiations to establish a Free 
Trade Area of the Americas so as to allow parliamentarians to 
debate it and civil society to be consulted before Parliament 
approves it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Prime Minister would have us believe that he is a 
champion of democracy and transparency in America because of his 
democracy clause and his promise to make public the texts of the 
FTAA, he forgets to walk the talk. He should not be surprised 
then if we have serious doubts about his concern for transparency 
and democracy. When he has proven to us that he is a real 
democrat, we will consider taking seriously the transparency and 
democracy that he claims to promote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at a few facts which speak for themselves. The 
Minister for International Trade brags about his government 
obtaining from the countries of the three Americas in Buenos 
Aires a formal commitment to share the texts of the FTAA. We have 
been asking him to do so since January 29, but he always answered 
that Canada could not make the texts public because the other 
countries did not want to. Now, the other countries have agreed, 
but we have yet to see the texts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of what is the minister proud?  Of once again talking, but not 
following up with action?  These people are all talk and no 
action.  We are still waiting for the texts.  Worse yet, we have 
absolutely no guarantee that parliamentarians will receive them 
or be informed of what is going on until it is too late.  We have 
no guarantee whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister tends to forget that 60% of the population is 
not behind him. He continues to govern Canada by polls.  He 
refuses to look at the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, I received an e-mail from a young CEGEP student in 
my riding who was quite simply fed up with the Prime Minister's 
refusal to listen.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Tremblay, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, the people's march against the FTAA 
this weekend was both a success and a failure.  It was a success 
because between 30,000 and 60,000 marchers turned out to say no 
to the FTAA; it was a failure because— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pardon me, but I am reading from the text. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jean Chrétien once again turned a deaf ear. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I simply wish to remind members that they 
may not do indirectly what they would not do directly.  I am 
certain that the member will be able to adapt what she is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> I will therefore amend the text, Mr. 
Speaker.  I am sorry to amend your text, René, but the House 
requires it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will therefore continue: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Prime Minister of Canada once again turned a deaf ear. 
After several people spoke to me about this, I decided to launch 
a petition ...  If the government of the member for 
Saint-Maurice—

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I apologize for amending your text, René. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—is so fond of democracy, it should prove that it is; and if, as 
it says, 54% of Quebecers “somewhat” agree with the FTAA, then 
it should organise its own referendum. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter is from a young man who is not yet 20 years old and 
who is aware of the importance of the ongoing debate about the 
FTAA. For us from Quebec, for us sovereignists, apart from the 
fact that the most important thing is to attain sovereignty, the 
second most important thing is the debate presently going on, 
the negotiations concerning the free trade area, of which we 
would like to be an integral part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister prevents Canadian members of parliament from 
playing a relevant role in the FTAA adoption process. He does 
not want to allow the members of this House to hold a debate, 
with the proper documents, before the agreement is ratified by 
Canada. 
Once again, the Liberal government is preparing to put us in a 
position where we will be wasting our time by allowing us to 
hold a debate about the FTAA only after ratification. Its best 
policy could be summed up this way “Say whatever you want, we 
will do whatever we want”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister does not even want to hear about a referendum 
on the FTAA, while he is one of the least legitimate western 
statesmen, since he was chosen by less than one out of four 
eligible voters. The government has no mandate— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay: </B> Usually, the truth is hard to take, Mr. 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no mandate whatsoever from the people of 
Canada to move forward with the FTAA project. In the last 
election, as was the case in each previous election, its 
platform was set out in its red book, which is getting thinner 
and thinner as time goes by the way. 
The red books have become thinner and thinner with time; there 
are fewer and fewer programs, less and less work in the House 
and more and more international meetings to negotiate a free 
trade area while refusing to involve us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government not have the courage of Brian Mulroney 
who in 1988 called an election to ask Canadians if they wanted 
him to sign the free trade agreement? This government, which 
today is trying to negotiate a free trade area, was against 
Brian Mulroney's proposal. The people were for it, and 
thanks to the people and not to the Liberals, we were able to 
progress. Now, week after week, they are literally reaping the 
benefits of the free trade agreement. They crow over that as if 
it were their doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not have a mandate to negotiate the FTAA, 
it has to obtain one, either by calling an election or by 
organizing a referendum. There are not many ways of going about 
it, unless the new leader of the party could decide otherwise.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our current Prime Minister stubbornly continues to refuse Quebec 
and the other provinces a formal place in the process of 
negotiating and adopting the FTAA, at least within the areas 
under their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat disturbing to learn that the Prime Minister 
described the march as “blah, blah, blah”.  The marchers and 
those who held forums just involved in blah, blah, blah.  It is 
somewhat disturbing to see these peaceful demonstrators dismissed 
in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that is disturbing, in the government statement 
over his signature, is that they want to make more investments in 
order to have better educational policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the government that has, over thirty years, allocated 
the least to education and cut the most from transfer payments to 
the provinces, making the objective of improved educational 
policies difficult to achieve.  It will do this without involving 
Quebec or the provinces, while education is a totally provincial 
jurisdiction, in the main. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this experience of the summit, we have unfortunately been 
given a fine demonstration of the lack of democracy in our 
country.  Where democracy is concerned, if the Prime Minister is 
incapable of demonstrating to us with concrete actions that he is 
a democrat, there being several questions still up in the air in 
this regard, how is he going to keep his promises?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to the points made by my hon. colleague.  She suggested 
that the government has not yet released the text.  That was the 
subject of much discussion in the House of Commons before the 
recent break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade showed great leadership. 
The Prime Minister was on record weeks ago in the House of 
Commons saying he would happily release the text but was not 
prepared to do so unilaterally.  Through the leadership of the 
Minister for International Trade in Buenos Aires we were able to 
secure a full commitment of the 34 leaders to release the text 
shortly after the summit's conclusion.  The summit concluded on 
Sunday.  This is just Tuesday, so perhaps the member could show a 
little more patience.  The text will be released in due course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what polls the member has been looking at.  The 
vast majority of polls in Canada suggest that two-thirds of 
Canadians support our efforts in negotiating the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member says MPs have not been able to participate. 
There has in fact been very wide consultation.  There have been 
hearings at the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade.  There is a special subcommittee on trade. 
Three hundred thousand dollars was given to the parallel summit. 
There were the FIPA meetings of parliamentarians of the Americas, 
including Canada, right here in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says there is no mandate for the government to 
negotiate the FTAA.  Is the member unaware that we had a federal 
election in November?  The FTAA has been in process for several 
years and yet the government was overwhelmingly re-elected.  It 
even increased its seats and support in the province of Quebec, 
an increase we know will continue over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member unaware that the FTAA was not even an issue in the 
election?  The government was re-elected with a very strong 
mandate even though Canadians were fully aware that the FTAA 
talks had been under way for years. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is pretty discouraging 
to hear the hon. member say he listened to my speech.  He 
understood nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should first work on his terminology skills.  I said “We do 
not have the texts.  We want them before, not after, before” . 
That is clear.  We do not have the texts.  He says they will be 
out in a few days.  We have absolutely no interest in the texts 
that come after.  We want those that come before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to know what the government is negotiating on our 
behalf.  We want to express our opinion on the content of the 
negotiations so parliament may give the ministers a mandate, 
since they have no mandate to negotiate from the public.  We are 
the 301 representatives of the people.  The only way to 
legitimize the FTAA negotiating process is to have parliament 
vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no other solutions.  We want the texts ahead of time 
so we can tell the government that we agree with this, but we do 
not agree with that, so it really knows it alone cannot decide in 
secret on behalf of the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government may well have got more seats.  It did not 
even get 40% of the vote across Canada.  It better not try to 
tell us it is representative.  That makes no sense.  The 
government has no mandate to negotiate that.  This was never an 
issue during the election campaign.  There is not a word about 
this in the red book. The government party keeps saying “I got 
elected on the red book.  Everyone will know what it is”.  We 
know one thing about this government and that is it has never 
kept its promises, never. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When negotiations on the free trade area of the Americas began 
in 1994 in Miami, President Clinton decided he would Americanize 
the governments of America.  We are following his plan, and the 
government has no mandate for that.  It is shameful to stand up 
and claim that we are the ones not understanding anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Get with it, Liberals, find out what the words mean. 
Consultation means consult, not inform.  They simply informed the 
governments, they never consulted them.  They have to find a way 
to stop saying that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it will be hard for me to do better than the member for 
Rimouski—Neigette-et-la Mitis, but I will certainly say what I can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I wish to thank and congratulate the member for 
Joliette for his work and particularly for the motion he moved 
today, which all parties said they appreciated the opportunity 
to discuss, particularly just a few days after the Quebec summit 
was over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to remind the House that it was the member for 
Joliette who, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, asked the 
government to hold a take note debate in the House, which we 
were finally granted.  Because of his leadership and initiative, 
there was an opposition day, in the course of which we asked for 
the documents related to the negotiations. 
I also wish to congratulate the member on his involvement in the 
peoples' summit, particularly that portion of it having to do 
with the parliamentarians' summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, this all required teamwork.  Many members of the Bloc 
Quebecois got together.  Each week we met in committee in the 
morning to discuss all of this, to consider all the issues, 
every aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I am most concerned about the human rights aspect, 
since I represent the Bloc Quebecois on the foreign affairs 
sub-committee on human rights.  Because of this special interest, 
I took part in the people's summit and in last Saturday's 
march, for which between 30,000 and 60,000 people turned out, which 
admittedly was for those opposed to the FTAA. 
There were also people in favour of the FTAA, but on certain 
conditions.  I fall into this category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to be against free trade, and I 
find somewhat simplistic the definition given by NDP members, 
who are completely opposed to it and who say that it means trade 
without any constraints.  This is not what anybody wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the purpose of NAFTA, the agreement now in force 
between the United States, Canada and Mexico, is to place 
restrictions on free trade. The best proof of this is that not 
all sectors are subject to free trade.  This is the case for 
shipbuilding and shipping. Personally, I do not agree with this. 
Why?  Because the United States wants to maintain protectionist 
measures for certain sectors of activity.  We are also having 
problems with softwood lumber. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc Quebecois is asking as a minimum is that existing 
free trade provisions in NAFTA be applied to lumber. We are not 
asking the government to negotiate new agreements that would 
weaken the free trade agreement in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the shipbuilding sector, Quebec and Canada are currently 
faced with an almost impossible situation. Some countries work as 
partners and they endorse and respect the OECD's view against 
subsidizing the industry. However, the United States has a 
somewhat different and very protectionist policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be understood that when people are opposed to a free 
trade area, if the existing situation is not changed, that 
situation will prevail. What is the current situation? When each 
country's trade is not free, what is it subjected to? We must ask 
ourselves that question, always keeping human rights in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not exclude from the outset any possibility of 
negotiating a free trade area, because this is indeed an 
opportunity to deal with human rights, along with the 34 
countries involved in this free trade area of the three Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more I read on this issue, the more I realize that a number 
of countries do not respect the declaration of human rights and 
the various conventions on human rights. However we must seize every 
opportunity. These issues should be included in trade 
negotiations with other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take, for instance, the democracy clause with regard to 
Haiti. We saw, during the weekend, that the president of Haiti 
had to answer some questions. He was questioned by other leaders. 
So this is a way to influence him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He apparently has asked for help in order to implement some 
clauses because sometimes, if only in terms of the justice 
system, there is a need for courts. There are costs involved and 
some situations are not easily managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, during the people's summit, representations were 
made to me by the Dominican Republic and Haiti regarding 500,000 
Haitians who presently work in the Dominican Republic but have no 
legal status there. Because these people have no passport nor any 
official document, they have no rights. The only right they have 
is the right to live, but they live in utterly deplorable 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the two countries agree that they must address these 
problems, but there are often economic issues involved. They need 
the financial support of developed countries. We should 
never forget this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government often champions democracy and the 
implementation of international charters. In this regard, I wish 
to mention a meeting between senators and members of parliament, 
which was organized by a committee only five or six weeks ago. 
They discussed the refugees now living in Canada, ten years 
after having obtained their citizenship or having been accepted 
in Canada. Those people have met all the formalities, except the 
requirement for documentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, when people leave their country because of violence, 
massacres or other emergency situations, it is understandable 
that they do not always have the time to bring along a passport. 
This is presently the case for some Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue will possibly lead to amendments to the Immigration 
Act. Some people live in Canada as refugees but have no Canadian 
passport. Therefore, they do not dare leave the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must see to it that this country, namely Canada, does 
correctly what it is asking of other countries. This motion is 
about democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did so many people take part in the march on Saturday? 
Because they wanted to know more. They wanted their 
parliamentarians to be informed of the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as we are debating this motion today, we still do not 
have the texts used in the negotiations. 
We have absolutely no guarantee that any agreement 
will be submitted to parliamentarians, before it 
is ratified. However, in other countries, including our 
neighbour, the United States, things are quite different. The 
U.S. president may not have mentioned it in Quebec City, but he 
said on other occasions that he was not be allowed to fast track 
the process, meaning that he did not have the mandate to 
negotiate as freely as he would have wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we compare that mandate to the one the Prime 
Minister of Canada says he has, the Prime Minister seems to have 
a lot more latitude than the president of the United States. 
People do not realize that. Moreover, the Prime Minister is not 
elected directly by the people, like the president in the United 
States. Despite the shortcomings of the American electoral 
system, which we had the opportunity to see in the last election, 
the U.S. president has a mandate that was given to him directly 
by the people. This is not the case in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I enthusiastically support this motion and I urge the 
Minister for International Trade, who I think is an intelligent 
man to make the texts available to us and to give us the 
assurance that any future agreement will be submitted to the 
Parliament of Canada before it is ratified. He knows the value of 
words and understands what this means.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting 
that the Bloc members have talked about the number of votes the 
Liberal Party has earned in being re-elected federally.  I did 
not hear the same kind of logic from the Bloc Quebecois members 
when Mr. Charest earned more votes in the province of Quebec than 
the péquistes.  However, that is a problem they can face with 
their lack of consistency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member the following questions.  Does he not 
recognize the unbelievable progress that has been made in the 
Americas over the past few years?  Does he not understand that 
had such a meeting been convened of the leaders of the Americas 
some 10 or 15 years ago, we would have had at least half or more 
of the leaders wearing army uniforms with jackboots?  Does he not 
understand the great progress that has been made toward democracy 
in the Americas?  Does he not understand the support the Canadian 
government and the Canadian people are giving toward encouraging 
those fledgling democracies?  Does he not see the great value in 
the democracy clause that all the leaders signed onto in Quebec 
City? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I am willing to 
acknowledge that. However I am having a bit of trouble with the hon. 
member's question, because I think he is confusing me with a 
previous speaker, since I did not talk about the number of votes 
any party got. It was the previous speaker who did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That however makes me wonder about the capacity of the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Trade to 
really listen, since he is confusing what I have just said in my 
speech with what a previous speaker had mentioned earlier on. It 
is doubly troubling since the member for 
Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis was talking about the lack of 
attention and the lack of understanding shown by the 
Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope the minister will have a better understanding of what 
we are saying. It is simple, we want it to be submitted to 
parliament before it is ratified. It cannot be that hard since 
the Americans have found a way to do it. U.S. parliamentarians 
were able to get the texts and the positions of all the parties. 
However in Canada it is not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it incredible that Canada is refusing, for instance, to 
sign or to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Why? Because it is 
following the example of the U.S. government, which has refused 
to do so. I find it strange that the Canadian government follows 
in the steps of the United States when it is wrong, but not 
when it is since U.S. parliamentarians have access to 
these documents, but not us. This is an odd situation.

progress be everywhere in the world and that people enjoy equal 
quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charter of human rights says that it is important to strive 
to have a better redistribution of wealth and access to 
education. However, if words really mean something, once their 
meaning is well understood they have to be acted upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand those who demonstrated in the streets and 
said that everybody was talking about democracy. All the heads of 
state talked about democracy, and I think they talked about it 
more strongly because of the peaceful mobilization of a very 
large number of people calling for more openness. These people 
wish that the civil society and all citizens be as well informed 
as possible. In the age of Internet, let us make all the 
documents available, and not just some of them. Let there be real 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To consult does not mean only to inform, as the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis said, it also means to receive 
advice, to listen and try to implement what is suggested when 
it makes good sense. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank the hon. member 
for Joliette for having used one of opposition days to speak 
about one aspect of international trade. I am very happy to see 
that the Bloc is interested in foreign policy, particularly as 
far as international trade is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want also to thank the hon. member for Joliette for having 
written his motion in such a way that, and I can see it 
clearly, it shows he is supporting the policy of the 
Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we are very conscious of the importance of openness, of 
the consultation of parliament and the provincial governments, of 
industry and, obviously, of the interest and lobby groups, those 
which are called, wrongly I think, the civil society. It is extremely 
important to go in this direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am all the happier that the Bloc has proposed this motion 
because it allows us, once again, to show clearly that Canada is 
the champion of openness. We were the first country to disclose 
the preliminary negotiating position of our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One year ago, we put on the website our position in the 
negotiations. This was a first in the history of international 
trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Canadian position has been the subject of close 
consultation with this parliament, and particularly with members 
of the 
standing committee on foreign affairs and international trade, 
which I have had the opportunity to meet several times and which 
I greatly appreciate working with very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must tell the House that we have the opportunity today to 
recognize the originality of the Canadian voice in the community 
of nations. We have just lived a Quebec summit where the Canadian 
voice has once again demonstrated its leadership by obtaining the 
democracy clause. Thus, we are making a remarkable progress 
towards openness, transparency and consultation, and this is 
thanks mostly to Canada's leadership and diplomacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last year, thousands of Canadians have been visiting the 
Web site to verify the Canadian government's position. Some 
countries have followed the way of transparency that we have 
opened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For months, the opposition has been blaming me for not releasing 
public texts that belonged to all the ministers of the 
hemisphere. We went to Buenos Aires and Canadian diplomacy, 
thanks to the credibility of our foreign policy and to Canada's 
credibility in the hemispheres, has made a historical 
breakthrough. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been able to convince our colleagues that the draft free 
trade agreement should be made public.  The opposition cannot 
believe that we would succeed in making those texts public.  I am 
extremely proud that we have succeeded in what I consider to be 
an historical breakthrough.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This historical breakthrough should have an influence on all 
other trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However another historical breakthrough took place in Buenos Aires. 
We have institutionalized a dialogue with hemispheric interest 
groups and pressure groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know several countries of our hemisphere were saying 
“Each country will take care of its consultations with its own 
civil society”. 
Canada said “No, on the contrary, we will choose 
an approach focused on the hemisphere, the civil society”.  As I 
was saying, I think this expression is false since we are the 
civil society.  There is no better representation of the civil 
society than all of us here in the parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They speak about interest groups and lobbies.  We have chosen 
this consultation and we also obtained the consent of our 
colleagues to institutionalize this dialogue with interest groups 
and lobby groups and we are proud of that. No other country was 
taking the leadership Canada did within the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone said earlier that the provinces were not consulted.  It 
is totally unbelievable.  Every week, every day almost, officials 
of my department or my negotiators communicate with provincial 
officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 5th, before the Buenos Aires meeting, I brought 
together all the provincial ministers of trade.  Quebec was 
represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very beginning of the meeting, the Quebec minister told 
me that Quebec considered the gathering to be an information 
briefing and not a consultation. I replied that the minister 
could be assured that the meeting was meant to be a consultation 
and that any difference of opinion, any perspective on any 
subject he would want to bring to our attention would be most 
welcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We established our agenda and we talked about all the elements 
of the Canadian trade policy and there were very few 
disagreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government agreed so completely with Canadian trade 
policy that the meeting was concluded one hour early. Basically, 
the Quebec government supported Canadian policy on every point, 
on softwood lumber or our current process on the FTAA, so much so 
that they want to take some of the credit for having the 
agreement documents made public. They are trying to say that the 
Canadian government succeeded in Buenos Aires because the Quebec 
government wanted the documents made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can one say that one is not being consulted and, at the same 
time, take credit for some of the success of the Canadian 
government at the ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires and of the 
Prime Minister at the Quebec summit? We have held and are holding 
real consultations at the negotiators level and the ministerial 
level. I am always available to meet with ministers who want to 
draw my attention to particular points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to stand here today and say that the FTAA has 
been subjected to the most comprehensive and extensive 
consultation process ever in free trade negotiations. We are very 
happy with the progress being made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, we realize that citizens are increasingly interested 
in international trade. 
I see it as an opportunity, not as a threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have nothing to hide. On the contrary, we wish to have in 
depth debates and discussions because, in the end, they will 
contribute to improving the agreements we reach. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian leadership, both in Quebec City and in Buenos 
Aires, was wonderful.  I do not know how many ministers, heads of 
governments and heads of state told me how pleased they were to 
see Canada as part of the Americas.  They said that it has been 
far too long since Canada was involved in the Americas. Now they 
were hearing the Canadian voice and they were respecting it.  It 
was because of the Canadian leadership toward transparency that 
they were trusting our instincts and they would consent to what 
Canada was proposing regarding transparency.

the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very glad that the hon. member for Joliette assured us

These are already values of the Canadian government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to inform the House that we are pleased to 
support the motion, although we cannot support the amendment. 
The government will not abandon its responsibility to negotiate 
and conclude treaties in the best interest of all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support the main motion because we are profoundly 
committed to consultation, we respect parliament and we are 
interested in knowing what parliament and the parliamentary 
committee want, which is close consultations on an extremely 
important subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I honestly think that the motion by the hon. member for Joliette 
is an opportunity to celebrate the great progress the American 
hemisphere has made under Canadian leadership, progress that will 
also impact on the other trade negotiations at the WTO. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to tell the Minister for International Trade that I am pleased we 
are able to start debating this whole matter today.  We are 
always focussing just on the process and I am anxious to see us 
touch on substantive issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the opposition has not waited for government 
permission to call for the texts to be made public, as hon. 
members will recall.  I believe the Minister for International 
Trade was surprised by his colleagues' response, the proof being 
that the French translation of the texts was not available.  If 
the federal government had really thought the response would be 
positive, it would have started getting its texts translated 
before receiving the response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been interested in the debates on the free trade area of 
the Americas for 15 years now.  I have seen that the process has 
in fact become increasingly transparent as the result of social 
pressure, pressures from parliaments and parliamentarians. As far 
as the free trade agreement with the United States was 
concerned, and that was a relatively non-transparent 
negotiation, there was no desire to address trade issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When NAFTA was negotiated, there was a little more openness, but 
not a lot.  It was the American government, at the urging of 
President Clinton, that finally forced Canada and Mexico to have 
two parallel agreements on the environment and on labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are at another stage, the free trade area of the 
Americas.  I willingly admit that there has been some progress as 
far as transparency is concerned, but not enough.  It seems to me 
that we have reached the stage where parliamentarians need to be 
involved on an ongoing basis, and to have the opportunity to give 
their approval of any potential free trade area of the Americas 
agreement before government ratification of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could very easily work this way: the government signs an 
agreement, submits it to the House, which holds a debate on it, 
the House approves it and then the executive ratifies it.  That 
is the way it is done in Great Britain and in Australia, and how 
it will also be done in the Quebec national assembly.  The 
premier of Quebec has in fact announced that the national 
assembly would vote on the agreement before the government signs 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have got to this stage and I would have liked to 
have seen the government party support the amendment, which seems 
to me to be the stage we have reached at this time, as far as 
transparency and democracy in Canada and in Quebec are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that the hon. 
member for Joliette has taken an interest in this issue for a 
long time. In fact, we can feel his influence on the Bloc 
Quebecois, which has traditionally been supportive of free trade 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois and the PQ in Quebec have generally been 
supportive of trade liberalization. The hon. member's influence 
is such that since his election to this House, there has been a 
complete distrust of what we are trying to accomplish in 
international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the head office, the boss, the Quebec 
government is trying to do, being supportive of free trade— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B> I hear the member for Quebec, who is also 
extremely suspicious of trade. They always have a problem with 
the improvements that we are trying to bring about to liberalize 
trade.

international trade issues. Our economy has made tremendous 
progress since we signed the free trade agreement with the 
United States and Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that it is not the U.S. presidency that 
changed Canada's approach on NAFTA and produced two side 
agreements on labour standards and the environment. These 
changes occurred because there was, at the same time, a change 
of Government in Canada. 
It is when the Liberal Party took office in 1993, at the same 
time that Mr. Clinton became president of the United States, 
that we, as a government, chose to add side agreements to NAFTA. 
We are the ones who took the initiative of proposing an 
improvement to what had been negotiated by the previous 
government. We are the ones who negotiated with Chile side 
agreements similar to those that we developed for the free trade 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that yesterday morning, when I signed the 
bilateral free trade agreement with Costa Rica, my colleagues, 
the Minister of Labour and the Minister of the Environment, also 
signed side agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is from this side that leadership and innovation in 
international trade made its way to Buenos Aires. 
Any minister who took part in the meeting in Buenos Aires will 
confirm that had it not been for Canada's leadership the texts 
of the preliminary agreement would not be in the process of 
being released.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the minister talking about 
transparency and how open his government has been.  I can tell 
the House that when he talks about transparency it is 
restricted to government officials and ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just returned from Geneva where there are many issues 
dealing with labour.  Why is his government not tackling those 
issues by getting the Minister of Labour and the Minister of the 
Environment involved in order to open the process so that we do 
not have the protests that we had in Quebec City and in Seattle? 
Those protests symbolized that transparency is not there despite 
what he is saying.  Would the minister please comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the people who came 
to demonstrate in Quebec City or who demonstrated in Seattle did 
not do so because there was no transparency.  They came because 
they did not like what we were trying to do.  They were opposed 
to trade liberalization and the sort of improvements that we were 
trying to make to the international trade system.  I find that 
very unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard President Fox of Mexico, President Lagos of Chile and 
other leaders of smaller economies tell us that what they needed 
was trade and access to our markets.  That is development that 
will help them strengthen their democracies.  I beg those who 
object with what we are trying to do to pay attention. We will 
pay a great deal of attention to what they have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met with many round table pressure groups but they should 
also listen to what 33 leaders of the Americas have come to tell 
us.  They have said to give them trade. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I congratulate the minister who has shown tremendous leadership 
in taking Canada down an inevitable path that we must seriously 
explore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine our country having any kind of serious negotiations with 
33 other countries and not having some form of protest.  I cannot 
imagine it.  It is what makes Canada the most democratic and 
freest country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was much noise made by people who were opposed to free 
trade about the security fence that was put up around the 
perimeter.  Imagine the scenario if that particular defensive 
action was not undertaken by our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall when some students in Vancouver, who broke through at 
the APEC conference, were pepper sprayed.  That led to a 
multimillion dollar inquiry into how the RCMP behaved and acted. 
There were all kinds of legal fees, allegations, 
counterallegations and charges. 
It was because some students had broken through a fence, perhaps 
not the same kind of fence as in Quebec City, in a violent way to 
try to force their views on the security people.  It was not 
tolerated and the actions led to an inquiry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What would have happened in Quebec City?  We know that some 
people were arrested because they were carrying explosive devices 
and potential means of destruction into the country.  Those 
weapons were confiscated.  We saw it on television.  What would 
have happened if there was not the level of security and those 
people had come through and somehow managed to detonate an 
explosive device and perhaps seriously injure, maim or even kill 
some of the participants? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member opposite in the House would be on their feet 
screaming indignation, calling for the government to resign, 
calling for the people involved in security, the solicitor 
general and others to resign their seat because they were unable 
to provide the necessary security for an international meeting to 
take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians would agree that the images we saw were not what we 
expect to see in a Canadian city at any given time.  The reality 
is that we live in a world that is full of people who would 
purport to put their views forward using means that are 
unacceptable to the vast majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to speak about that vast majority in terms of the 
demonstrators.  Most of the demonstrators were there to 
peacefully put their viewpoints across.  They held a very 
successful people's summit.  I take some exception with that, but 
that is all right.  I do not have a problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They put their counterviews on the table and they discussed 
them.  They passed resolutions and developed strategies.  There 
were people from the labour movement who were concerned about 
labour standards.  There were people from the civil society who 
were concerned about sovereignty, culture and protection of our 
natural resources.  The government does not have a problem with 
any of those issues being put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the protesters drove the agenda with some 
success.  I am not convinced that six months ago when the 
planning began for this conference the first and most significant 
clause to come out of Quebec City would have been the democracy 
clause.  The engagement of the public has led the leaders of all 
those countries to decide that a common bond, a common principle 
of any agreement on free trade must include an adherence to the 
democratic principles that Canadians hold so dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means is elections.  That is why Cuba was not invited 
or allowed to participate.  Anyone who has been to Cuba would 
realize that the people, on the surface, seem to have everything 
that they need.  They seem to have their health care and their 
education provided for.  They seem to have certain basic things 
like food and shelter.  However, in Cuba they do not have the 
most fundamental basic human right, that is the right to dissent, 
the right to demonstrate, the right to hold a differing opinion, 
and the right to express that opinion.  It is clear that in terms 
of this agreement, with the democracy clause, that they simply 
cannot be part of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues that will be looked at is the situation in 
Haiti.  There will be a group travelling to Port-au-Prince to 
meet with government officials to ensure that true democracy and 
not some kind of military dominance is in place in Haiti. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The countries that are signatories to this agreement, and I do 
not know of any other agreement where this kind of a clause has 
been put in place, will have the right to expel a particular 
country from membership and disallow it from taking part in the 
particular benefits of free trade if in fact it violates the 
democracy clause. 
What we see could only occur in Canada.  We need to deal with 
the possibilities if we can.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Burnaby—Douglas claims he was shot by a rubber 
bullet, although he is not sure, but he and the leader of the NDP 
want to force an inquiry.  These are mere tactics in an attempt 
to derail and stop the progress of negotiating a free trade 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would benefit if we were to expand our markets?  This 
country has done remarkably well.  Our next census will show our 
population to be somewhere around 31 million people.  If we 
compare that to our neighbour to the south, which has 10 times 
our population and the clout and economic ability to trade, it is 
quite remarkable that our growth rate is higher than the United 
States, 2.4% versus 1.7%.  Our inflation rate is lower, our 
unemployment rate is comparable and our economy is very strong on 
its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could we do that if we were to shrink wrap our borders and 
shrink wrap this country?  I do not think we could.  However, 
should we be looking at other markets?  Do we want to tie 
ourselves to the will of the United States when the economy does 
take a downturn or do we want to have alternatives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that our sovereignty is protected.  I have no 
doubt about that.  Every member in this place would agree with 
that.  We want to ensure that our natural resources and renewable 
resources are protected and, where feasible, are marketed where 
opportunities arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the motion put on the floor by the Bloc is to 
ensure that there is transparency in the negotiations.  Many of 
the meetings were on television.  The media had complete access 
and the people's summit had terrific input into the process that 
went on.  The transparency is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we are on our feet today is another example of how 
parliament can play a role in shaping the future.  We should work 
with the minister and the government to ensure that we negotiate 
a free trade agreement of the Americas that will not only benefit 
Canada but benefit many of the poorer countries that could use 
assistance in terms of science and technology, our exports, our 
expertise and our capabilities, and that could perhaps use some 
help in the area of democratization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on the edge of a tremendous opportunity to expand the 
horizons of this country.  Instead of dwelling on the negative, 
the demonstrators and the rock throwers, we should acknowledge 
the fact that there is healthy dissent.  It is truly Canadian and 
the Canadian way to negotiate.  This is an opportunity we should 
seize.  We should move forward and develop an agreement with the 
Americas that makes sense for the prosperity of this entire 
hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that with the leadership of the minister and the 
Prime Minister, and the work of all the people involved, we will 
indeed have an agreement for which our children will say well 
done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is always interesting to listen to the member from 
Mississauga.  There are times when I do not agree with him but 
this time, concerning the benefits of the FTAA, I have no problem 
agreeing with him.  The benefits of the FTAA, if handled 
properly, will bring prosperity.  However, if it is not handled 
properly, it will raise doubts and create the same thing that we 
had with the MAI.  The government's inability to communicate the 
benefits of the MAI resulted in its failure. 
If the government continues on that path and does not allow more 
transparency in the FTAA we may face the same problem, which 
would be detrimental to our country and to prosperity in the 
hemisphere.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been voices out there in Quebec City.  The minister 
rightly responded that a number of people there were totally 
opposed to the FTAA and not to the transparency of the system.  I 
agree with him in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point is that a lot of protesters said that they 
wanted to ensure that prosperity was spread globally and that 
they had a voice in the process.  The member said that parliament 
has been discussing this, but if it were really discussing the 
issue there would not be so much protest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not think it important that the final draft 
of the FTAA be brought into parliament for an open debate and 
ratification by parliamentarians?   Would he not agree to that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member earlier 
expressed an odd concern for a member of the Alliance Party, a 
concern one would sooner expect to hear from the NDP.  He asked 
about labour standards and how they might be applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could anyone in this place suggest that we impose our labour 
standards unilaterally or even bilaterally on countries within 
the free trade zone of the Americas?  How can we ensure that 
labour standards regarding health and safety, minimum wage, 
procurement, fair wage and other issues are brought to bear in 
the countries with which we are negotiating if we do not 
negotiate with them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have too many cooks in the kitchen or we will spoil 
the broth.  We all know that.  There is a job to be done.  The 
negotiating team has work to do.  The leaders of the countries 
have started the ball rolling with the meetings in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we should work toward standardized labour protection in 
these countries.  However, any member here who has travelled 
through the Americas knows that the labour conditions in many of 
the countries, notwithstanding the democracy clause that was 
passed, are atrocious and unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must work on a continual basis with these countries to show 
them the benefits of having a high quality, highly paid and 
highly skilled labour force.  We can achieve this through 
negotiation and education.  The FTAA is just one of many tools 
that can ensure prosperity is spread throughout the Americas.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am looking 
forward to taking part in this debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It holds a particular interest for me, as the member for Quebec, 
the riding which hosted the summit of the Americas, as well as 
the people's summit. There has been much discussion about 
violence and tear gas, but today let us come back to the 
discussion by the entire spectrum of civil society, by these 
groups speaking for civil society, on the impact of the FTAA on 
people's daily life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discussion started a long time ago and resulted in the 
resolutions and the strong commitments made by the groups 
representing civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I wish to congratulate the organizers of the people's 
summit on the quality of the contributions made by ordinary 
people on education, labour, agriculture, communications, human 
rights, environment, health and the status of women. What would 
the impact of the FTAA be on all these areas, if it were 
concluded, as there is every indication it will be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These working groups noted the ever increasing gap between the 
rich and the poor.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue very close to my heart since I have worked on 
EI reform. We are aware of the gap between the rich and the 
poor. When businesses and plants close down and workers can no 
longer rely on insurance benefits to get the money they need 
between jobs, they can quickly and easily be forced into various 
levels of poverty and even utter poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear the Minister for International Trade say that he is 
very happy, very glad and very pleased, I cannot help but 
remember that he said the exact same thing when asked 
about the concerns raised by the EI reform. The minister is now 
sitting at the FTAA negotiating table and is saying that he 
is very confident and also glad to be able to meet with the 
public and various interest groups and to listen to them. However 
is 
there not a difference between listening to the people and 
following up on their concerns? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is very active on this issue and we have 
brought forward many motions in the House and also in the 
various committees dealing with the free trade area of the 
Americas. Today, what we are trying to do is to move the debate 
forward a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the summit of the Americas, our colleague from Joliette 
proposed a motion to allow us to talk about what is at stake in 
these negotiations and to ensure greater transparency. We know 
what came out of that: nothing. It was too late, the texts could 
not be made available and they could not be translated into all 
the required languages. We cannot say it was a very 
transparent exercise, especially after learning, because of an 
open microphone, that certain clauses of particular interest to 
the opposition parties, in this case the Bloc Quebecois, and to 
civil society would be included in this FTAA agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I am more concerned when I see the minister rejoice 
and say, as he always does, that everything is fine. 
In this motion, we are calling on the government to allow 
parliamentarians to debate this process and to allow civil 
society to be consulted not after an agreement has been signed, 
but before ratification is approved by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concern and this desire were also expressed at the people's 
summit, during the plenary session of the last conference. It 
was requested that people be informed of all the issues related 
to the free trade area of the Americas and of the impact it 
could have on our lives if, for example, we adopted chapter 11, 
which gives businesses a special charter that would allow them 
to sue governments for loss of profits because these governments 
have put in place standards and safeguards in all areas, social, 
environmental, cultural and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this is why the Bloc Quebecois is concerned about how things 
are going and will act as watchdog so the people will know just 
what exactly is happening in the negotiations on the free trade 
area of the Americas.  We know that this weekend nothing was 
signed.  However in the coming years there will be a whole process 
where things will be thought out.  We will therefore act as 
intermediary between public concerns and what is being concocted 
often behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about globalization with certain people, they say 
“Yes, there are political aspects to globalization.  It means 
openness to the world, much better prices, the expansion of 
businesses and the export of goods and services”.  When we talk 
to them about the real issues of the free trade area of the 
Americas, we are a little more reserved about the first 
interpretation of globalization.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we point out all the aspects of the free trade area of the 
Americas, including chapter 11, and some of the changes it could 
mean in the case of job security, for example, it makes them 
think.  They wondered if it would bother certain businesses to 
have a government adopt labour or environmental standards or 
social conditions, because businesses' profits would be reduced 
in such cases.  When people are faced with this sort of 
provision, they say “That could penalize us too and even lead to 
exclusion, impoverishment, a greater gap between the rich and 
the poor, a loss of gains, manipulation and especially to a loss 
of control and of choice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is therefore a double standard.  When all the stakes are 
made clear, other questions come to mind.  They are also worried 
when we tell them, for instance, why groups representing civil 
society were not invited to make their concerns known to the 34 
heads of state.  They are worried when we tell them, for 
instance, that the forum of business people can, however, be 
heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another irritant, a second obstacle, is the manner in which all 
the discussions can be interpreted.  When it is said that the 
same people are both judge and judged, when one owns a business 
one will definitely look out for one's own interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Groups, civil society and elected representatives who are 
accountable to the public are also worried when, for example, 
there is a desire to create this link with civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the gap between the rich and the poor was one 
of the first observations of the people's summit. 
We are therefore concerned that there would be a charter for 
businesses setting out their right to set up operations in 
certain locations.  For instance, we were told that because a 
business had been unable to expand as much as it would have 
liked in Mexico, it sued the government for lost profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where will all this lead?  We are right to be concerned. 
Instead of saying that everything is fine and that we are very 
enthusiastic, we must look carefully at where we are headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people's summit was a reflection on our future, and there 
are many possible solutions.  One of the most 
interesting things about the people's summit being held in 
Quebec City is that all Quebecers felt concerned. 
Social groups had an opportunity to speak with the public and 
made known their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore hope the motion moved today by the member for 
Joliette will be adopted, as amended.  I hope there will be 
support for our request that there be official ratification by 
the government, authorized by parliament, and that the public be 
consulted before this official ratification by parliament, by 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elected representatives must take note, because we are 
accountable to the public for decisions taken by the government, 
particularly when it comes to something as precious as people's 
quality of life, because the FTAA is very much tied up with that 
quality of life.

the Regions of Quebec announced a total of $1.1 million in 
Government of Canada funding to Quebec's mining industry,

“From Ore to Metal”.

compel the television stations to increase their Canadian

changed drastically with the Prime Minister stating that this 
chapter is working well.

agreement on a free trade area of the three Americas? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
chapter 11 is currently in effect. It has been for seven years. 
We are living with it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, it is being reviewed on an ongoing basis to see if it 
could be improved on. Clearly, there will be discussions on this 
chapter in the years to come, since the other countries that 
want to join Canada and Mexico will see the impact of this 
chapter on their economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the level of trade that we have had, chapter 11 has 
been used only a few times and so far the outcome has 
been quite positive for Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is confusing, to say the least. The Minister for International 
Trade told us that he was in disagreement with chapter 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, the Prime Minister told us that this chapter was working 
well, that he was in agreement with it. Now, the Minister for 
International Trade has changed his tune and claims to be in 
agreement with the Prime Minister, while adding that the 
government has not yet taken a position. Meanwhile, his 
department's Internet site states that chapter 11 must not be 
replicated in the FTAA.

one?

now under way and those that might yet be brought under chapter 
11 of the NAFTA agreement could exceed $2 billion.  Clearly, this 
is no small affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister and his government be so 
irresponsible as not to have a clear position on something as 
basic, both for NAFTA and for the FTAA, as chapter 11, when what 
is at stake is the very ability of governments to legislate for 
the common good?

against free trade, when its head office in Quebec City is still 
in favour of it.

with free trade but, as the Minister for International Trade 
said, there is a problem with chapter 11.  He admitted it 
himself. The Prime Minister says the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government's position?  In the face of such an 
important threat, should the Prime Minister not clarify his 
position and tell us whether chapter 11 poses a problem for 
Canadians and Quebecers in the context of NAFTA today?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade,

chapter 11 is working reasonably well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again last week, we won the Pope & Talbot case, and we did so 
without a hitch.  NAFTA provides mechanisms which allow us to 
have an ongoing dialogue with our partners and to continue to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday and again this afternoon, the trade minister confirmed 
the government's flip flop on its commitment not to sign on to 
any more trade deals that put corporate rights ahead of citizens' 
rights.  The Prime Minister confirmed the same a few minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The promise was to get rid of chapter 11 in NAFTA and not sign 
on to any other trade deals that repeat the same mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  Why has the government 
changed its position? 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have not changed our position.  We have signed an 
agreement on chapter 11.  We have explained that when there is 
$1.3 billion of trade on a daily basis in American dollars with 
the United States, the number of cases under chapter 11 is not 
extravagant.  In most cases the government has won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will always look at it and improve it if it is in the 
interest of all partners to do so, but chapter 11 has been there 
for the past seven years.  At this moment there is no likelihood 
that it will be changed within the next few months.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, no 
amount of self-congratulations or blah, blah, blah by the Prime 
Minister will change the fact that the government has flip-flopped 
on a very specific commitment it made to get rid of 
chapter 11 in NAFTA and not repeat the mistake.  Yesterday the 
Prime Minister repeated exactly that mistake further entrenching 
the chapter 11 NAFTA provision in the latest deal signed with 
Costa Rica.

it has been in operation for seven years.  As the minister said 
earlier, it has been very good for Canada. It has helped Canada 
to create more than 2.1 million jobs since 1994.  It is certainly 
not a bad deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did all the other leaders want to do over the weekend? They 
just wanted to join us in what we are doing with the Americans

there will be a better chance to redistribute the wealth.

quotas by issuing supplemental dairy import permits, losses that 
equate to 70 Canadian dairy farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why were supplemental permits issued to allow U.S. producers to

we give supplementary quotas, it is very often because there are 
consumers in Canada who ask for a specific product that they 
need.  I will review the situation and review the way we allocate 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reclassification the United States has done is for cheese

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—FREE TRADE AREA OF THE AMERICAS 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on the motion moved by my colleague in 
the House of Commons— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise a point of order. 
I would not want you to interpret my point of order as a desire 
to challenge your authority, but it is aimed at allowing our 
colleague of Rosemont—Petite-Patrie to make a speech in minimum 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could you maintain order in the House or suspend the sitting for 
a few minutes, because it is impossible for us, even in the 
front row, to hear what my colleague of Rosemont—Petite-Patrie is 
saying? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I was able to hear what the hon. member for 
Rosemont—Petite-Patrie was saying. That is why I did not interrupt 
the conversations in the House. However, I hope that all the 
hon. members who have something to say, and who are not taking 
part in the debate, will continue their conversations outside 
the House as of now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague 
for his intervention, because even I was having trouble hearing 
what I was saying. So many people on both sides of the House 
were talking that I could hardly express the views and the 
principles I wanted to bring forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to rise in the House to speak to the motion put 
forward by my hon. colleague from Joliette, on behalf of the 
Bloc Quebecois, the government to “put in place an 
open and ongoing process to keep parliament informed of 
negotiations to establish a free trade area of the Americas so 
as to allow parliamentarians to debate it and civil society to 
be consulted before parliament approves it”. 
Of course, I also support the amendment moved by the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we asking today for a more open negotiating process to 
establish a free trade area of the Americas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many different reasons, because it is quite normal to hope 
that our fellow citizens and non-governmental organizations will 
be able to take part in the debate that will help us reach in 
the future, somewhere around 2005 according to what was agreed 
upon during the weekend, a free trade deal with a human touch, 
which will reflect a number of the fundamental principles of our 
modern societies as well as the consensus developed here, in 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal mainly with the importance of protecting the 
environment in the context of globalization, free market and free 
trade, and also of protecting the environment when it comes to 
the creation of the free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should think back to the period when NAFTA was negotiated and 
signed. At the time, it was described as one of the greener 
international trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental clauses in NAFTA were the result of the 
perseverance, involvement and determination of non-governmental 
organizations to include a number of clauses to protect the 
environment. We should recall that back in 1993 NAFTA did 
include a number of environmental principles and clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, at the face of the preamble of NAFTA, there is a bias 
in favour of sustainable development, environmental protection 
and compliance with environmental standards and regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NAFTA preamble was clearly pro-environment, and that in 
itself is significant. 
Had these principles been stated in an environmental agreement, 
it would have been understandable, but they were stated in a 
trade agreement. It was a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFTA contained a number of provisions including one that said 
environmental standards had to be higher than those recommended 
by international environmental organizations. This makes it 
possible for a signatory state that wants to raise its 
environmental standards above and beyond what had been agreed to 
internationally to do so. That was very clearly stated in the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect was the fact that under NAFTA there would be no 
lowering of environmental standards to attract investors and 
investments. 
Why is that? There was a provision preventing a signatory 
country from creating, through this free trade agreement, what 
was called a polluter's paradise, from lowering its 
environmental standards to attract investors. That was clearly 
stated in the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, all that added to the North American Agreement on 
Environmental Cooperation, which created the Commission for 
Environmental Cooperation, was the culmination of environmental 
cooperation between Canada, the United States and Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFTA has obvious flaws. We talked about chapter 11, and we must 
keep talking about it. The Prime Minister and the Minister for 
International Trade were telling us today that there were very 
few challenges under chapter 11 of NAFTA, that it is all in the 
opposition's head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From an environmental standpoint, it is totally false. Let us 
consider what happened with Sun Belt Water Inc. This California 
based company sued the government of British Columbia because it 
would not allow it to export bulk water from Canada. The Prime 
Minister and the Minister for International Trade were telling 
us that there were no problems, but that was one.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another case in point concerns Ethyl Corporation, a company that 
got $30 billion in compensation because the federal government 
wanted to pass here, in this House, a bill banning the use of a 
gasoline additive called MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not an act that the company was challenging, but rather a 
bill that was brought before us, the parliamentarians, but had 
yet to be passed in the House when it was challenged in court. 
The company received $30 billion in compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that the chapter 11 investor-state dispute mechanism 
is not a problem. Quite the opposite, since the situation with 
the Ethyl Corporation has clearly shown that our law making 
authority, as parliamentarians, could be limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was not clear on the issue. Are we shoving chapter 
11 aside? Do we really want to protect the environment? The 
government will have to answer those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the summit in Quebec City, we would have liked to see the 
government make a firm commitment on three or four environmental 
issues. We would have been pleased with that. First, 
regarding the environment, that the federal government would not 
accept anything less that what was agreed upon in NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Minister for International Trade take all the necessary 
steps to assure the House that the Quebec and Canadian 
environmental legislation will not be challenged in court by 
large corporations, as was done under the North American Free 
Trade Agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, the Bloc Quebecois wants to ensure that 
there are provisions preventing large companies from challenging 
the environmental legislation in court. How ironic that we, in 
the opposition, are the ones who want to protect the Canadian 
environmental legislation. The environment minister is letting 
the international trade minister negotiate an agreement that does 
not only deal with trade, but also with the environment and 
public health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also would like to have the international agreements on the 
environment, the Basel convention and the Montreal protocol on 
the ozone layer be honoured in the free trade area of the 
Americas and in the agreement likely to be signed in 2005.  We 
will not ask the Government of Canada to have the Kyoto protocol 
honoured.  I think that would be a bit much to ask of it, since 
it did not even deign to ratify it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, this is what we expected from this government. 
Of course, the government decided to exclude the Minister of the 
Environment from discussions.  I could talk about this for a long 
time yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what we might have wished from the Minister of 
the Environment, a few weeks away from the summit of the 
Americas, was a reiteration before the 34 environment ministers 
in Montreal of his intention to honour the Kyoto protocol.  In 
meeting with the 34 environment ministers, he refused to sign the 
Montreal declaration on climate change.  That says a mouthful 
about where we are going in terms of negotiations in 2005 for the 
free trade area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be watching and will make sure, in the coming weeks and 
months, that the North American Free Trade Agreement, and 
especially the free trade area of the Americas, contain 
provisions on the environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully 
to the comments of my colleague opposite.  Unfortunately, I am 
not sure he listened very carefully to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has mistakenly quoted the Prime Minister as 
saying that there are no problems with chapter 11.  The Prime 
Minister did not say that.  The Prime Minister said that the 
chapter has worked relatively well but that in a trade 
relationship with the U.S., which totals $1.3 billion daily, 
there are bound to be irritants and rough spots.  The Prime 
Minister did not say there were no problems.  He said that the 
chapter was working relatively well given the size of the 
relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Minister for International Trade has said repeatedly, 
and he has been crystal clear on this, is that we need to protect 
investment.  He said that was very important but that some 
rulings by dispute panels had gone beyond the scope of the 
original signers of the NAFTA.  He said that we needed a chapter 
like chapter 11 but that it needed clarification and tightening 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe in the necessity of protecting 
investment?  Does he not see that without some protection for 
investment such a treaty will likely bring very few benefits to 
any of the participating countries? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, this government says that 
“Chapter 11 works relatively well. There are only minor 
problems”. Need I remind the parliamentary secretary that 
chapter 11 deals with relations between businesses and the 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the parliamentary secretary accepts that, under this chapter, 
the legislation of his government can be legally challenged, it 
says a lot about who will protect this trade agreement. The 
comments made by the parliamentary secretary are totally 
unacceptable and only seek to protect investors, at the expense 
of people's health and of their environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the parliamentary secretary thinks there is no problem with 
the fact that the Canadian legislation can be legally challenged, 
fine. Personally, I do not think he is in the right place. He 
should go back to the private sector, because we are here to pass 
laws that will not be legally challenged by major companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the parliamentary secretary believes what he just said, let 
him go back to the private sector, because the House of Commons 
is not where he should be. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member is going 
to make personal comments and give me gratuitous advice about 
where I should go, he ought to do some research and know that I 
do not come from a business background.  The hon. member again 
shows quite clearly that he is weak in his research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, as I, the Prime Minister and the minister have 
said, the chapter has worked relatively well in a trade agreement 
with $1.3 billion daily trade.  Yes, there are bound to be 
problems and there have been problems but not that many.  The 
government has won several of the disputes that have been 
launched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member somehow think that companies, whether or 
not there is a NAFTA chapter 11, cannot sue if they feel their 
interests have been unfairly prejudiced?  What world is he coming 
from?  We cannot stop individuals or corporations from launching 
lawsuits.  They do not even need chapter 11.  They have that 
right under the rule of law in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not believe I 
misunderstand my role and that of the other members in the House. 
We obviously want to increase Canadian investments and 
facilitate exports. We want a FTAA but not at any cost. Above all 
our role is to protect the health of the people and our 
environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government and the House pass laws to protect our 
environment and the parliamentary secretary says that there is 
nothing wrong with legislation that his own government has 
brought forward being legally challenged, what kind of world are 
we in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to facilitate Canada's economic development, but 
also the protect to health of our people. If the parliamentary 
secretary is not ready to defend these principles, some day, when 
he goes on the campaign trail, his constituents will certainly 
remind him of that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on the motion 
put forward by the opposition on the free trade agreement of the 
Americas.  I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the summit of the Americas this past weekend my constituents 
and other Canadians witnessed an historic gathering.  Thirty-four 
heads of state met in Quebec to discuss many issues of mutual 
interest and to create the largest free trade zone in the 
hemisphere.  Thousands of Canadians, through demonstrations or by 
other means, have made their opinions known regarding the FTAA 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Weeks prior to the Quebec summit, I had the opportunity to hear 
from the people of my riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore on the 
issues.  I also heard the views of various witnesses who appeared 
before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade, of which I am a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the federal government's commitment to ongoing 
dialogue and public debate on the issue, Canadians have a sense 
of the FTAA and what it will mean for them.  The government is 
determined to make the FTAA negotiations as open and transparent 
as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows Canadians have a wide range of views on the 
issues.  Many Canadians come from the regions with which we are 
looking to participate.  Some of them fear their views might not 
find their way to the negotiating table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is important to the government that its policy course 
advance the interests of all Canadians and that it hear from 
Canadians on issues of national interest.  That is why the 
government wants and facilitates an informed public debate.  What 
is happening today is part of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians value transparency in government and the federal 
government would not have it any other way.  In developing trade 
policies and agreements, the government makes every effort to 
facilitate the participation and input of all Canadians.  Through 
the FTAA process, the federal government has shown its commitment 
to public discussion on this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for 
International Trade have consulted provincial and territorial 
governments, parliamentarians, civil society, environmental and 
labour groups, business leaders, academics and other citizens on 
the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has taken a series of steps to facilitate 
such public involvement, and I will highlight a few of those 
steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government contributed funding to the people's summit, where 
Canadian ministers were joined by high level representatives from 
20 countries and five international institutions and met with 
more than 60 representatives of civil society networks, groups 
and associations.  Most of us who watched the people's summit on 
television know it was successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the government has repeatedly answered to 
parliamentarians through debates on the floor of the House, 
appearances by ministers before the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade, briefings by officials and 
co-operation with committees of both Houses of parliament 
regarding the FTAA and the WTO.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1999 the Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade established a trade negotiations and agreements website in 
order to use the Internet as the quickest and most efficient way 
to give Canadians the information they needed and the information 
they wanted on trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since December of last year the website has been a valuable 
resource whereby thousands of Canadians can view Canada's 
proposal in the FTAA negotiations.  Over and over the minister 
responded in the House that the website was up and running. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should know that our country was the first in the 
hemisphere to publicly release Canada's FTAA negotiating 
position.  That happened about a year ago in response to the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
Report on the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing so, Canada has led the way in citizen engagement and is 
encouraging FTAA partners to follow suit and make their positions 
public.  Two of our trading partners took us up on this.  Chile 
and the United States have followed Canada's example and released 
detailed summaries of their negotiating positions on their 
respective websites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged that Canada is reaching beyond all borders to 
ensure that the citizens of the hemisphere are also made aware of 
the FTAA negotiations.  This is of particular importance to 
smaller nations of the hemisphere where there is no comparative 
advantage in technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technological assistance from Canada in helping them to get 
their messages across to the people would be useful in ensuring 
that this dialogue on transparency taking place in the House 
today can also happen in all other parliaments.  In addition to 
ensuring that those countries can have the benefit of technology 
in communicating to their citizens, Canada has offered 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been said in the debates on the FTAA about the text of 
the negotiations.  Canadians wonder if they will ever get to see 
the text.  By their nature, negotiations are formal discussions 
intending to secure an advantage or a benefit for those involved. 
Whether it concerns a commercial contract or a peace settlement 
among nations, negotiations often take place behind closed doors. 
Releasing the text beforehand is counterproductive to the 
interests of Canadians and would jeopardize the discussions by 
undermining the negotiating stands of participants or making 
available privileged information that could allow some to profit 
at the expense of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the House was informed that Canadians will see the text 
of the negotiations in the next few days once they are available 
in the four languages of the FTAA: English, French, Portuguese 
and Spanish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to Canada's leadership the negotiations for the FTAA have 
set new standards for openness and transparency in other ways. 
The engagement of civil society in the FTAA process is a result 
of Canada's effort from the very beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must express thanks to the Minister for International Trade. 
During his chairmanship of the FTAA negotiations from May 1998 
until November 1999, Canada was instrumental in establishing the 
committee of government representatives on the participation of 
civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have worked very hard in several areas to ensure that 
participation.  The committee of government representatives on 
the participation of civil society meets regularly as a 
consultative body in the negotiations and serves as a forum for 
input from citizen based groups, the business community and 
non-governmental organizations.  This is an unprecedented step in 
international negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 23 of this year Canada's latest proposals were 
announced to expand and strengthen the mandate of the committee. 
They were made available on the trade negotiations and agreements 
website. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit itself was widely covered by broadcast media and 
Canadians were able to see a full session of the debates between 
the 34 heads of state during the morning of April 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are concrete steps that demonstrate the government's 
commitment to openness and transparency in the FTAA 
deliberations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, let me reiterate that Canada's views on public input 
into the FTAA from the outset has been and remain in full support 
of transparency in ways that safeguard Canada's interests and 
reinforce the confidence in the government's ability to reflect 
its interests and priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians in civil society play a major role in the 
process.  Having this debate and using the mechanisms at our 
disposal such as committees ensures that Canadians understand the 
issues and are able to convey their views to government.  The 
debate today is part of that transparency. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by reminding those 
who are watching the debate of the actual wording of the motion 
because I think it is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois motion says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government put in place an open and ongoing process to 
keep Parliament informed of negotiations to establish a Free 
Trade Area of the Americas so as to allow parliamentarians to 
debate it and civil society to be consulted before Parliament 
approves it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another example of why the Bloc Quebecois continues to 
demonstrate that it is probably the best opposition party in the 
House.  I say this in the context of the problems today that have 
been experienced by the Canadian Alliance with the division 
within the party.  More than that, this is the first time in a 
very long time that the House has had an opposition motion before 
it, which I think is a motion of considerable weight and quality 
and certainly merits the debate it is getting today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this were a motion put forward by a private member from the 
opposition, where we on this side regard all private members' 
motions and private members' bills as issues of free votes, I do 
not think there is any question at all that this motion by the 
Bloc would be supported.  The negotiations that went on this last 
weekend in Quebec and which will continue pertaining to creating 
a sort of common market of the Americas is an issue of tremendous 
importance to Canadians and I think is an issue of tremendous 
importance to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Bloc comes forward or anyone in the House comes forward 
with a motion suggesting that parliament should take these 
negotiations seriously and should stay abreast of these 
negotiations as best it can is quite appropriate indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell everyone that I have some sympathy with the 
protesters that appeared at the summit at Quebec on the past 
weekend.  Of course I am not interested in those people who 
merely threw rocks and demonstrated for the television cameras. I 
do not have any respect for any person who considers speech 
something that requires him or her to wear a mask.  When we speak 
either in the House or in public or even on the streets then we 
should speak as who we are and be seen.  However, the majority of 
the protesters were seen and they were peaceful protesters.  They 
had an important statement to make because whatever is happening 
and whatever is the ultimate outcome of these negotiations, there 
are legitimate concerns about sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not one who puts a lot of credence in the kind of rhetoric 
that we hear from the Council of Canadians and its leader, but I 
really believe that when we establish transnational trade 
agreements and create dependencies among countries there are 
genuine issues of sovereignty.  When we create dependencies, we 
create situations where we cannot take it back or we have 
situations where we have lost a certain amount of control as 
parliamentarians, as governments over our country's destiny 
because we have transnational agreements in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc during question period raised a number of questions 
with respect to the so-called chapter 11 in the North American 
Free Trade Agreement whereby corporations have an opportunity to 
litigate across the border. 
That is if a corporation in Mexico feels that a corporation in 
Canada that is competing unfairly for the same market within the 
United States, Canada or Mexico, if it feels that it has some 
unfair advantage in the terminology of the trade agreement, then 
it can take that corporation to court and possibly win.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a genuine problem of sovereignty there. What that 
really means is that a business enterprise operating in Canada is 
subject to rules and challenges that exist outside this country. 
It is very right to be concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, I believe that the chapter 11 is 
necessary.  However we should debate it, and it is healthy to 
debate it, because it works.  I believe it works in the context 
that we have it now with the United States and Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it work as well if it is applied in the context of Brazil, 
Argentina and other countries of Latin America?  Will it work 
when it is applied to 30 countries?  I am not so certain.  I need 
to see that debate.  When the Bloc Quebecois comes forth with a 
proposal that says the House should debate that kind of issue, I 
can only actually support in spirit what the motion is proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have other concerns with respect to this whole process of a 
free trade zone of the Americas that again gives me some sympathy 
for some of the peaceful protesters who were in Quebec.  I ask 
myself questions occasionally, Mr. Speaker, about what does it 
really mean?  What is the real motive behind creating this 
enormous free trade zone of the western hemisphere when in fact 
most of the economic activity is occurring in North America?  I 
suppose we could add Brazil and I think we would get probably 
three-quarters of the economic activity of the western 
hemisphere.  So I ask myself then what is the incentive?  Why are 
we bringing in all those other countries of the western 
hemisphere? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far I have not had a really good explanation from watching 
television because I do not of course have any special access to 
the negotiations that are going on in Quebec, and nor should I 
because as the previous government speaker mentioned of course 
negotiations have to be undertaken behind closed doors.  However 
there does come a point in which we as parliamentarians have to 
know the content of these negotiations and that is where I find a 
lot of favour in the motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is where is it really taking us?  Why do we want to 
make this common market of the Americas?  More and more I am 
coming to the conclusion or coming to the feeling that it is all 
about creating a sort of firewall, creating an uneconomic entity 
in the western hemisphere to insulate Canada, the United States, 
Mexico and the other countries, but probably principally the 
United States because I think a lot of this is coming from the 
United States, to insulate the North American economies from what 
could happen in the Far East or in Europe.  The world marketplace 
is changing dramatically and what has happened is we created huge 
economic dependencies in the Far East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I come back to the point that this is where there are 
legitimate questions to be asked about globalization because it 
creates these enormous dependencies.  What will happen, if when 
we create these expectations and we create these countries that 
rely on one another for trade, when the resources run out?  What 
happens when an economic giant comes on the scene, like China? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there has been enough thought and debate in this 
House about what it is going to mean when the Chinese actually 
take their place in the world economy.  It is an accident of 
history that the Chinese should be for 50 years under a communist 
regime, under a controlled economy regime because for thousands 
of years the Chinese have been the ultimate entrepreneurs. 
Chinese is the language of commerce in the Far East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are going to see dramatic economic changes in the Far 
East which could have an enormous impact on the western 
hemisphere.  So I wonder sometimes whether this whole idea of a 
free trade zone of the Americas is really about creating some 
sort of insulation for Canada, the United States, Mexico and the 
countries of the western hemisphere.

</I></B></P><P align=left>And finally, I would say that with respect to keeping parliament 
informed, as this motion proposes, the reality is that we in this 
House cannot have an emergency debate or a debate like this every 
day or every week, even on an important subject like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that we make sure that the 
Senate is paying attention to this motion, because I believe that 
the senators do, and they have the opportunity in terms of time 
and expertise to pay attention to this kind of issue and perhaps 
be the part of parliament that is kept informed as these 
negotiations are ongoing. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to speak to 
the motion brought forward by my colleague from Joliette. One 
word could be used to summarize this motion, the word 
transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the issues at stake touch the everyday life of people, what 
they watch, what they listen to, what they read, what they eat, 
what they drink, what they use, it is important that people be 
informed of these issues by those they elected to represent them 
in this House. That is why this motion is important. I encourage 
all members of this honourable House to vote in favour of the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to discuss another aspect 
of transparency: the role of legislatures, of the parliaments of 
federated states, such as that of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this House we are regularly told that Canada is one of the 
most decentralized federations, that it is a model for the world. 
We pat ourselves on the backs, yet often many, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and the Minister for International 
Trade in particular, are sorely mistaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at what is being done in other parts of the 
world, at examples of approaches that might differ a bit from 
what is applied here, and might be far more productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take, for example, the European Union, an association of 
sovereign states. The ministers across the way often try to tell 
us that the European Union is a model because it is headed toward 
a federal system.  It is not so.  The European Union makes far 
more room for its member states in the discussion and in the 
negotiations leading to trade treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main article governing this is article 133 of the treaty on 
the European Union, which states that when the matters under 
negotiation fall wholly into areas under EU jurisdiction, it is 
the European Commission that negotiates on behalf of the EU. That 
said, all member states have given the commission that mandate. 
Thus, right from the start, the member states play a far greater 
role in determining the position of the union, unlike what is 
done here.  Here the provinces are not even consulted, and they 
are barely kept informed.  That is the first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is possible for countries, France being one example, 
to allow their national assembly a say.  For example, even if the 
topics being discussed are the exclusive preserve of the European 
Union, the national assembly has given itself the authority, 
through a constitutional amendment passed by the French in 1992, 
to use the European position to give its point of view.  This is 
an inquiry.  It allows questions to be put to the European 
Commission so that national elected representatives are not left 
out of such important negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point I wish to make, still in connection with the 
European Union, is that increasingly international treaties do 
not concern trade exclusively. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT71"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT71"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the treaty between the European Union and Israel, 
or the free trade agreement between the European Union and 
Mexico, include issues which are not the exclusive jurisdiction 
of Europe, with the result that member states must also ratify 
these treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Union therefore ensures that, before its position 
is finalized, member states also have their say, including during 
the ratification process itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite say “The European Union is different.  It is 
not a federation, even if that is the direction in which it is 
headed, other models should be considered”. Very well, I say, let 
us look at two other modern federations.  Let us look at Germany, 
a powerful nation, a member of the G-7, like Canada, a federal 
state with a number of Länder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Germany, in the European context, must decide on a position 
and it falls within an area which comes predominantly under the 
jurisdiction of the Länder, the federated states of Germany, it 
is the Länder which determine Germany's position and, what is 
more, it is a representative of the Länder who sits down at the 
international negotiating table, on which are written the words 
“Allemagne-Germany-Deutschland”, and who negotiates on behalf of 
the federal state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federated states, in areas under their jurisdiction, will 
therefore negotiate in the place of the federal government, 
something not insignificant.  We know very well, obviously, that 
the best way to be represented internationally is to be 
independent.  In the meantime, however, they better not try to 
tell us that Canada is the most decentralized federation, because 
it is not true.  We have seen this in the case of Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another interesting example worth mentioning, that of 
Belgium, which applies what I would call a Belgian version of the 
Gérin-Lajoie doctrine.  The Flemish or French communities or 
Brussels have external jurisdiction over their internal 
jurisdictions.  In their respective areas, the federated states 
of Belgium, the federated communities of Belgium, speak for 
Belgium internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are three examples that indicate Canada is truly a 19th 
century federal model.  It is not a modern federation.  In a 
world increasingly open, increasingly, permit me this 
tautology, globalized, it is unacceptable that Canada's federated 
states are not consulted properly, not informed properly and 
involved in the process before, during and after negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it would have been far better, first, to put in place a 
very formal process to consult with the provinces in order to 
define Canada's position; second, to ensure that Quebec is part 
of the binational negotiation team with the federal government; 
and third, if a much more interesting model were to be used, to 
ensure that in provincial areas of jurisdiction, Quebec and any 
other province interested to do so, because there could be some, 
although I do not think there are any, but there could be, may 
have a say and speak out for their own interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It only makes sense since, at some point in time, the 
legislation for the implementation of this treaty will have to be 
passed. It will be possible for a province to say “We differ; we 
do not want this treaty to be implemented”. Common sense would 
dictate that federated states, the provinces, for instance, be 
allowed to negotiate on their own behalf within their sphere of 
jurisdiction, so that, later on, they would be able to say “We 
negotiated this ourselves; we have no qualms about putting an 
implementation bill to a vote”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we have to realize how important it is to support this 
motion, because it deals with transparency. Second, we need to 
stress how much this notion of transparency is misunderstood or 
ignored by the government. We have to ensure that federated 
states, and Quebec in particular, with clear cut positions to 
defend, have their say in the process before, during and after the 
negotiations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may agree with me that this will have to be done while 
Quebecers prepare to make the decision that will allow their 
interests to be protected and promoted at the international level 
like they deserve to be, that is while they prepare to decide to 
build their own country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wonder if my hon. 
colleague opposite is really suggesting that the federal 
government enter into major negotiations on a trade treaty with 
10 provincial partners sitting at the same table.  What about the 
three territories of Canada?  Should they be there?  Would it be 
undemocratic to leave them out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member really suggesting that all of the countries 
proceed like that?  We would need an awfully huge negotiating 
table.  Is he serious?  Does he believe such a process would be 
practical?  Does he not understand that Canadians have elected 
the federal government from coast to coast to coast to speak for 
them and their interests?  That includes, of course, the province 
of Quebec, where the government was re-elected with a higher 
number of seats.  Is the member serious about his suggestion that 
we take such a large delegation?  What is his real problem with 
understanding that the federal government is the legitimate 
authority to negotiate on behalf of all Canadians? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the parliamentary secretary to the 
Minister for International Trade that his party has fewer seats 
from Quebec in this House than the Bloc Quebecois. Therefore, 
there is a huge problem in the premise of his question. That is 
my first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, does he not understand that Quebecers never gave the 
government the mandate to negotiate on the international stage in 
areas outside its jurisdiction? Quebecers never gave it such a 
mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we can talk about details if he wants, I do not mind. I 
make the following suggestions. First, a Quebec-Canada or 
Canada-Quebec binational team should be established to defend 
Quebec's interests pending a yes on sovereignty, which will 
happen sooner than the member opposite may think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see him smile. We need not go to Mars to see examples of how 
federations work. I named two, Belgium and Germany. In both 
cases, the federated states were much more involved in areas 
under their jurisdiction on the international stage. So there is 
no point in trying to have us believe that Canada is a model for 
all federations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also look at what is done in the European Union, where 
the various member countries work together before, during and 
after negotiations not only so they feel involved, but also so 
their interests are defended, protected and promoted rather 
aggressively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are different ways of doing this. We are willing to talk 
about it. In fact, this will also be part of the partnership 
discussions that will take place after Quebec achieves full 
independence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, surely the hon. member is 
aware of the extensive consultations between the federal 
government and all the provinces, including la belle province de 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the hon. member is aware that in one of the latter 
meetings between the Quebec minister and the Minister for 
International Trade the full time that had been set aside by the 
international trade minister was not even needed, as the Quebec 
minister had raised his points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the hon. member is aware that in the EU, which his party 
likes to quote as an example, those nations in the EU are 
willingly sacrificing considerable sovereignty to be part of the 
EU. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the member is a separatist and that his goal 
is a separate Quebec.  I disagree with him, quite frankly, that 
it will ever happen, but let us be candid here.  He cannot have 
it both ways.  Either he wants sovereignty for Quebec or he 
understands that in the EU he quotes those nations are giving up 
sovereignty.  Which is it?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau: </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to see the 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister for International Trade 
understand how the European Union operates.  It is composed of 
sovereign states, independent states.  This is a model 
partnership between sovereignty nations, one that we 
sovereignists on this side of the House are certainly prepared to 
look at, but not to copy word for word, comma for comma. This is 
a model of partnership between sovereign nations which, if 
explored in a less partisan manner and I will go further than 
that, if the other side of this House would just look at it, 
would be seen as the model for the future.  We would see that 
independent and sovereign nations can work together far better 
than when a nation like Quebec feels constrained by an outmoded 
arrangement like the Canadian federation, which dates back to 
1867. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak today to 
the opposition motion proposed by the Bloc Quebecois member for 
Joliette and seconded by myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is indeed in very direct continuity with the reflections 
proposed to us throughout the past week by the peoples' summit, 
the summit of the Americas and the public participation in the 
protest, as well as the public's desire to have a free trade 
agreement that respects social, economic and cultural aspects as 
well as all other concerns, so that we will have not just free 
trade within the Americas but also a society that will be able to 
reap its benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was one main message for me.  As a parliamentarian who 
took part in the parliamentary forum at the people's summit and 
as someone who took part in the peaceful march, I realized that 
this was an extraordinary march which took place in Quebec City 
to show that people from all walks of life, women's groups, youth, 
unions and ordinary members of the public, simply wished to say 
“Yes, we can agree with a free trade area, but not the one that 
we know nothing about yet, the one about which we have seen only 
the trade side.  We want to have a society that allows people to 
achieve things”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me, the motion that was moved today, practically the day 
after the summit, in a way ensures that our role as 
parliamentarians will continue.  The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government put in place an open and ongoing process to 
keep Parliament informed of negotiations to establish a Free 
Trade Area of the Americas so as to allow parliamentarians to 
debate it and civil society to be consulted before official 
ratification by the government, authorized by Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everywhere, this was the message I received from people.  They 
are telling us “The FTAA is something major.  It seems fairly 
complicated”.  We had NAFTA, but some of the provisions in it do 
not seem to be working as well as they could, such as chapter 11 
and the defence of rights issue.  We are also in a very 
different situation, where the size of countries' economies and 
their prosperity are completely different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, 66% of all economic activity is concentrated in 
the United States and only 34% in the other countries. So, 
adjustments need to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the message that was sent to us by citizens who want 
their parliamentarians to act as watchdogs, to ensure every step 
of the way that whatever agreement is reached is something useful 
that we all want. The worst thing would be to say: “Parliament 
will look into this at the end of the negotiations in 2005. We 
will see what came out of the negotiations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have come to realize from the current practice and also 
the answers the Prime Minister gave us today about the 
enforcement of chapter 11 of NAFTA is that we need to scrutinize 
things very carefully because in negotiations a lot of things 
are settled at the last minute. Concessions are made and our 
society and our young people should not have to pay for them. 
This is probably why I have given this matter considerable 
thought and I do hope this motion will be adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the young people who took part in the protest of the 
people's summit were there to say: “It is the world we will have 
to live in that you are defining and we want to ensure that this 
will be done according to criteria we find both interesting and 
acceptable. In the past, social gains were made by some countries 
and we have to ensure that we benefit from those and that 
everyone else does”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some environmental concerns were expressed by young people in a 
particularly brilliant manner. There were also concerns about 
working conditions and the whole issue of child labour. All these 
situations contribute to making this an important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be aware, as parliamentarians, of how important it is to 
adopt this motion. It is important to adopt it in its initial 
version, but even more so in its amended version. If we cannot 
manage to adopt the amendment, at least let us adopt the main 
motion. However the amendment includes a very important element. It 
says “before official ratification by the government, authorized 
by parliament”. In other words, let us give back the power to 
those who were elected by the public, to those who received a 
mandate from the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said that “it is during an election that 
these things are settled”. This is quite possible and we should 
all be aware of that. This is something I have been thinking 
about and I said it in the text. Parliamentarians and those who 
wish to become parliamentarians some day cannot ignore this plea, 
otherwise they will stop being parliamentarians or they never 
will become parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who did not listen to what was said last weekend, the 
next time there is an election in Quebec, in Canada or anywhere 
in the world, people will want to make sure that what is being 
negotiated by their government regarding the FTAA is negotiated 
under certain conditions, include certain programs and yield the 
desired result. I say that because the message is that people no 
longer want agreements signed exclusively on the basis of trade. 
They no longer want to be told that increased trade will create 
wealth. Increased trade can help to create wealth, but there is 
a responsibility that has not been adequately fulfilled by 
governments over the last ten years, and I am talking about the 
distribution of wealth. It is a responsibility of governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector can create wealth, but it does not have the 
full responsibility of ensuring its distribution. It is the 
state's responsibility. Personally, I believe that the state is 
always better served when it is under the control of those who 
were elected by the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we have a responsibility. The people sent 
us a clear message in this regard. Now that dust is settling on 
the summit of the Americas and that negotiations are beginning, 
we must ensure, as parliamentarians, that we will have the 
necessary tools to follow up on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states “That the government put in place an open and 
ongoing process”. My personal position on this is a suggestion 
that could be heeded. 
This open and ongoing process could easily, in my opinion, be a 
special parliamentary committee, consisting of members 
representing all aspects of negotiation, not just those having 
to do with trade, but social and environmental aspects as well, 
so that there is regular follow-up and so that, when there are 
progress meetings to move negotiations forward, there will be 
watchdogs in parliament as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit of the Americas left us with two images: one of 
people engaged in violent demonstrations on the perimeter and 
the other of people, on both sides of the wall, who were unable 
to address the basic issues.  So they focussed on the wall. 
This was as true of heads of state on their side as it was of 
people on the other side, some of whose actions were 
reprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the public is asking of these parliamentarians is that they 
negotiate in a civilized fashion, in their choice of words, in 
the ideas they put forward, and in their defence of opinions, so 
that when we are judged in the next election, it will be on the 
basis of having assumed our responsibilities and having said 
“Yes, we will conduct a regular follow-up and yes, ultimately, we 
will vote on the proposal.  If it is acceptable, we will vote in 
favour, and if it is not, we will vote against”.  This brings 
significant pressure to bear in negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heads of state were not given a blank cheque.  Furthermore, they 
were only too aware of this.  Their mandate is to come up with a 
free trade agreement with a human face.  If they do not fulfil 
this part of the mandate, the mandate will simply be taken away. 
However for this to happen, the House of Commons, like all 
parliaments concerned, must be able to make its views and 
position known, because we are the representatives of the public 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just had a summit where we were told that there were all

ten recommendations to make the FTAA acceptable. Here is one of 
these recommendations:

amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really 
appreciated my colleague's speech. At the end of his 
presentation, he referred to the positions taken by the CEGEP de 
Rivière-du-Loup mobilization committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity in a debate to share with him the 
ideas put forward by these students and I was very impressed to 
see they did not object to market openness nor to free 
trade, but they suggested a number of conditions. They have 
learned from the past as we should also do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to give us more details on something 
he has already talked about, which is the general approach used 
by these young people to mobilize the students of Collège de 
Rivière-du-Loup in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, on his tour, the hon. member for 
Joliette had the opportunity to meet with students of CEGEP de 
Rivière-du-Loup and CEGEP de La Pocatière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Rivière-du-Loup, the students had some kind of a charter 
setting out a number of positions. I will quote just a few, to 
show those students' concern: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the FTAA promote a form of interconnected democracy between 
the people and its government as well as between the various 
member states of the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a strong international committee be set up to impose 
sanctions in the case of human rights violations, which would 
not be subjected at all to the proposed international trade law 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the FTAA help protect local economies, small and 
medium-sized businesses and all low capital competitors, as well 
as cultural differences, by limiting the creation of monopolies 
in order to stimulate strong, just and fair competition. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So these are some logical and rational positions, which at the 
same time take into account objectives that are not purely 
commercial. I think there is an extraordinary message in there 
for the elected officials that we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that occasion, I even put forward an idea which I think would 
be interesting to implement within the next few years, and I 
wish we had the opportunity to implement it. 
It would be to set up a parliament of the students of the 
Americas, which would meet at least once in the course of the 
next three or four years, where we could hear students from all 
these countries telling us what kind of America they would like 
to live in in the future.

would not generate opposition among people but rather create 
wealth and distribute it fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the students from my region and all those I saw 
at the demonstration and who made some specific proposals such 
as those.  I think it augurs well when more and more young

involved and take action to make the world a better place in 
which to live.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to share my time with the hon. member for 
Brampton West—Mississauga. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>  First, I would like to congratulate the member for Joliette 
for his motion.  It includes a very important principle, that is 
the participation of parliamentarians and of the civil society 
in the process of economic integration of our hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judging by today's debate and question period, it is clear that 
the members are already involved in this process.  Opinions vary 
quite a bit, but members are well-informed about the best 
conditions for the development of free trade in the Americas. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said to the member for Halifax this morning, we all agree 
that we want trade.  We recognize the need for economic 
integration but we also recognize that it needs to exist in the 
context that recognizes human rights, democracy, sustainable 
development, cultural diversity and the protection of labour 
standards.  We therefore often differ on the means to achieve 
that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents fully understand that the prosperity of our 
citizens depends on a free and open economy throughout the 
Americas and throughout the world.  It depends on a system of 
international trade that is buttressed by international rules. 
These rules would enable trade and economic integration to take 
place so that we who have benefited so much from that trade and 
from the wealth that has been created by a free and open society 
and a free and open economy, can now begin to share those values, 
that openness and those opportunities with other less fortunate 
people in our own hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of what took place in Quebec City last weekend. 
It was an open and transparent process resulting in a democracy 
clause that will continue to guarantee that there will be 
democratic governments throughout the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A commitment was made by the leaders on such diverse issues as 
health, poverty reduction, education, human rights, the assurance 
of effective courts, the elimination of the drug trade and other 
issues.  A plan of action was made with concrete steps, 
amendments and commitments that would ensure that these take 
place with proper financial resources and human resources to 
ensure it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to our government, the Prime Minister, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, the Minister for International Trade and others, 
we have had a meeting in Quebec City which has brought together 
the leaders of the Americas.  They have made concrete commitments 
to ensure values throughout our hemisphere that would benefit all 
of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to pay particular tribute to the Minister for 
International Trade.  I was present in the room when the United 
States representative for trade pointed out that it was our 
minister of trade who ensured that the negotiating text of the 
free trade agreement be made available so that all members of 
civil society and all members of parliament could have an 
opportunity to discuss its terms.  It was under pressure from our 
government and our minister that achieved that result in Buenos 
Aires and for which we would all benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate calls for an open and continuous process to engage 
parliamentarians and civil society in what we were engaged in 
last weekend.  The government is committed to that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT77"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT77"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1620

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians also have a role to play.  I ask my colleagues 
who participated in the foreign affairs and international trade 
standing committee for the past two years what we have been 
doing.  We did a report on the MAI, the FTAA and the WTO.  We are 
presently doing a study into the summit process itself.  All 
these meetings and discussions, which are available to all 
members and all parties, bring together not only members of 
parliament but witnesses from civil society as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We travel across the country and we hear from every individual 
who wants to come before our committee to give his or her 
position on these important issues.  We have extensive hearings 
and we make recommendations.  The government is then obliged to 
respond to those recommendations in the House, which it has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through our committee system we have had the opportunity to 
actively participate as parliamentarians in the process of 
hemispheric economic integration.  We attend meetings regularly. 
The member for Calgary East, who spoke critically of the process 
himself, pointed out this morning that he attended the 
ministerial meeting of the WTO in Seattle.  I was also there. 
Other members of the House have been to many ministerial 
meetings.  We accompany the ministers.  We have an opportunity to 
be part of the process and we do that on a regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind everyone that in the House just a few weeks ago we 
established the interparliamentary forum of the Americas, 
bringing together the representatives from the parliaments of 34 
countries of the Americas.  They will be able to debate and they 
will be able to share their values, views and impressions with 
one another on a permanent basis now because Canada led the way 
in the formation of what is a very important interparliamentary 
body for the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians are actively engaged and through our government 
do actively engage themselves in this process, as is also true of 
civil society.  I recall what happened in Toronto some years ago 
when our minister of trade held the first meeting as a lead up to 
the summit.  He brought in civil society at that time.  It was 
the first time that had been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A similar meeting took place at the summit in Quebec City.  On 
the weekend I had the opportunity to chair an extraordinary 
meeting of 57 NGOs composed of representatives of indigenous 
peoples, human rights groups, sustainable development groups, 
youth, every form and segment of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Saturday afternoon four Canadian ministers had the 
opportunity to meet with twenty ministers from other countries in 
the hemisphere.  At that meeting we discussed issues and 
responded to questions, all in the presence of the president of 
the World Bank, the president of the Inter-American Development 
Bank, the head of PAHO, and other leaders of multilateral 
institutions, including the president of the OAS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an unparalleled and unprecedented opportunity for the 
engagement of civil society in the process, not as observers but 
as active interveners who had an opportunity to participate, to 
ask ministers questions, to have Mr. Zoellick from the United 
States respond, to have ministers from across the Caribbean and 
from the southern hemisphere respond to their questions and 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the post mortem follow up that we held to those meetings, we 
received an assurance from our government representatives that 
this process would continue.  This was the first time that this 
has ever taken place, and I ask all colleagues to bear that in 
mind when they criticize.  We are so critical all the time about 
everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government led the way.  We insisted on it.  This 
was our summit.  It was our government, our Prime Minister, our 
ministers who insisted among their colleagues that we should put 
this in place.  I am confident that we have established a 
precedent now that will survive throughout the future. This is 
something that cannot be stopped.  It is a wonderful precedent 
that we established this weekend and we should be celebrating. We 
should not be criticizing all the time, but we should be 
celebrating.  We should also celebrate the fact that our 
government financed the people's summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope everyone in the Chamber thinks he or she is a member of 
civil society.  As a member of parliament and as a member of 
civil society, which I think I am, I do not feel I am being left 
out of the process.  I recognize that there are problems, that we 
can be better engaged and that we can change things. 
As the post mortem at which I participated on Sunday with our 
NGOs took place, everybody said they had an extraordinary 
experience.  They said we could improve it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not engage ourselves in the House in the process of 
approaching it from that constructive point of view?  Why do we 
not seek to improve the process rather than constantly criticize 
it, as I hear from opposition members?  They say that nothing 
good was achieved and that nothing is happening.  However the 
average citizen looks out, sees improvements and wants us to work 
together to make it an even better system, not to sit here and 
carp and complain about the problems we have had to live with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the hon. member's comments.  I am not 
surprised to hear the member say that he does not feel left out 
of the process as a parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it should be recognized that the member is the chair of 
the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade.  He is a part of the government and he is on the inside 
track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk with people in my riding and people who are out on 
the streets, they feel left out of the process.  They know that 
this agreement is being negotiated behind the wall, behind the 
fence that people were protesting against, behind closed doors, 
and that it had been a very closed kind of environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Government of Canada has given an inch, it is only 
because of massive public pressure and opposition as well as 
pressure that the NDP has provided in the House unequivocally in 
its opposition to the FTAA.  That is the nature of politics.  It 
is because of that pressure that the government has been moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could he consider that the so-called democracy clause is a 
huge advance when it is democracy on the basis of electing 
governments to do the bidding and the work for these huge 
corporations?  That is what people object to.  I do not 
understand why Liberal members do not understand that very 
fundamental point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of 
premises in the hon. member's question that I do not accept.  I 
do not accept that the agreement was arrived at behind closed 
doors.  It was on television.  It was as open and transparent as 
it could possibly be when we had 34 heads of state together in 
one place.  We could not have 5,000 people in the room.  We do 
not have 50,000 people sitting in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the member not stand here and say that this is an 
illegitimate organization?  Everybody is not in the Chamber.  Not 
everybody can walk in here.  The hon. member cannot bring a 
constituent into the Chamber and neither can I.  Why?  It is 
because we need a way to exchange views with one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not make us illegitimate.  We were elected to be there 
and the leaders of the Americas were elected to be in Quebec 
City.  We need to give them the tools to do the job.  The 
member's suggestion that they are illegitimately there is 
striking at the very fundamental roots of democracy that the 
member purports to be in favour of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also do not accept the fact that what took place was as a 
result of pressure from her party.  The leadership came from the 
Minister for International Trade and from the Prime Minister to 
open up the process.  The Prime Minister of Canada does not need 
the NDP to tell him how to run the country.  That is very clear, 
as the last election pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point about the democracy clause is where I have a 
fundamental difference with the member.  I listened to the 
speeches of the member's colleagues this morning.  The New 
Democratic Party's position is as simple as this: the NDP says 
that other elected governments have entered into international 
agreements which have made them undemocratic.  The hon. member 
does not believe there is a democracy clause, but what the hon. 
member forgets is that the people who entered into these trade 
agreements that have been criticized by everyone, including 
ourselves, were democratically elected governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we choose to give up to international interests some part of 
our sovereignty to benefit more our citizens through a pooled 
sovereignty, that is our decision as a democratically elected 
people to make.  That is what was taking place in Quebec City and 
that is what the member does not like.  The member does not like 
the fact that other people have adopted a system of democracy and 
values that the member disapproves of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not make them less democratic.  It just makes them 
different.  It is that difference in the world that we should be 
celebrating, not the imposition of one's values on everybody else 
in the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a few 
very specific questions for the hon. member. I would like him to 
tell me why there were no Liberal members of parliament at the 
people's summit and at the parliamentary conference of the 
Americas. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, does he not find inappropriate that the final 
declaration of the 34 heads of state mentions only the 
inter-parliamentary forum of the Americas, the FIPA, which has 
been in existence for hardly a month, while there is no mention 
whatsoever of COPA, which has been highly respected since 1997 
and whose membership is much larger and pluralistic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he think about the relations between FIPA and COPA 
during these negotiations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, my answer will be brief because 
there are several questions here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave the debate to FIPA and COPA, because it is somewhat 
an internal debate, but I suggest to the hon. member that the 
reason why FIPA has been referred to in the final summit document 
is precisely because it represents national parliaments 
throughout the Americas. FIPA was entrusted by the governments to 
do certain tasks. Therefore, it is quite justified on their part 
to choose some instrument for doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can COPA do something else? I totally accept COPA's legitimacy 
in its area of influence, but I believe we should accept FIPA's 
legitimacy in its area of influence as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West—Mississauga, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the opposition motion.  It 
is the first time in a long time that all responsible members of 
parliament can work together to make sure that the consultative 
process is an open approach, one which was initiated by the 
government and will continue in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the foreign affairs committee, I have had the 
privilege of travelling across this country to hear 
representations from Canadians who belong to every sector of 
society.  Some who take a cynical approach to the government went 
through this exercise merely to pay lip service.  However, I can 
assure the members of the House that every view was represented 
in the completed reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I believe it would be a fairly accurate guesstimation that 
at least 60% or more of the committee's time has been spent 
listening to the many well informed Canadians whose careers are 
directly linked to the study of the economic implications to 
business as well as labour in regard to the trade agreements into 
which Canada enters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1999 Canada hosted the FTAA ministerial in Toronto. 
Canada supported a civil society forum which was arranged by a 
coalition of hemispheric organizations to parallel the Americas 
business forum.  A record 22 FTAA ministers and country 
representatives were there to hear civil society's views and 
recommendations on trade and investment, labour standards and 
poverty reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that really puzzles me about the Bloc members is that 
Quebec elected members from the Bloc to represent them in all 
international fora, so I do not really understand why the Bloc 
feels there should be 10 provincial negotiators at the table 
along with the federal negotiators.  Do they also believe that 
the United States should have 50 negotiators along with their 
federal negotiators and that as well there should be additional 
state negotiators for every country in Central and South America? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a federal jurisdiction.  Canada strongly believes that a 
more democratic, prosperous and equitable hemisphere can be 
achieved only if all sectors of society are involved in its 
construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, Canada has proved to be in the vanguard in promoting 
greater inclusion and engagement.  At the summit of the Americas, 
the Minister for International Trade, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, the Minister for International Cooperation and the 
Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa were joined by 
high level representatives from 20 countries and 5 international 
institutions to meet with more than 60 representatives of civil 
society networks, groups and associations.  These 
representatives, who have been closely involved in the 
development of the summit's action plan, came from across Canada 
and across the hemisphere.

I sound somewhat more like a cynic than a team player.  The 
patience of the Chair of the Standing Committee on Foreign

especially by me, but I also must confess that I am more of a 
believer than I have been in a long time because I have seen the 
result of the consultations and of the reports that come out of 
foreign affairs.

chair was on the inside track.  It would be nice if we could all 
be on the inside track, but it would be totally and completely 
unmanageable.  I cannot think of anyone I know who can better 
represent or who should be more on the inside track than the 
chair of the foreign affairs committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to know that neither she, her party nor 
anyone else has the monopoly on caring about social issues, 
labour conditions or environmental conditions.  No one has more 
of a monopoly on this than our chair does.  He is diversified. We 
cannot all be on the inside track, for a couple of reasons. 
Sometimes we are not all capable of comprehending it.  He was 
elected to do that and elected to chair the committee.

Speaker, I listened very carefully to my colleague opposite who 
is still wondering why Quebec wants to send its own negotiators 
to these major international tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put a question to the member. First, does the 
member truly believe that Quebec is a nation? If she answers yes 
to this question, and I would ask her colleague, the 
parliamentary secretary, not to slip her the answer, if she 
believes that Quebec is a nation, does she not think that nations 
should be present at international tables to defend their own 
interests? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like her to answer the first question. If her answer is 
yes, then, of course, she will have to say that Quebec should 
take part with the other nations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with a great deal of emotion that I rise today, as 
there is something rather interesting and symbolic in my doing 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago, coming back from the Easter recess, I had been 
a parliamentarian for two years at the time, I was expressing 
concern, as I am today, about 
the widening gap between the rich and the poor. In an 
attempt to spark a societal debate on the impact of the 
globalization of the economy and on our political power, I picked 
up my seat and took it out of the House of Commons to give it 
back to my constituents. That was three years ago. In a sense, 
today is the anniversary of my action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit held in Quebec City last weekend was also an 
important event. I went just about everywhere in the city, among 
other places to the parliamentarians' forum. I was greatly 
pleased to hear everyone talk about globalization or 
continentalization. In short, I think the debate got off to a 
good start. I do not mean to say that it was my doing, but anyway 
there is an interesting symbol in this whole issue. I am happy 
that we are debating it and that it was raised by the Bloc 
Quebecois, through the member for Joliette. So there are positive 
aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other aspects remain disturbing however, as we saw during the 
weekend. 
I had the opportunity to participate in the forum of 
parliamentarians, but I also took part in Saturday's march. I 
spent the whole week with friends from the Lac-Saint-Jean area 
who have an apartment very close to the security perimeter, which 
enabled me to play the role of observer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everyone here will agree that our role, as 
parliamentarians, is to observe what goes on in the field and to 
come back here with a good understanding of the events that are 
taking place in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that my weekend was very enlightening, although sad 
at times. I already said that I was pleased with certain things I 
saw in the media. Granted, there was way too much emphasis on 
vandalism, but there were reports on television, on the radio and 
in the newspapers on the impacts of globalization and of the huge 
societal changes that we are going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, there is a certain awareness on the part of the 
people. Close to 40,000 people marched peacefully in the streets, 
and I must insist on the word peacefully. Unfortunately, there 
was another segment of society that had chosen direct action and 
violence. It is totally inappropriate and it diminishes 
the quality of the message that those who marched peacefully 
wanted to send because they were critical of the way 
globalization and continentalization were being pursued. 
We must realize that a lot of things happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue to try to understand what motivated the 
vandalism. Unfortunately, a number of violent protesters did not 
know exactly why they were doing what they were but they 
were doing it to confront the police. Others were there because 
they thought it was the only way. Again, I strongly condemn such 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, someone said to me “Listen, Stéphan, do we not have 
the population, the youth that we deserve?” After thinking it 
over, I said to myself “Maybe. Maybe we should think about 
things like that”. In short, this is part of the joy of 
politics. The sociological aspect of such phenomena must be taken 
into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was nevertheless an interesting aspect. Whether they are 
demonstrators in the street, rioters or people who got inside the 
perimeter, they all talk about the distribution of wealth. They 
all talk about the protection of environment, about enhanced 
democracy. So there seems to be a societal consensus about the 
goals that we must reach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, however, divergences about the means to reach that 
end. Some people say that free trade will lead us to our ruin, 
while others believe it will bring prosperity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the results, I believe that the debate is expanding. 
However, we, as parliamentarians, should  examine 
the issue more thoroughly. Again, I congratulate my colleague, 
the member for Joliette, for having organized the forum of 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a group that has made itself visible in a special way 
this week. I am referring to parliamentarians, namely members of 
COPA, who have really indicated what was important in the whole 
negotiating process. I am not referring here to democracy clauses 
in each country as they were discussed during the weekend, but to 
the whole continental process, which is short on openness, 
consultation, debate and dialogue. I am convinced of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the civil society should be included, but so should 
the parliamentarians. If they are not, we have a serious 
problem. We do have a serious problem now, because they are 
not included at present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, because of this we have had new initiatives like 
COPA, which has been trying for three years to get 
parliamentarians of the various provinces and countries together 
to have a whole range of opinions. We can have a debate 
in this parliament among ourselves, but, if we are to have a 
complete picture of the situation, it is essential to have 
meetings with parliamentarians from other countries of the 
Americas to sketch out the kind of society we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may be talking about a trade agreement, but as far as I am 
concerned, we should be talking more generally of the exchange 
area of the Americas. Exchanges are not restricted to trade, but 
include knowledge, culture, politics and social issues. We all 
stand to benefit from increased exchanges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we need rules. This is why I am very uneasy with the term 
free trade. Does this mean we should have a free market without 
any rules, environmental rules or social rules? I hope not. I 
hope this is not what our leaders have been discussing during the 
weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support trade, but trade should be fair, with sustainable 
development, a development that is respectful of people and of 
the environment. To have this, we need agreements for 
the Americas. We have to negotiate and discuss this. It is a 
great proposal. 
In fact, it is such an ambitious project that it encompasses the 
richest country in the world and one of the poorest. Some people 
believe that it will be totally impossible to reach an agreement, 
but at least there is some dialogue going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Call me naive or utopian, but I believe that some day we might 
have a trade area of the Americas where there will be cohesion, 
wealth redistribution, greater democracy, an environment agenda 
and many more great things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There appears to be agreement that parliamentarians should work 
together. I am the international co-operation critic for the Bloc 
Quebecois and I happen to believe that we need interparliamentary 
co-operation not only in the Americas, but throughout the world, a 
world of global markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we have more and more concerns that reach beyond the walls 
of this parliament, we need discussions and exchanges of ideas 
that also reach beyond this parliament, hence the emergence of 
parliamentary associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is however a barrier to interparliamentary co-operation. 
The language, of course, can be a barrier and it can be quite a 
challenge. If fact, I have promised some of my parliamentary 
colleagues to try to learn Spanish during the summer, because it 
is a beautiful language and it could help me to better understand 
my Latino colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another barrier to interparliamentary co-operation is the 
distance, although we probably have the technology to overcome 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to use technology to promote democracy. The 
time has come for parliaments in the Americas and throughout the 
world to get the telecommunications tools they need to hold 
virtual parliamentary sittings in which some thirty people, 
including members of the civil society, could take part. We could 
also have regular sessions to examine some issues in depth, 
thanks to all the technology we now have. The time has come to 
take this step, which is why I have become an advocate of virtual 
parliamentarism.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving 
me a chance before one of the hon. member's colleagues, but I am 
sure we will all get a chance to participate in this very 
interesting and worthwhile debate, which was the idea of my 
colleague, the hon. member for Joliette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we do support the main motion, because we feel that 
what the main motion calls for we have been doing for some 
months, are doing now and will continue to do.  The government 
will support the main motion, but it will not support the 
amendment, for some important reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who just spoke said some argue that free trade will 
bring prosperity while others argue that it will bring the 
opposite, poverty.  I would like to give him the thoughts of two 
world leaders and ask him to react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I agree with those who feel that it will bring 
prosperity.  I feel that is the proper conclusion.  What the 
president of Mexico, Vicente Fox, said to the protesters in 
Quebec City who were there to speak on behalf of the less 
developed countries of the Americas, was this:  let us choose. He 
said “we are the democratically elected leaders of those 
countries so let us choose what is right for our people, and we 
are accountable to those people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what my colleague thinks of the remarks of Mr. Fox and 
also of the remarks of Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the 
United Nations, who said recently in his report that the best 
thing we can do to help the less developed countries of the world 
is to globalize and liberalize trade.  He even quantified that 
and said that would ensure $100 billion in aid to those 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my hon. colleague could react to the comments of 
Secretary General Annan and President Fox. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have not said that I was opposed to free trade. I only 
said earlier that some people had concerns regarding free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the globalization or continentalization of 
the economy has the effect of increasing competitiveness, for 
example. This has consequences attached to it. When 
competitiveness is pushed to the limit, companies, which are 
profit driven, are sometimes compelled to reduce wages and to 
operate from countries where the environment is not respected. 
This will also create a tax competition between states. To 
attract investors, companies do not want to pay any taxes or very 
little. However it is with tax money that health care and education 
are financed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that this type of pressure exists. I am not saying that 
this is exactly what will be happening, but the tendency is 
there. This is why I say that governments and parliamentarians 
must remain strong to ensure that the rules of the game are set 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member, and probably with Kofi Annan, when he 
says that trade brings prosperity. I recently travelled to Chile 
with the Minister for International Cooperation. It is true that 
Chile is one of the most economically integrated countries in the 
world. There is a middle class in Chile. I admit it. I do not 
believe that everything should be either black or white in 
politics or in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, there are signs of concern. Some say that investments 
from the north will bring prosperity to the south, and that is 
possible, but there are other elements that have to be taken 
into consideration such as education, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the objectives that northern countries must set 
themselves is to ensure that the countries we deal with 
provide access to 
education. It is absolutely essential. To become a developed and 
democratic society, education is absolutely necessary. We cannot 
have globalization with countries that are not even able to 
provide education to their young people, the new generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might not be in the text of the agreement itself, but this 
absolutely must be taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must pay attention to what people say in the street. We 
cannot say that they are anti-globalization, a word I dislike. 
It is not true that people are against globalization. They are 
against the way it is happening. We must be careful with the 
words we use.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will comment on the speech made by my colleague, who 
said that language, whether we want it or not, can be somewhat of 
an obstacle to negotiations and trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I see the parliamentary secretary saying no. He 
pointed to the interpreter a few moments ago. If that is not an 
obstacle, how can he explain the fact that his government 
mentioned translation problems as a reason not to release the 
documents to be used in the negotiation of a free trade area of 
the Americas on the eve of the summit? Is this not real proof 
that it can be an obstacle? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, to answer my colleague's 
question, the government insulted our excellent 
translators and interpreters. They are able to translate the 
debates simultaneously, but we were told that it was impossible 
to translate a 900 page text in more than a week. Come on. The 
people from Ottawa smiled when they said that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are certainly having a great 
debate here this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc supply day motion is that we put in place an ongoing 
and transparent process by which parliament is informed of the 
negotiations concerning the establishment of a free trade zone of 
the Americas, whereby parliament can debate and society can be 
consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not quite sure exactly what they mean by consultation of 
society.  I certainly agree with the reference to parliament. 
Parliament has to be involved.  We, the elected members of 
parliament, are the representatives of the people.  We get a lot 
of feedback.  As a result, parliament should definitely be 
consulted in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly my understanding that the text of the agreement 
is to be released once the translation is complete and the 
release of information or any changes certainly should be made 
public.  We stand for that four-square.  There also has to be 
input by parliamentarians, which I have referred to and which the 
motion of course is asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is Canadian Alliance policy that treaties like the free trade 
agreement of the Americas be brought before the House of Commons 
for a vote.  Deciding on proceeding with trade agreements should 
be decisions made by parliament and not by the personal 
prerogative of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have increased openness.  It would help the 
negotiation of free trade agreements by decreasing public 
suspicion and increasing public awareness and knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also have increased public debate facilitated through 
the House of Commons.  That would offer practical improvements to 
Canada's negotiating position, which might not have been thought 
of if the negotiations are done in secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of trade is that countries that do a lot of 
trading with their neighbours and friends around the world are 
those countries that increase the wealth for all of their 
citizens.  We have seen that here in Canada.  One of the best 
examples I can think of that relates exactly to central Canada, 
Ontario and Quebec, was the 1960s auto pact agreement whereby 
there was free trade between central Canada, Ontario and Quebec 
especially, and the United States.  For many years Ontario has 
seen the highest incomes in the country.  That is due to the 
trading relationship Ontario was able to enjoy.  All Canadians 
should be able to enjoy that kind of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basic concept of free trade not only am I personally in 
support of it, but free and increased trade is what the Canadian 
Alliance stands for.  We see that need for open and freer trade 
also applying to agriculture.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen quite an improvement with the cattle agreement we 
have with the U.S.  Last year over 200,000 head of feeder cattle 
came up from the northwest corner of the United States to be fed 
in Canada.  That created wealth for the Americans.  We outbid 
their ranchers on the price of the cattle.  We brought them here, 
fed them and added value.  Some of the beef was shipped back to 
the States and some was shipped overseas as finished beef.  It is 
a good example of how trade benefits all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest problems with trade is high foreign subsidies 
for agriculture.  High tariffs restrict imports into countries 
and, in their case, restrict exports as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the great advantages of freer trade around the world, not 
only the WTO but in this case the free trade of the Americas, is 
that countries considered second and third world countries, whose 
economies have not yet fully developed and which have not been in 
a good trading relationship with the rest of the world, will find 
their citizens on the whole are much better off and enjoy a 
higher standard of living.  Not everyone will drive a car or have 
a yearly income of $50,000, but the situation in many of these 
countries, where some people live in slums and garbage dumps, 
will come to an end if their economies grow.  Part of that can be 
achieved through free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will accept some of these countries' agricultural products. I 
bring up agriculture because I am the chief agriculture critic 
for my party.  Importing agricultural products is good.  Some 
countries do not have a lot of high technology exports to send us 
but they do have agricultural and low end commodities.  In 
return, as their wealth increases, we can sell more to them and 
thereby create wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP like to think of wealth as a static kind of thing. There 
is a big ball of wealth and it is all about fighting for a piece 
of that ball.  The Canadian Alliance clearly believes and 
understands that the ball of wealth can grow and grow until all 
people around the world have a decent standard of living with 
health services.  That is why we so strongly advocate trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a few problems with its trade position.  I use the 
example again of P.E.I. potatoes.  The rules based trading that 
should be in place is not working to its full extent.  We must 
recognize that any trade agreement must include dispute 
settlement mechanisms and that the parties must live up to their 
trade agreements.  The Americans are artificially using a disease 
problem as an excuse to bar imports of P.E.I. potatoes into the 
U.S.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way to deal with that is to use the dispute settlement 
mechanisms we have under the agreements.  The government should 
establish a good working relationship with our trading partners 
but we instead see the government fighting with our trading 
partners.  Brazil is a good example.  The United States is 
another.  These issues should not be escalating into trade 
actions.  They should be worked out on a bilateral basis between 
neighbours and friends before they become bigger problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of state trading enterprises will be coming up in the 
free trade of the Americas.  Canada's FTAA position regarding 
this will probably be identical to its WTO position.  The big 
example in Canada is the Canadian Wheat Board, which is the 
monopoly buyer of grain in Canada.  However, when it markets our 
farmers' grain around the world it is no longer a monopoly but 
just one of many sellers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions then become:  How much of a price can the wheat 
board get?  Can it get a better price or do a better job of 
marketing than a grain company or other grain broker?  A 
situation may develop where the board and its directors, except 
for two of them, may say that the monopoly must be maintained 
because it is the only thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in the WTO talks that trading monopolies or state trading 
enterprises are not conducive to freer trade around the world. 
The wheat board is wrong on that basis but it is also wrong in 
that many farmers do not want its monopoly to continue.  The 
Canadian Wheat Board artificially distorts trade because the 
government is imposing its agenda on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on one last thing.  The organic growers are 
represented by Carol and John Husband, Arnold Schmidt and Ron 
Tetoff.  These people have developed overseas markets for their 
organic grain.  They are being forced to go through the wheat 
board to get a buy back on it, and that is dead wrong.  We have 
many farmers, including Art Mainil in Weyburn and Barry Farr, who 
want the voluntary wheat board brought into play.  We will see 
that negotiated in the upcoming free trade of the Americas 
agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with a lot of interest to the 
member across the way who talked about the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must first understand that the Canadian Wheat Board is not 
the same as it was in the past.  It is not only a crown 
corporation that has five members appointed by the government, it 
now also has 10 members who are elected by the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a reputation for selling food products, and in this 
case grain products, that are second to none.  The Canadian Wheat 
Board has done an admirable job in the past, is doing so in the 
present and will continue to do so in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across the way seems to think that all farmers out 
west want to do away with the Canadian Wheat Board.  I have had 
the opportunity as vice-chair of the standing committee on 
agriculture, along with the member opposite, to hear farmers out 
west.  That is where the debate is going on right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across the way should give the wheat board a chance 
now that its officials are elected by grassroots farmers.  He 
should give it a chance to change itself from what it has been as 
a crown entity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has consistently gone after the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  Why has it done so?  Does the U.S. really think our wheat 
board is a bad thing or does it want it abolished because it does 
a good job for farmers out west? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Alliance 
and I are not advocating doing away with the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  It is a co-operative agency through which farmers can 
voluntarily market their grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board had 55 years to show its worth.  We 
have seen that the wheat board no longer sells many of the grains 
and commodities it once did because there is a better way to 
market those commodities.  Oats are a good example.  We will not 
see anyone fighting to have those grains marketed again by the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, for whatever reason, thinks it must 
retain control of wheat and barley so it can sell wheat to 
foreign countries like North Korea for $1.50 a bushel and make 
western Canadian farmers pay for it. 
That is what is wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 10 elected members of the Canadian Wheat Board, two have 
been elected to represent the thousands of farmers who want 
choice in marketing.  It has nothing to do with ideology.  It 
should have nothing to do with the government forcing a marketing 
agency onto farmers.  It should be about an individual farmer who 
has $1 million or thereabouts in assets being able to do the best 
for his farm economically.  The university educated farmers we 
have today are far better at marketing their products than some 
colossal monopoly that says one size fits all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board must become voluntary.  If it does not 
happen today, I will keep working tomorrow and the day after that 
until it does.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in this debate on 
behalf of the people of Surrey Central on the timely motion by 
the third party: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government put in place an open and ongoing process to 
keep Parliament informed of negotiations to establish a Free 
Trade Area of the Americas so as to allow parliamentarians to 
debate it and civil society to be consulted before Parliament 
approves it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc is using the summit of the Americas as a catalyst to 
put the spotlight on parliamentary reform.  The Canadian 
Alliance, along with other parties, has been pushing the 
government to change the way we govern ourselves in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today is very much in sync with our agenda.  The 
Canadian Alliance wants three things from the government as a 
result of the successful summit of the Americas.  First, we want 
the text of the proposed free trade agreement of the Americas 
released once its translation is complete.  Second, we want 
information regarding changes to the agreement to be made public. 
Third, we want input by parliamentarians.  We understand it has 
not been easy to translate parts of the agreement, but this is a 
requirement of the motion and the government must comply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in the spirit of democratic parliamentary reform we 
think it is time to force the government to include the House of 
Commons in the negotiation of these types of treaties.  A take 
note debate is simply not enough.  When the government makes the 
decision and then asks the House to debate, that is not 
democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit of the Americas is particularly important to 
Canadians because Canada has $42 million invested in the Americas 
outside the U.S.  Over 90% of goods from Latin and Central 
America and the Caribbean come to Canada duty free.  Canada 
exports 45% of the GDP, so it is very important that we discuss 
the issue in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance recognizes the enormous benefit of free 
trade to our country.  It will broaden our trading rights.  It is 
mutually beneficial to participating countries.  It gives 
consumers a better choice of goods and services at cheaper prices 
compared to tariff protected economies.  It helps us get value 
added products.  It helps bring about prosperity and development 
in Canada.  It enhances freedom of enterprise, democracy and good 
governance.  It enhances the voluntary exchange of goods, 
services and money.  It protects intellectual property rights. 
The discussion of free trade in the House is therefore very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary debate is also important because a number of 
questions remain unanswered.  Questions about trade disputes, 
softwood lumber, agriculture and fisheries have not been 
addressed at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, what is Canada's role in the FTAA?  We do not yet know. 
What are the benefits versus the costs of dealing with those 
countries?

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to debate that because so little has been made 
public by the government.  We also need to know what criteria the 
government is using to promote trade relations in the FTAA.  How 
about our trade policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to debate these things.  We need to know how we will be 
dealing with or holding those nations accountable for their human 
rights record, as well as good government practices.  How about 
trade sanctions against any rogue nation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things are important, particularly with the increase in 
organized crime and international crime.  We need to know these 
things, but this weak Liberal government has not given parliament 
a chance to deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It being 5.15 p.m. it is my duty to

necessary to dispose of the business of supply.

the privilege to table the bill before the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House a bit about Bill S-10.  Bill S-10 would 
create an office that combines the traditional functions of both 
the British and American poet laureate.  I am certain that my 
fellow parliamentarians are familiar with these traditions. 
However I beg the indulgence of the House while I briefly 
describe both offices and provide some historical notes on these 
offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poet laureate is a formal title conferred upon poets in several 
countries as a sign of official recognition and historically to 
designate these poets as official chroniclers of state events and 
occasions.  I did not have the privilege of learning Latin, but 
those who have had the opportunity and, in the minds of some, the 
horrible task of learning Latin will know that the term laureate 
is derived from the Latin word laurea or the English word laurel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its use reflects the fact that in ancient times the laurel tree 
was sacred to the Greek god Apollo, the patron deity of poetry 
and music.  It is believed that he decreed the laurel to be the 
emblem for poets and victors.  So it was that ancient poets who 
achieved distinction were crowned with a wreath of laurel, as 
were athletes victorious at the Olympic games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In medieval England it became customary for rulers to have court 
poets as part of the royal household.  Their importance in 
composing works for the court and national occasions is a 
reflection of the fact that at the time narrative verse was the 
central means for recording and communication of history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1616 King James I created the office of court poet for Ben 
Jonson, but it was not until 1668 when John Dryden was given the 
title of official poet laureate that this title was indeed 
created in England.  Since that time the office of poet laureate 
has been continuously occupied except for a four year period 
following the death of Alfred Lord Tennyson in 1892. 
Today Andrew Motion is the official poet laureate of that 
parliament.  His 10 year term, begun in 1999, is historic as 
previously in the U.K. the appointments were life appointments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, while the formal title of poet laureate to 
the Library of Congress was only created in 1985, the office 
itself dates back to 1936.  It was then that the late Archer Mr. 
Huntingdon endowed a chair of poetry at the Library of Congress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to be noted that in the U.K. it is the duty of the prime 
minister to nominate successors from which the reigning sovereign 
will choose.  The lord chamberlain then officially or formally 
appoints a poet laureate through the issuance of a warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, however, said appointments are by the 
congressional librarian and are for a one year term.  An 
incumbent in the United States can be reappointed indefinitely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This then brings us back to Bill S-10 wherein the duties of the 
parliamentary poet laureate would include writing poetry relating 
to state occasions for use in parliament.  This draws from the 
British model and as well would include advisory and public 
awareness duties.  This function or responsibility draws from the 
American model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the American model the official poet laureate of the Library 
of Congress is also responsible for hosting poetry reading, for 
encouraging poets to go into the schools and the learning 
institutions in order to spread the word, and for encouraging the 
use of language by young people and by Americans in general as a 
means of communication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill S-10 the term of office would be two years and would 
not be renewable.  The appointment of the parliamentary poet 
laureate would be jointly by the speakers of the House of Commons 
and of the other place.  The process whereby the two speakers 
would appoint a poet laureate under this legislation would be 
that the speakers would choose from a list of three nominees that 
had been submitted by a committee composed of the parliamentary 
librarian, who would be chair of that committee; the national 
librarian; the National Archivist of Canada; the Commissioner of 
Official Languages for Canada; and the chair of the Canada 
Council. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill leaves to both speakers, the Speaker of the Senate and 
the Speaker of the House of Commons, or to the committee, the 
responsibility of detailing the rules related to the 
recommendations.  For example, will the selection of the three 
names to be submitted to the speakers of both Houses obey to the 
rule of unanimity?  Will it require a consensus, a majority, a 
plurality, or will it be submitted to any other determinant rule?

very day to provide meaning and enjoyment to contemporary readers 
and audiences across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of Canada's most gifted poets is Irving Layton.  He has made 
a lasting and unparalleled contribution to Canadian literature 
through his extraordinary verse.  Or, as Aristotle wrote in the 
<I>Poetics</I>, “it is not the business of the poet to tell what 
has happened but what might happen and what is possible”.  I 
think Irving Layton as well as other great Canadian poets are a 
true expression of that quote from Aristotle.

had been very long and I could not even see the end of it.  I 
must say I was very tired and slightly downhearted.  However when I 
read Mr. Gossip's poem, it put a smile on my face and lifted my 
spirits.  It gave me the energy to get to the end of the day and 
accomplish all I had planned. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to beg again the indulgence of my colleagues so as 
to read another poem, “Appraisal”, which was composed by Cyril 
Dabydeen.  Mr. Dabydeen, who is a noted Canadian poet of 
Caribbean origin, was in fact the poet laureate for the city of 
Ottawa about 15 years ago.  He received an annual stipend of $1. 
It reads:

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a great poem.  It speaks to many things that we 
have experienced in Canada.  Whether it be our participation in 
the war against the fascists during the second world war, whether 
it be our welcoming of masses of immigrants throughout our 
history coming from the four corners of the earth, of varying and 
diverse ethnic, racial, linguistic and religious origin, we have 
it all in Canada, including the role that parliament has played 
in opening the gates and seeing that the gates remain open.  I 
think that this is a great poem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come back to my bill to establish a poet 
laureate.  I hope I would have the complete support of all hon. 
members of the House to see that the bill is adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked if this is a paid position?. There is nothing 
in the bill that requires the position would be paid. 
Historically and traditionally it is an honorary position and at 
most an honorary stipend would be attached to it.  It would be 
the committee and the speakers who would decide whether or not an 
honorary stipend should be attached to this position and, if so, 
what amount.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that there may be a member on the other side of the House

I hope that means that I have his support at least for the bill,

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of the House to consider seriously the position of 
poet laureate.  We talked about how parliament is disconnected 
from reality.  This is something that we read and hear in the 
media continually.  We also talk about how our youth have become 
disconnected from the democratic process of participation.  The 
capacity to use language in all its richness is one way of being 
engaged.  Poetry has a long tradition in Canada.  Jacques Cartier 
was a poet and some of our prime ministers were known to have 
composed verse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members on both sides of the House to begin the 
Canadian tradition of parliamentary poet.  A parliamentary poet 
would go a long way to encouraging literature in our society.  It 
would encourage our young people to see the spoken word as 
something that is enriching, that is a means of communication and 
a means of recording our experiences as an individual, as a group 
and as a society.  It lives on forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members to support the bill to allow the creation, the 
beginning, of a Canadian tradition of poet laureate, which goes 
with the tradition of having the most poets per capita of any 
country in the world.  We have the tradition.  Let us bring it 
into parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Cheryl Gallant (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to rise today on 
behalf of the official opposition to speak to Bill S-10, an act 
to amend the Parliament of Canada Act respecting the 
establishment of a parliamentary poet laureate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Canadian Alliance, the notion of a poet 
laureate certainly appeals in a civilized sense to the beauty of 
the spoken word.  We on this side of the House are probably more 
sensitive to the spoken word because in the political forum we 
call question period our words are swords with which we do 
justice on behalf of the Canadian people every day.  It is with 
considerable interest that we in the official opposition view 
anything in parliament that has to do with the spoken word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to speak to the hurt the spoken or written word can 
inflict on others, particularly when it is used for malicious 
intent.  I refer to a magazine article that was recently 
published in an Ottawa city news magazine.  The writer's story 
was about a murder trial in my riding of 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke.  It has taken on a certain 
sensationalist reporting, much in the style of the popular U.S. 
tabloids. 
I wish to read into the official record what the news magazine 
had to say about the beautiful rural community in which the 
murder took place. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community is not one of those nice little towns that dot 
southern and eastern Ontario.  It is more like a rural freak 
show—a railway town without a railway—where most people make 
their money in the fall either by catering to deer hunters or by 
bringing in the marijuana harvest from up in the hills behind the 
village.  Many of the older residents are the simple Ottawa 
Valley folk who are the butt of so many recycled Newfie jokes—

there is more, to emphasize the emotional effect that words can 
have on a listener.  When I read this hate literature, and I use 
the term sparingly because I know it is a powerful term and I do 
not intend to minimalize anyone else's experience with hate 
literature, I felt immediate contempt, if not downright disgust 
for a publication which would slander an entire community for the 
sake of a few dollars in the guise of being a news magazine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once that spoken or written word is distributed it becomes 
easier for the next media to come along and build on the original 
myth.  This article was followed by a shot at the entire Ottawa 
valley community under the veil of humour by the tax dollar 
funded national broadcaster when in its program <I>The Royal 
Canadian Air Farce</I> suggested that inbreeding was a cottage 
industry in Ontario ridings held by Canadian Alliance members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a problem with public servants disguised as journalists, 
or in this case a poet.  I would expect safeguards to be built 
into the position of poet laureate.  Poets have the ability to 
stir up powerful emotions in the same way as a writer.  As we 
consider the office of poet laureate, we must be cognizant of 
this fact.  Is this position intended to unify us as a nation or 
is it intended to stir us up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read with great interest the debates in the other place 
regarding the bill.  There are many more questions in my mind 
than time will allow today.  I have great difficulty with the 
proposed legislation which goes to the very heart of what we are 
discussing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the position of poet laureate appropriate in a country like 
Canada that has evolved into a multicultural mosaic?  I make this 
point because in the examples of those countries such as Great 
Britain which have created positions of poet laureate, they are 
very dissimilar to our experience in that theirs is a 
monocultural experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The observation has been made that it is appropriate for there 
to be one poet laureate.  Should there not be two to reflect the 
bicultural nature of our institutions?  While that may reflect 
the English-French diversity, what about the first nations 
people?  This past century has been characterized by a migration 
that is neither French nor English.  We are a work in progress 
when it comes to the society we are building in the northern half 
of this continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we as parliamentarians want to associate ourselves with one 
voice that will not be able, by virtue of the way that the craft 
of poetry is reflected, to reflect the nation we have become in 
the 21st century? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it was stated in the other place that leadership 
depends upon individual voices leading.  What the position would 
be able to achieve would depend upon what leadership and what 
voices.  I fear that a poet laureate would be constrained by the 
official position and so defeat the purpose for which it was 
intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the sponsors of the bill for the spirit in which the 
proposal has been brought forward.  I look forward to continued 
debate on the subject.

We just might be more cautious<BR> 
So they wouldn't hang their head.

Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for St. John's West.  I hope <I>Hansard</I> will 
appropriately record the remarks with rhyming couplets and iambic 
pentameter.  Hopefully <I>Hansard</I> is capable of doing that.  I 
am not too sure about translation, but I am sure it will do its 
best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to commend the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine for bringing forward the bill in 
this place and the hon. senators for creating it in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now comes the boring stuff, with just a little discussion about 
the bill itself.  The role of the proposed poet laureate would 
consist of writing poetry for use in parliament on occasions of 
state as well as sponsoring poetry readings.  The poet laureate 
would also provide advice to the parliamentary librarian 
regarding the enrichment of the library's cultural holdings to 
include significant poets who have made major contributions to 
Canadians' understanding of who we are as a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal calls for a poet laureate to be selected for a two 
year term by the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Speaker 
of the Senate.  The laureate would be chosen from a list of three 
names submitted by a committee chaired by the parliamentary 
librarian.  The other members of the committee would be the 
national librarian, the national archivist of Canada, the 
commissioner of official languages of Canada, and the chair of 
the Canada Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the poet laureate is a time honoured and well 
established tradition in several countries, as has been mentioned 
earlier.  England named its first poet laureate in 1616.  The 
position became an official royal office in 1668.  Until 
recently, the office of poet laureate was awarded for life, but 
since 1999 the laureate has been named for a 10 year term.  The 
laureate is chosen by the reigning sovereign from a list 
submitted by the prime minister.  The laureate's duties are to 
write poems suitable for court and state occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has had a poet laureate, known by various 
titles, for about 61 years.  In the U.S.A., the poet laureate 
serves a one year term and is appointed by the librarian of 
congress.  The poet laureate there receives an annual stipend of 
$35,000, which is funded by private donations.  The laureate's 
role is to increase the citizenry's appreciation of reading and 
writing poetry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within Canada, the province of Saskatchewan invested a 
provincial poet laureate in the fall of the year 2000.  This made 
it the first Canadian province to demonstrate in this manner its 
commitment to the recognition of artists and the arts as a vital 
force in the community that reaches even into official life. 
The poet laureate of Saskatchewan is an honorary position whose 
role it is to celebrate the spirit of the people and places of 
Saskatchewan and to serve as a focal point for the expression of 
Saskatchewan's culture.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The poet laureate of Saskatchewan attends public events, 
participates in provincial celebrations, including those 
presented by the Government of Saskatchewan, and writes poems 
addressing the history, the beauty, the character and heritage of 
the province and its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poetry holds an important place in the lives of many Canadians. 
Poetry readings take place in many settings.  Poems are published 
in books, magazines and even on buses and subways.  Many 
thousands of Canadians put much time and effort into writing 
poems of all sorts for all occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the creation of the position of poet laureate state 
occasions would be added on the list of times and places in which 
Canadians could experience the power of poetry.  By writing poems 
for significant state occasions a poet laureate might provide a 
creative and lasting record of those events for generations to 
come.  Featuring poetry at such events would also be a means of 
paying tribute to the creativity and genius of our artists and of 
honouring the important place of poetry in our heritage and 
identity.  Indeed Canadian poetry reflects the diversity of 
Canadian people.  What better place to express this diversity 
than at state occasions which are significant for all Canadians? 
What better means to express it than through poetry which is the 
voice of and for the people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the proposal before us here today is an 
initiative that has many positive elements and one that is worthy 
of further consideration by the House.  I would therefore support 
having the bill sent to committee for more detailed study.  The 
committee could focus on the most appropriate means whereby such 
a position could be created.  In addition, the appropriate 
committee could examine the feasibility of what is apparently the 
bill's mandatory requirement for the position.  It may be that 
this mandatory requirement could be made optional or permissive 
to give parliament the flexibility with respect to the 
appointment, its timing and to provide flexibility with our 
cultural communities as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course Canadian poets have a long tradition of raising their 
voices about the beauty and diversity of our land.  Since the 
days when this country was first proclaimed our poets have sung 
its praises.  Numerous poets in both official languages and in 
all of the languages of our multicultural citizens, including our 
aboriginal languages, have written, published and recited poems 
about this land, its people and the events that make us who we 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who among our French speaking citizens has not heard of Émile 
Nelligan, Saint-Denys Garneau, two of our most famous poets of 
the early 20th century?  Before that poets like Crémazie and 
Fréchette were instrumental in helping to define French Canada in 
the 19th century.  Who among our English speaking population is 
not aware of the poetry of Gwendolyn MacEwen, Leonard Cohen, 
Michael Ondaatje or Margaret Atwood? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because poetry plays a significant role in the lives of 
our people that the Government of Canada spearheaded the 
celebrations of world poetry on March 21 of this year.  World 
Poetry Day was declared by UNESCO in 1999 to lend recognition and 
new impetus to poetic movements around the world.  As UNESCO's 
director general, Koichiro Matsuura said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poetry is not very demanding: a voice or a sheet of paper are 
enough to give it life.  We meet with poetry at all times and in 
all places, thus providing its universality and transcendent 
nature. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the celebrations of World Poetry Day, the Department 
of Canadians Heritage mailed poetry day packets to more than 
3,000 high schools and middle schools across Canada.  These 
packets encouraged teachers to involve their students in the 
celebration of World Poetry Day by engaging in activities as 
diverse as poetry itself, writing poems, holding poetry readings, 
submitting poems to community newspapers, inviting poets to speak 
in the schools, studying Canadian poetry and promoting poetry in 
public transit vehicles and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Canadian Heritage also created a World Poetry 
Day website which besides providing information about Canadian 
poetry and poetry day events, provided a forum for Canadian 
students to show their poetry to the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since World Poetry Day, as declared by UNESCO, happened to have 
coincided with the International Day for the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, the Department of Canadian Heritage 
married the two themes for 2001 and sponsored the publication of 
a special issue of two Canadian poetry magazines, <I>Prairie 
Fire</I> based in Winnipeg and <I>Arts le Sabord</I> based in 
Trois-Rivieres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These special issues featured original poetry on the theme of 
diversity and tolerance and their ethnic and cultural dimensions. 
They were launched on March 21 at celebrations across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in the spirit of celebrating diversity and understanding 
among peoples through the medium of poetry, the Department of 
Canadian Heritage partnered with the embassy of El Salvador in 
sponsoring an evening of “Poetry of the Americas” in Ottawa 
again on March 21, featuring poems from more than 20 countries in 
the Americas.  Canadian poetry can stand with the best.  Canadian 
poets are recognized around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Canada's own P.K. Page was chosen as the poet whose work 
“Planet Earth” was read on World Poetry Day on international 
ground at the United Nations, at the top of Mount Everest, in 
Antarctica and in international waters of the West Philippine 
Sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These readings took place as part of the United Nations dialogue 
among civilizations through poetry, a way of using this universal 
form of expression to enhance understanding among nations, a much 
needed exercise owing to the increasing interaction and contact 
among peoples of all races and nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we in Canada also celebrate in our history and 
heritage, the interaction of great diversity of peoples who, 
through their experiences both different and shared, have joined 
together to create this great country we call Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I support the principles underlying the bill and 
perhaps the bill itself.  I urge members to support the passage

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  Order, please.  The House in committee of 
the whole on Government Business No. 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I call the debate and because we are endeavouring into 
uncharted waters, I will make a few opening remarks as to how 
this debate will be conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there have been take note debates in the House on many 
previous occasions, tonight we are dealing with a slightly 
different situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion under which we are meeting provides that the debate 
will be conducted under our standing orders for committees of the 
whole, namely, that no member shall speak for more than 20 
minutes with no period of questions and comments.  Second, that 
members may speak more than once.  Third, that members need not 
to be in their own seat to be recognized.  That is why we see our 
hon. friend from Brandon—Souris so close to the Chair this 
evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I understand this format has been chosen to 
create a more informal atmosphere that will promote genuine 
dialogue among members on this issue.  In that sense I believe we 
are embarking on something of an experiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As your Chair, I must be guided by the rules of the committee of 
the whole.  However, if members, and only if members agree, I 
would be prepared to exercise discretion and flexibility in the 
application of these rules.  That way I hope all participants can 
make good use of their time and take full advantage of the 
availability and accessibility of ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the co-operation of all members, I hope we may all learn 
some valuable lessons tonight about how this type of debate can 
best be conducted, so as to be a productive forum for exploring 
issues of public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to your co-operation.  Myself and other occupants 
during the debate will demonstrate the flexibility that hopefully 
will allow us to create a forum of discussion on public policy 
that will be attractive to members on both sides of the House and 
if not more important to all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That the committee take note of the state of Canada's resource 
industries.

<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Rural 
Development)(Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern 
Ontario), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to rise in this 
debate and to recognize all parties for agreeing to this special 
format.  It will lend itself well to a good discussion about a 
subject that is very close to my heart and I am sure to members 
who are gathered in the House.  That is the sustainability of our 
natural resource economies which in essence is the sustainability 
of rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take a look at rural Canada, it is not hard to realize 
that for the most part we are dependent on our natural resource 
industries for our economic well-being, for the wealth of our 
citizens and for the quality of life of those who live in rural 
areas.  Whether it is depending on the agricultural industry or 
on the fisheries or on mining or forestry, in rural Canada we are 
very much dependent on our natural resource industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think about it, our natural resource industries account 
for more than 15% of our gross domestic product and close to 14% 
of the jobs in Canada are based on our primary industries.  A 
large part of our trade surplus that we enjoy as a nation is as a 
result of our ability to harvest our natural resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, since it came to office in 1993, has a long and 
I think a very positive history of understanding and dealing with 
the natural resource sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall in the previous parliament the Speech from the Throne 
in 1996 speaking directly for the first time in many years to the 
needs of rural Canada, to the need to sustain our natural 
resource industries and to the need to sustain the rural 
communities that depend on those natural resource industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leading out of those commitments that were made in the Speech 
from the Throne in 1996, I had the honour and the privilege of 
chairing the natural resource committee in 1997 when we travelled 
around the country and talked with rural Canadians and produced 
something called “The Think Rural Report”.  I see the hon. 
member for Athabasca who was a member of that committee and who 
worked with me and I see others who were on that committee at the 
time to produce that report.  I should also mention that the 
report was a unanimous report.  All parties in the House that day 
agreed to the recommendations that we made in there about 
sustaining rural Canada, sustaining our natural resource 
industries and ensuring that they remained an integral part of 
our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased that leading out of that report the government of 
1998 brought forward the Canadian rural partnership, an 
initiative by which we were able to deal with the issues of rural 
Canada and the issues of our natural resource industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was further pleased when in 1999 the Prime Minister created a 
separate position for rural Canada, a position which I occupy 
right now, secretary of state for rural Canada, to ensure that 
the issues that surround rural Canadians and surround our natural 
resource industries would be front and centre of the discussions 
and the debates that took place here in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also pleased to see in the budget last February some very 
specific commitments to rural Canada and some very specific 
commitments to sustaining our natural resource industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important things, and I hope we have a chance to 
talk about this in debate today, is the need for us as 
parliamentarians, for the government and for Canadians in general 
to understand that the challenges that rural Canadians face and 
that our natural resource communities face are unique.  They are 
different from those that are often faced by an urban community 
from the urban parts of the country.  We need to approach, from a 
public policy perspective, what we do in a way that recognizes 
and understands those unique challenges that we face in rural 
Canada and in our natural resource communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think about it for a second, we can clearly see those 
challenges.  First, there is the challenge of geography.  When 
someone comes from rural Canada there is a whole lot of 
geography.  One of the issues concerns how we deliver services. 
How do we provide either public or private services over vast 
geographic areas?  It is very different from how we may approach 
it in a very tightly populated urban centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the issue of population density.  When we are 
trying to attract investment to rural Canada and to communities 
that are dependent on the natural resource industries, we often 
do not have the density of population nor the market size where 
we can readily attract the private sector to make the same type 
of investments they may be willing to do all on their own in an 
urban area.  We need to approach things differently where we 
often need to have public-private partnerships in order for that 
type of investment to occur in rural communities.  Infrastructure 
is a good example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telecommunications infrastructure may happen all by itself in a 
large urban centre because the population density and the market 
size are there.  That same infrastructure, just as essential in 
rural areas, will not happen through the private sector because 
the market size is not there.  We need those types of 
partnerships, public and private. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is the distance from market.  If people are 
dealing in rural Canada or in the natural resource industries, 
they have the unique challenge of distance from market.  If one 
is a small entrepreneur or small business person trying to set 
up, that is a challenge that he or she may have to face in rural 
Canada but not one in urban Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important differences and one that I am sure the 
members in the House know and the viewers from rural Canada 
understand is that our economies that are natural resource based 
tend to be cyclical in nature.  They are very much based on 
commodity prices and commodity prices fluctuate.  That means that 
we very often have a different type of economy than what we may 
find in a diversified manufacturing based or technologically 
based urban economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that means is that we need to take a different public 
policy approach when we are dealing with rural natural resource 
based economies than we may take when we are dealing with the 
manufacturing diversified technologically based urban economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the successes of the government, and we could have a 
debate about the degree of that success I suspect, is that we 
have an understanding that there are in fact unique challenges 
that face rural communities and that we need to approach our 
economies in rural areas differently to reflect those challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach itself has to be important.  From my perspective, 
there are four major approaches that are appropriate.  One of 
those approaches we call the rural lens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rural lens, which is one of my responsibilities as the 
Secretary of State for Rural Development, ensures that when 
we consider policy, when we consider legislation and when we 
consider responding to the issues of the day, we make sure that 
we do it in a way that makes sense for rural Canadians as much as 
it makes sense for urban Canadians, so that the solution does not 
just make sense in the big cities of Canada but that it makes 
sense in the small communities and the rural areas.  The rural 
lens puts the responses that we are making, whether they be 
legislative or regulatory, through a lens to ensure that they 
make as much sense on Main Street, rural Canada as they do on 
Main Street, urban Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I believe that as we deal with the issues of rural 
Canada and the issues of natural resource based economies, that 
we must take a bottom up and not a top down approach.  We must 
allow communities themselves to determine the best way to achieve 
their economic sustainability. It would reflect that the needs of 
the fishing community in Newfoundland are very different from a 
mining community in northern Ontario, an agricultural community 
on the prairies or a forestry community in British Columbia. 
Although they all face those unique challenges I talked about 
before, their solutions to those challenges will be and need to 
be reflective of their particular needs.  That is why it is 
important that we have a bottom up approach where we empower 
communities to set their strategies and to move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the senior levels of government, whether that be 
provincial or federal, is to provide those communities with a set 
of tools that allows them to pursue their objectives in a way 
that makes sense for them.  That is why we have such tools as the 
regional development agencies, in my particular case, in northern 
Ontario, FEDNOR.  The reason we have the community futures 
program, where we saw a $90 million investment, and an 
infrastructure program that has a specific amount targeted for 
rural areas, is so we can help provide the tools to these 
communities as they pursue those plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington.  Given the formality of 
the debate tonight, I look perhaps to engaging a little later 
with my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  I thank the minister.  I will be seeking 
his guidance from time to time.  I will be receptive to hearing 
questions, not only during his interventions but possibly if 
someone felt that it would be more appropriate to have a short 
exchange right now in terms of questions with the minister I am 
prepared to entertain that.  If not, I will go around once to 
every representative of each party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want members to keep in mind that when any member has the 
floor they are free to make interventions, to also ask questions 
and to receive replies. I am in your hands.  I see the member for 
Vancouver Island North rising.  I would ask all members on either 
side for their questions and to be succinct and the replies also, 
so that as much as possible we can maximize our time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to ask a succinct 
question of the secretary of state.  It relates to the rural 
economies, certainly in my part of British Columbia or in coastal 
British Columbia, that are in very deep trouble in many respects.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard some federal hints that there will be program 
announcements.  I think the minister made some reference to that. 
However, there is certainly a lack of clarity.  I wonder if the 
minister could offer any more clarity than what is a general 
issue right now in terms of what people at home know about what 
the government is planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I am not in a position 
to get specific about what future announcements may be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back to what I was saying when I was wrapping up my 
speech.  The concept is to first empower communities, coastal 
communities being a good example because they have a set of needs 
and concerns that are very different than a prairie agricultural 
community, to establish what it is they need to do to sustain 
their communities.  That process is taking place in many of our 
coastal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the federal government at that point would be to 
then listen to what those community needs are and then to develop 
a set of tools to assist them.  Some of those tools have already 
been announced.  We have talked about an infrastructure program 
that lays the basic groundwork.  We talked about having the 
availability of the community futures program that provides 
access to capital. If we are going to diversify and grow our 
economy we need access to capital.  That is another tool that is 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move forward we will have additional tools that will allow 
these communities to sustain themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. Chairman, 
my question is for the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there is an economic development agency in northern 
Ontario called FedNor. We also know that Abitibi—Témiscamingue is 
a resource area similar to northern Ontario which is being 
supported by FedNor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it be possible for FedNor to get involved in northern 
Quebec? We have been going through a decline in the past three 
years. Could FedNor get involved? If not, could a new agency be 
set up to provide assistance to northern resource areas? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Chairman, it is quite true that 
in the case of northern Quebec and northern Ontario we do share 
many of the same issues when it comes to sustaining our mining 
industry.  I know the member has worked hard in his riding and 
with his communities on their sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have undertaken a joint initiative where we are trying to 
assist our mining communities in terms of recovering from low 
commodity prices and some of the ramifications.  A regional 
development agency, CED, also covers Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than creating a separate structure, we need to have 
co-ordination between the two agencies to ensure that we deliver 
the program in a unified and comprehensive way when we are 
dealing with a problem that really crosses provincial boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional development agencies are positive things.  Although 
they are separate entities unto themselves, they are co-ordinated 
collectively through the Industry Canada portfolio. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I 
appreciate the format this evening which allows more interaction 
between the government and opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a quick question on private woodlot taxation.  There are 
around 440,000 private woodlot owners in Canada.  There are 
certainly more on the east coast than on the west coast but they 
are certainly prevalent across the country.  Part of the 
challenge woodlot owners face is an onerous tax burden because 
they tend to harvest their woodlots every 50 to 80 years in a 
cyclical manner. There is no way to amortize that profit over a 
10 or 15 year tax period.  They pay their tax up front, all at 
once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have been suggesting and pushing the government to do is 
to find a way to accommodate private woodlot owners so they do 
not have to pay all the tax up front and can amortize the tax 
payable over a 10 year period.  This would provide them with the 
opportunity to do some replanting, some thinning and some 
silviculture practices in the meantime so they have some expenses 
to claim against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the minister's comments on that and the 
possibility of looking at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Chairman, obviously specific tax 
policies fall within the purview of the Minister of Finance.

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives me an opportunity to refer to a very important point 
that the member made.  We need to ensure, as we deal with the 
comprehensive national issue of tax reform, that we do it in a 
way which makes sense for rural Canada and rural Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The woodlot situation is an example of that.  That is part of 
what I talked about in terms of rural lens.  Yes, we have to deal 
with taxation as a comprehensive issue for all Canadians, but we 
must make sure that even though woodlot owners are a small 
percentage of the overall economy they are an important part of 
the economy.  They are an important part of the rural economy and 
their needs through the rural lens need to be taken into account 
when we undertake tax reform. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Chairman, my 
colleague from South Shore has raised the same issue.  If woodlot 
owners were given the capacity to deduct expenses for 
silviculture in the same way as the farming community would 
actually do, it would enable them to offset the cost of managing 
woodlots in environmentally sustainable ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite often, when woodlots are passed on from an inheritance 
perspective, it may be more cost effective because they cannot 
pay the inheritance tax and the capital gains tax to clear-cut 
the woodlots.  They have no other choice.  It is a very perverse 
way from an environmental perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Minister of Finance has been amenable to looking at 
that, so I would say to the hon. minister that this is an issue 
of public policy of which I know the Minister of Finance is 
aware.  He seems to be amenable to doing something, and we would 
seek his help to try to move that particular yardstick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I am sure the Minister of 
Finance is familiar with the issues that the two members have 
raised.  I am certain he will give them his consideration as he 
looks on an ongoing basis at reforms to the tax system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, this is 
certainly an interesting format.  About a year or so ago, along 
with colleagues from both sides of the House, I was fortunate to 
attend a rural economic development conference in Magog, Quebec. 
It was a great success.  It was open to all of us.  About 500 
Canadians from sea to sea to sea, from rural and remote 
communities, attended that conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This the first time in the history of the House that we have had 
a minister for rural Canada.  I want to recognize that.  Will 
there be more of these conferences?  It was a great learning 
experience.  I learned a lot as I am sure a lot of other people 
did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all colleagues to come to the next one.  Has the 
final report of that conference been published yet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Chairman, the member is quite 
right in terms of having a national conference in Magog a year 
ago this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives me an opportunity to make a distinction.  It is not a 
consultation process.  It is a dialogue process.  It is an 
ongoing process where we reach out to rural Canadians from across 
Canada on an ongoing basis.  We want to hear their perspectives 
and their suggestions and then in return to feed back to them our 
reactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically the process during the off year, which is this year 
as we had the conference last year, is that there is a series of 
regional conferences.  There will be another national conference 
next year.  The action plan leading out of that, where we 
specifically committed to do the things that were brought forward 
to us in Magog, I expect and hope to have public within the next 
month or so.

listened carefully to what the secretary of state had to say and 
he did not mention anything about creating a partnership with 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last 50 years, the federal government has dealt with 
regional development. During the last 50 years, numerous 
programs were implemented with none of them taking into 
consideration the specificity of the various communities and 
their development which the provincial government has been 
promoting.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if he would go that far. I have many more 
questions for him, but this one is a good place to start. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Chairman, the member 
makes an excellent point.  For rural development to work well, it 
needs to have as many partners at the table as possible.  The 
provincial government is certainly one of those partners.  I have 
had an opportunity to have meetings, not with the new minister in 
Quebec but with the previous minister in the region, Mr. Jolivet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially we agree that the orchestra leader, the leader of 
rural development, has to be the communities themselves.  It is 
the federal and provincial governments which supply the tools. 
The hon. member is right.  We have to make sure that we do not 
duplicate what the provincial government provides the community 
in the form of a tool.  Obviously the federal government does not 
need to provide that tool or vice versa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good example, though, of where we work in co-operation with 
rural communities is the infrastructure program, which is a 
tripartite program with financial assistance coming from the 
municipality, from the provincial government and from the federal 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural 
Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Chairman, I am very happy to join in the 
debate tonight. I would like to thank the member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik for his initiative. 
Natural resources is 
a tremendously important sector for my riding of 
Timiskaming—Cochrane and for Northern Ontario as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Natural resources represent a very important sector for Canada 
and account for 11% of our gross domestic product, or $90 
billion, $100 billion a year in exports, a positive trade 
balance of $60 billion. It is the livelihood of close to 3.5 
million Canadians in more than 600 communities and represents 
750,000 direct jobs, good jobs to boot, and as many indirect 
ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resource industries are some of those who invest the most in 
capital equipment in Canada, a majority of their investments 
going to scientific and technologic innovations. A good number 
of our resource industries are among the most innovative in our 
economy and their productivity is growing faster than the 
average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should prove that the Canadian resource sector has nothing 
quaint about it. 
These are world class and knowledge-based industries. They have a 
rich intellectual capital and are part and parcel of the new 
global economy of the 21st century, which is based on knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They need it to reduce their operating costs, increase their 
productivity and competitiveness and overcome the difficult 
conditions and uncertain success due to the Canadian scene. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because a strong natural resource industry is so important to 
Canada, because we have learned to excel, to innovate and to be a 
leader in almost every facet of this global business, it is 
crucial for government to lay a solid foundation for natural 
resources to thrive in the 21st century, guided by the principles 
of sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is working hard to lay the right 
foundation for this sector, balancing environmental, social and 
economic concerns in three ways:  by providing sound economic 
fundamentals, and we have done that in the last seven or eight 
years; by encouraging innovation and knowledge so we remain at 
the cutting edge; and by promoting environmental stewardship and 
sustainable communities.  These are the three areas I would like 
to address this evening. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first area is sound economic foundations. The most recent federal 
mini-budget of last October delivered some of the tangible results 
of the success Canada has achieved in its fight to eliminate the 
deficit and to restore fiscal responsibility. Canada is stronger 
today since it is in the best financial position it has ever been 
in the recent past, as evidenced by the comments made by the 
International Monetary Fund.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, according to the IMF, Canada should continue to enjoy 
sustained economic growth and be able to react well to the 
economic downturn in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new budget brought good news for Canada's mineral industry 
with its 15% tax credit for flow-through shares investment in 
exploration projects in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure was put it place as a result of a grassroots 
campaign led by an effective coalition headed by the Prospectors 
and Developers Association of Canada, the Canadian Drilling 
Association and several members on this side of the House. My 
colleagues from northern Ontario and northern Quebec, including 
the member for Kenora—Rainy River, the Secretary of State for 
Rural Development, the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, 
the member for Timmins—James Bay and myself have understood the 
benefits of exploration in our communities. I must say that it 
was not easy to convince the Minister of Finance. We had to work 
hard to convince him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope this tax credit will attract new investments in 
exploration in Canada, especially since other levels of 
government have added their own programs to it. Such is the case 
in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, PDAC announced that flow-through financing coupled 
with tax credits and totalling about $30 million was confirmed 
just before the end of the year 2000. I am told that investments 
are growing for the year 2001, which looks very promising. 
I hope that more investors, advisors and stakeholders in the 
financial sector will take note of this major new incentive in 
the months to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax measure makes it more appealing to invest in mineral 
exploration. Since there is a more favourable treatment of 
capital gains, which we reviewed in the last budget, and a 
commitment to fiscal prudence on the part of the government, it 
can be said that a sounder economic base is in place. The 
minerals and metals sector, like the Canadian economy as a 
whole, can conduct its activities in a sounder context, and it 
is in a better position in the race for capital money on 
international markets. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to my second point, the need to focus on 
knowledge and promoting innovation to be competitive in global 
markets.  Innovation is about making opportunities happen, and 
without it we cannot succeed in the marketplace.  By turning 
ideas into action, by finding new and creative ways to do things, 
companies can gain a competitive advantage and become leaders 
internationally in their respective fields.  They can generate 
greater profits and a larger market share and they can create 
quality jobs.  This is what we have done in Canada with the 
mining sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Innovation is a fundamental characteristic of our natural 
resources sector.  Let us think of our success in exploration and 
mining, geomatics, remote sensing, mapping, surveying and 
environmental engineering.  Our high tech natural resources 
industry generates economic, environmental and social benefits 
right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact there are more mining jobs in Toronto than 
there are in rural Canada.  People do not realize that there are 
over 25,000 direct jobs in Toronto related to mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sector builds strong links to other sectors.  One obvious 
example is the sheer volume of commodity traffic that natural 
resources generate for our Canadian railway system.  Where would 
Canadian National and Canadian Pacific be without natural 
resources?  Canada's natural resources industries also purchase 
more computer equipment than all other Canadian manufacturing 
industries combined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is this idea in big cities that mining and forestry are 
backwoods industries and do not belong in a new age economy. That 
is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value of our natural resources, the very nature of the 
industry, is often misunderstood.  Some would have us believe 
that natural resources have a diminished role to play in a dot 
com universe because they have not kept up with the times.  The 
reality as we all know is very different.  The brain power and 
the technology used by this sector today are as sophisticated and 
innovative as any other.  We need to get this message out across 
Canada and around the world.  We must promote the innovative 
nature of our natural resources sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Toronto not too long ago at the PDAC annual meeting.  I 
met with members of a delegation from the Japanese mineral and 
metal association.  They were worried that Canada would not 
continue to produce the minerals that they needed.  They had 
heard the Prime Minister talking about making Canada the most 
connected country, the most innovative, and being in the 
forefront of the high tech economy.  I reassured them that the 
mineral industry was still the mainstay of our economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian resource companies recognize the importance of 
innovation. This is why, in the recent throne speech in which 
the Government of Canada stated its priorities for the years to 
come, natural resources were put under the theme “innovation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government pledged “to promote innovation, growth and 
development in all parts of our economy”, including our resource 
sector. We will achieve that goal by doubling our investments in 
research and development. 
These investments, and I am quoting the throne speech, “will 
directly benefit Canadians in areas such as ...natural resources 
management”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, natural resource industries invest heavily in 
Canadian research and development, including research on the use 
of state of the art technologies, such as robotics, computer 
vision, environmental technology and specialized software. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must go even further. We must invest in the new technologies 
to maintain a competitive edge and remain a truly sustainable 
industry for the future. Natural resources must be part of a 
renewed will to promote research and development in our country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good example of how innovative the mining industry has become 
allows an operator to be sitting in a Toronto office and running 
a scoop tram in a Sudbury mine using a computer.  This prevents 
injuries to workers, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  I will have to interrupt the hon. 
parliamentary secretary.  He was sharing his 20 minute block with 
the secretary of state.  The beauty of being in committee of the 
whole is that members can come back and speak subsequently.  I am 
sure he will have the opportunity to conclude his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order not to monopolize the time on one side or the other, we 
have had approximately 30 minutes on the government side with the 
original 10 minute intervention of the secretary of state and 
approximately 10 minutes of questions and comments.  I will now 
turn to the opposition parties. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Chairman, we are all in a learning process tonight of how this 
format will work.  It is a refreshing idea and I am pleased to be 
a part of it.  So far the debate has been somewhat broader than I 
had expected, ranging from issues of rural communities and on 
from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came as a party prepared to discuss natural resources 
specifically and the state of Canada's natural resource 
industries from a number of different directions.  My direction 
will be the issue of energy as that is where my interest lies. My 
riding currently supplies 15% of Canada's fossil fuel energy and 
it is a huge issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We currently have some $30 billion to $35 billion worth of 
committed investment going into the riding and the development of 
heavy oil and tar sands.  All this is in view of the discussions 
that have been ongoing between Canada, the United States and 
Mexico on a continental energy program.  It is of great interest 
to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time not only we in opposition but the industry as well 
seems to be wondering what the government is talking about and 
what its position is particularly in view of the Prime Minister's 
recent announcement of the creation of an energy cabinet 
committee with a number of the most senior cabinet members in 
Canada's government sitting on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a curious emphasis put on an issue, particularly 
because Canada some time ago when it entered into the Canada-U.S. 
trade agreement and the Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade agreement 
committed to a certain position on energy that binds Canada's 
energy industries essentially to supply.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The free trade agreement between Canada and the U.S. made 
commitments on behalf of Canada to guarantee delivery of Canada's 
energy to the United States.  The Americans are allowed to buy it 
at the same price that we Canadians are allowed to buy it.  We 
are not allowed to ration those energy resources to the Americans 
any more than we ration them to ourselves.  It really has the 
industry and many western Canadians curious that the issue of the 
continental energy policy might be more than what is already 
committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are issues dealing with the Mexican petroleum industry and 
issues around the North American electrical industry that need 
some discussion, investment and development.  However, regarding 
the fossil fuel energy industry, it seems we are addressing 
ghosts that do not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the whole issue of the free trade agreement and 
how we got into that position in the first place is curious and 
of some concern to me.  It is part of Canada's history that we 
went through a national energy program under a former Liberal 
government which raided the natural resource of the fossil fuel 
industries of Alberta and the west to the tune of some $60 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reaction to that program and that raid on the wealth of one 
of Canada's provinces resulted in a move by the premier and the 
energy minister of that province to fight very hard on behalf of 
my province and the natural resource industry in my riding to 
protect the industry and the province from that ever happening 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a serious mistake, not only on behalf of a previous 
Liberal government but on behalf of a province in Canada that 
moved to protect its interests the way it did.  If Canada had 
been behaving as a country should have in a time of crisis with a 
short energy supply and threats of energy interruption from other 
parts of the world, it should have moved to provide the assurance 
of energy supply and price to all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should have provided an assurance from the west as the 
national energy program had proposed to do and at the same time 
returned or exchanged that assurance of supply and price from the 
western producing regions to central and eastern Canada.  The 
return should have been some kind of benefit to those provinces 
to counterbalance the loss of income from those provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had that happened we would have been behaving like a country 
should have in the interests of the entire country.  We would 
have been in a better position today to deal with the energy 
crunch we faced last winter and that we will face again.  We are 
looking at perhaps record gasoline prices for Canadian consumers 
this summer.  All of that is related in some way to the history 
of the whole national energy program and the reaction to it in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even as recently as a couple of weeks ago in committee, some 
government members were using some of the language I heard so 
often back in 1980 about the national interest and how the 
government had a responsibility to act in the national interest 
when dealing with energy prices and protecting the interests of 
consumers across Canada.  That scares the heck out of people in 
my part of the country because of the history.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government today gives assurances that we will not 
revisit the national energy program, there are still concerns 
that the interests of a more populous region of Canada will take 
precedence over the producing regions in the national interest. 
It would be a shame to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move into this negotiated continental energy program, the 
power that has been presented by the government in the creation 
of this energy cabinet committee again raises concerns.  We do 
not understand what is going on.  Everyone is hoping the 
government will provide some clarity and assurance that when we 
start negotiating with Mexico and the United States to engage in 
this continental energy program that the interests of all 
Canadians will be paramount.  The benefits of the development of 
the energy supply to the United States from primarily Alberta 
will certainly provide great opportunities for Albertans, for 
Canadians from coast to coast and for people from all over the 
world who would come to my part of Canada, my riding, to find 
employment in highly paid, skilled jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do appreciate and want those great things but at the same 
time we want the interests of all Canadians to be kept in mind. 
Albertans are fair-minded and are willing to consider those 
benefits but we should do it in a national perspective.  If a 
compromise is asked for in one area to achieve an objective, then 
there should be give on the other end as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the negotiations on this national energy policy we could all 
come out winners if we do it properly.  Some of us, or perhaps 
even all of us, could come out serious losers if we fall to the 
interests of the Americans who, quite frankly, do not give a 
sweet tweet about the Canadian environment or Canadian rural 
communities.  They want our energy and they will have our energy 
one way or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like assurances that the Government of Canada will fight 
hard and negotiate hard in the interests of Canadians and of 
rural Canadians in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  I understand the member for Athabasca is 
splitting his time with the member for Vancouver Island North. 
Before I give the floor to the member for Vancouver Island North, 
are there any questions for the member for Athabasca?  The hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré:</B>  Mr. Chairman, the member asked a few 
questions and he probably would like a response from the 
government side.  I am pleased to do so.  The member had me 
worried for a while.  I thought he was asking for a return to the 
national energy program which I do not think would do well in his 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me reassure all members, if they have been listening to the 
Minister of Natural Resources, and specifically to the Prime 
Minister when he was in Calgary, that the government has no 
intention of going back to an NEP type of program.  We are 
talking about a continental energy program or policy.  We prefer 
to call it an expansion of the continental energy market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is quite simple.  The Americans need more energy and 
we have a surplus of energy.  Whether it is the tar sands, 
Churchill Falls, a region of the country that can develop 
electricity or whether it is natural gas in the northwest, we 
have a huge potential to create jobs and wealth in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a government are willing to expand our market and to sell, 
for the benefit of all Canadians and specifically the provinces 
that produce energy, to the Americans and to the rest of the 
world, but only by respecting provincial jurisdictions and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Americans do invest we will not allow them to call 
the shots.  This government intends to maintain sovereignty over 
natural resources which is critical for the security and the 
well-being of any nation.  That is what we intend to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Chairman, the member for Athabasca 
talked about a former national energy policy, and there is a 
relevant point there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past governments have tended to raid natural resource 
profits from individual provinces or territories.  We have set 
that precedent and somehow or another we have to move away from 
that precedent.  The specific instance I am referring to is the 
east coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oil field on the east coast is now bringing in an 
unprecedented profit that was never there before.  That is in 
direct loggerheads with equalization payments.  When Alberta 
found its resources under the ground, the federal government 
accommodated Alberta by allowing it to keep the profit from those 
resources and its equalization payments from 1957 to 1964. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been asking the federal government to recognize the 
advantage it gave to Alberta so it could get out from under and 
become a have province instead of a have not province.  Nova 
Scotia, Newfoundland, Quebec or any province is never going to 
get out from under the yolk unless they are allowed to keep some 
of their profits.  It is not just the oil field.  It could be the 
mining industry or the diamond industry in the Northwest 
Territories or in Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member's comments on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Mr. Chairman, this has always been a 
favourite issue of mine so I thank the member for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has always been my position that the provinces should be 
treated equally.  Nova Scotia, or Newfoundland or British 
Columbia, where this is just becoming an issue, should be treated 
no differently than Alberta.  If the provinces where the industry 
develops are expected to provide the infrastructure to support 
the industry, they should reap the benefits of the development of 
that industry.  That can never happen if the federal government 
continues with its greed to demand ownership of a resource and 
benefit from a resource and then dribble money back to the 
province in whatever formula it thinks is appropriate for that 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has always been my and my party's position that the 
responsibility for the management, development and regulation of 
offshore resource development should be with the provinces. 
While constitutionally the supreme court chose that the federal 
government would own that industry, there is absolutely nothing 
to prevent it from delegating responsibility for the resource 
development, and therefore accruing the benefits of the resource 
just like Alberta does.  The sooner that happens the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we start meddling with equalization and start allowing the 
producing provinces to keep their equalization at the current 
level and at the same time enjoy whatever benefits the federal 
government thinks the province should have of the royalties, then 
again we are skewing the way the provinces are treated.  That is 
a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we simply delegate responsibility to Nova Scotia for offshore 
development or the same for Newfoundland, then those provinces 
take on the same responsibility as Alberta did to conduct the 
regulatory and environmental protection process.  They develop 
the infrastructure then they enjoy the benefit.  As that benefit 
increases with the development, the provinces lose in the gradual 
process that equalization and they become a have province the 
same as all other provinces that have achieved that status 
through resource development.  That seems to be the fair way to 
do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I am the chair of an ad 
hoc group called the coastal parliamentarians in British 
Columbia.  It is comprised of all federal members of parliament 
and provincial members of the legislature that touch on salt 
water.  Interesting issues come up in this group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that is very awkward is the fact that there is 
not a single government member of parliament from rural British 
Columbia, whether coastal or non-coastal. 
Therefore, there are an awful lot of frustrations on that file. 
What I am finding, and what is apparent to everyone, is that a 
lot of those frustrations deal with two departments, the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Department of 
Transport.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, what we are talking about tonight deals with the 
Secretary of State for Rural Development.  If members want to 
take some question out of what I am talking about tonight, one 
question would be how can we end the frustrations that we face in 
dealing with rural and remote coastal issues in British Columbia 
when we are dealing with a bureaucracy and a government side that 
does not really understand those issues?  Many of them are 
fixable.  One of the things that is becoming very apparent to us 
is that when those same kinds of issues are brought up in 
Atlantic Canada where there are government members, they get 
fixed an awful lot easier than what happens in our circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some real life examples right now.  Many of them are 
two-bit items that really hurt and public safety is often at 
risk.  I just fail to understand why the government would choose 
to put public safety at risk.  The marine travelling community is 
the busiest recreational waterway in Canada.  The federal 
government is basically abandoning its strong mandate for public 
safety in those areas by getting rid of rescue stations.  It was 
to do it this year.  Now it is saying it will not do it until 
next year.  It is just summertime events, not big cost items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting rid of the coast guard divers off the Hovercraft near 
Vancouver airport is putting people at risk.  We have every 
signal from the coast guard now that the destaffing of light 
stations will be back on the burner again.  The promise was not 
in this millennium, which I think was what the minister of the 
day said in terms of destaffing.  However we are into a new 
millennium now.  Those are great frustrations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the secretary of state refer to community futures and 
some initiatives with that group in rural communities.  We have 
rural coastal communities that have been denied community futures 
coverage.  They have written to the appropriate minister of the 
day on numerous occasions and have never received satisfaction. 
Maybe if I had had a chance to rise on a second question, that 
would have been my question.  How can this be?  It is a political 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  During the time of the member's 
intervention, he is free to use any of that time for a question 
to a member opposite or otherwise.  Within that 10 minutes 
timeframe that he has he can either speak or ask questions, 
whichever he might choose later on.  If he has a question that 
he wants to put, he should feel free to do it during this period. 
It is entirely his period to do with as he chooses, either to 
simply make a speech or mix it with questions.  The floor is his 
to do as he chooses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I think that is what I am 
doing but I appreciate the guidance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that occurs to me is that this is a new format, 
a different format.  We have some existing formats in the House 
of Commons that are used inappropriately. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1940"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT112"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT112"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1940

<A HREF="#LINKT111"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if I get up in the House of Commons during question 
period to ask a minister a question and do not get the full 
answer because of either time constraints or the minister is not 
really familiar with what I might be asking, I have the 
opportunity to file a piece of paper with the clerk and go on 
what is called the adjournment proceedings or the late show.  I 
have done that on numerous occasions.  Guess what?  The minister 
who responded to my question was never been there for the late 
show.  It was always a stock prepared answer.  It was as if it 
did not matter what I asked because the answer was just simply 
read. Some things could be done a whole bunch better around here. 
That is all my unprepared speech for tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three things I wanted to touch on.  I will do it very 
quickly.  One is we spent two years in this place.  I was on the 
natural resources committee in 1999 and 2000.  I know the 
secretary of state was on that in 1996.  We prepared a report 
called “Forest Management Practices in Canada as an 
International Trade Issue”.  We tabled it in June of 2000.  It 
was also a unanimous report and I think we said some very good 
things.  Of course, the government's response did not occur 
because of the election call.  Now we have resubmitted to the 
committee a request for the government to respond, which under 
the rules is within 150 days.  We are already looking at next 
September.  That is a year and a half after submission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some emergencies out there.  A lot of this report 
dealt with the mid-coast of British Columbia because that was 
like a litmus test for what was going on regarding the 
environmental pressures on international market access for forest 
products on the Canadian basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had recommendations in there for pro-active delivery of 
Canadian forest practice messages in our major markets.  We had a 
very practical program presented to our committee.  The committee 
was enthusiastic about endorsing that.  The commitment from the 
federal government was a minor one because industry and the 
provincial government in British Columbia had already bought in. 
The financial commitment being asked for was simply to 
demonstrate real commitment.  It was not to extract a bunch of 
money.  Guess what?  It fizzled.  There was nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, we have companies operating in the mid-coast, 
the provincial government to some extent, environmental 
organizations, Greenpeace and so on have signed some protocols. 
This was been a huge struggle.  Last week International Forest 
Products, a major operator on the B.C. coast, announced layoffs 
of 500 direct employees, 400 contract employees and the closure 
of a sawmill, which will have tremendous other implications as a 
consequence of what is happening on the mid-coast.  There are 
going to be other announcements from other companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this is happening and it is as if the federal government 
is blind to it.  The federal government has a mandate for 
international trade and international access to market issues. It 
is doing nothing to fulfill that mandate compared to what it 
could be doing.  Yes, I know we have an international partnership 
program run through the embassies, diplomats and so on.  This was 
a practical program that would have had real buy in.  It could 
have gone somewhere.  It could have done something. 
There is no excitement.  There is no response.  Everything is 
flat when it comes to the government response.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very strong suggestion from the Canadian Alliance in 
terms of something the government could do to help in the natural 
resources sector, that is, to implement the program and do it 
immediately.  There is no reason why it could not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program is a practical market access initiative put forward 
by forest workers, in this case IWA Canada, the international 
woodworkers and their largest local, which covers their coastal 
loggers, some forest workers in northern Ontario and also a fair 
chunk of the sawmill industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly I want to touch on the softwood lumber dispute for a 
just a few minutes.  We cannot ignore it if we are going to talk 
about natural resources.  All I want to say is that it is a great 
disappointment to me that although the official opposition, the 
Canadian Alliance, was proactive on that issue and had its 
position out as of June 7, 2000, until February of this year the 
Alliance still did not know what the government's position would 
be upon the expiry of the softwood lumber agreement.  We went 
through a federal election campaign never being able to extract 
from our British Columbia candidates or from our rural candidates 
where they were on the softwood lumber agreement.  That is not 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Chairman, an ex-Liberal member of parliament who is 
now the CEO of the Council of Forest Industries in British 
Columbia is saying exactly the same thing.  Where was the 
leadership when we needed it?  That was another letdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I want to touch on in my remaining 30 seconds is 
west coast oil and gas.  I want to serve notice today to anyone 
who is unaware of it that this is the next huge issue in British 
Columbia.  There is a coastal rural consensus that it is required 
and needed, and we have to get there.  We need to get there with 
provincial leadership and either federal leadership or federal 
non-interference.  That is the message I want to deliver. 
Obviously we would like proactive federal leadership, but at the 
very least the government should not put obstacles in the way. 
The senior members of the Liberal caucus from British Columbia 
need to receive that message very strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I just want to take a 
moment to respond to a couple of the points my colleague made in 
his presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the frustration in coastal communities in 
British Columbia.  One of the things I talked about in my speech 
was the need for us to have an opportunity as a federal 
government to understand and listen to the specific solutions the 
coastal communities themselves want to pursue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am pleased to be able to announce 
that this week in British Columbia 
one of those rural dialogue sessions I talked about is in fact 
occurring.  Members of the coastal communities of British 
Columbia will be attending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I am sure the hon. member knows, there is an organization in 
British Columbia, the Coastal Community Network, which represents 
many of the coastal communities.  I will take the opportunity 
when I am in British Columbia on Friday to meet with the CCN and 
discuss directly with its members many of the issues and concerns 
the hon. member has brought forward in the Chamber.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one last point on the issue of community futures, which 
the member has brought forward.  I would be pleased if he would 
have an opportunity to talk to me at some time later this week 
specifically.  I will endeavour with my colleague to undertake to 
find out the difficulties or to try to deal with the difficulties 
the member is alluding to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Chairman, this could be an 
interesting format.  I am thinking about a certain hour that is 
called QP when quite often we wish we had the chance to ask 
questions, even of our own ministers and even of the opposition. 
Perhaps down the road it will be the opposition that is not sure 
about this format. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member, who represents one of the most 
beautiful parts of our country, and all parts are great.  I want 
to clarify this.  He may not have time before he addresses 
another subject.  I admire ad hoc groups of all MPs for the 
coastal parts of B.C.  Our daughter is working and going to 
school there, and I do want to include the comment that there are 
some CAP sites in some very remote areas.  I know there is a need 
for more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague mentioned that this ad hoc group from the B.C. 
coast includes all the federal and provincial members.  I want to 
clarify this.  Does the ad hoc group include the Minister of the 
Environment, who I know is very passionate about not just the 
environment but coastal B.C.? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no props, but I am sure that in the future when we talk 
about our great resources in Canada we will perhaps focus even 
more on H2O. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I thank the member for his 
question.  I think the member's daughter may be my constituent. 
Am I correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Does the member think she voted for 
him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Yes, most likely she did vote for me. 
The member asked me if the member for Victoria, the Minister of 
the Environment, was a coastal parliamentarian.  It is ad hoc. 
Everyone gets the communications and can choose whether to attend 
or not attend, whether to participate in the e-mail network or 
not.  I will say that our annual meeting is actually held at the 
same time as the Coastal Community Network meeting.  The two 
groups are linked in that regard, although they are at arm's 
length.  This year's meeting was just a month ago, but 13 months 
ago the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans, as I recall, both attended and both spoke.  It was 
greatly appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a high level of support from the federal government at 
that time, but from my perspective, my vision, in the optics I 
saw this year, there was a low level of support.  Maybe that was 
because November is a terrible time to have an election and run 
all the machinery of government.  Everything gets out of sync and 
gets disjointed.  I am letting the member off the hook by saying 
that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Chairman, I will be 
splitting my time with the hon. member for Témiscamingue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely pleased to take part in this debate on the state 
of the natural resources of Canada and Quebec. I am going to 
use a topical example to address this question: softwood lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going through some extremely difficult times in 
connection with this.  We know the American commission has 
decided to look into Canadian trade practices, in what I would 
term a highly impertinent manner.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have a pretty tough row to hoe, and I feel it is 
important to have a clear picture of the situation, as it 
pertains to Quebec in particular, as far as the importance of 
wood as a resource and of the lumber industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had occasion to discuss this matter in the House several 
times, so hon. members will know that it accounts for 130,000 
jobs in Canada, which are directly connected with the industry. 
The figure for Quebec is 40,000 jobs.  Quebec is the 
second highest producer, ranking after British Columbia, which 
is responsible for close to 25% of lumber production. 
It means that 7 billion board feet are produced annually, which 
represents a total value of $4 billion Canadian. About half a 
billion dollars are directly invested in the sawmill industry 
each year and some $65 million in the forest industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as Quebec and the regions of Quebec are concerned and I am 
looking at my colleagues and all of us are being affected by 
this crisis some 250 municipalities have sprung up around wood 
processing. In 135 towns and villages, all of the jobs are 
related to this industry. Except for our major urban sectors, all 
our rural, semi-rural and semi-urban regions are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is located in the Lanaudière area, which produces 
lumber. The ridings of my colleagues from Témiscamingue and 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean are also affected. In the Mauricie area 
that I had the opportunity to visit during a tour concerning 
the summit of the Americas, producers asked me a lot of questions 
about what we had done in the House. The same is true for the 
Lower St. Lawrence, the North Shore, the Eastern Townships, the 
Laurentians and many more areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This all goes to show how crucial the sawmill industry is for 
the regions of Quebec. This crisis in our trade relations with 
Canada is extremely serious, and we are following the situation 
very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, 51.4% of Quebec exports go to the United States, 
while the rest, or 47.6%, goes to Canada. As we can see, the 
U.S. market is a major outlet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec exports to the United States represent about $2 billion a 
year while Canadian exports as a whole represent about $10 
billion or $11 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important industry, an industry for which the free 
trade provided for under NAFTA must be maintained. It is widely 
known that for the last twenty years now, the American 
industry, and I should even say part of the American lumber 
industry, has been harassing the Canadian and Quebec industry as 
soon as our market reaches 30% of the American market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real reason of all that fuss is that the Canadian and Quebec 
industries have been successful over the years, thanks to the 
investments they made in their equipment and to their revamping 
of their production methods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lumber industry is closely related to the pulp and paper 
industry in Quebec. Accordingly, a great deal was done over the 
years with regard to the environment, work organization and 
investment in new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not that Canada and Quebec are subsidizing their 
industries by requiring very low stumpage fees. We all know that 
the investigations made in 1991-92 have shown that as far as the 
Canadian industry was concerned, especially in Quebec, there was 
no subsidy. Actually they really had to look hard to find a 0.01% 
subsidy. Therefore, the problem is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe people need to be reminded that since 1992 stumpage 
fees have been raised substantially in Quebec and in all of 
Canada's provinces.  For example, in 1992, when the most recent 
inquiry on the alleged subsidies took place, stumpage fees were 
$5.42 a thousand board feet.  In December, they were $9.26.  So 
they have just about doubled, and reached $11.61 in December 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1992, our stumpage fees have increased 
in objective terms. This is true for 
Quebec and for the other provinces—making our case even better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are disappointed to see that the American 
secretariat has nevertheless initiated inquiries under 
anti-dumping procedures and countervailing duties, despite the 
facts.

<A HREF="#LINKT115"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The paradox, and I think it is important to point it out, is 
that the American interests established in Quebec and Canada are 
complaining, in terms of their production in Canada and Quebec, 
that stumpage fees are too high.  Often these same American 
interests criticize Canada and Quebec for having stumpage fees 
that are too low, when it comes to their American production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a sort of schizophrenia, which demonstrates the extent 
of ill will in the whole matter in part of the American industry. 
As I mentioned, we find it completely unacceptable that the U.S. 
department of 
commerce has begun investigations when there is absolutely 
nothing to justify them. I read 
the Minister for International Trade's press release and we share 
his point of view completely— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One interesting thing is that, contrary to 1995-96, it seems 
that the Canadian and Quebec industry, and I can guarantee this for 
the Quebec industry, is united.  After five years of the 
Canada-U.S. softwood lumber agreement with quotas and countervail 
duties, we came to the conclusion that it was not a question 
of negotiating any agreement at all and that we had to return, in 
fact, there was a short period of free trade, to the rules of 
free trade, as set out in NAFTA, for all goods, including energy. 
This is in a context where there are new rules of the game 
compared to 1995-96. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing Canada did was file a complaint with the World Trade 
Organization, which agreed to set up a panel of experts to look 
into the legality of American practices with respect to 
countervailing duties, which we are now subject to.  Let us hope 
that we have their response soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our regions in Canada and Quebec deserve to see 
members of the House stand together against harassment from the 
American industry and, I would say, a certain lax attitude on the 
part of the U.S. government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to recall that on March 20 of this year the House 
almost unanimously passed a motion which I moved on behalf of the 
Bloc Quebecois to support the Canadian government's wish to go 
back to free trade, that is free and equitable circulation of all 
softwood lumber. 
Following this motion, our subcommittee on disputes and 
investments took the initiative of sending a letter signed by a 
large number of parliamentarians from all parties to the American 
secretary of state for commerce, Mr. Zoellick, to inform him that 
we were in disagreement with the situation and that we wanted to 
go back to free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said, and I think we all agree, that this is not a subsidy 
issue. As I mentioned earlier, our stumpage fees are not low. I 
will read a short excerpt of a letter sent to the minister for 
International Trade by 
Gilles Baril, the Quebec minister of state responsible for 
regional development and minister of industry and commerce, and 
Jacques Brassard, the Quebec minister of natural resources. They 
remind the federal minister that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Quebec forestry development plan, timber royalties are 
based on the market value of timber from private forests. That 
timber and the timber from the United States account for 31% of 
all the lumber provided to the Quebec industry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the situation is still critical. There is the 
structural problem to which I referred, in that the American 
industry did not invest enough money. It cannot compete with the 
Canadian and Quebec industries and its production costs are 
indeed higher than those of our industries. There is also a 
problem with economic conditions in that lumber prices in Canada 
and in Quebec are currently going down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three reasons, which I will review briefly. American 
consumption has slowed down because of the economic downturn in 
the United States, which means that there is less demand for 
softwood lumber. Supply has increased substantially, not because 
the provinces, those provinces affected by the agreement between 
Canada and the United States, have increased their exports, but 
because other countries have taken advantage of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the time that the agreement was in place, Canada 
increased its exports to the United States by 7.9%, while other 
countries increased theirs by 187.7%. This means that certain 
countries took advantage of the fact that the Canadian industry 
could not do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important aspect that is specific to Canada is the issue 
of quotas, which forced several provinces, including Quebec and 
British Columbia, to sell to Canadian markets.

<A HREF="#LINKT116"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This led to such a drop in prices that, and I will conclude with 
this, at this very moment, stumpage fees in Quebec are $9.26 and 
the price is $10, which means that our industry could not survive 
countervailing duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members that the Bloc Quebecois wants this situation 
settled rapidly, without compromising the principle of free 
trade. We want all of Canada's regions to work together through 
these difficult times, from which I am sure we will emerge as 
winners. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Chairman, I have listened to the hon. 
member for Joliette.  I appreciated his speech, because it is an 
excellent one.  He knows his business.  We know this dates back 
more than 18 years to 1982.  After a thorough investigation by 
the U.S. department of commerce, Canada concluded that stumpage 
fees did not represent a subsidy on which any action could be 
taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to say, as I read in the Quebec Lumber 
Manufacturers Association's press release, that the association 
remains confident in its capacity to demonstrate the 
inconsistency of the allegations advanced by the American 
coalition in connection with the lumber issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raised all the elements of the issue and perhaps 
he could once again remind us of them in just a few words. There 
is talk of a quota system for certain provinces, but much harm 
has been done by the quota system in certain provinces, 
particularly Quebec, in the resource regions, the remote regions, 
particularly to the small sawmills. Does the hon. member agree? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> Mr. Chairman, if the truth be known, the 
provinces affected by the Canada-Unites States deal have been 
hard hit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers in British Columbia, as in Quebec, have lost some of 
their share of the U.S. market to other countries but also sadly 
to other Canadian provinces who had free access to the American 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will remember that when we had free trade with the 
Unites States, which lasted only a few months in 1995 and 
1996, prices in Canada and in the States were the same, but with 
the quota system, prices in the U.S. ended up being $140 higher 
than in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all imagine how provinces like Quebec, British Columbia, 
Alberta and Ontario were unable to fully benefit from the 
feverish activity in the U.S. market but had to sell a huge part 
of their products at a price $140 lower than in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quota system really hurt us. It is true for Quebec, but I 
must say that it is also true for British Columbia, which along 
with the crisis in southeast Asia, had to deal with a decline in 
its lumber exports without the benefit of any new outlets. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased this evening to intervene in this debate, which gives us 
an opportunity to put the natural resource industry in Quebec and 
in Canada into perspective and to set the record straight, 
because in recent years it was fashionable to speak of the 
new economy and of the high tech sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have forgotten that natural resources are one of our economic 
forces and they are great consumers of technology.  They require 
very specific industrial applications.  The mining sector, for 
example, is a great consumer of technology.  At home, for 
example, we are working to develop underground communications. 
These are very specific applications of research in the 
communications sector that find uses in the traditional sectors, 
which buy these technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, because it is less fashionable, the 
technologies sector, rightly so, because the development there is 
fascinating, has attracted a lot of attention.  However, a lot of 
private investment has gone into this sector as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only to look briefly at the changes in the stock markets 
to see how the businesses in these sectors attracted substantial 
capital, while it was very difficult for natural resources 
sectors, such as mining, to attract capital to do the research 
vital to ensuring sufficient reserves in the coming years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going any further in connection with the mining sector, 
which is one of the subjects I want to speak more about today, I 
have a few comments about the remarks by my colleague, the hon. 
member for Joliette, on softwood lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it a bit strange and surrealistic on the weekend to see 
the American president come to Quebec City and boast of the 
virtues of free trade, when his government is denying us free 
access to the American market in a sector such as that of 
softwood lumber.

<A HREF="#LINKT117"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that Canada was the host country.  One does not want to 
start arguments when one is receiving guests, but I would have 
expected a little more firmness toward the U.S. president. When 
he was on the platform beside the Prime Minister of Canada, he 
was singing the praises of free trade, and everyone knew 
perfectly well that a few days later he was going to give us a 
good swift kick with respect to the American investigations into 
our industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Americans must be made to face their own contradictions.  Free trade 
is not a one-way street.  It is not because we are better than 
them in this sector that we should do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, in the coming years there will be something extremely 
important in the softwood lumber sector.  It is a rare and 
limited resource, which we have probably overexploited in recent 
decades.  To succeed, therefore, our companies will have 
to provide even more added value and processing of our products. 
This will require more investment to improve research 
and development in natural resource market niches, particularly 
in forest products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember one frustration I experienced as an MP in recent 
years.  A program such as technology partnerships Canada was not 
accessible to businesses in traditional sectors, or was 
accessible with great difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a bit more flexibility in the tools available to us, 
while complying with the constraints of international agreements 
we have signed, so that the capital we put into developing 
technology partnerships, or doing more research, is a little 
better targeted and more suited to the reality of the natural 
resources sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been through this a few times in the lumber sector.  It 
was very difficult to get approval for proposals to invest or 
improve infrastructures, one reason at the time being that they 
had to meet very high environmental standards.  The pulp and 
paper industry, for instance, had to invest heavily and it was 
very difficult to get support from the federal government because 
the tools were not very well suited to this reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this must be taken into consideration. These companies will 
have to make massive investments in the coming years to maintain 
their sales and their growth, because they will have to further 
process the wood products they already have. If they do not do 
that, they will have problems. Everyone agrees on that. They will 
not experience shortages, but natural resources in the forestry 
sector will become rarer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now go back to the mining industry. The crisis is very 
serious. Back home, in the Abitibi—Témiscamingue region, it is 
one of the most serious crises ever. There are a number of 
reasons for that. For example, gold was used as a hedge against 
inflation for a long time. A lot of gold was bought up by central 
banks and accumulated in reserves. This is a thing of the past 
and we should not be nostalgic but face the fact that gold is no 
longer the hedge against inflation that it once was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that gold may not fetch the prices it did in the 
past. We have a situation where small mining companies produce 
gold at a cost of $200 to $300 per ounce and sell it for $260. 
And I am not including financial costs, which means that they 
lose money in the process. This situation cannot go on for very 
long. This is not social economy and I have nothing against the 
social economy, but the mining industry must be profitable. So 
our production costs will have to come down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also have to invest to develop new ways of doing things, 
new technologies, and in a big way. We will also have to invest 
in exploration, otherwise we will have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exploring abroad used to be the thing to do. I will spare hon. 
members the figures, but I have here a document that was given to 
me by the hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik. 
Everyone knows that generally speaking we are not close allies 
but political rivals, but I believe we both agreed that the 
crisis has made it urgent to develop common ways to help people 
of our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am grateful to the hon. member because I think he showed a 
sense of fair play when he gave me this very well written 
document, which shows among other things the increase in 
production in developing countries, in South America and 
elsewhere. It can been seen that there has been no growth in our 
production and that we have not invested much in exploration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It becomes rapidly apparent that we are beginning to face a 
problem. I fear that we have not yet reached the worst of it 
in the mining industry, and in particular in gold mining. About 
three years ago, the price of gold dropped under $300 and it has 
stayed under that level since. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT118"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall having read the financial reports of mining companies, 
which always said “We anticipate that, next year, the price of 
gold will be around $330”. This did not happen. It did not 
happen then and it is not happening now. We must admit that it 
will not occur next year either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look at our industry in a different way. The government 
will have a major role to play in the short and long terms. We 
will have to be creative. I do not have the monopoly on 
solutions, but I am convinced that if we try we will find 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to increase support for exploration. 
We need to be realistic as well and to realize that the 
traditional vehicle of flow-through shares is perhaps no longer 
the way of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investors have been stung.  I will give members a picture of what it 
is like in our area.  Investors who put money into this have been 
burned more than once.  Very few projects have seen any 
cost effectiveness, because exploration is very high risk. 
Second, in past audits Revenue Canada has set new assessments, 
saying that certain work had not been done or was not up to 
standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So if somebody put $10,000, $15,000 or $20,000 into projects and 
then got hit with another assessment four years down the line, on 
the grounds that the standards were not met, he or she would have to 
get up really early in the morning to convince him to reinvest in 
the same company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been an area where a lot of people have been burned. 
Investors put money into the technology sector of the stock 
market.  Two or three years ago, a person could invest in just 
about anything and prices went up.  This led to a considerable 
drain on capital.  The situation has corrected itself a bit, but 
investment in this sector was far less attractive, with little 
spinoff, but with the risk and uncertainty of potential 
reassessment and with less attractive tax credits than earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, today the mining industry perhaps needs a different 
kind of support.  The pre-election budget improved things a 
little.  It will not be enough, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the other side of the lake, from the 
other Témiscamingue, the Ontario one, said yes there was 
an improvement over last year, but still far from enough. 
The level of exploration still remains far from sufficient, if 
we are to have the reserves required for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the better.  Many of the reserves identified in the 
development countries are used up, and that is a good thing. 
Perhaps that will bring investors back here.  New metals are 
being discovered, including palladium and diamonds, and these 
attract investors.  This is interesting, yet not everywhere has 
been explored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that I am nearing the end of my speech. I would like to 
add only one thing. When we talk about northern Quebec or 
northern Ontario, and I mention those regions because they are 
the ones I know best, people often feel these regions have 
been thoroughly explored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When exploring, one makes a very small and very deep hole in 
various locations. Very often something could have been found 
only a few feet away. It is far from obvious that the exploration 
process can reveal all that. We have not yet explored 
everything that there is to be explored in Canada; far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Noranda mine in our region operated for years. A mining 
potential was later discovered close nearby. This shows how 
difficult it can be to find the deposits and to identify them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technologies are now getting better and research can yield 
maximum results, but we still have to go further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore really hope that this debate will not end with the 
speeches. I look forward to real action. We certainly will 
contribute to that. We will stimulate the debate and will be full of 
determination, but money will have to be spent. There is a lot of 
money around these days. There are large surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The natural resources sector, and I have talked about mines but 
the same holds true for all the other natural resources, will have 
to be considered carefully if we want to put a major sector of 
the development of our economy back on track, particularly in the 
resource regions, one of them being the one I represent, the 
Abitibi—Temiscamingue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie James—Nunavik, Lib.): </B> 
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments 
made by the member for Témiscamingue. It is true that we have not 
always seen eye to eye. It took an emergency debate for me to 
call him yesterday afternoon to arrange a meeting. Together, we 
found some solutions in the best interest of the people of 
Témiscamingue and Abitibi. That is the only thing that matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made a point about deep wells. In Quebec there is a program 
to provide assistance to mining companies developing deep wells 
and Quebec is the only one financing this program. Not to mention 
that the 13 mines scheduled to close within five years are 
located in Abitibi and northern Quebec. That is where the problem 
lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member a question about exploration and 
another one about the R and D activities carried out at UQUAT, in 
Rouyn-Noranda, Val-d'Or, Duparquet and Amos. Could he tell us 
about this provincial program? Should the federal government get 
involved with the province in such programs to provide assistance 
to the mining industry?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Chairman, it would be an historic event 
if we could reach an agreement in our region.  After all, if 
Israelis and Palestinians in areas of conflict are talking to 
each other, we should be able to do the same. Anything is 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> We will never get that far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> We are far from that indeed, and the 
comparison ends there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a good opportunity to add to 
the program Quebec has implemented for underground exploration. 
There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Improving on what already 
exists is something that could be done in the short term, until 
other measures are identified. That could be done rapidly and it 
is not complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two departments who work the best together in 
federal-provincial relations are the departments of revenue. 
Revenu Québec has already defined the mechanism. It will not be 
long before both departments start discussing to find a quick way 
to implement this. It could be done very rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Underground exploration is important, but it is true that there 
is more surface exploration being done. The challenge is to do 
more underground mining, or to operate mines with smaller 
potential or to have more thin capitalization companies engaged 
in this kind of activity. 
We do not want it always to be the big players doing all the 
development in the mining industry. A special effort has to be 
made to ensure that thin capitalization firms have the capacity 
to do more than they are doing at the moment.  This is one 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have in our region a university that is very aggressive 
in its research and development, one of the most productive, a 
part of the Université du Québec network of campuses, the 
Université du Québec en Abitibi—Témiscamingue, with a number of 
research projects on the table in the natural resource sector. It 
is a fine way to development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a project in the mining industry I mentioned earlier, 
research into underground communications. We also have a fine 
communications company, Télébec, a Bell subsidiary but with 
regional players in administration, who are very aggressively 
working to develop tools for the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are forestry projects in Amos and Duparquet and in the 
mining industry.  So we have a fine research in the natural 
resources sector, but the tools are lacking. It is important to 
point that out.  A lot of money has been invested in the Canada 
foundation for innovation, in university chairs, and so on, but 
we must recognize that the big universities are not the only 
universities.  There is a network of small universities.  I know 
this is a big concern for people in the region.  It is true in 
Atlantic Canada.  It is true in Quebec.  It is true throughout 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point, the government must not just say that it is 
putting money into foundations managed independently, but 
guidelines are also necessary, because the small universities 
have a role to play in the economic development of the regions. 
We must make sure that a fair share of the budget goes to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Chairman, the hon. 
member spoke a fair amount about innovation and the importance of 
exploration companies to the mining sector and the fact that we 
obviously need to find ore before we can exploit a mine or ore 
body or potential ore body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an open debate between all opposition parties and the 
government and it is not for me to stick up for the government 
side.  However I certainly applauded its efforts in October of 
last year to bring back some form of flow through share policy to 
absorb the debts that exploration companies run up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the hon. member and his party feel about the so-called 
new super flow through share which would allow exploration 
companies to deduct some of their debt burden by letting people 
invest in their companies and deduct 100% of their investment? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Chairman, yes, I certainly would not 
want to suggest that the move in the last budget or the measures 
taken before the election were insignificant. It was a step in 
the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that this was done very quickly. The whole budget 
was prepared hastily. I am not sure this fitted in a 
comprehensive development plan for the industry. That is where 
the problem starts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we have now is to convince people to invest in the 
mining industry. That is not an easy task. We need to have the 
prospect of a fair return, and exploration has to be more 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments are not the only ones involved. The industry should 
also take a look at itself. Take for example junior exploration 
companies. We should be honest enough to tell them that they 
cannot work in isolation anymore. Some of them could join forces 
to explore for resources together, share the properties, and 
reduce the level of risk for the investor. We can do all we want 
to improve the deductions for company losses of companies, for 
example, this is more for companies that already have mines in 
production, but we should improve the prospects for the 
investors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must give more support to those who are already in operation 
and who have an exploration potential nearby. This was a step in 
the right direction, but we should have a comprehensive plan that 
would say “Look, the federal government is telling everyone that 
it is a key industry. We are prepared to put money in it on a 
rational and sound basis”. This would send a powerful signal to 
investors. It would not be merely a minor, isolated measure 
designed to please people in the regions on the eve of an 
election. The intention was good in part, but the overall 
impression of investors was not as positive as it could have been 
if it had been part of a broader plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that I appreciate is the change of rhetoric. The new 
Minister of Industry is not perfect, but at least when he talks 
about the economy he no longer makes a distinction between the 
old and the new economy. I am very pleased about that, because a 
little too much was made of that concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an economy with many activity sectors and we must now 
target all sectors and the natural resources sector is one of our 
better performing ones. We talked about the productivity gap 
between the United States and Canada. We are more productive than 
the Americans in the natural resources. At some point, we should 
invest in our strengths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measure taken last fall was a step in the right direction, 
but we need more and we have the means to do more. This is my 
hope. I hope that today's debate will lead to action. We are 
creating expectations, so we will have to deliver. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Chairman, just want to make a comment 
on flow-through shares or the mineral exploration tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the convention of the prospectors and developers association 
of Canada in Toronto, they were the ones that called them the 
super flow-through share program. They agreed that what they got 
was even better than what they had asked for. The program came 
after very lengthy consultations, about two years and a 
half, with the industry. Thus, this did not happen during the 
last months before the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to specify that both the association and 
the government did not do a good job of selling this program to 
investors. I met some people from the association before their 
convention and they distributed an excellent promotional 
brochure. The Canadian government had a very good presence at the 
convention. I think investors are aware of the program, of its 
value and of the fact that, on the stock exchange, dotcom 
companies' shares have fallen. People are realizing that these 
kinds of shares are not a panacea and they are going back to 
natural resources. I believe this augurs well for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Chairman, I will just take a few seconds 
to say that we are willing to agree on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to some brokers and they were not very familiar with 
the program. Things were somewhat improvised, because I do not 
think a budget was expected in autumn since it was usually tabled 
in February. The sales pitch that should have come with such 
measures was totally lacking and did not manage to send a clear 
message like “Look, the federal government is saying loud and 
clear that this key industry has a bright future and we believe 
it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope things will be corrected in the months to come and that 
the next time the government wants to announce some measures, it 
will wait a bit longer, even if time is of the essence, to ensure 
that the measures are built on a solid foundation. This is what I 
hope for next time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Chairman, 
I intend to share my time with my colleague from 
Acadie—Bathurst, hopefully with minimal interruptions from my 
friend to the right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  From the right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  And from the right as well.  I intend 
to address most of my comments to the issue of fossil fuels.  I 
would like to discuss a number of issues related to natural 
resources but there is not enough time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I posit to the members here and to yourself, Mr. Chairman, that 
the whole issue of fossil fuels requires very close attention.  I 
think I speak on behalf of all our caucus in expressing grave 
concern with regard to comments the Prime Minister has made to 
the media in the last few days and again today in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about what appears to be a willingness on the 
part of the government, with very little forethought or planning, 
to deliver our fossil fuels wholesale to the U.S. market. 
That gives us great concern because it does not seem to take into 
account the environmental issues that are related to that type of 
development.  It does not take into account the issue of the air 
pollution problems which will come from that.  Quite frankly we 
think it does not address the issue of the cost of developing 
some of those resources in the long term.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary has already said this evening, we 
have the tar sands.  We can bring gas in from the territories. 
Those are very expensive processes.  If we did not have some of 
the tax breaks that have been accorded to the tar sands, those 
tar sands would not be economically viable at this point.  I know 
I will get some disagreement on this but they are certainly much 
more expensive than the alternative of renewable resources, like 
windmills in particular.  Even solar energy is getting very close 
to being as expensive as the development of those tar sands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other problem with the development of the tar sands is the 
type of air pollutant that will result from that.  I know I have 
thrown this figure out once before in the House, but I will do it 
again.  The Suzuki Foundation made very clear in the research 
that it has done that just one tar sand plant would be equal to 
putting 1.3 million automobiles on our roads, and all the 
pollutants and toxins of course that result from that type of 
expansion in the use of vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is we cannot keep going this way.  We are faced as a 
society with international agreements.  In spite of the fact that 
the Bush administration has now taken the position that it will 
reject Kyoto, it will probably only be there for four years. Then 
what will we do if we have developed the tar sands at that point? 
We will be faced with a new administration, probably a wiser 
administration as far as the environment is concerned, saying to 
us that it is sorry but it will be going the route of 
conservation of technological changes which will reduce the need 
for that much fossil fuels.  Then we will have just blown all 
that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be faced with that same administration, which will be 
more environmentally concerned, saying to us that yes, we have to 
meet Kyoto and that its state governments will not take our 
pollutants any more.  I speak very personally about this given the 
jurisdiction from which I come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding, where we get a lot of the pollutants from the 
Americans who are in the process of starting to clean that up, 
has the attorneys general of both New York State and Connecticut 
saying to Ontario that it has to clean up.  We have all those 
coal fired plants.  They are not going to want to take Ontario's 
pollutants any more.  We will be faced with an administration 
which will be saying those things to the government and country 
in four years.  The Bush administration may not but the next one 
will.  If it is not in four years, then it will be in eight 
years.  We have to plan for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In coming back to the cost issue, just yesterday Algoma Steel in 
Sault Ste. Marie went down.  One of the reasons was the high cost 
of fuel to run that plant.  It was a highly efficient plant 
according to the statistics.  It was the 12th most efficient 
steel plant in all of North America.  One of the reasons it went 
down was because of the fuel cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just cannot keep going down that road.  We have seen the 
Prime Minister taking positions in the last four days which are 
dramatic shifts, as I see and our party see it, away from where 
we thought we were going, which was moving more toward 
conservation.  We just cannot keep following them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make a couple of other points, some of which came out of 
the information at the summit of the people in Quebec City over 
the weekend.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Suzuki was there and pointed out that from his 
foundation's research because of the trade deals we have a huge 
demand that is going to increase for bunker fuel.  Over the next 
10 to 12 years that is going to increase by 300%.  That is just 
about the worst fuel we could be burning.  That will be dumped 
into the atmosphere and the rest of the world will not accept it 
any more.  We are hearing it very clearly at this point from the 
European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end result of this is going to be that some time in the next 
four to eight years, whether it be this political party running 
the government or another one, we will be faced with all sorts of 
communities that, having some development work done in natural 
resources around fossil fuels, will be looking at losing their 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at rural development, what is going to happen?  Will 
we be faced with a situation such as Elliot Lake where after the 
nuclear industry began to cut back we lost that mine?  That was a 
success story.  How many more of those can we do?  Very few.  We 
will to be faced with having to deal with those communities.  If 
we do not do this planning and prepare for some of the 
alternative fuels, wholesale communities will be faced with 
extinction.  There will become ghost towns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the New Democratic Party's position we are suggesting that 
we have to prepare for that.  We have to look very closely at 
what we are doing.  Our question is what will be done in terms of 
the development of those types of tar sands or bringing fuel in 
from the territories, if in fact the market is not there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bush stood up and made great statements.  He said that if we had 
the fuel he would take it.  I do not think he has the support of 
his congress in that and he is not going to have it in four 
years.  I would like to know from the government side what it 
will do at that point if those errors have been made in 
developing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré:</B>  Mr. Chairman, first, before I 
answer the hon. member's direct question with regard to tar 
sands, 
I think it has become very cost effective.  My colleague from 
Alberta will agree.  At the beginning it was about $36 per 
barrel.  It is now down to $14.  It is very cost effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the potential new administration in the United 
States in four years, anyone who thinks that if the republicans 
are thrown out and the democrats get in that they will not need 
energy is living like <I>Alice in Wonderland</I>.  The American 
economy and population is growing and their need for energy is 
growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the resources and the potential to service that market, 
as well as other markets in the world.  We have potential 
resources, the tar sands being just one example.  What about 
developing Churchill's clean renewable energy?  Natural gas is 
one of the cleanest fossil energy resources that we can take from 
the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot say that because we are turning slowly but surely 
toward more environmentally friendly energy sources that we have 
to get rid of all other kinds of energy resources tomorrow.  It 
can be done in a couple of years.  I will remind everyone that 
the government has invested over $1 billion in these climate 
changing initiatives and we are working toward cleaner energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I want to make is with regard to the comment he 
made about the environment.  I will remind the member that any 
investor from the United States who is willing to invest in the 
tar sands or any energy projects across the country will have to 
follow the provincial jurisdiction on environment and follow the 
rules, as we all have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Chairman, that is just too 
simplistic, it really is.  I was actually going to save this line 
for the Minister of Natural Resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really tired of hearing about the $1 billion that we are 
spending on it.  The reality is we have hardly done a thing.  If 
we look at the work that Germany and Denmark have done on wind 
power, we have done nothing by comparison.  Germany has created 
35,000 jobs in wind power alone.  Denmark is doing almost 10% of 
its energy in wind power alone.  They are comparable countries to 
us in terms of their technological development.  We should be 
doing that. 
I guess it is almost an insult.  To suggest that we will be able 
to do this rapidly, I am not stupid.  I understand that we cannot 
do it rapidly, but we are not doing it fast enough.  I can look 
at other countries around the world and say that these countries 
are doing it.  Why are we not?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not say that we will develop the wind power that can 
be used in the northern climes and at some point we would be able 
to export that technology to Russia and northern Europe?  Why can 
we not do that?  Why can we not be spending money on that?  It is 
just too short-sighted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say that the market is always going to be there for that 
energy source.  It is not always going to be there.  If we keep 
track of the consumption of fuel in cars, in less than a decade 
we can cut consumption of fuel in cars by 50%.  What is going to 
happen to the market at that point? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I do not know where to 
start on this one.  Some of the comments are ridiculous.  If wind 
power is the answer, and Canadians support wind power and it has 
the potential to supply the energy needs of Canada or the United 
States, then industry would invest in windmills and create wind 
power.  The fact is it has a very limited potential to supply our 
energy needs.  Therefore the investment is limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tar sands have the potential to supply all of Canada's 
energy needs and much of the U.S. energy needs for the next 100 
years.  Industry is investing $35 billion.  This old myth about 
the huge subsidization of the tar sands is exactly that.  It is a 
myth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would challenge the solar industry, the wind industry and any 
other energy industry to compete with the same subsidization 
level as the fossil fuel industry.  It is there.  The market is 
there.  If it has potential it will be built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My opinion on the development of energy is that we as a country 
should look at all forms of energy and put a total cost on the 
development of each particular source of energy.  We should 
choose to develop the lowest cost form of energy first and move 
up the scale.  As the natural or finite energy sources are 
reduced we move into the next level, then into the next most 
expensive and on up the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be the reasonable approach and I would certainly do 
that.  Many of the tar sands players, energy companies, I would 
add, are involved in the wind power industry, the nuclear 
industry and in a number of other sources of energy.  They are 
multifaceted companies which have just as much concern for the 
environment and supplying Canada and the world's energy needs as 
anybody else.  I think some of these myths are just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I will try to be brief. 
There is a point that I want to try to get across to the member 
for Windsor—St. Clair.  I am not in disagreement with him that 
we need to seek alternatives to fossil fuels and the finite 
resources of energy.  We know fossil fuels are a finite resource. 
There is a certain amount of it and some day it will be gone.  We 
continue to find more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take exception to his comments about Europe.  Quite often we 
look at Europe as somehow being a warmer, fuzzier, cleaner, more 
environmentally friendly region of the world.  I fundamentally 
disagree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Germany may be able to say that it invests more money into wind 
energy or alternative energy resources but it buys natural gas 
from Russia and does not care how Russia gets that gas.  It does 
not care about the political or social costs which come with that 
gas.  It does not care about the technologies that the Russians 
use.  Fracting a single zone in Russia, which they have developed 
in that zone, has never been done.  They develop something 
deeper or something higher up the well bore.  They just do not 
have the technology to do good work.  As well, they make the 
rules and bend the rules to suit themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We can have Europe or the European Union talking about being 
green and clean, but they will use uranium powered energy from 
France.  They do not mind importing that energy.  They do not 
mind importing Russian natural gas.  They do not mind setting 
special levels for Norway.  There is some danger in looking at 
Europe as the pristine example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that we should not head in that direction, but I 
am concerned that we should not put it on too high a pedestal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Chairman, my comments are along the same point.  Calgary 
residents are getting their electricity from wind energy if they 
so choose.  I have been studying what Germany has been doing and 
it has a lot of windmills.  I have seen some of them firsthand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also mentioned Russian gas. We must also remember 
that 70% of Germany's energy comes from nuclear power.  Green 
Germany run by a green government is using nuclear energy for 70% 
of its energy needs.  We should not believe the myth about Europe 
being a wonderful example to follow because it is just not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I must admit that I am 
happy we are having this debate tonight.  These are the most 
provocative responses that we have had this evening so I will 
take some credit for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not prepared to agree with the comments we heard from the 
Alliance with regard to corporate decision making.  If they were 
real, would we ever have developed nuclear industry at all?  Do 
we always go to the bottom line and explore the cheapest option? 
Once we have made the kind of commitments the oil industry has 
made, we are locked in to a certain degree.  I recognize that the 
oil industry is beginning to do research and some development in 
wind power and solar power.  I recognize that but it has not gone 
far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to go back to the initial point I made earlier this 
evening and that is what we see in terms of what the Prime 
Minister has been saying over the last four days.  Have we just 
given up on everything else?  All our eggs have been thrown in 
the basket of developing the U.S. market and we appear to be 
ignoring these other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I would make with regard to the comments of my 
friend in the Alliance is that development of the tar sands 
completely ignores the environmental consequences of developing 
that source of fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one last comment regarding Germany.  It has recognized 
the mess that it has made of things by depending so heavily on 
nuclear energy and is beginning to try to move away from it.  I 
do not wear blinkers.  I fully understand that the bottom line 
still is that Germany is doing much more in wind power than 
Canada is.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Chairman, it is a 
pleasure to take part in this short debate and speak to some 
issues of concern for our regions and our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to limit my comments to the situation of the mining 
industry in my area. We are lucky to have several mines, like the 
Brunswick mine, Heath Steele, Cariboo Mine or Durham Mine in the 
Fredericton area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mining industry is not at all like the fishing industry. 
Although the fish stocks have all but disappeared, if we are 
cautious, they will come back. The same thing should happen in 
the forest industry. We can cut trees down; it is a beautiful 
resource that meets everyone's needs. 
If we are careful, we can replant trees and the forest will 
grow back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as soon as we start operating a mine, we can start 
estimating the date it will close. It will never come back. That 
is the problem with mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, we had several mines in my region. The Durham 
mine in the Fredericton area is closed. The Heath Steele mine 
is closed, since the gold deposit is depleted. The Cariboo mine 
closed because of low mineral prices. Operating that mine was too 
expensive. Prices would have to be much higher for that mine to 
reopen. As for the Brunswick mine, it is estimated that it will 
stay in operation for about ten more years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat on the natural resources committee for a period of three 
and a half to four years. I started talking about the problem 
with mines and what we should do about it as a country.

underground and never see the sun. Some people would not like 
that. 
I liked working in a mine.  I liked it and miners like it.  A 
miner is a miner.  These are jobs that pay fairly well and 
offer good salaries and bonuses.  People make $50,000, $60,00 or 
$70,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is good for the regional economy.  In my riding, in 
Bathurst, New Brunswick, when people say that the Brunswick mine 
will be finished in the next ten years, this is a disaster. When 
I took this to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I 
remember the Liberals saying “Yvon, you are complaining again; 
you never seem to have any good news for us”. I thought it was 
the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had to start thinking in advance.  We had to start thinking 
ten years in advance in order to know what we were going to do to 
replace these jobs.  I was really taking preventive 
action. Already, I was starting to talk about it and to say “In 
ten years, we are going to lose our mine.  What are we going to 
do today?  What are we going to do to replace those jobs?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should not start by saying “Listen, we are sick of 
listening to you because you are always negative.  You are 
negative because there are no more fish in the ocean”. It is not 
my fault if there are no more fish in the ocean.  That is enough 
to be negative about.  There are no more jobs.  It is not my 
fault if the mine will disappear in ten years.  I am here to talk 
about it.  It is my responsibility to 
talk and to try to find solutions with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that the government does not push exploration enough.  It 
does not push it enough.  What happens is that companies leave 
and invest in other countries.  This does not cost a lot. This 
week I went to the people's summit. I attended a meeting and an 
evening event on the mining industry, where there were Canadian 
workers from Cominco.  There were also workers from Chile.  They 
had a collective agreement.  The Canadian workers' collective 
agreement was about 200 pages long.  The Chilean workers' 
agreement consisted of two pages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can imagine how these people were being exploited.  Can one 
believe it, two pages?  I am sure that one was for management and 
the other for the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Sometimes, there is more in two pages than in 
ten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Can you imagine? After that, those companies 
will invest somewhere else because they cannot get any help here, 
in our own country, to find ways to explore and develop our 
mines. Those companies move out of the country, then take the 
minerals and dump them on the Canadian market. Later they end up 
in places like Algoma Steel, a steel company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that, at that time, the government of Ontario, under Bob 
Rae, made a great deal of effort to help the company, which had 
put itself into debt, but the workers and the community in Sault 
Ste. Marie saved that company. Now, with all the dumping from 
foreign countries, we are on the verge of loosing Algoma Steel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid. Let's hope we will not lose it, because there are 
good jobs in Sault Ste. Marie. These are well paid jobs in the 
steel industry.  How many similar situations are happening across 
the country? I think this is important. It is important to look 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about New Brunswick. We used to have four mines, 
but we have only one left. Soon we will have none.  What are we 
doing to open new mines? Surely we have not extracted all the 
minerals in the ground. There must be some left somewhere. These 
are good jobs, but dirty work. Do not worry, it is not the 
Parliament of Canada. When they come out from the mine, they are 
dirty and their skin is black. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my region like those jobs, which have been good for 
our community. Having touched on mines, I will now say a few 
words about forests. A few words on this and a few on that, as we 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a region where natural resources are plentiful. In 
modern forests, we have to invest in tree planting.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How long have companies been clearcutting? They were getting rid 
of the wood, selling it to mills and they did a lot of that. No 
government rule ever said that when a tree was cut, another one 
must be planted to replace it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The planet does not belong to us. It does not belong to me 
nor does it belong to the Chairman. It belongs to 
everybody. Everybody should be able to use it. I find that we do 
not treat our planet and the people working on this planet 
properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A nursery was sold in my area; in fact, the provincial 
government got rid of it. Then the local forestry union got 
involved in the process and said “We now want to plant our own 
trees. We can do it, but we would need federal funding to do it”. 
The province gave them part of the money, or $250,000. They 
needed $650,000, but no, this did not come under federal 
jurisdiction. Come on, what are we doing here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things can be done for the well-being of the population. Things 
that will be beneficial. The same applies to Northern Ontario, 
whether in Kapuskasing and elsewhere. I have visited the whole 
area and lived there. People live longer in northern Ontario 
because of the forests. 
Whether in White River, Manitouwadge, Wawa, Chapleau, 
Kapuskasing, Hearst or Arpin, it was the livelihood of how many 
people?  Now new investment is necessary; it is long term 
investment that benefits everybody and which will create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had thought that ten minutes would be more than I needed, but 
now I see that I will be short of time. Anyway, I think things 
like this are what is important.  The government will, I 
believe, have to invest in this area.  It is all very well to 
talk about all that went on in Quebec City, free trade and all 
that, but our people need jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought to take a serious look at mine 
exploration, forestry and tree replanting so that there is new 
growth.  The same goes for the fisheries, aquaculture and all 
that. 
Secondary and tertiary processing have to be done, whether in 
forestry or fisheries.  Even in the mines, second and third 
level processing can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take natural gas, for example.  This is an energy source we are 
having to fight for in north-eastern New Brunswick, and we are 
wondering whether we are going to get natural gas.  It is good 
for the environment, good all round, and supposed to cost a 
whole lot less than what we are running our smelters on at 
present, and all those other things, to produce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the comments I wanted to bring before the House.  I 
appreciate the opportunity to do so and to look at our future, 
because our children are our future, provided they can find 
jobs.  Not all the work for them is in Toronto, Montreal or 
Vancouver.  We need to look out for the rural areas, where there 
are also people working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said on many occasions,“You don't get 2x4s on 
Toronto's Yonge Street or rue Sainte-Catherine in Montreal”. 
Regions like mine are needed to produce them.  That is where the 
investments have to be made, if we want to create 
jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Cheryl Gallant (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I have three brief questions to ask 
the government.  One of Canada's natural non-renewable resources 
sector petroleum products appears to be in short deliverable 
supply.  Does the Ministry of Natural Resources feel that reactor 
generated energy is necessary as part of Canada's energy mix? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  I do not want to interrupt but obviously 
this is a very new format.  Before I allow the intervention, I 
will seek others who might have had comments or otherwise on the 
intervention of the member for Acadie—Bathurst. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Rural Development) 
(Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario), 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, the last comments of 
the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst might have been provided by 
my speech writer about the need to remember rural Canadians in 
the overall context of the nation, and not simply to deal with 
the urban centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of his opening comments was interesting because I spent some 
time in Elliot Lake when it was a mining community.  One of the 
comments made was that the first day of the end of a mine is the 
first day of operation, when the first shovelful is taken out, 
because the material mined is a non-renewable resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I do not know why the member would characterize himself 
as a doomsayer by wanting to talk about how we would deal with 
the issue 10 years down the road because that is exactly the 
appropriate way we would have to look at it. 
A multifaceted and dynamic approach needs to be taken.  There is 
not just simply one aspect to it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2100"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT127"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we in rural Canada, when we are natural resource 
based communities, need to maximize the resource we have.  Let us 
take the mining industry as an example.  The member talked about 
that in a number of areas and it is important to emphasize in 
terms of remembering that there is a very fine line between what 
is ore and what is rock and it is basically the cost of the 
ingredient and the cost to produce it.  Therefore, one of the 
things we need to work on in the natural resource industries in 
rural Canada is using technology.  We need to use research and 
development and to support that in order to bring down the costs 
of production so we can lengthen the amount of time a particular 
mine can be in operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also mentioned the need to value add to the 
commodities we are harvesting or are mining.  That again is 
another strategy to maximize the benefit of a resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the third component of that is indeed to look ahead to 
the time when that particular mine may not be there.  We need to 
look ahead by continuing to do further exploration so that other 
mines may come on stream or, as in the example of Elliot Lake, to 
find an alternative way to sustain your community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the types of things I talked about in my intervention 
when I mentioned that there is a need for a public policy 
perspective that is unique to rural Canada, that is specific to 
natural resource based economies and that deals with those very 
specific issues that I think the member put forward very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the intervention.  For 
example, if we are talking about the mining industry and if we 
are looking at the Brunswick Mine, it is not that long ago that 
they started to use the Pastefill, where they put concrete into 
it, du ciment.  They started to do it.  Doing that makes it just 
as hard as the pillars on the side.  Then they pick up the 
pillars.  It is too bad they did not pick them up 25 years ago. 
They would have saved a lot of pillars and mined the whole mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the types of things that can be done.  Sudbury was 
doing it a long time ago.  Falconbridge was too.  The miners were 
going underground and doing the backfill on a concrete floor all 
the time while we were on the rocks and breaking our feet most of 
the time, if members know what I mean.  That is the type of 
technology we can use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government could put those mining industries 
together to look at it instead of having them say they have a way 
to do mining that is cheaper so they do not need their friends to 
do it.  They almost call each other adversaries.  I think this is 
wrong because we are losing part of a natural resource that could 
offer jobs for a longer period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding Elliot Lake, I know that something else has been 
found.  With all respect to the people of Elliot Lake, they say 
they have turned it into a good place to retire to, but we do not 
want that in New Brunswick.  We would like to keep our youth in 
New Brunswick.  We have enough leaving right now.  We want to 
keep them at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I agree with the member.  There are different things we 
can do to prolong secondary or third processing.  It is one of 
those.  In forestry, for example, why do we send all our product 
somewhere else so that it comes back from other countries that 
sell it back to us?  It is the same thing in the fisheries.  Who 
is talking more, probably down home, about secondary or third 
processing in the fishery?  I am telling everyone that it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  I know this is a totally new experience for 
all of us.  In my following remarks, I want to address myself 
particularly to the hon. member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, 
but also to all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been at this debate for a little more than two hours and 
because it is not structured as we are accustomed to, time seems 
to go a little more quickly.  To the extent that we have had two 
hours of debate and I have not yet had the opportunity to give 
the floor to speakers from the Progressive Conservative Party, 
the format, as I would understand it, would be that in the 
initial round we would have a speaker, or speakers if you split, 
from each of the parties, and in the second round we would 
alternate from one side of the House to the other, depending on a 
representative being here from the party or parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, with the greatest of respect to our colleague from 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, who I know has been here since the 
beginning and has been very patient and very attentive, I regret 
this, but I will be giving the floor to the members of the 
Progressive Conservative Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In advance, I will tell all my colleagues that in the speaking 
order the next opportunity will fall to members of the government 
side, followed by the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I did not mislead anyone.  These are uncharted waters for 
all of us.  Certainly the participation has been very 
interesting.  I take note that most of you spoke without notes. 
Obviously you care very much and have a great deal of knowledge 
about the subject matter.  I think that lends itself well to 
making public policy for all Canadians and tonight in this case 
in the area of natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the end of my speech.  We turn now to the Progressive 
Conservative Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I would be sharing my 
time with the member for Brandon—Souris and if I have a couple 
of minutes or 30 or 40 seconds left at the end of my 20 minutes 
he will get them.  I think that is only fair and reasonable as a 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate here tonight is on natural resources.  I very much 
appreciate the Secretary of State for Rural Development being 
here and staying throughout the debate, and his colleagues with 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly I think that when we look at the economy and the 
global situation on the planet today we tend to trivialize the 
primary industries.  Many of us tend to forget where we come 
from.  A number of the ridings represented in this place are 
rural ridings.  I would even dare to say that perhaps we rural 
ridings are equal to the urban ridings.  If we counted them all, 
I think we would surprised by the number of parliamentarians who 
are here representing rural constituencies.  There are a great 
number of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also going to take the opportunity in this debate to 
discuss rural issues, very much like the rest of the speakers 
have discussed rural issues, but I think we are discussing rural 
issues in a number of sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not look at the Secretary of State for Rural Development as 
being responsible simply for rural Canada or the agricultural 
community.  There is a very large forestry sector out there. 
There are large fishing communities on the three oceans around 
the country and on Canada's inland waterways.  We have a huge 
mining sector in the country that has been quite often overlooked 
and underrepresented, I believe, by the present government, by 
other governments in the past and by provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to find a way to accommodate our primary industries in 
the country, to have them represented so that the people have 
viable jobs and opportunities, not only for themselves but for 
their children and for their grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us from rural Canada are survivors.  We live in 
communities that have survived for hundreds of years, quite 
often.  We represent 15 or 16 generations of ancestors and more 
in some parts of Canada.  We have managed to eke out a living, 
whether that has been a subsistence agricultural living or one 
dependent upon forestry or fisheries, for literally hundreds of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have to find a way in the modern economy, with the 
globalization of the planet, with transportation that is 
immediate, this minute.  It is no longer that day or that week, 
it is this minute.  The discussion taking place here can be 
listened to in Australia or China.  Decisions we make in the 
Parliament of Canada can be reacted to immediately by businesses 
halfway around the world.  With all respect, I do not think this 
government or any government is quite ready for that type of 
accommodation of the new economy.  I do not think we have adapted 
to that.  The appointment of a minister of state for rural Canada 
is a step in the right direction.  I applaud the government for 
it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about a couple of specific areas and 
hopefully get some replies from the minister on these specific 
areas.  I will try to be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first love is forestry, so I have to go there for at least a 
second.  We tend not to recognize the importance of forestry in 
Canada.  It is the primary industry.  It is the second most 
important industry in the country.  If we combine the primary 
industries such as forestry, agriculture, fisheries and mining, 
we can shut out the rest of the economy in this country.  We 
produce the jobs.  We put more money into the economy than the 
rest of the sectors put together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A tremendous amount of money comes from the primary industries 
of this country and the majority of them are sustainable.  The 
mining sector, we have found, is more sustainable than we 
thought.  When people look for minerals today in Canada they do 
not try to look for a new mine.  They go where we have been 
mining for generations and find more resources, more ore bodies, 
wherever that may be.  Timmins, Ontario, is a prime example of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started to talk about forestry.  We should not take away or 
ever forget the fact that as much as we may love to look at a 
view scape of timber, the real economy of that timber is the 
noise of it hitting the ground.  It is not only the fact that 
companies cut that timber.  There are jobs involved in getting it 
to the mill.  The wood is processed.  Houses are built from it. 
There are value added products that come in, whether that be 
paper, pulpwood or finger jointed mouldings for door frames. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tend to trivialize the contribution the forestry sector has 
made to this country and that it will make forever.  It is 100% 
completely sustainable.  In most of Canada it is not dependent on 
planting a whole lot of trees or putting a lot back into it.  We 
can continue to harvest the forest through natural regeneration 
on the west coast of Canada and certainly on the east coast of 
Canada in those maritime climates.  Very little of the land in 
eastern Canada needs to be replanted.  Foresters have to go in 
there 10 years after harvest and thin it.  There are so many 
stems coming up on the acreages that they have to be spaced.  It 
is not a matter of planting trees unless someone is trying to 
grow a different type of forest, unless the land is better suited 
for Norway pine instead of black spruce, or perhaps better suited 
for an exotic species like Norway spruce instead of balsam fir. 
There are alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need very much to look at the mining sector, on the east 
coast in particular now that we have the advantage of the 
development of the Sable gas fields and the Panuke oil fields. 
That oil and gas liquids and gas are coming ashore now in Nova 
Scotia.  We have been talking for six months about a second 
pipeline.  The first pipeline is already developed.  Now there is 
discussion about a second pipeline double tracking the pipeline 
that is already there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at a way to do a better job of sharing the 
money.  I spoke about this earlier, about the fact that when 
Alberta was developing its oil and gas reserves the federal 
government recognized the position Alberta was in.  From 1957 to 
1964 Alberta received equalization payments from the rest of 
Canada and kept the revenues from their oil and gas reserves. 
That allowed them a head start in putting their infrastructure in 
place to actually develop and exploit the natural gas and the oil 
fields of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and any other province should get 
no less a deal than Alberta got.  That takes a little bit of 
backtracking by this government.  That takes a different 
approach, but it can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking for the cancellation of equalization payments 
or the refusal of the federal government to gather royalties from 
the east coast. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT130"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking for is a period of time similar to what 
Alberta got, five, seven or eight years, in order to build the 
infrastructure up so what has been happening does not continue to 
happen.  For every dollar that is made in the offshore, 81 cents 
goes to the federal government and 19 cents goes to Nova Scotia. 
This is not rocket science.  This is a very simple equation. 
Somehow we have to change that imbalance, and that takes time and 
that takes an initiative on behalf of the government to 
compromise on a position that it has already taken.  I see no 
reason why we cannot do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tremendous resources in rural Canada and in our primary 
industry.  In the South Shore riding that I represent we have 
1,760 boats fishing.  That is phenomenal.  That is in three 
counties.  The fishery is in decline and it is facing great 
hardship.  We have a lot of people fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a great primary resource that is sustainable and we need 
to maintain that.  We have an oil field that is being developed 
that we need to encourage.  We have a forestry resource sector 
that needs to be encouraged as well.  I have left the agriculture 
sector for the hon. member for Brandon—Souris.  We need to 
encourage agriculture in Canada and we need to find a way to 
enhance it. Those are issues that face rural Canadians every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to encourage people to continue to live in rural 
Canada, if we want to have ghost towns in Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba and if our small towns in Atlantic Canada are to 
survive, we need infrastructure for transportation.  We need all 
kinds of innovative ways to continue to live in rural Canada and 
have an economy of means that can support us to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Rural Development) 
(Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario), 
Lib.):</B>   Madam Chairman, the hon. member 
talked about the need to have an appreciation for the natural 
resource sector and what it means for Canada.  I am sure all 
members in the House keep close to their desks a document called 
“Think Rural”, which is a report of the standing committee on 
natural resources, chaired by myself, issued in March 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read the opening paragraph of the report because 
it speaks directly to the member's point.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's natural resource industries have been the mainstay of 
our prosperity for most of our history and continue to be so 
today.  They represent the backbone of the domestic economy and 
are by far our major source of trade surplus. Currently, they are 
one of our strongest strategic advantages in global competition. 
In fact, Canada is the third largest mining nation in the world, 
the world's largest exporter of forest and mineral products, a 
net energy exporter and a large-scale producer and exporter of 
agricultural products.  Our future prosperity depends as much 
upon our continuing ability to discover and harvest our natural 
resources in rural Canada as it is coming to rely on our 
knowledge-based manufacturing and service sectors.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Chairman, I listened with great interest to my hon. 
colleague from South Shore, a fellow bluenoser.  He touched 
briefly on the issue of natural gas development in the province 
of Nova Scotia, which has application in Newfoundland, to 
Hibernia and to other wells that are under exploration there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke of the case that is being made currently by our 
premier, John Hamm in the province of Nova Scotia, and his 
campaign for fairness where he talks about the equivalent 
opportunity his province is seeking to bring gas revenues into 
the province for reasons of stabilization, opportunity and 
infrastructure that my colleague referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the example is made and the case is laid out before the 
Canadian people, it is undeniable that this is very much a case 
of fairness.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There were different scales of economy between Nova Scotia and 
Alberta in the 1950s.  There were different issues in terms of 
government regulation of that industry.  However the case remains 
very compelling when one considers the potential revenues that 
would be lost by the province as it attempts to enter a very 
large and competitive global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotians are not feeling that they are optimizing or 
capitalizing on those benefits themselves.  People in communities 
like Goldboro, White Head, Canso and Dover are feeling left out 
of the process of capitalization on their own natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the hon. secretary of state at his word that he has an 
understanding and a sympathy for that case.  This is an 
opportunity to demonstrate action and to demonstrate that the 
Government of Canada is listening to the provinces and is ready 
to work with them to help them optimize the benefits to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotians should not have to be dependent or feel a sense of 
loss.  They should have a sense of entitlement and a sense of 
participation in the Canadian economy, the same way Albertans did 
40 years ago.  That is all Nova Scotians are looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotians are looking for demonstrable evidence of that. 
They are looking for an opportunity to receive more of their 
royalties, more actual accrued benefit from their own natural 
resources.  That is all we are asking.  In the bigger picture 
they can be greater contributors to the economy and greater 
beneficiaries of their own natural resources, which benefits all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All rhetoric aside, it is the people of those small rural 
communities in Guysborough county who are looking for some 
tangible proof that the government is listening.  The people of 
Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and other provinces are looking for 
evidence that they can be full participants in Confederation and 
full participants in the economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Chairman, 
I thank my colleague for allowing me a very minor portion of the 
time allocated to us.  I too would like to echo his opening 
comments and congratulate the Secretary of State for Rural 
Development with whom I have had the opportunity of dealing on a 
number of occasions in his portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about rural development and where I see his 
department heading in the not too distant future with respect to 
helping rural communities not only maintain their populations but 
hopefully increase them and grow.  He read a comment from a 
wonderfully prepared report, which unfortunately I have not had 
the opportunity of reading.  It will be on my reading list in the 
not too distant future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back into history we will recognize that the whole 
country was developed on natural resources.  Explorers came here 
because of the fish and the furs they could harvest and export 
back to Europe.  My grandfather, as I am sure is the case with 
many ancestors of other people here, came to Canada because of 
agricultural land.  People could come here and get land at 
reasonable prices, start raising a family and grow the crops we 
are so famous for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our natural resources, inclusive of the mining we talked about, 
the natural gas and the oil sands projects, are the backbone of 
the country.  They started the country.  They are the backbone of 
our economy.  We have grown beyond that and have embraced the 
technical revolution we have enjoyed over the last number of 
years and the technology we have developed along with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the problem we are suffering right now is the fact that 
Canadians have forgotten their roots.  They have forgotten how 
the country was developed.  They have forgotten what is still the 
backbone of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the advantage of living in Toronto, and maybe that is 
a disadvantage.  I know the difference between rural Canada and 
what we appreciate as being there from the earth.  People from 
Toronto take it for granted. 
When people in Toronto flick a light switch they think that is 
where electricity comes from.  I am not trying to be derogatory 
to the people of Toronto.  What I am saying is that urban 
dwellers, of which I was one, take for granted all that is being 
provided.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a thermostat is turned on, be it heat that comes from a 
coal-fired, a gas-fired or perhaps even an electric furnace, that 
energy comes from the rest of the country.  Canadians are now 
allowed to take advantage of that.  I am speaking about natural 
resources but obviously I know agriculture best coming from the 
area that I do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When urban dwellers buy at a grocery store most of them believe 
that the foodstuffs come from that store.  The foodstuffs come 
from my area.  They come from people like my grandfather who 
planted the seeds and grew the crops.  They come from people who 
raised the cattle, the pork or the chickens.  They come from 
those people who we cannot forget and, unfortunately, in our 
society we have forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague said that he would leave agriculture as it is my 
forte.  I have talked in the House too many times about the 
crisis that agriculture is now facing.  It is for any number of 
reasons.  It is because of an unlevel playing field and subsidies 
that are being paid by Americans and Europeans.  It is because of 
the horrendous increase in the cost of production through natural 
gas prices for fertilizer and fuel prices for the tractors.  We 
cannot trade our commodities with other countries because of 
unfair subsidization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do is to remember where we came from.  We need 
to support that industry as well as other industries.  We also 
need to get a mindset.  I will not throw stones or cast 
aspersions, but I think the government has basically lost touch 
with that natural resource, that primary industry, agriculture. 
We have to develop a mindset that says we as Canadians will 
support that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we do that?  We do that with long term support systems 
that we put into place.  We need to develop those so that there 
is some hope for our younger generation to come into and continue 
in the industry.  We need food, shelter, heat and water to exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister of agriculture were here I would ask to him to 
please have the European mindset where they have said that they 
will support their farmers, their rural communities and their 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will switch gears a little because we do have the Secretary of 
State for Rural Development here.  I will talk about what he 
knows best, which is rural development, those rural communities 
that this great country is made up of.  Unfortunately, more and 
more people are moving into those urban centres but there are 
still a lot of us who would prefer to live in rural communities 
because of the lifestyle, the clean air, the clean water and the 
ability to live in a rural setting that is more conducive to 
raising families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a chance to talk to the minister and he has been very good 
at looking at the big picture.  However, I would like to give him 
some suggestions about how we could preserve rural living.  One 
suggestion would be to introduce a tax incentive that would 
attract people to live in rural communities.  We have talked 
about tax incentives for northern allowances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also be looking at different ways of attracting health 
care professionals and workers into rural Canada.  One of the 
major problems we have in rural Canada right now is attracting 
health care professionals. That is not to say that the problem is 
not there for urban centres either, but we have a worse problem 
in trying to bring those people into our communities.  Health 
care, as we all know, is probably the issue when it comes to 
supporting a rural community with an elderly population.  We 
should be looking at ways to attract health care professionals 
into rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also be looking at capital availability for 
infrastructure.  My colleague talked about the solid 
infrastructure, the bricks and mortar, the roads, the railways 
and the highways.  Rural Canada also needs to have the technical 
infrastructure in place.  If we do not have those advantages we 
will lose that to the urban centres.  It is not good for the 
country if it is made up of just four or five megalopolises. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT133"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must maintain our rural communities.  Perhaps we should look 
at capital projects for infrastructure in rural areas.  Perhaps 
we should look at different ways of attracting people to live in 
rural Canada.  Maybe housing is the answer.  We have seen 
examples.  Elliot Lake has attracted groups of retirees from 
urban centres to adopt what I consider a much nicer lifestyle in 
a rural area.  Perhaps it is a marketing thing that the Secretary 
of State for Rural Development should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we should look at our own departments, because a lot of 
problems come from the federal government.  Let us take a simple 
issue like customs and customs areas.  A prime example is my 
constituency where there are a number of border crossings.  When 
a decision is made by Canada customs to reduce, remove or change 
the service at a border crossing it affects the whole community, 
but the department making the decision does not have the mindset 
or vision to see how it will affect the community.  We must 
change that thought process.  When a decision is made, no matter 
how small, it will affect other people.  That must be dovetailed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state talked about the rural lens.  The rural 
lens would make sure we bring all departments together so that 
when they make a decision or change a service they communicate 
with each other to make sure the change will not negatively 
affect the lifestyle of people in a community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we lose three people in a customs department in Boissevain, 
Manitoba, it means a great deal.  If we lose three people in 
downtown Toronto it does not mean as much.  We must therefore 
acquire the right mindset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the biggest issue vis-à-vis natural resources and 
rural development is education.  There must be government 
support.  Rural development must be funded by society in general, 
which probably means urban dwellers, but they must understand why 
they are doing it.  We must all decide among ourselves, and I 
think we have.  I think the people in the Chamber tonight 
recognize that rural Canada is a vital part of what the country 
is all about.  Having come to that realization we must now decide 
how to provide services that will allow rural Canada to prosper 
and grow.  That is where we must head from here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the minister for being here.  I would add that the 
debate tonight has been excellent.  We had a debate like this not 
long ago on foot and mouth disease.  Like tonight, we debated the 
issues logically and in a non-partisan way.  I congratulate the 
government for putting the process forward.  I hope we can 
continue this process in other areas of debate because it is very 
worth while.  This is the way it should be in parliament, not 
acrimonious as we have seen in the past.  I congratulate the 
government for bringing the debate forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Rural Development) 
(Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario), 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Chairman, to answer all the 
hon. member's points I could be up here as long as he was. 
However I will take a moment to answer just a few and to mention 
to him that, if I have his schedule correctly, the two of us will 
be in Brandon together at the end of the week at the rural forum 
in his home community.  I look forward to that, and it will give 
us a chance to discuss some of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it in a nutshell, I would describe it this way.  All 
Canadians, rural or urban, should have the opportunity to access 
the wealth of Canada and of the nation.  The key point is that we 
recognize, as public policy makers, that there are certain unique 
impediments that work against rural Canada and rural Canadians, 
and that one of our jobs as policy makers and parliamentarians is 
to address the impediments that inhibit the ability of rural 
Canadians to access the wealth of the nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned a number of possible solutions in 
terms of taxation and other things.  He also mentioned something 
I think is very important: the idea of the rural lens.  I fully 
agree with him that all of us in the House and in government need 
to ensure that as we respond to the issues of the day, put 
legislation forward and develop regulation, we do so in a way 
that deals with the reality that is rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to delivering services, whether in health care or 
information, there is a big difference between delivering them in 
a place like Vancouver, Toronto, Winnipeg or Montreal and 
delivering them in rural Canada.  We must develop policies that 
take those differences into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to being with the hon. member in his home

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Chairman, this is one of the most awesome events I have 
participated in during my brief seven and a half or eight years 
as a member of parliament and my time as a legislative assistant 
for other members prior to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very interested in the comments made by the hon. member 
for Brandon—Souris.  As someone who has experience with the 
natural resources industry, I will point out to him an 
observation I have made.  As the hon. member knows, there is a 
nuclear reactor in my riding, at one point one of the largest in 
the country.  I have some interest in the dynamics of the 
marketplace, particularly as they relate to oil and gas and of 
course to food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have noticed the disparity between rural and urban Canada, of 
course, where fishing, farming, mining and forestry tend to be of 
a rural nature whereas the production, processing and delivery of 
products occur in more urban centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member has given any time, thought or 
consideration, along with his party colleagues, to reviewing and 
updating our thinking on the new changes in the marketplace and 
how it has become more concentrated.  Has he given any thought to 
the impact this might be having on the bottom line, not just for 
urban Canada but more specifically for rural Canada?  Either 
member can answer.  It is open to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Chairman, I know the member for 
Brandon—Souris wants a kick at this can too but the issue of 
processing comes from globalization and is not part of the 
traditional primary resource industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A prime example of that, and this is the point I want to get 
across, is what has happened in Britain.  With globalization and 
the amalgamation of meat processing plants in Britain, as well as 
the health standards that have been introduced in Canada, the 
United States and other parts of the world, many smaller 
abattoirs and meat processors in the U.K. have been forced out of 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foot and mouth disease was a direct result.  Huge meat 
processing conglomerates started taking hogs, sheep and beef 
animals from one part of Britain and, instead of processing them 
in the local village, trucked them in some cases 400 or 500 
miles.  Because of the incubation period, foot and mouth disease 
spread throughout Britain and to France and Germany in no time. 
It was a direct result of the globalization of the meat 
processing industry.  I would like to hear some comments on that 
or— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B>  I will ask the member to 
respond.  Time is up but I think we are being flexible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Madam Chairman, I will not take a lot 
of time.  My hon. colleague is obviously talking about primary 
processing and the minister will have an opportunity to see the 
state of the art largest hog processing plant in North America 
when he visits my riding on Friday. 
I would love to take the member on a tour.  I know we can arrange 
it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The urban market is obviously where most rural food products 
that are processed end up.  With regard to the member's question 
about urbanization, I can only say to him that there has been an 
evolution.  When my grandfather came to Canada he farmed a 
quarter and 80 acres, which at that time was a huge amount of 
land.  Today in my area a small farmer farms 2,000 to 2,500 
acres.  That is a huge difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not opposed to growth or evolution.  The point I am trying 
to make is that we must adapt.  Even in our natural resources and 
primary industries we must adapt.  There is no question about 
that.  However, as I said earlier, there must be an education 
process and an understanding in the urban market of what we are 
trying to achieve in rural areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will feed people.  We will give them lumber.  We will give 
them mining, natural resources, and oil and gas.  However people 
must appreciate that some of the wealth developed in urban 
centres must go back into rural communities, whether at the 
grocery store or when we turn on a switch or in some sort of 
societal support.  That is what we must talk about when we talk 
about support for rural Canada, and I think this is a good start.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Chairman, tonight I would also like 
to thank the minister responsible for northern Ontario, who 
stayed here all night. It is really appreciated and it is the 
first time that we have here a committee of the whole in which 
all parties are taking part, the Bloc Quebecois, the Canadian 
Alliance, the Progressive Conservative Party, the New Democratic 
Party and the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight's debate is a civilized debate. We should be doing this 
more often, that is finding solutions. We are making friends. The 
war is still on  and I appreciate the comments from the member 
for Témiscamingue who is still here tonight and who says that we 
have to co-operate for the well-being of our people. The war is 
still going on between political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will share my time with the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord. I 
also appreciate his dedication. What is important is that he is 
one of the originators within the Liberal caucus in this debate. 
I want to thank him because we all are people from resource 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What matters here tonight is the case of the ridings of 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik and Témiscamingue. We know that the 
economic situation there is now very different from what it was 
just a short while ago. The economic slowdown is serious in our 
resource regions. The situation is really bad in 
Abitibi—Témiscamingue. I have never seen anything like this in my 
whole life. In the last three years, we are managing a decline. 
Even the parish priest is depressed on Sundays. Think about it. 
People are trying to find ways to work. It is not easy. 
The governments and our ministers are doing a fine job, but that 
is not quite enough. The Liberal member for Outremont, who is the 
minister in charge of the economic development agency, is making 
announcements in CFDCs and in all areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing the government will have to do, and that is 
to go back to the effective agreements it had with the provinces. 
We had Quebec-Canada agreements in the mining industry. We could 
tell that Quebec was in charge. I agree with this, and we should 
not care which party forms the government. What matters is the 
taxpayer's money being spent here. We used to have good 
agreements. It seems that the discussion in Whitehorse brought 
about changes in provincial jurisdictions. If we have a big mess, 
everybody should do his part to find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know we have problems in the forest and mining industries. 
The 15 mines that will close in the coming years are all in 
Abitibi—Témiscamingue. The government knows that. Political 
affiliation does not matter. In the next 20 months, 1,000 jobs will 
disappear. We now have a serious crisis on our hands, with the 
Sigma-Lamaque mine being closed and the Beaufor mine having 
closed six months ago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must point out that solutions need to be found.  The 
government has implemented some things, such as the 15% tax 
credit on flow-through shares.  As the hon. member for 
Témiscamingue just said, improvement is needed.  It is true, 
improvements must be made.  This was a first test for the 
Minister of Finance.  We were pleased that he intervened in 
October.  It is not easy to understand what flow-through shares 
are.  We do know that a tax credit represents an additional 40% 
deduction the first year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the debate on the mining industry, a way must be 
found, along with the province of Quebec, to intervene. 
Authorization from Canada must be sought, because federal 
transfers are being made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Abitibi—Témiscamingue represents some 860,000 square kilometres, 
so things are not easy when it comes to the cost of fuel, raw 
materials and so on.  Everything comes from outside the area, 
anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else, however.  The mining industry has not 
benefited from the corporate income tax cut that was set out in 
the last budget.  That is what we are hearing from people. 
Officials of the Quebec Mining Association met with us in our 
officers and told us that the government had to find a way to 
give them some tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, in 1948 Canada passed an emergency act on support 
for the development of gold mines to help owners of 
gold mines in Canada deal with the strong increase in 
production costs and guarantee a stable price for the gold they 
produced. The government repealed this act on June 30, 1976, 
because prices had increased. During that period, the federal 
government had given the mining industry $303 million for 61 
million ounces of gold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to find a new way for the Government of Canada to 
support the gold mining industry, and we know that with the price 
of metals this is not easy, maybe we should come back to an 
emergency act. People say “We will sell gold.” I know that in the 
month of March of this year, Canada did not sell gold. Last year, 
we probably sold 900,000 ounces. People say to me “Guy, we will 
have to stop selling gold. The government should buy it up, keep 
it”. Such an act could help us to find a way to help our 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also support the efforts of industries regarding the 
exploitation of small auriferous deposits or base metal for small 
and medium size businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our companies go to South America or other countries and EDC 
guarantees the loans. This is awkward because it does not 
guarantee loans in Canada for companies who want to develop a 
deposit. If we do it for other countries, why not do it here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people in resource based regions see that Bombardier gets 
an interest free loan from the government, they are proud. This 
is not in our regions, but we are proud for people in Montreal, 
for all other communities in the south that get contracts from 
Bombardier; we are happy with that. 
However what are we doing for the small businesses? People would like 
to get repayable interest free loans to be able to go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk a long time about what we hear from the grassroots. 
Some members talked earlier about the forest resources. The 
member for Joliette and the member for Témiscamingue mentioned 
it, but the quotas also have to be taken into consideration. The 
quota system really hurt some of the small businesses back home, 
even well established companies, like Précibois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is strange is that we do not even know who has quotas. We 
are told that this information is confidential. Some people in 
Toronto have quotas even though they do not have a company, but 
just a lumber yard. Things are not easy back home. Those who have 
quotas also have a business, employees, wage ledgers and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want free trade and I know that Quebec will work hard on this 
issue because it is an important industry, but the James Bay and 
Nunavut area that I represent are facing other issues that we 
will need to address later on. This is a huge region. We have 
fishery resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are quotas on shrimp. People find it strange that the 
member of Val-d'Or should talk about quotas on shrimp. I 
represent the largest riding of all ten Canadian provinces. It 
covers 802,000 square kilometres, running 2,000 kilometres from 
north to south. I have 68 mayors to deal with. It is not easy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a constant fight for the economy. Our members are fighting 
for the economy. Think about families who are fighting to have a 
salary at the end of the week and who do not have jobs right 
now. The employees of McWatters and of Beaufor are in this 
predicament. There are cases like this throughout the mining 
industry and we are trying to find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also talked about the fishing industry, about Atlantic shrimp 
quotas and about the Inuit in my region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have nothing against urban areas, but we should establish a 
special agency in the resource regions of Abitibi, Témiscamingue, 
Baie-James—Nunavik, Lac-Saint-Jean and Îles-de-la-Madeleine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about a special agency, we would like decisions to 
be made locally and quickly. I will give the example of the 
Department of Human Resources Development, where decisions with 
regard to students are based on 1996 statistics. Today the 
unemployment rate for young people is 21%, but we are being told 
that it is 14.8%. Let us get real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am telling my government that it must find ways to do 
something about that. People would like nothing better than to 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really liked tonight's debate, and I think the government will 
listen to us. We must act quickly to find new ways of 
collaborating with the government of Quebec. That is what 
politics is all about. People do want to work. Resource regions 
need help right now. I say it and I will repeat it, they are 
going through very tough times. Negative growth is worse than a 
recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I trust this government and the ministers who work very 
hard. They are here, they are listening to us. We have surpluses, 
but we must act without further delay. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a comment and a 
question and I will continue in the spirit of good co-operation 
tonight and try to build on our common points instead of our 
differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of his speech, the hon. member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik talked about the creation of an 
agency or a willingness to see more decisions made in the 
regions. At the present time, the regional development agency is 
Canada Economic Development. Quite often we are frustrated 
because files only go through the riding office in Val-d'Or, but 
the decision making centre is not there. For example, Community 
Futures Development Corporations have boards comprised of people 
from the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member agree with the creation of a regional 
decision making structure and with people from the region running 
Canada Economic Development and having more leeway in making 
decisions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, the discretionary fund of local leaders is 
$100,000. It is the same as it was about fifteen years ago in 
former regional development agencies; $100,000 today and $100,000 
fifteen years ago do not have the same value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree with a board comprised of people from the region 
having more leeway to approve projects in the regions instead 
of constantly having, as in our case, to send them to Montreal or 
Ottawa to have them approved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Madam Chairman, the hon. member is right, 
because sometimes it takes three or three and a half months to 
get an answer. We currently have projects in the regions with 
universities, but we must wait three months, a month and a half 
or two months in Montreal, before going to Ottawa and having to 
wait for another month and a half. It is important to realize 
that people in the regions want decisions to be made 
immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know one thing. If I need $10,000, I go to a bank and if the 
manager has not given me an answer a week later, I go elsewhere. 
If we do not get an immediate answer from the bank manager, we 
find another solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is right. Perhaps the government should set up 
CFDCs or an agency to promote economic development for resource 
regions. Ministers come to the regions, they see things 
firsthand. 
However senior public officials do not always do so. They do not 
always come and they do not know the reality. They should come 
and spend a month in my region, in Rouyn-Noranda, Val-d'Or or in 
the area, to see what it is like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some do come. I know Jocelyn 
Jacques, who is from Montreal's CED. He visits the regions and 
he sees how things are going.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should not take 30 days to make decisions. Business people 
want action. It takes three months. This is why, if we have a 
development agency, we can have it. Our neighbour, Fednor, is a mere 400 
feet from the Rouyn-Noranda city limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Richard Desjardins says in his song, they are 400 feet away, 
but we should get the same thing to develop the forestry sector 
and all the other sectors, together with the James Bay Cree and 
the Inuit. They are our partners, but there must be some action 
in the short term, not in the long term, not during the next 
election campaign, not in three or four years, but in the short 
term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is right. A decision will have to be made as 
quickly as possible regarding economic projects, to help our 
economy back home. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Madam Chairman, perhaps I could make 
a comment on the last two interventions.  Both members spoke 
about a philosophy that I deeply believe in.  I believe the 
government demonstrates it an ongoing basis.  Rural development, 
community development particularly in resource communities, has 
to be a bottom up and not a top down driven process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are quite right that for there to be effective decisions 
in terms of the direction that needs to be taken, the types of 
priorities that need to be set, they have to be taken within the 
regions, taken at the local level.  Quite frankly what will work 
in northern Ontario may not necessarily work in Atlantic Canada, 
on the prairies or in the interior of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some models within the federal government which work 
that way.  The community futures program, I believe SADC in 
Quebec, is a program that works that way.  Although it is funded 
by the federal government and receives its money from the federal 
government, it is controlled and operated by a local board of 
directors chosen from local citizens in the community.  They know 
best their community and make the decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the federal government funds them, the decisions are 
made at the local level, including investments in small 
businesses. The community futures model, one which we have in 
Quebec, in Ontario and indeed right across the country, is a very 
apropos one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the federal-provincial infrastructure program 
where the decisions about what projects to bring forward are 
being made by the municipality, by the people closest to the 
citizens who understand the needs of their citizens the most, and 
then the federal and provincial governments collaborate with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The model is a good one.  The need to have a bottom up driven 
process is a good one.  We had some examples of where we 
undertake that in the federal government.  We can build upon 
those examples and enhance that type of process to even a greater 
extent. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, Lib.):</B> Madam Chairman, 
obviously I wish to congratulate all my colleagues.  It is 
relatively unusual to have a debate where partisan politics do 
not overshadow the interests of our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I wish to congratulate my caucus colleagues.  If I 
had been elected for the sole purpose of getting the Liberal 
caucus to approve an initiative such as this, I would have been 
thrilled.  It is probably the best way of promoting the 
interests of our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, we are very partisan regularly and that 
when the public's interests take precedence over what divides 
us, we probably all come out ahead.  That is part of 
what getting elected is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot debate the whole issue of natural resources without 
constantly bearing in mind the regions involved that depend on 
them.  We cannot analyze all the individual resources, be they 
fish, the forest, aluminum or the entire mining industry, 
without taking into account the regions that have lived off 
these resources for decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, as everyone has pointed out, all the country's resource 
regions are experiencing a very serious problem.  I come from 
the kingdom of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean.  This is not one of the 
country's high employment areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now our economic performance is due, very temporarily, to 
the construction of an Alcan plant.  In a few months we 
will fall back into the harsh reality, which is country wide, 
where our resources will no longer support us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that resources are exploited less than they 
were, it means that we are coming to terms with a technological 
increase in production rates.  In industrial sectors where we 
had 13,000, 14,000 or 15,000 people working, there remains 
perhaps 5,000, 6,000 or 7,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must assume its responsibilities 
and not think that everything will fall into place on its own 
when it holds federal-provincial conferences or transfers money 
to transfer payments, to tax points, to health care and to 
education or when we have specific programs for economic 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, obviously with the provincial 
governments, has a vital mission to carry out, that of ensuring 
the survival of resource regions.  It is clear that in 
politics we are always somewhat partisan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a quote from a speech by the rector of our university to 
the Quebec institute of public administration.  This is not from 
25 years ago, but from last April.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been clearly shown, and no one has contradicted these 
studies, that regions such as ours did not receive a fair return 
on their contributions to government coffers, according to their 
demographic weight and their needs, either in health services, 
or in investments in roads or, and even less so, in profits 
generated through the exploitation of national resources. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious to the rector that our regions were there 
to be exploited. As long as a few jobs were being created 
for resource development, most people did not complain too much. 
However now we realize that the jobs are no longer related to 
resource development. This is why the rector says that if we 
want to come into our own, regions like ours and like all the 
others will have to be involved in the decisions required to 
ensure our development. Decisions cannot come from higher up 
anymore, neither from Quebec City nor from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Mr. Moussaly, of the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi, said, 
resource regions like ours with a population of some 300,000 
generate surpluses of over $330 millions for the Quebec 
government. 
Nobody, as far as I know, except Mr. Landry, the former Deputy 
Premier, has challenged this and he had no evidence to back his 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that because resource development creates fewer jobs, 
it continues to fill the government coffers. Therefore, both the 
federal and the provincial government will have to ask 
themselves what is the best way to ensure that the resource 
regions benefit from the country's wealth. Canada is getting 
richer and the resource regions are getting poorer because young 
people are leaving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our area, between 2001 and 2015, our population in the 15 to 
30 year age bracket will drop from 62,000 to about 42,000, with 
unacceptable unemployment rates, yet we still produce the same 
amounts of aluminum ingots. All resource development activities 
go on without any further jobs being created and we keep on 
filling the government's coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A debate like the one we are having tonight should encourage the 
various levels of government to try to find some ways to empower 
the resource areas. It is not normal for an industry that 
generates almost $6 billion of positive economic activity in 
Canada, like the aluminum industry, to create from two and a 
half to three times fewer jobs than before, when it continues to 
export aluminium ingots throughout the world and buys back 
500,000 tons of finished product annually at the domestic level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should commend my government colleagues, because for the 
first time we will have a research centre on aluminum 
processing technologies to help us. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT140"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a 150 year wait, it does not matter if it takes a couple 
of years to build a centre that will empower us and help us to 
turn to aluminum processing, an activity that should do well in 
the future in many areas, like high technology, road 
transportation, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the government is to empower us and help us to make 
strategic choices to ensure our economic development in all the 
various industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, members of all parties are too often forced to make 
representations alongside regional promoters to Quebec City and 
Ottawa. 
I dream of the day when the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region and 
probably other regions as well will have their own development 
corporations, where we will have the ability to make choices, to 
have people with expertise to guide us in advanced sectors where 
we can excel and create jobs for our children. I dream of that 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also dream of the day when we will have the opportunity, 
through our own development corporation, to be financially 
involved in businesses instead of simply throwing grants and 
repayable loans at them, when we will able to bring the federal 
government, through all its departments and agencies, to tell a 
young person starting a small business “There are 8, 10, 12 of 
us here to support you and to be financially involved in your 
business. 
We want to advise you on market opportunities and on promising 
market niches that you could develop”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must renew its ties with resource 
regions. Within five or six years, it will transfer some $80 
billion dollars to the government of Quebec in equalization 
payments for health and education. I want to be sure that the 
federal government can take initiatives to assure resource 
regions that they will have what they need to fulfil their 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use health as an example. For the past 10, 15 or 20 
years, our region, which has a population of 300,000, has had a 
shortfall of about $75 million dollars each year. It is a fact 
that has been proven by provincial officials and that is 
recognized by all. 
The federal government is transferring $13 billion this year, 
but where is the guarantee that in my area we will have the 
moneys needed to assume our responsibilities, to give health 
care to the sick, at least to be able to give seniors a bath? 
That is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want governments to co-operate in order to respect the regions 
and to give them the means to choose the opportunities they want 
to exploit and financially help the businesses in full 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank members and greatly appreciate the debate tonight, as was 
pointed out by my friend Guy ,who is working very hard for his 
riding and for whom I have a lot of respect. He puts his full 
energy into projects for the people he represents. 
I am convinced that this is only a beginning and that we will 
have many other opportunities to exchange views will all our 
colleagues and with each other in order to promote a better 
understanding of the reality we are living in our regions and 
find constructive solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started with aluminum. We are dealing with health and we will 
try to deal with many other sectors, particularly the 
development of tourism. Members will understand I am thinking of 
the new vocation of the Saint-Félicien zoo, which will become a 
centre for the conservation of boreal biodiversity, in 
co-operation with the Government of Canada and all the other 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank you for allowing me to say these few words in this 
debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Chairman, the speech by the Liberal 
member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord was an excellent one.  I am 
familiar with his work in the House of Commons and I thank 
him again for having set in motion this emergency debate within 
the caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has referred to a development corporation, but a short term 
one.  Tourist resources are also development corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like a little more information.  When reference is made 
to tourism, we have both natural and tourism resources in our 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two points I wish to raise.  In the short term, how much 
does a development corporation need to get from the federal 
government?  Second, would the hon. member speak to us of the 
tourism resources in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Madam Chairman, obviously this debate is not 
the place to define a specific amount within which a regional 
development corporation must operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism has always been an area of concern to me.  Back in my 
first mandate here, when we were involved in creating the 
national marine park in the Saguenay fjord, I kept saying to 
myself that it was incredible that the fjord of Saguenay was not 
on the list of Canadian parks after more than a century.  I 
wondered whether we in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean were part of 
Canada.  Think about it.  I had the opportunity in 1997 to vote 
on the third reading of the bill establishing a national park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to work in that direction. I am certain that 
the people in our regions, like all the members here, will be in 
a position to make their own development choices, to choose the 
areas on which they wish to focus.  They need the assistance of 
the central government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain too that the federal government, while continuing 
to transfer funds to the provincial governments, is in a position 
to undertake initiatives that will help the regions take charge 
and direct themselves into areas with a future that will bring 
them into the world economy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Chairman, 
I would like to put a 
little question to my colleague from Chicoutimi—Le Fjord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening we have had a fine debate.  We have had 
very constructive discussions, apart from the member for 
Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, who did some politicking.  I listened to all 
the debates and I think people in my region were very pleased. 
I think everyone wants to move ahead, but I felt the member for 
Chicoutimi—Le Fjord wants to go backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected by the people of Jonquière to solve a problem 
faced by all of Canada's regions.  It is not only the riding or 
the region at home that faces it.  I was here to debate for all 
regions, to come up with constructive solutions for all of 
Canada's regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member for Chicoutimi-Le Fjord tried to rein in all 
the energy of the members of this House.  What the federal 
government is doing is not a partnership, as he seemed to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke of equalization payments.  Do you know that 
these payments were established in Canada in 1940?  That was 
before the war, in order to help the war effort of all the 
provincial governments.  It was renegotiated in 1977 by the 
governments in place, the governments of all the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is a federal-provincial agreement.  When he was the 
Conservative member, he said we had $33 billion cut since the 
arrival of this government.  I hope he recalls what he 
said.  At the time, his leader, Mr. Charest, now the head of the 
Liberal Party of Quebec, said the same thing, that the Prime 
Minister and not Lucien Bouchard was the one to blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to go beyond that and ensure we move ahead.  I 
am here to make progress.  Our regions are there for the same 
reasons.  The government has to move forward, not go backward 
always with an eye to the past.  The past tells us what 
the future will be, as the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik 
put it.  This is the way to go.  It is time to stop shooting 
oneself in the foot like the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord. 
What is needed is a partnership as the member wants with my 
colleague.  It is time to stop and this member must tell the 
truth.  We are all here to help each other and move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. 
member for her comments. She can count on me to work in a 
constructive way to promote research in the aluminum, health and 
tourism industries in my region. We will do our very best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that the Bloc Quebecois member for Jonquière still 
thinks my election was a glitch. It was not. Her leader, the 
member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, anticipated it two days before 
the election, when he delivered a speech in Chicoutimi during 
which he looked somewhat like De Gaulle. The hon. member for 
Jonquière remembers that in Chicoutimi the Bloc Quebecois leader 
proclaimed me the winner twice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that his spontaneity prevailed over partisanship. 
Trust me, we will continue to promote the interests of our 
region and we will do so very effectively, as we have shown for 
the past six months. I want to point out that, over the next six 
years, Quebec will get $80 billion in equalization and transfer 
payments. We will work hard to ensure that our region gets the 
maximum from the federal government to take charge of its own 
destiny, because there are people who feel that we do not get 
our fair share from the Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Jonquière is well aware of that. The federal 
government transfers funds to Quebec, where the money is put 
into structures in the regions. The PQ government sets up all 
sorts of committees. 
All these committees get small subsidies so that they are at the 
mercy of the PQ government. I am here to promote the initiatives 
that will ensure the future of my region, including research in 
all areas, tourism and the development of small and medium size 
businesses. We will continue to strengthen our presence and we 
will do our utmost to be increasingly more present in the 
country's resource regions, particularly in our beautiful region 
of the kingdom of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Chairman, I 
cannot resist correcting the 
member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord on a point or two.  I have 
respect for his political involvement but, at the end of his 
speech, when he questions the good faith of the government of 
Quebec in managing or spending money, I would point out to him 
that the government of Quebec is accountable to the voters. 
Normally, in Quebec City, there is one opposition party, which 
is there to do its job.  These members are accountable to the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that people expect their federal MPs to become 
opposition members in Quebec City when they are here.  There are 
places where that can be done.  I am sure that the people in his 
riding hope that the member will go after the maximum in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also sort of insinuated that there were many 
transfers that were going to be made to Quebec and that he was 
not too sure whether that was going to be properly spent in the 
regions. 
This needs to be put in perspective, however.  There were many 
cuts and, at the time, we were not concerned about how the 
government was making them.  People did not want Ottawa having a 
say in how they were made, but when it came to reinvesting 
money and good news, Ottawa had to call the shots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There cannot be a double standard.  The record needs to 
be set straight.  Equalization payments and health transfers do 
not advance regional development.  I hope that the government is 
talking about new money for regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when I was young, the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord 
was a Progressive Conservative at the time, there were 
Canada-Quebec agreements, subsidiary agreements on regional 
development.  My region received $75 million over five years. 
Since then, I wonder if Canada Economic Development has spent $5 
million in the last 10 years. At some point, we are no longer 
talking about amounts comparable to what they were previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, the Conservatives did some good development work. I 
give them credit for this. There are two members who are now 
sitting on the other side, but who were Conservatives then. They 
believed in the regions and I hope the Liberal Party will take a 
more favourable approach towards the regions, while respecting 
everyone's abilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with a question. Would the hon. member agree 
with regional management of this? He spoke of a development 
corporation for the kingdom or a local corporation that would be 
a shareholder in projects, which is a very good idea, and not 
only a granting agency, so that we could have long term benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, CFDCs, as the secretary of state was 
pointing out rightly, are managed locally but not Canada Economic 
Development. Decision making centres for these structures are 
outside. I am sure he has experienced this elsewhere. Would it 
not be appropriate, at least in the short term, to correct the 
way Canada Economic Development is working, so that people from 
the region can have a say on what is going on there? There ought 
to be more leeway to work with this tool while waiting to develop 
another, if need be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Madam Chairman, I thank my colleague for his 
comments. Indeed, a corporation that would be responsible for 
the development of a region, both in terms of capital and it 
terms of strategic development choices, would obviously have to 
be controlled locally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not taken the time to fully define the operation and the 
legal structure of such a corporation, but we would like that to 
happen quickly. We are looking for a formula that would enable 
us to be more effective in resource regions. Things are going 
well in Montreal in terms of development. The problem is that 
people think that resource regions can survive without 
government support. It is simply not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us analyze the number of people who leave our region, and 
that goes for all resource regions. We must have ways of keeping 
our young people. 
There are niches we can exploit in all sectors. For example, in 
the lumber industry, we are slowly starting to move into 
processing, 
but things are progressing too slowly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Chairman, it is certainly an 
opportunity to speak at a take note debate.  This is the largest 
audience that I have ever seen at this type of a debate.  I 
recall my first take note debate when we were talking on Bosnia. 
It was probably the second week I was here.  There were two 
members in the House for that debate.  This is a huge turnout. 
Obviously this method is working better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of industry and natural resources in my 
constituency.  A $7 billion expansion was just completed to our 
petrochemical industry.  We have a pork plant capable of 
processing something like 20,000 hogs per day, most of it shipped 
to Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 70% of my constituency is urban high tech.  The future of 
our community is very dependent on industry and on natural 
resources.  There are 11 quarter sections of land under housing 
development.  There is massive growth and we can just barely keep 
up.  There is zero unemployment.  This is a good news story from 
our area.  We of course have the Alberta advantage with low taxes 
and that which goes with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put a little emphasis tonight on an issue that I am 
most concerned with and that is the environmental implications of 
so much that we do, whether we talk about urban or rural 
development or whether we talk about industry and natural 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A speaker a long time ago talked about Syncrude.  I worked on 
the Syncrude project before there was a Syncrude and was part of 
an environmental study which was done when it was just a pristine 
environment.  One of the earlier speakers implied that there was 
no environmental concern, but I for one know because I worked 
there for about three years doing an environmental impact.  It 
was done and that was a long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about three things.  I would like to talk about 
Kyoto, air and air pollution and water.  Those are three 
resources that we should be particularly concerned about and that 
we should have a lot to say about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak briefly on Kyoto because it is a huge issue and 
obviously we would need a number of nights to really get into the 
Kyoto deal.  I think it was doomed from the beginning.  I do not 
think anybody really disagrees that climate change is occurring. 
The impact that humans are having on that is scientifically 
debatable.  That again is another issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process was doomed because of lack of consultation and a 
lack of planning.  The government did not do its job properly.  I 
am talking about this government and a number of others.  Kyoto 
one was doomed from the beginning.  It could not possibly work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us should learn a lesson when we talk about natural 
resource development or concerns about consultation and 
communication with the people, industry and the provinces.  That 
is what we have to do but I feel we have not done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the good news about Kyoto?  The good news is that at 
least now we are aware that there is a problem.  Canada now has 
the opportunity to show some leadership to the world to move on 
and involve China, India and Brazil, those industrialized 
countries that were not part of Kyoto one.  Let us let them 
leapfrog in terms of technology.  Let us sell them technology 
that would not allow them to have air pollution if they went 
through all the steps we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot we can do and encourage.  We can encourage 
alternate energy.  We can do all those things.  We must make 
decisions about tradeoffs that we will have to make.  The worst 
way to handle this would be for a government on high to come down 
with a carbon tax or with some kind of oppressive decision 
against energy in order to try and force conservation on people. 
People will buy into it.  People will co-operate.  The people of 
Calgary are buying into wind energy.  It costs more but they are 
buying it and are proud of it.  There is any number of new office 
towers in Calgary, most of them are heated with solar energy. 
They have solar collectors on the roof.  That is the kind of 
thing government can encourage by tax breaks, by research and 
development.  There is so much we can do, so let us not lament 
about Kyoto.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I really believe the Canadian government is doing a reasonable 
job of saying that we have to have sinks and that we have to have 
all of these or we cannot agree.  When I was with the minister at 
the G-8 environment minister's conference it was obvious to me 
that the government understood the next step that we had to take. 
Now we need to communicate that to the people and to the people 
in the House, and we need to discuss it openly.  Maybe we need to 
have another take note debate on Kyoto and what we do about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, all Canadians are concerned about air quality.  The 
people of southern Ontario and of the Fraser Valley are 
concerned.   Let me tell the House something that is happening 
with resource development and it is that we should think about 
because it has happened in Ontario and now it is happening in 
B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a power shortage in California but California does not 
want to have energy plants there because they pollute.  God knows, 
it has to protect the air in California because there are 
problems.  It now has legislation because it had referenda which 
said it had to take care of its air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Washington state wants to get the profit by selling energy to 
California but it does not allow high tension power lines over 
places where people live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the good idea?  It is to build Sumas 2, 3, 4 and 5 or 
actually 12 power plants within 500 yards of the British 
Columbia-Washington border.  Why is that such a good idea?  They 
would take Alberta gas.  They would have wind blows north.  They 
could run the power lines down the centre of Abbotsford and the 
high tension power lines could be taken out to the coast and run 
down to California.  It would be the perfect situation. 
California would get the energy without having to have the power 
plants.  Washington would get the profit without having to have 
the pollution.  Of course we would get the high tension power 
lines, the pollution and we would make the Fraser Valley the 
number one most polluted place in Canada instead of southern 
Ontario.  Southern Ontario would become second and Fraser Valley 
would become number one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the kinds of things that we cannot let happen.  We 
cannot let energy development go that way.  I phoned our consul 
in Seattle, a former Liberal member from Newfoundland who is a 
good friend and a good guy.  He said that they could not 
interfere with what foreign governments did.  However, we can 
damn right interfere with what foreign governments do if it is 
going to blow that air into our area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to work together. If we are talking global energy, then 
let us talk global energy.  I say the government is not standing 
up for those people in the Fraser Valley.  I am really concerned 
about that, so are the people of Abbotsford and the people of 
that area.  The people of Ontario should be concerned as well 
because the same thing could happen there.  We could literally 
put power plants right along the whole border as long as the 
winds were blowing the right way.  Let us be concerned about 
that. Let us talk about that.  No matter what we are doing, 
whether it is agriculture, energy or natural resources, we have 
to think about the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started out as an environmentalist.  I trained as a biologist 
and now I am back full circle talking about the environment 
again.  We need to talk about the environment in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, water will be our most important nature resource of the 
future and again the government needs to take leadership.  What 
do we need to do?  We need to know what we have as a resource. 
We have never mapped our aquifers.  We do not know how much water 
we really have.  We do not know if we are on a positive or 
negative input for that water.  We do not know whether we are 
draining our aquifers, whether they are being replaced or whether 
they are positive or negative. 
That is easy.  The science is there.  We know how to do that. 
Many parts of the world have done that.

consider the ecological impacts when we change or divert water 
from one place to another.  We need to talk about that openly. 
The government needs to communicate that openly.  Then we need to 
make decisions.  That is how we handle water.  I encourage the 
government to consider that and to communicate that to people as 
an important resource. 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Chairman, we are very interested 
in the comments made by the hon. member for Red Deer, 
particularly with respect to the issue in California and the lack 
of energy there.  He explained something that was occurring in 
the Fraser Valley.  I am not sure if he meant coal generation or 
hydroelectric generation and what the implications were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am from southern Ontario.  A lot of us would like to believe 
that our air is fairly clean.  A lot of us would prefer not to 
have the kind of blow over from some of the coal-fired plants 
that have been used as an alternative to the shutting down of 
some the reactors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for us to really understand where he was coming from, 
could the member perhaps give us, in the environment that we have 
here, a specific illustration of the problem because it was a 
very good thought.  I am not sure if it is a provincial 
jurisdiction or if we should be co-operating with those levels of 
government, obviously we should, but I would like a better 
illustration of what he was saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Madam Chairman, first, we should be 
co-operating with the provincial governments in all cases because 
it is a common problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be gas fired generation.  Initially, they were going 
to use diesel fuel and gas, and at one point they were going to 
use coal.  There is one plant being proposed as coal but the 
other eleven, as I understand it, will now be totally gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is the location and the prevailing winds.  One of 
those plants, the Sumas 2, which is the closest to being approved 
by the government, will put out 3,000 tonnes of pollutants. I 
could give a breakdown of the chemicals involved, but the point 
is that air is already polluted from Vancouver.  Because of where 
those plants will be located, the pollutants will blow directly 
into the Fraser Valley which is backed up by mountains and so it 
will capture that air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An air analysis was done.  Medically, Health Canada says that 
150 deaths per year right now can be directly attributed to the 
air in that area.  That is with what they have now.  If we 
magnify that by what is being proposed, it becomes even more 
dramatic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to work with the province and the federal government 
needs to provide the leadership to help the province and the 
cities, urban and rural.  The farmers have been told by 
Agriculture Canada that their production could go down as much as 
30% because of the pollution that is coming in there.  It has big 
implications. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Chairman, I am somewhat heartened by the discussion that has gone 
on tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a person who has lived in a resource based riding for the 
last 42 years.  I have earned my living from resource production. 
Basically mining but certainly forestry is a big producer in my 
area.  I am talking about northwestern British Columbia, which is 
probably a bit of a microcosm of the natural resource history of 
Canada.  We have had mines come and go.  We have had the forestry 
industry wax and wane.  It is a real indication of how critical 
and how important resource industries are to the local economy 
but how tenuous they are when it comes to world commodity prices 
and situations that affect them.

<A HREF="#LINKT146"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a little history on some of the mines that 
have come and gone since I lived in that riding over the past 42 
years.  I started out at the north end in Cassiar, which was a 
world famous asbestos mine.  Asbestos has its connotations for 
some, but it has produced a lot of products for the Canadian 
export economy and has created a great deal of wealth for the 
north over its lifespan.  It is no longer there for various 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mine at Stewart, a world famous gold, silver, lead and zinc 
mine, is long gone but was a real producer in its time.  Mines 
come and go.  We have Eskay Creek producing today.  It is a world 
class silver producer with some very substantial gold values as 
well.  It is an incredible mine.  It will be mined out, but it is 
there today and is producing wealth for the north and for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Windy Craggy, which we heard a lot about a few years ago, was a 
potential world class copper, cobalt and gold property.  They 
spent something like $50 million proving up the ore body and 
going into pre-feasibility studies and had the rug pulled out 
from under them for mainly environmental reasons.  That is a real 
tragedy in terms of a resource that could have produced thousands 
and thousands of man years of jobs and billions of dollars of 
revenue and contributed hundreds of millions of dollars into 
government coffers over 30 or 40 years with the potential for 
other mine development in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very pristine area but if done properly these things can 
be done.  Balance is the key to the whole development of our 
natural resources.  There is a price to pay for everything but 
the price has to be acceptable.  If we can come up with an 
acceptable way for development, whether oil and gas, minerals, 
forestry, hydro electric or whatever, some projects are doable 
and some are not.  There has to be that balance.  We have lost 
that balance to a large degree and that is something we have to 
try to get back, because of the potential for the wealth of 
Canada that can be generated.  We cannot forget that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other mines that have come up such as the Grand 
Isle copper mine.  In my little town of Stewart there was the 
Grand Duke copper mine which was the world's largest underground 
copper mine at one time.  It was huge, having a thousand men 
working there.  There are still millions of pounds of copper 
underground there, but the mine is gone.  It is closed down.  It 
is not viable to operate for a number of reasons which I will get 
into at the end of my 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we took a thousand jobs out of a town the size of Stewart, it 
would be down to 500 people.  When jobs are gone, the community 
and the people suffer.  We are lucky we have the Huckleberry 
mine.  It is not in my riding but the ore is hauled into the port 
of Stewart.  It is a copper mine that is producing today, 
marginally viable, but it is luckily enough still producing.  We 
have the Kemess mine, which is a fairly new one.  It is a copper 
mine in northwestern B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to encourage these types of developments.  Unfortunately 
it is getting more and more difficult for mining companies not 
only to find new ore bodies but to develop them because of red 
tape, restrictions and problems that are put in their way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the potential for oil and gas.  In northeastern B.C. it 
is booming.  Fort St. John, Fort Nelson and all along the Alberta 
border and into Alberta is booming area with oil and gas 
development.  I envy them.  It is creating jobs and putting food 
on the tables of families and creating revenue for governments. 
That is what we need to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the east coast we have Hibernia and Sable Island producing 
oil and gas.  Hibernia is a huge benefit to the eastern part of 
Canada.  On the west coast we have the potential for oil and gas 
that is 10 times that of Hibernia.  It is huge, but nothing is 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a moratorium on exploration, not on production but on 
exploration.  We are not even allowed to go out there and have a 
look at it.  The message I want to send to government is that it 
is time we took a real hard look at this. Technology has evolved. 
The environmental restrictions are there and there are ways and 
means of doing things that were not there 30 years ago when the 
moratorium was put on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The potential is there, 10 times Hibernia, for pulling B.C. out 
of the economic doldrums which it is in right now through no 
fault of the government.  I guess we all contribute.  It needs to 
change.  We need to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pulp and paper industry in my area is absolutely critical to 
feeding families and putting food on the table.  The FCI pulp 
mill is in Prince Rupert.  The communities of Terrace, Kitimat, 
Stewart, Smithers and Hazelton depend on that forest resource. It 
is getting tougher to be able to develop resources.  For a number 
of reasons we are able to develop resources but the cost is 
rising and it is getting tougher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I wish to make is that if there is a mountain of gold 
but the gold cannot be produced at a profit it is a waste.  If it 
is not ore it is a waste.  It is that simple.  That is the 
problem we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ninety miles north of my home in the Stewart area is what is 
called the Ground Hog coal field.  It has been known for almost 
100 years.  It is a world class anthracite coal deposit.  It is 
the cleanest burning coal.  It is a wonderful product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We actually shipped coal to Newcastle from there on a test 
basis.  A hundred thousand tonnes of Groundhog coal was shipped 
through the port of Stewart some 10 or 12 years ago.  It has not 
been developed.  There are reasons for that.  It is not 
economically viable.  The companies that own it look at these 
projects and because of all the hoops that have to be jumped 
through and world markets and commodity prices that all 
contribute to the bottom line.  If there is no bottom line they 
do not develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are having difficulties with the fishery which is another 
natural resource.  In my maiden speech I touched on the Pacific 
salmon treaty and some of the fisheries management difficulties 
that we are having on the west coast.  There are some real 
difficulties in the herring roe and kelp fishery in terms of 
licences going one way or another and the balance not being there 
any more.  The fish industry is very concerned about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have potential in water, another natural resource.  We have 
the Kemano project, a hydro electric project that produces power 
for Kitimat.  It is a huge project that has been there for many 
years and yet Kemano completion was shut down.  There was a 
second stage to the original project which was shut down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask ourselves why these things are happening.  There 
is something wrong.  The potential is just absolutely phenomenal 
and this is one small corner of Canada, northwestern British 
Columbia.  I am sure it is happening all over the country.  We 
need to ask ourselves what we can do.  The backbone of Canada is 
its natural resources and its people.  We have to look at 
providing long term benefits to communities when we produce these 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that is a concern of my colleague across the floor.  It 
is a message I am getting loud and clear.  Over the past 40 years 
resource communities have gone through the ebbs and flows of 
peaks and valleys.  The valleys are getting deeper unfortunately 
and the peaks are getting a lot less frequent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be long term benefits accruing to these 
communities.  That is something that we really did not deal with 
in the past very well.  We have to look at that to see how we can 
stabilize this community, especially when we develop finite 
resources such as metals, minerals, oil and gas.  Forestry is a 
little different because it is a renewable resource.  If we deal 
with that properly we can have trees forever.  I will get 
arguments on that, but I know we can if we do it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People is the resource that gets forgotten very often.  How many 
times have I seen a mine shut down, all kinds of government funds 
come in to help people move away and relocate and then the town 
dies?  We have then lost a lot of the good people and the 
potential for developing something else becomes more difficult 
because the workforce is gone.  It just compounds itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize and understand some of these things.  What 
can we do to encourage our resource industries?  The taxation 
aspects are critical.  The industry has to be allowed to make a 
profit to reinvest.  Flow through taxing for mining was 
mentioned.  That is a good start.  We need to pursue that a lot 
further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example. in B.C. last year roughly $25 million was spent 
on mining exploration.  We need to spend $150 million per year to 
maintain a level that would see some new mines coming out in the 
future.  There is a huge problem that has to be dealt with.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A program put in many years ago by the Conservative government 
in 1957-58 was called roads to resources.  That opened up the 
whole northwest corner of British Columbia as well as, I think, a 
number of other areas in Canada.  That is something the 
government should take a look at again in regard to some sort of 
program that would allow some of the more remote areas with huge 
potential to develop.  I am not saying to subsidize anything.  I 
think industry has to stand on its own two feet, but government's 
role is to provide the basic infrastructure of power, roads, 
ports and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my colleagues across are nodding, so I assume they 
are hearing me.  I do appreciate that.  I have enjoyed this 
opportunity, Madam Chairman.  I think it is a good format and we 
should continue it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Chairman, I want to thank the 
hon. member for Skeena.  I thought some of his comments were very 
interesting.  I have just spent a little time in British Columbia 
in the community of Kimberley, which is closer to Cranbrook.  I 
was also surprised at the reliance of the community on local 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly from his own experience the hon. member has quite a bit 
of knowledge on what is needed.  How does a resource based 
industry or how do resource based communities such as the ones he 
alluded to in his area compete, given globalization and given the 
need for shareholders' rights to be first and foremost in terms 
of profit making?  Even if we are the most productive country in 
the world, at some point or other it would appear that Canada 
does not always have the edge, short of giving away any type of 
tax concession, which seems to be the only alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there other areas where the member believes that Canada may 
have a competitive advantage vis-à-vis other nations that may 
produce the same product but per unit much more cheaply?  Because 
of course there are other factors such as warmer climates and 
cheaper labour which might also enter into this.   What does the 
member think would help his community, certainly in light of 
depressed prices like we see in the cycle he referred to earlier? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton:</B>  Madam Chairman, obviously there is no 
panacea that will solve all these problems overnight.  I fully 
understand and recognize that, but I think we have to start 
working toward some of these solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned Kimberley.  Of course the Sullivan Mine has 
been going for almost 100 years.  It is due to close very 
shortly.  I think it probably is finally mined out.  Mines do not 
last forever.  They are finite resources.  However, by the same 
token, the incentives can be there for industry when it is 
developing and getting the mines into a production stage.  As 
somebody mentioned earlier, a mine starts to close the day it 
opens, because eventually the ore body is depleted.  The key is 
to maximize the ore body, as I think somebody mentioned.  That is 
a very good term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resources will not last forever, but we must maximize them. 
We can do that by being the best in the world at what we do, as 
Canada certainly is when it comes to mining and forestry and, I 
am sure, a number of other industries, like agriculture.  We are 
pretty damned good at fishing too, maybe too good but I do not 
know about that, because there are some problems.  We have to be 
the best in the world at what we are doing.  I think we can do 
that as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a role for government, as I said earlier, in providing 
basic infrastructure.  I think that is key.  We must have power, 
roads and ports.  Those three things have to be in place.  We 
might include railroads to a degree, although that has more of a 
private sector aspect.  It did not 150 years ago, but today I 
think that is more for the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the tax climate and flow through shares and things 
like that.  I am not suggesting subsidies.  I do not believe in 
them myself.  I do not think that is the way to go.  I think the 
answer is a tax regime that is amenable to investment and allows 
profits to be made, to be reinvested and to create more jobs.  I 
think that is the answer and we just have to work toward that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Chairman, the member raised the concept of roads to resources, a 
policy from the late 1950s.  How you look at that depends on 
which end of the road you were at in regard to whether the 
program was a good thing, because the policy then was more a 
colonization policy.  The colonization I talk about is the 
unexploited north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our region in Saskatchewan, it brought the roads from the 
south straight up north, whereas the traditional transportation 
route was east-west.  The northern communities were east-west 
oriented, but the road to resources program criss-crossed it 
north-south.  It still disrupts the whole flow of our community 
and our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going to the next step of development in the hinterlands, the 
frontier, the mid-north or the boreal forest, I think it is time 
that the true social, economic and ecological balance, or what we 
call sustainable development, should be challenged.  It is time 
for us to be responsible.  People in the north have to be part of 
their development.  They cannot just watch the resource trucks 
come up and go down with the ecological impact and the transition 
that takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that resources, especially non-renewable resources, have 
to leave legacies.  In my region there are no research and 
development institutes in the boreal forest.  There are none. All 
the research is done in southern universities and in corporate 
centres to the south.  The region is still like a colony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like us to take a responsible look at the northern 
regions.  Let us develop those areas.  If people want to develop 
the area, they should move there, pay the taxes, circulate in the 
economy and create an economic cycle, where one dollar can go to 
the Mac's store, another dollar can go to the laundromat and 
another dollar can go to the local car dealer.  Right now it is 
still like the roads to resources program.  Forestry, mining, oil 
and gas are taken from the north and we turn around and get our 
goods at the Wal-Mart in the shopping mall to the south.  That 
has to change. I think an economic cycle should be created in 
these northern regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear what the hon. member's experiences are in 
northern B.C. compared to what mine have been in my area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton:</B>  Madam Chairman, I fully concur with the 
hon. member's concerns.  I think I said earlier that long term 
and lasting benefits must accrue to the resource based 
communities.  I think that is where we really have failed in the 
past, like in the community I used to live in.  I moved away when 
I became a member of parliament, to a more urban area.  Believe 
me when I say that I really miss my quiet rural life, but I am 
enjoying this too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Benefits have to accrue.  There is no question about it.  Times 
have changed.  In the past people went in to get resources, got 
them out of there and that was the end of it. What was left 
behind was left behind.  I do not think that is acceptable any 
more.  It is a shame that it has gone as far as it has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was going to say, the community I used to live in has gone 
from a peak population of 2,500 when the Grand Duke mine was 
operating to 500 people today.  We have had a few humps and bumps 
in the meantime, but it is very difficult for these small 
communities that are resource based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there has to be something left behind, whatever it might 
be.  As the member suggests, it could be forestry research 
centres or northern campuses for universities and those types of 
things.  That is something that needs to be addressed.  A lot of 
these issues are much more provincial than federal, but I think 
this is a good place to suggest some of these things and possibly 
funnel some funds toward it in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main experience with the roads to resources was, of course, 
the Stewart-Cassiar highway.  It was done under that roads to 
resources program in 1957-1958, in that era.  It basically built 
a road from Cassiar to Tidewater and Stewart so that the product 
could flow not through the Yukon, unfortunately for Whitehorse, 
but more directly to Tidewater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kemess mine right now hauls its concentrate further eastward 
to hit railhead at Mackenzie to go to Vancouver.  It is hauling 
it further that way than it would have to straight out to 
Tidewater and Stewart.  It is going in the wrong direction and it 
is going 1,000 miles to Vancouver.  It does not make sense.  The 
mining company itself cannot afford to build that road.  A road 
is proposed, but if there were some co-operation among the 
federal and provincial levels of government and the industry, 
there are other potential ore bodies in there that could be 
developed if a road were there. 
Also, the forest industry would be extremely happy to see such a 
road.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the types of things we need to look at.  What is the 
potential for natural resource development if government gets 
involved in some form of basic infrastructure, maybe not building 
the road per se but assisting with it?  That is what I am saying. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Chairman, I will be sharing my 
time with the member for Churchill River.  I have attended for 
two hours now.  I am not as patient, of course, as the hon. 
minister for rural development, but I have sat many times very 
pensively watching his work and his deliberations.  I applaud his 
efforts, not only for being here for all these very good and 
valued questions but also for being the first, I think, to deal 
with one of the more substantive issues that confront the House 
of Commons, usually in a very partisan and very confrontational 
way. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight, my comments will deal with a subject that is perhaps a 
sort of hub of the major issues of the day concerning the energy 
sector and the market structure. We see now that oil prices have 
increased, although they have not reached $28 a barrel yet, and 
we also see prices at the pump of 80 cents a litre in Toronto 
and 90 cents in other areas such as in Quebec, and even a little 
higher, depending on tax variations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned.  I cannot for the life of me think of something 
that is more debilitating to bringing us together, under the 
question of not just our nation but of natural resources, and to 
overcoming the divide between rural and urban sectors in our 
economy than knowing that the people who produce the product—and 
knowing that there could be an abundance of jobs in those 
areas—are at the same time perhaps suspect on the part of those 
who are consuming the products at the other end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers across Canada, whether they be in rural or urban 
areas, quite often are subjected to very high prices for 
products.  At the other end, of course, those who produce the 
products, whether they be miners or farmers or those who are 
working on the derricks in this country, will find that the price 
may be satisfactory.  However, no one is making a whack of cash 
at the platform level and certainly jobs are being created there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say all of this in the context of the government's interest in 
the area of continental energy policy.  I am perhaps borrowing 
from previous members of parliament and from one who is no doubt 
familiar, Madam Chairman, to you and to the Governor General, Ray 
Hnatyshyn.  As a member from Saskatchewan, he said on the 
question of a continental energy policy that for Canada it is 
like swapping partners but with a bachelor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course this creates some difficulty, because a lot of people 
would naturally assume that providing new opportunities for a 
hungry, thirsty energy deficient U.S. may on the surface appear 
to be an important way of ensuring that we are able to get other 
concessions from that country, particularly in areas that deal 
with natural resources, such as potatoes, agriculture and of 
course softwood lumber.  We are at the same time perhaps risking 
the rise in energy costs to the extent that those energy costs 
may be prohibitive not to the Americans or to others within that 
continental arrangement, but more specifically to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like to point out for members of parliament what I 
believe to be a rather interesting phenomenon that is occurring 
right across the country.  People may be paying as much as 80 
cents to 90 cents a litre for gasoline, yet crude is $10 less 
than it was six months ago.  As I mentioned earlier, it was 
hovering at the $28 range.  Six months ago it was near $36 or $38 
and the price was averaging roughly 75 cents or 76 cents.  What 
has changed is the market structure and the ability of those who 
process.  Again, it is that big middle ground between the 
producer of the product and the consumer.  Those who refine or 
transport or create this new product are able to take a lot more 
as a result of a lack of or a deficiency in competition.

<A HREF="#LINKT151"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a number of excuses or reasons given.  One which 
was been cited was short supply.  Canada does not have a shortage 
of supply.  Maybe there is the odd refinery that shuts down from 
the United States.  However let me be very clear on the question 
of natural resources for all my colleagues here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The excuse that is trotted out before winter is that it will be 
a cold winter therefore we will have low inventory.  During the 
summer there are more people driving and therefore we have a low 
inventory.  These are realities of our geography and climate in 
Canada.  We have cold winters and warm summers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However Canadians have experienced not only high prices for 
gasoline but for other energy products, more so than we have seen 
in many years.  Of course that may be owing to the fact that we 
are already part of a continental arrangement where NAFTA has 
prevented us from keeping a supply.  Perhaps that is not such a 
good thing.  It certainly is not what I am advocating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am concerned about is the ability to tack on an extra few 
cents.  Today, when Canadians are reading about record profits 
being made by oil companies to the tune of almost $1 billion in 
the downstream alone in 12 short weeks, there is something 
seriously wrong with the transfer of wealth from the Canadian 
economy to the bottom lines of major oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not disagree for a moment that a continental policy which 
allows Canadian products to be refined and created here in Canada 
but produced and sold back to Canadians in U.S. prices is in 
itself a bad thing.  Canadians and many members of parliament I 
am sure are not aware of the fact that it constitutes virtually 
12 cents of a litre of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns about the object of a purposeful discussion 
on dealing with resources and making productive uses of them for 
all Canadians and for the international market.  I do not think 
Canadians should volunteer themselves as international boy scouts 
and assume we should be looking in the other direction, saying 
that that is fine and that we can supply energy to other nations 
but that we are not looking after the interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today on April 24, 2001, it would appear to me that that is a 
very serious problem for Canadians.  However I believe there also 
is a problem with the structure of the market.  Those who control 
the product are in a position to also control and determine what 
the price is going to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we control the infrastructure, if we control the pipelines, 
if we control the ability for the product to be refined, it is 
very conceivable that those who are producing, whether in the 
industries of agriculture or fishing or mining, will wind up with 
lower and lower prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the issue of agriculture.  It seems rather 
unfortunate that we simply are looking at the issue of 
agriculture from the perspective of depressed international 
crises.  Most analysts are now looking at agriculture from a 
different perspective and that is to see that there are changes 
of concentration, dynamic, quick, evolving changes of 
concentration in the areas of processing and manufacturing to 
respond to the new realities of concentration at the retail 
sector in our economy, certainly as it relates to food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, although Wal-Mart does not have a large presence 
in terms of groceries in Canada, certainly the weight and the 
substantial size and power influenced by Loblaws, or Sobeys or by 
other smaller but nevertheless important regional players, such 
as Dominion and A&P, have an impact on artificially raising 
manufacturing costs and in turn take this out on farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just something that has been invented by this member 
of parliament at this time.  Policy-makers and a lot of us do not 
want to enter into the more substantive and critical area of 
determining what the structural problems are with the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are not prepared to accept that Canada has, perhaps more 
than other nations and certainly more than our trading partners, 
a much more concentrated market environment, we are inevitably 
going to find ourselves in a position where all the solutions we 
are looking for are really band-aids and very short term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I would plead with members of parliament that when we are 
dealing with the issue of natural resources, we look further than 
simply saying that these are industries that have to compete on 
the international market or that these are industries that have a 
similar product but the processes might be somewhat different. 
We must examine whether or not the markets in which those 
products are to be sold are already predetermined and 
precontrolled in which there is already a fixed or set price, 
which is harmful and detrimental to the competitive process but 
is also detrimental to the very people who are working day in and 
day out across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with a dichotomy of people in rural areas, as I 
have heard from the minister, who are not making enough and who 
do not have jobs.  We have heard about the mining sector and the 
agricultural sector.  We heard about consumers who felt they were 
paying too much.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, Lib.):</B>  Madam Chairman, 
I hope you do not 
mind, but I will start my presentation by sharing a map.  This 
map transcends political boundaries.  There is no language on it. 
Because of the satellite imagery technology that exists today, 
it is available to us.  It is in printed form for us as 
parliamentarians.  However not one of our committee rooms or 
other rooms has a map of Canada in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for us to make our place on the planet, and we always 
want to say we are not Americans, why do we not put a map of 
Canada somewhere in a northern location.  We are a northern 
country.  We are from the northern hemisphere.  If we stand at 
home and look at the world, our home is to our back.  I propose a 
map be hung in one of the committee rooms.  We could dedicate a 
committee room with a map of the natural resources and natural 
waters of Canada as a gift to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some of these committee rooms it might spark an initiative. 
Maybe somebody in downtown Toronto would start to see that the 
islands in the north are a part of our decision making.  We have 
Quebec, the St. Lawrence region, the Hudson Bay watershed, the 
Mackenzie River watershed and the whole west coast watershed in 
the Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an astounding lesson.  As a young person I have always 
been interested in land and water.  I was a surveyor and was 
working in the mines.  I can always find something new on a map. 
It could be an oil company, a mining company or a forestry 
company but there are always new discoveries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As decision makers we are lacking vision.  We have not created 
an image of our own country, region and territories.  This is a 
huge mistake.  My riding is Churchill River but when I enter the 
House I assume a responsibility for all of Canada.  This is what 
needs to be done here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Terminology is also very important.  I spoke with the minister 
responsible for rural development.  I have always challenge words 
about the regions of Canada.  The three regions which were 
mentioned in the throne speech were urban, rural and northern. 
The north is a unique region of its own.  It is not rural.  We 
are trying to be urbanized but we are really not urban either. 
The north is a unique opportunity, a unique lifestyle and a 
unique climate.  It is everything in its own.  The north has 
enough weight of its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a northern minister who is in charge of the territories 
north of sixty.  We have huge regions in the northern half of the 
provinces where there is no federal ministry in charge.  That is 
why I challenged the rural minister because he had his remote 
community added on to his portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we co-ordinated ourselves with our provinces as well, 
from Labrador to Quebec to Ontario to Manitoba to Saskatchewan to 
Alberta to B.C. and to the Yukon, Northwest Territories and 
Nunavut.  All these regions should not only have a resource 
development and community development vision, but also social and 
human development vision. 
It all comes hand in hand.  We cannot do it separately.  We 
cannot leave legacies like Uranium City in my riding which had a 
huge mining operation.  It looks like Beirut today.  The mining 
company pulled out.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government was also responsible there because it 
started out as Eldorado, a federal crown corporation.  However if 
anyone went there today they would see that it looked like 
Beirut.  It is time to clean it up.  We have to go back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of going back, a comment was made by one of the 
members.  There is a need for co-ordination in this country which 
does not really exist yet.  There are little sparks of it. 
However in 1909 it existed.  Let us go back in history.  In 1909 
there was a body called Canadian conservation council which 
existed for about 12 years.  Then it fell apart because the 
bureaucracy of our nation's capital took exception to it.  It was 
getting too structured and competing against other people's 
hierarchies.  It is time for us to go back to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It exists in Bill C-5, the endangered species legislation. 
There exists in that bill the Canadian endangered species 
conservation council.  It is made up of three ministries, 
fisheries, environment and national parks-heritage, and the 
provincial ministries that are in charge of wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should expand that council to include members of the Senate 
and members of the aboriginal nations.  Then we would embody 
everything in this country and encircle all of this:  on reserve, 
off reserve, provincial, territorial, Senate and both houses.  We 
could create a conservation council that would look at 
sustainable development, economic sustainability, the 
conservation of our economy, the social and human needs, the 
conservation of our population in our young children and their 
future, plus the ecology which is the most important part because 
it is the land.  It is the land that gives us the source of life 
and the source of our riches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we enter the parliamentary restaurant there is a picture of 
a pyramid.  At the top is the capital and credit of this country, 
all the money stacked on top.  At the bottom, which holds it up, 
is the territorial lands of this country.  Unless we rationalize 
and balance all of this it will be off balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at my region.  We have forestry, mining and the hottest 
uranium mines in the world, in fact the most uranium in the 
world, but all our paycheques are flying over our heads.  They 
are going to Prince Albert and Saskatoon.  Our roads in our 
communities are the worst and the most dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our community was a social experiment where they did not want to 
create Uranium City, a mining town.  The policy was to fly in 
their workers from small villages in the north, train them and it 
worked.  However it started to abandon those pick-up points and 
started going to the major centres.  That is where it went wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those fleets of planes that sit empty today could fly our 
workers into the tar sands.  The tar sands need human resources 
and labour.  We are just next door.  We get the ecological 
footprint of the tar sands.  All our weather comes from the west 
and so does the pollution which comes from the tar sands.  It 
affects us ecologically but not economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To try to grab those jobs in Fort McMurray, the town of La Loche 
with 4,000 Dene people used its human resources training money to 
build a road to the border.  The Dene people's own training 
dollars built that road.  Now it did not go through to the tar 
sands because Alberta did not fulfil its agreement to build that 
road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation it is time that we start to plan our resources and 
look at our real resources from the right perspective so that we 
can show our uniqueness if an American comes to our committee 
room and asks what it is. 
Americans are used to centring the world from Texas.  That is the

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK275"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Chairman, 
I am very pleased to be 
here tonight. Since the beginning of the debate, I have found 
the exchanges we have had very productive, because hon. members 
have told Canadians and Quebecers who are listening to us 
tonight that throughout Canada we all have the same problems 
and no one was telling them about this fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity to say so and this is a great 
opportunity to speak of our specificities, which may be very 
widespread throughout Canada, but which have some similarities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned tonight that there were mining problems in British 
Columbia. 
I have learned that Newfoundland is facing other problems and 
that there are mines in Abitibi. We also have mines in my area. 
I have learned all that and I think it will help to open up the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope a lot of people watched this first discussion and 
realized that they are not alone in this, that by sharing and 
talking about their problems, some solutions can be found. That 
is what I found out tonight and I want to thank the hon. member 
for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik for making this exchange of views 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The region I represent is a huge resource area rich in aluminum. 
We are known as the cradle of aluminum. The first aluminum plant 
in Quebec was built in the riding of Jonquière. My father worked 
there and, at that time, 8,000 people worked at the Arvida 
plant. 
Nowadays, there are only 500 employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can see what a difference 50 years can make. Because of 
all the new technology, jobs were cut but the company remained 
competitive at the world level thanks to these new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technological change costs us a lot of jobs in the areas that 
rely on resources. My region relies on hydro, pulp and paper, 
mining, forestry and lumber. Whatever resources Canada has, they 
can be found in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had regional seminars and all sorts of other things in 
the last few years, things that were developed by the Canadian 
government, the Quebec government and by the local 
population. We were allowed to say what we thought had to be 
done to help us take charge and to ensure that our resource 
region which had given a lot could receive something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying before, there were seminars. From there we 
proposed structures to help identify ways to pull ourselves 
through. The provincial government has held out a hand to the 
resource regions and in our area we have pressed them. 
We can do that in our area. We pressed them and we said 
“Now that this has been identified, you will have to help us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its last two budgets, the provincial government gave us money 
and an opportunity to pull ourselves through and to develop 
regional structures with this money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little earlier, the minister said that he was ready to make 
partnerships with the provinces. Even the member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik told us that we should renew some 
specific agreements made while the Conservatives were in office. 
In the days when he was a Conservative member, I was with the 
Bloc Quebecois. Things were working properly then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However what is the government doing now? I am very sad to say this, 
but this government is developing programs that will definitely 
not meet the needs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2320"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT156"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT156"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2320

<A HREF="#LINKT155"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are wall to wall programs, in parallel instead of 
converging with the structures put in place by the province.  I 
do not know whether other provinces in Canada have provincial 
structures that identify regions of a specific nature; I would 
like to have heard someone say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our region, we were told that the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean 
region was going to be aluminum valley.  That entitled us to very 
specific tax credits.  Tax credits were also given for the next 
ten years for the processing plants that would be built in our 
region.  The companies locating in our region would not have to 
pay income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The region was also declared a secondary and tertiary lumber 
processing region, because of our forestry resources.  One of my 
brothers worked as a logger in the days when the resource was 
accessible.  Now the forests are being pushed further and further 
back.  They are far not only from our cities, but also from our 
rural centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on that, we were told “You have taken control of your 
future, so here is some money”.  I am therefore asking this 
evening, having heard all this, why this government would not 
dovetail its programs with those identified by the people in the 
regions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must state that the people of the regions are the ones who 
have identified their present and future development.  They have 
looked back at where they started, and they are saying “This is 
where we are now”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial government has given us the means to do it. We 
know that for mine development, it gave us $264 million in 
support of forest resources development and mining operations in 
the last provincial budget.  I do not know whether members knew, but 
this was what it put on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the Liberal government not do the same thing and give 
the same amount to make it possible to move ahead, as it was put 
earlier?  Someone said “Soon there will be 13 mines closed at 
home, and there is nothing”.  The member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavut 
said that.  He has 
taken steps.  I am not saying they are perfect, but I am saying 
they are taking steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reached the stage of taking steps. 
We have not yet reached the stage of always talking.  We are at 
the stage of taking steps, because we have all reached the same 
place, knowing that action is essential.  A number of Liberals 
and a number of Alliance members said “Action is vital”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening we MPs have taken part in a debate and have 
concluded we must act.  I am waiting to hear from the 
government.  When will it act?  When will it put on the table 
the means to enable resource regions to move ahead using the 
means they have identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These means include resources, money, and it involves honouring 
the niche they have defined for themselves.  This is what I ask 
of the minister responsible for rural matters. 
He says he was prepared to form partnerships.  I would like him 
to tell me something.  If tomorrow morning the government of 
Quebec said “Yes, we agree with an alliance in this area”, would 
it be prepared to sign the agreement and say “Me too.  I put my 
money on the table”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I note that this is what has enabled us to develop the 
debate we have had tonight.  I hope tomorrow we have 
another positive aspect and act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Rural Development) 
(Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario), 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Chairman, I appreciate the 
intervention of the hon. member.  I realize and respect her 
commitment to her riding and what she is trying to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me try to describe the challenge or the problem.  When it 
comes to rural citizens, whether those rural citizens live in 
Quebec or whether they live in Ontario or British Columbia, the 
issue is not one of who should take the predominant role, the 
provincial government or the federal government.  That is not the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly I think she emphasized that too much.  The issue 
is not between the provincial and federal governments.  The issue 
is rural Canadians and rural communities.  They will establish 
the priorities.  They will find the way.  They will recommend the 
structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role for us as a federal government and for the provincial 
governments is not the issue between ourselves, but the issue is 
between how we relate to the communities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say that I want to work with my counterpart in Quebec as 
I do with my counterparts in every province, it is not to work 
between each other.  It is to work together with the communities. 
That is what the priority has to be.  That is the priority of the 
government and that is my commitment as the Secretary of State 
for Rural Development. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Madam Chairman, what the 
secretary of state said about rural development is exactly 
what I said. We did that exercise back home. We did it regarding 
rural communities and regional development. We did that 
exercise. We said “This is what we want to develop”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not sit with these people and tell them “You have 
defined this? We are prepared to help you”. This is what I am 
saying. I agree. However we will not do the exercise all over again. 
It was done in my region. It was done in done in 
all the regions of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of very specific areas were defined. 
Very important resource regions were defined, including the 
Abitibi—Témiscamingue, the Magdalen Islands, the Gaspé Peninsula, 
the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and the North Shore. This was all 
included in the exercise conducted by the grassroots over the 
past four or five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member prepared to sit with these people, the 
grassroots, and hear them tell him “This is what we want and we 
want to have money, we want the same thing that the Quebec 
government is putting on the table”? This is what I am asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done it, and was along the lines that the 
parliamentary secretary mentioned since the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Madam Chairman, I would like to make a comment 
to the secretary of state, and then to ask my colleague from 
Jonquière a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with what he said. This is what the government does in 
its dealings with communities. In the case of the federal 
government in Quebec, there are two structures which affect 
regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there are also ministers with a sectoral involvement, 
but the main tools are the Community Futures Development 
Corporations and Canada Economic Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Economic Development Canada does not have the approach he 
mentioned, an approach based on co-operation, where the community 
takes the decisions. Canada Economic Development Canada produces a 
program thought of and made in Ottawa, Montreal or elsewhere for 
regional development. That is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a difference between the structure in place in Ontario 
and the one in Quebec. FedNor does not operate the same way as 
Canada Economic Development. The later is much more centralized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I hope that the member will pressure his colleague 
responsible for regional development in Quebec and tell him that 
this does not respond exactly to our needs at this time and that 
we need more flexibility and a model which goes in the direction 
you mentioned, a model which comes from the grassroots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not exactly the way Canada Economic Development 
operates. In programming, any project of more than $100,000 has 
to be approved at a senior level. There are practical 
problems with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the secretary of state is acting in good faith, I 
am even sure of it, but I hope that we will see some changes in 
this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a short comment for the member for Jonquière, whom I 
congratulate on her speech. There is something I forgot to 
mention earlier, and I would like to know what she thinks about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often, there are difficulties in the regions.  For instance, the 
Department of Natural Resources or other departments, such as 
Agriculture Canada, are fairly large.  Often we would like 
to have a few more researchers or those people described as 
public servants.  We would like them to be a little more present 
in the regions, or for there to be more partnership, often with 
our teaching institutions.  We would like these people to work 
in our communities.  This would enhance co-operation between the 
community and the departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether this feeling exists in her region.  In my 
region, we would like more employees of these large departments 
to be based in the region, to live and breathe a little more of 
regional reality, rather than always having to wander all over 
the place to convince people of their efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to have more public servants based in the region, 
while reporting to the administrative structures, but a little 
more in touch with what is going on in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few agreements, but we would like to see them 
extended.  We find it a bit frustrating to be one of the major 
producers in the mining sector and not to have more people from 
the Department of Natural Resources assigned to our region, for 
example, or based in our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik will agree 
with me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Madam Chairman, in my region, we have 
the exact same problem. We are under the responsibility of 
people in Quebec City or in Montreal. We do not have our own 
officials in our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to Canada Economic Development. When I submit 
applications from my region to Canada Economic Development, I 
cannot have a say with regard to these applications. If I want 
to have a say with regard to an application given to me by one 
of my constituents, I am told that it will hurt the applicant. 
Decisions are made in Quebec City, Montreal or Ottawa. I find 
that extremely hard to take for people in my region and for 
those whom they elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CFDCs give repayable loans. 
They give grants to non-profit organizations, but not to 
businesses that want to develop new niches. They only give 
repayable loans. I think it is a very serious problem. These 
people often need substantial capital to develop an expertise 
and to start up a business that will enable us to progress. I 
find that deplorable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Madam Chairman, since 
it is getting late, I have decided to speak about some 
interesting things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have, for instance, decided to speak of my riding.  I will not 
give a geographical description, as my colleague has done, 
but I do issue a warm invitation to visit a region that is in 
the forefront of the mining sector.  After Baie-Comeau, you would 
see Franquelin, Port-Cartier and Sept-Îles.  The scenery is 
outstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the mining critic for the Bloc Quebecois, I have taken a lot 
of notes.  I do not want to forget anything about my riding this 
evening.  It is not very often that there is an opportunity to 
talk about the mines in my region.  I would like the people in 
my riding to know that I have praised it, that I have spoken of 
them and that I have placed this sector in the limelight, a sector 
that is very beautiful, but is also in need of government 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the spokesperson for a mining region. Its mining production 
ranks the North Shore as foremost in all mining regions in 
Quebec and in Canada.  I am delighted to be able to say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyday we make use of a lot of products that are essential to 
our every day lives, construction materials, household 
appliances, cars, coins, televisions, computers.  All these 
products are directly or indirectly connected to the mining 
sector in which we are involved and the top producer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A significant amount of the metals used to produce these 
products come from the mineral deposits of the beautiful North 
Shore region of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mining output of the North Shore region is essentially 
focused around iron ore.  I do not know if members have heard of 
ilmenite, but it is very important. 
This is a very rare ore that is found in Havre-Saint-Pierre and 
even in Natashquan, the land of Gilles Vigneault. This ore has 
been found through prospecting programs. Presently, those 
programs are funded only by the Quebec government. This is 
shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas some boast that Quebec has a national government, we 
have to look at the regional level for development. All the 
mineral deposits in Quebec have been prospected and found thanks 
to money from the Quebec government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2335"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT159"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT159"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2335

<A HREF="#LINKT158"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very important because in our region, on the North 
Shore, we do not have any arable land. The weather there is not 
suited to agriculture or ranching. Our land is fertile for 
industrialization. We are rich thanks to the sea, forests and 
mines. We do not complain, we are happy. We are very happy that 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the prospectors and the mining companies first determine 
what they are looking for. They do research and ask themselves 
what exactly they are looking for: precious metals, gold, 
silver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could tell hon. members that, very recently, a diamond, 
nickel, zinc and copper mine was found north of Schefferville. 
The ore concentration, in terms of percentage, is very 
promising. 
We also have asbestos and graphite.  We support the discovery of 
these substances.  The community is very aggressive in its help 
to prospectors, because the development of our region is 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many matters involved and the stakes are high.  The 
development of Quebec and its regions is a long way from 
revealing a huge success.  A lot remains to be done. In my 
riding alone, the Mazeret company, I am pleased to report, will 
operate a mine that will create some one hundred jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fonds régional d'exploration minière de la Côte-Nord hopes to 
interest one of the mining companies in getting involved in a 
site we call La Blache.  It is the Bloc Julie, commonly known 
as Block 30.  It is located 145 kilometres north of Baie 
Comeau.  People found a very large ore indicator there. 
They also reopened the pellet plant with this money, without 
government intervention, by the way. In the past five years, in 
Sept-Îles, $1.5 billion dollars has been invested, and they are 
investing nearly $70 million in a power plant to be called SM-2. 
For those who have heard of SM-3,it is about 150 kilometres 
north, and the SM-2 is on highway 20.  A dam already exists there 
and it will be used to produce about 20 kilowatt/hours of 
electricity, which we want to increase to 60.  To do so will 
involve an investment of $70 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At 7.30 p.m., the environmental public hearings office was 
holding hearings on this.  I am delighted and I hope everything 
went well, since this development is vital to the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mining industry is a major contributor to the Quebec 
economy. Not only are many areas directly dependent on this 
industry, but the large urban centres are also taking advantage 
of its important economic spinoffs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if people know it, but ore shipments are worth 
about 3.5 billion dollars a year in economic spinoffs for Quebec 
alone, while the number of jobs created is estimated at 17,137 
person years. This is really is something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good number of head offices are located in Montreal and in 
Quebec City, including the IOC Mining Company, Québec-Cartier 
Mining—the only mining company from Quebec—and QIT-Fer et Titane 
Inc., in Havre Saint-Pierre. These companies all employ many 
people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mining industry has also been badly affected in the last 
years. It has gone through very hard times. The years 2001 and 
2002 will be very difficult for the mining industry. I think 
that my friend Guy Saint-Julien knows it very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, we need government support,  particularly from 
the central government. The federal government thinks it can do 
everything and help everybody and it claims that we are so lucky 
to be part of that government, that we are very lucky because 
otherwise we would be in peril and lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People therefore really rely on the federal government to help 
those companies. We sometimes hear that bankers are happy to 
lend us money on sunny days. They are happy to lend an 
umbrella when the sun is out. 
It is because when they lend money, they give an umbrella, but 
as soon as it rains, they take it away. With respect to the 
mining industry on the North Shore, in my friend's area, we are 
having some rough weather. We are living through hard times. We 
need action and assistance from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was told that my colleague, the hon. member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, made some promises during the election 
campaign. Some have talked about $300 million or $400 million, but I 
would be satisfied with $300 million, as long as I get $100 
million for my region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government needs to do is to provide a budget to help 
mining exploration and mining companies. 
Unfortunately, I do not have time to give the Bloc position and 
what it is proposing, because my time is up. However I will 
have the opportunity to bring forward a motion in the next few 
days to present the Bloc position, that is, what the Bloc 
Quebecois wants specifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Madam Chairman, I have a question for the 
member for Manicouagan, which is also a large riding. We are 
neighbours, since our ridings are adjoining. Together, we cover 
about, and Quebec is 1,600,000 square kilometres, 1,100,000 square 
kilometres. I have 800,000 square kilometres and he has some 
300,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did talk about the agency. What is important to us, as we 
said during the election campaign, is what we should have in the 
resource regions. We know that the mining sector is currently 
suffering and forestry is also beginning to suffer. A little over 
a week ago, I travelled to Shefferville with the Secretary of 
State responsible for the Economic Development Agency of Canada 
for the Regions of Quebec, the hon. member for Outremont, and we 
discussed economic development. As members know, things are not 
easy in resource regions, given the price of metals and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are trying to find ways to get specific, short 
term programs, not virtual programs on the Internet and so on, 
but programs for rural communities. I appreciate the fact that 
the minister spent the evening with us, because we truly value 
his excellent remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must find new ways to co-operate with the 
Quebec government and with the governments of all the other 
provinces. We can take action. A few years ago, we had agreements 
that produced results. Now we do not have anything. We are proud 
of Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa and Toronto, because they have 
major multimedia projects on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud. Jobs are being created and we are glad about that. 
Finally, we should never forget that, whether it is in Lac 
Saint-Jean, on the North Shore, in Manicouagan or the Gaspé area, 
jobs are being created. Whether it is in Abitibi or in Montreal, 
close to 7,000 jobs are created thanks to the mining and forestry 
industries. The same thing goes for Quebec City.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member might want to comment on that. We need short 
term concrete measures to preserve these jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier:</B> Madam Chairman, to answer my 
colleague's question, tomorrow at 2.00 p.m., I will be in 
Schefferville to open a multipurpose sports centre.  I am told 
that there is a swimming pool and an arena.  The folks in 
Schefferville have hope.  The mine has been closed and others 
have been discovered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diamonds have been discovered.  Once diamonds have been 
discovered, a monopoly whose name I will not mention, but he 
knows who it is, bought it so as not to have any competition. 
The government of Quebec invested $4.5 million.  That is why I am 
asking the federal government to match that amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am an optimist by nature and I am confident, because there is 
great potential in northern Quebec, north of Schefferville. What 
the Bloc Quebecois is going to propose is a long term cut in the 
effective tax rate for mining companies, and I think that he will 
agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see what form it will take.  In order to increase 
investment in the mining industry, it is essential that the tax 
rate be cut.  According to my poll of both opposition and 
government members, people would be in favour of a tax cut right 
now for at least the next five years for investing in the mining 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People know that running a mine, especially 
with the cost of gas, the cost of energy and equipment, 
particularly in remote areas, is very expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be a reduction in the effective tax rate for mining 
companies.  The Bloc Quebecois is going to work very hard on 
this.  With my colleague, we will be introducing a bill to this 
effect.  I hope we will have the support of the member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Madam Chairman, I had to look at the 
map to see where my hon. colleague was from.  However his 
colleague beside him is from Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1970s there was a project known as the mid-Canada 
development corridor.  It connected Newfoundland and Labrador, 
through Saint Augustin, one of the areas in Quebec, and all 
through that area of Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba.  The plan was 
shelved.  It was a major undertaking in the 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the provinces and the federal government could come to 
an agreement on a plan similar to that one.  All the provinces 
would be engaged.  They could look at the undeveloped area of the 
north.  They could also look at the new sustainable practices we 
have today that were non-existent in the 1970s.  If it was not 
feasible in the 1970s, perhaps it is feasible now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should be engaged to work with all the 
provincial governments.  They should be working together to 
develop the undeveloped area of the northern regions where the 
resources are vast.  We have to do it in a timely fashion and it 
has to be done appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I am hearing from the Bloc.  It is an opportunity 
for us to engage in a common goal so that Canada could be proud 
that it had achieved something.  Each province could be proud 
because it would take ownership of its regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first step in this development is research and development 
units in the north.  Their development will take timely and 
appropriate measures.  Would the member care to comment on that?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier:</B> Madam Chairman, let me reassure my 
colleague. At my age, and being born in Quebec, I do not need a 
map to go anywhere in Canada. I know all regions. I am just back 
from Vancouver, and I was in the west recently. I spent our 15 
day recess in Victoria. I do not need a map to visit the hon. 
member's riding. I hope he does not need one to come and visit 
mine, because we should all know our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My country is Quebec, of course. I have always said that we 
have really two countries here, Canada and Quebec. Canada is our 
neighbour. 
When I was in Victoria, I said I was in Canada and people found 
that funny. I like Canada Vancouver and my neighbours. I also 
like my colleague's speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He seems to worry. He is showing us a map as if we did not 
know Canada. We know it very well. We know where we are going, 
and we know from where we are come. Let me reassure him. We 
are working very hard on mining development in the west, in 
Canada and in Quebec. We should look for deposits where they 
are. Hon. members can understand that, since I have been 
elected by my constituents, I work first for my riding, but also 
for the people of Quebec and Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Chairman, it is a pleasure to participate in this take note 
debate in committee of the whole on the state of Canada's 
resource industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the second largest country in the world in area and it 
is very rich in natural resources, which are an important source 
to a brighter future for our country.  However, the government 
lacks vision and strategic planning in developing, exploring and 
utilizing these resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that the government also lacks a balanced approach 
between resource development and environmental concerns.  I will 
give a few examples to make my point, particularly in the mining 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an opportunity to visit a few mining industries. I have 
about 40 mining related industries that produce something for the 
mining industries in my constituency of Surrey Central.  After 
talking with various individuals and businessmen in the mining 
industry, I learned that they consider it to be a tragedy the way 
the mining industry has been treated by the various governments, 
both federal and provincial.  They are also upset with the 
regulations.  They feel that the regulations are bureaucratic red 
tape in order to discourage them.  Similarly, they say that the 
federal-provincial jurisdictions in some areas overlap and that 
in other areas they are not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mining industries spend a lot of time exploring and setting 
their infrastructure.  They also use a lot of energy in terms of 
their management input and taxation becomes another factor that 
is driving them south.  As an example, we have a $12 billion 
dollar investment in Chile which is three times more than our 
investment in Japan.  We have invested $42 billion alone in the 
Americas outside of the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware of the softwood lumber crisis in the forestry 
industry.  The people involved in that industry are very 
discouraged with the recent skirmish that has been going on. Free 
trade seems to be only one way but, when it comes to our natural 
resources, free trade has let Canadians down because of the poor 
planning, poor negotiating skills or mismanagement by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that anti-dumping and countervailing have not been 
handled right for many years.  This new investigation by the 
U.S.A. in this area will probably worsen the relationship between 
the two countries on the trade front in forestry and especially 
in softwood lumber and in remanufacturing demanufactured 
products.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visited a factory in my riding which utilizes waste products 
in the forest industry.  That industry is also suffering because 
of poor negotiating that took place in the past.  The federal 
government's policy on water exports is not clear.  It does not 
seem to have a vision on how to handle the resource.  It also has 
no clear policy regarding the production, export and pricing of 
electricity.  We do not know where the government stands on such 
issues as air, flora and fauna, and endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the speech of the secretary of state.  I understand the 
challenges the government faces in terms of geography, density, 
remote areas and communities that depend on the mining industry 
and infrastructure development.  We lack infrastructure 
development in Canada as far as natural resource rich rural 
communities are concerned.  In addition, we know the market size 
is small.  Regulatory and communication policies are stretched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Natural resources contribute about 15% of our GDP.  In 1996 the 
government mentioned in its throne speech the need for 
sustainable development of our natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my time is up, can I have unanimous consent to increase my 
time by 15 minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B>  No, you cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  I will wind up, then.  I wanted to 
talk about how parliament was not consulted when we signed the 
treaties at the Kyoto, Beijing and Rio conferences.  I will 
therefore say that the government needs to focus more on the 
state of natural resources in Canada and to come up with a clear 
vision on how to handle these things effectively in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not touch on energy, electricity and nuclear power. 
Perhaps another time I can talk about that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Madam Chairman, I had a 20 
minute speech on the history of resource development in Yukon. I 
will get it in during another debate because you are very good at 
letting things in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the minister for being here until midnight.  All rural 
members of parliament, as well as all rural Canadians, should 
support his initiatives and programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before coming to the Chamber I was in the parliamentary 
restaurant to lobby members to support these initiatives.  Rural 
members have a very good reason to support them.  We are 
outnumbered.  We are outnumbered in parliament and yet we inhabit 
the vast majority of the land.  We must therefore stand and fight 
to show that we are different, that we have special needs in the 
north, that we are an important part of Canada and that we need 
those resources.  That is why I commend the minister for the 
wonderful programs and hope all rural members will support him in 
his efforts and will fight for rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Madam Chairman, in closing the debate 
I take the opportunity to thank all members for participating. We 
had a reasonable number of members here this evening who 
discussed topics of importance to rural Canada and rural 
Canadians.  I thank all of them for their efforts and their 
energy.  I look forward to working with them over the weeks, 
months and years ahead to achieve positive results for rural 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank you, Madam Chairman, the table officers, the pages and 
everyone who has been here until midnight to make sure we could 
have this debate.  The process of going into the committee of the 
whole has proven a very good exercise and I think it is something 
we should try at other times as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B>  It being midnight, 
pursuant to the order made Monday, April 23, 2001, the committee 
will rise and I will leave the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24 
(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 12 a.m.)
