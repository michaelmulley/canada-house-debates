	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to see you in the Chair, because you were 
present yesterday.
<P>
	I would like a clarification regarding what happened during 
debate on the Reform Party's amendment to the amendment with 
respect to Bill C-42. As you will recall, it was during the period for 
questions and comments and I still had time remaining when the 
government whip presented a motion to extend the sitting, pursuant 
to Standing Order 26.
<P>
	You entertained the motion, Mr. Speaker, and a number of things 
then happened. One was that you deemed that a motion to adjourn 
the House had been moved pursuant to Standing Order 38.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	You then asked if the House was ready for the question, on what 
it was not clear. There were cries of ``question'' from both sides 
and you set the vote in motion. You will recall that I hurried over to 
the Table and, at the first opportunity available to me, raised a point 
of order.
<P>
	My point of order concerned the fact that the government whip's 
motion to extend the sitting was out of order. I will read the last 
paragraph only of the Speaker's ruling on this motion, in the hope 
that this will enlighten the Chair.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In view of the fact that the matter was a procedural motion and that it was 
proposed at a time contrary to the Standing Orders, the Chair is of the view that the 
motion is indeed out of order and has not been adopted.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My question today is whether, if we step back and you have 
immediately declared the government's motion out of order, I 
would still be in the period for questions and comments. Or 
whether, given my brilliant answers, for no one else had any 
questions to ask me, you would have called for debate to resume 
and not gone on to the vote.
<P>
	I therefore think that everything that occurred between the time 
the government whip's motion was ruled out of order and the time 
that the Chair confirmed the motion out of order was illegal. 
Accordingly, the vote on the Reform Party's amendment to the 
amendment concerning Bill C-42 is illegal and should never have 
been held.
<P>
	I would like you, Mr. Speaker, to shed some light on this, for I 
believe that the custom of the House would have dictated that, 
following the government motion, you should have said very 
clearly-and this should have been recorded in <I>Hansard</I>, which it 
was not-``questions and comments'' or ``resuming debate''. You 
did not do so, probably through omission, or because government 
members were speaking very loudly and were in a hurry to vote in 
order to gag us.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask you to rule on this question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm. This is a very interesting point. I have reread 
yesterday's <I>Hansard</I>. On page 6813, I said: ``Is the House ready for 
the question?'', but the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm, with 
all of his legal background, did not take that opportunity to speak.
<P>
	I find this a very interesting point, but since we are both lawyers, 
the hon. member ought to be prepared to admit that that was when 
he ought to have spoken up.
<P>
	The Speaker cannot be changed in mid-stream, but in this case, I 
believe there is nothing more to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am not a lawyer, but that does not prevent me from 
understanding.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> I even think these things are easier to understand 
when one is not a lawyer. When you asked the House if it was ready 
for the question, the great  majority of people-and yourself, I am 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6831"> 6831 </A></B>
<P>
sure-understood that it was on the motion of the Government 
Whip, which was later deemed out of order.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Normally a debate ends with a motion. That was what the House 
answered yea or nay on, not the amendment to the amendment. You 
ought to have asked: ``Are there any questions or comments?'' If 
no one rises, then you ask if the House is ready to vote on the 
amendment to the amendment, and not on the motion of the 
Government Whip.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> On the good advice of my counsel, dear 
colleagues, this is what I asked:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is the House ready for the question?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker: </B>The question is on the amendment to the 
amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment 
to the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>Agreed.
<P>
	Again, I suggest that that would have been the time for the hon. 
member beside you to speak. Since he did not, I believe that, 
unfortunately, the matter is closed.

	The House resumed from November 27 consideration of the 
motion in relation to the amendments made by the Senate to Bill 
C-42, an act to amend the Judges Act and to make consequential 
amendments to another act; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C-42, an act to 
amend the Judges Act.
<P>
	Fundamentally, the Canadian judiciary must remain independent 
and free of bias or coercion from outside sources, in particular 
those which stem from special interest groups or, in fact, 
Parliament.
<P>
	This bill concerns Madam Justice Louise Arbour. She was 
appointed to be the chief prosecutor in The Hague for the UN war 
crimes tribunal. At the outset I would like to say that is not only an 
honour for her but it is an honour for all Canadians. She will take 
the place of Chief Justice Richard Goldstone of South Africa, a 
highly distinguished individual. Her appointment to this position 
demonstrates the confidence which the international community 
has in Canada and its judiciary. We are looked on as being a nation 
which, by and large, maintains a great deal of independence, for 
which we are highly respected by the international community. It is 
a degree of respect which is completely out of proportion to our 
size and our economy. A lot of Canadians do not realize the respect 
which the international community has for our nation. The 
appointment of Judge Arbour certainly demonstrates that respect.
<P>
	The amendment to Bill C-42 is a good one. I must commend the 
Senate for bringing it to the attention of the House. Bill C-42 
ensures that there will not be a cozy relationship between our 
judges and outside influence. Without this amendment judges, 
technically, could be open to influence, not only within Canada but 
also outside our borders.
<P>
	The appropriate middle ground would be for Canadian judges to 
step down temporarily to take up very important appointments, 
such as the one we are discussing today. Judge Arbour is perhaps 
the most prominent of all the Canadian judges who have been 
appointed to a position in the recent past.
<P>
	The role which the Canadian judiciary plays in enabling 
democratic and judicial institutions to build up in other countries is 
important. It is particularly important in the democratic and 
judicial restructuring of countries which have been wracked by 
war. Many of these countries do not have a proper judicial process 
in place. Many of them have had their judicial process destroyed.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	Canada has a very good judicial system. It is something that 
could be exported to other countries. In that way those countries 
could be taught how to plan a judiciary that is free of bias, free of 
influence and independent of the wiles and influences, powers and 
purses of other groups in the community. It is a basic tenet of living 
in a free and democratic institution, one with which everyone in the 
House agrees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6833"> 6833 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill contains a number of important considerations and 
concerns that Canadians have made with respect to the judiciary. 
One of those is the appointment process. The number one criterion 
in becoming a judge ought to be merit and experience. At present, 
though, judges are appointed on the basis of not necessarily what 
they know but who they know.
<P>
	We have many good judges in our system. They are superb, 
intelligent, bright, meticulous and articulate individuals who do 
great honour to our system. We in the Reform and the Canadian 
public have a problem with the appointment of those rare 
individuals who come into the system, not on the basis of their 
skill, not on the basis of their merit but because they are a friend of 
the government of the day. That has to be addressed. If the 
government were to take that on, it would add increased credibility 
to our judicial system.
<P>
	Recently the courts moved from interpreting the law to making 
laws. In fact they have shot down laws that this House has passed. 
It stems from the 1982 charter of rights and freedoms. The charter 
has given increasing powers to the judicial system, in particular the 
supreme court, to actually make laws.
<P>
	Members of the public, when talking to me about this, find it 
quite perturbing, as many in the House do, that the supreme court, a 
group of appointed, not elected, individuals actually have the 
power to supplant laws that have been passed by the House. The 
public does not understand that and find it extremely grievous.
<P>
	A better idea would be to rein in the supreme court, to make sure 
that its role is to interpret law, not to make law. I am not a lawyer 
but it would be very good if the government studied ways to 
revamp the judicial system to ensure that the supreme court goes 
back to interpreting law and not making law.
<P>
	Another aspect I will touch on briefly is that Bill C-42, to which 
this amendment applies, deals with some extremely generous 
pension benefits for judges. That needs to be dealt with further, I 
am quite sure in the future.
<P>
	Reform also finds quite grievous the way the bill is being 
finessed through the House. It belies an increasingly perceived 
cosy relationship between the Minister of Justice and the judiciary. 
These kind of relationships have to be severed. The judicial system, 
our courts and our judges have to be separate in their decision 
making process from this House and the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	As a former correctional officer I would like to say one thing 
about Judge Arbour. She is most known for her scathing indictment 
of what went on at Kingston in the women's penitentiary and the 
riot that took place. I have never been on record in saying this but I 
would like to take the opportunity to do so.
<P>
	I found, as a former correctional officer, it to be completely, 
grossly unfair and a scathing indictment of the correctional 
services. During a riot-I have seen this happen-in a penitentiary 
when dealing with inmates, who often do not deal in the ways we 
deal with each other in public, can become a very dangerous 
situation. Inmates can be carrying hidden weapons. It is very 
reasonable to ensure that those individuals are stripped searched. In 
a riot situation it is important to go in with overwhelming force. It 
is important for the safety of the correctional officers. It is also 
important for the inmates. Going in with less than overwhelming 
force actually poses a greater threat to the inmates and to the 
correctional officers.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I was greatly disappointed by the unfair and negative treatment 
our correctional services received. It became an issue of political 
correctness and trial by media. It was not an issue of fact and what 
is reasonable in those very difficult and trying circumstances. Most 
members of the public would not understand this because 
thankfully most people have not been in jail.
<P>
	I would like to touch on an important aspect of Judge Arbour's 
current responsibilities, one on which Canada can take a leadership 
role. It has to do with the war crimes tribunals that are taking place 
in the Hague.
<P>
	I had an opportunity to meet briefly with Judge Richard 
Goldstone a few months ago. He was visiting Canada to ensure that 
the war crimes tribunal continued. As we speak, it is in a state of 
flux and could potentially fall apart. This would do grievous harm 
to the principles of international law to which most civilians and 
politicians in the world adhere.
<P>
	Most nations of the world follow certain rules and regulations in 
an effort to ensure that those who are least powerful, mostly 
civilians, are governed by some basic tenets of law that protect 
them, their property and their families.
<P>
	The war crimes tribunal unfortunately came into existence 
because of the absolute disgusting turn of events most recently in 
Bosnia, Rwanda and Burundi. It also stems from previous war 
crimes tribunals such as the Nuremberg trials and from previous 
international agreements on international law over the governance 
of war.
<P>
	If we are not going to support the war crimes tribunal and ensure 
that it continues, all the international laws that exist from the 
Nuremberg trials to what we have today will be for nothing. If we 
allow this organization to fall apart, which it is in the processing of 
doing, then it will send a message to those who would commit 
heinous, atrocious, appalling crimes that they are free to do what 
they want because no one in the world is going to bring them to 
justice. They will be left to continue committing these terrible 
crimes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6834"> 6834 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, I implore the government to back Judge Arbour and 
her colleagues and use its influence to get other countries to also 
back the war crimes tribunal taking place in the Hague. The 
government should also try to ensure that it becomes more 
effective. They are finding it impossible to work under certain 
circumstances. There is a lack of funding and manpower which 
makes it almost impossible for them to bring war criminals to 
trial. There are also other numerous bureaucratic entanglements 
which prevent them from doing their jobs.
<P>
	It is going to require an increasing amount of international 
co-operation. We have an ideal opportunity, having a Canadian as 
the chief prosecutor, to pursue a course that is going to streamline 
and increase the effectiveness of the war crimes tribunals. Having a 
Canadian there will carry forward our skills as a nation and a leader 
in diplomatic endeavours to the Hague and to the war crimes 
tribunals.
<P>
	We also have an enormous role to play in the world. The 
situation in Zaire and central Africa must be looked at for what it 
is. This is an impartial, apolitical issue as a half a million to a 
million people's lives are on the line. Some things have to be done 
at the outset. We have to get the agreement of the Zairean 
government to ensure that reconnaissance takes place in eastern 
Zaire to determine exactly what is going on. Humanitarian groups 
that are poised to go in and provide assistance to these people 
cannot go in because it is an extraordinarily dangerous situation.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	I am not advocating for a moment sending in a huge mass of 
troops armed to the teeth to stop a war. That simply is not going to 
happen. We have to prioritize what we have to do. The first priority 
must be to ensure the safety of those half million odd civilians who 
are fleeing from the fighting. Many are being killed by Tutsi rebels 
who want to kill off male Hutus.
<P>
	A possible solution would be to send a multinational force. 
Canada can provide the logistics, troops from the Organization of 
African Unity and the EU, independent of Belgian and French 
troops, could go into the area and ensure that safe corridors are 
available for the civilians to go back to be repatriated into Rwanda.
<P>
	Second, humanitarian groups that are already on the ground with 
medicines and food must be allowed to safely go into eastern Zaire 
to provide these basic necessities to these people. What is faced 
now and in the coming days is an epidemic in these populations of 
malnutrition and starvation and also an epidemic of diseases such 
as typhoid fever and cholera that is going to kill thousands on 
thousands of people.
<P>
	This, though, cannot be the end of it. We have seen a cycle 
develop in central African over years and years of killing and some 
repatriation and further killings taking place. The cycle of killing 
and death has to stop.
<P>
	The international community cannot keep pouring money into 
central Africa without an end point. As politically incorrect as this 
is to say, perhaps we should take a very close look at working with 
the three governments in the area to redraw some of the tribal lines 
to ensure that Hutus and Tutsis live in their pre-colonial tribal 
areas. Maybe this is a solution that would enable the warring 
factions to stay away from each other.
<P>
	There has to be a demilitarization of the extremists on both sides. 
It is extremists in the Hutus and the Tutsis that are taking a 
significant role in trying to continue the fighting in their areas. 
They are not only killing members from the opposing tribe, they 
are also killing moderates within their own tribes. What is left is a 
very fearful group of civilians powerless to change the course of 
events because they are ruled by extremist militias who are doing 
things only for the benefit of themselves and a very narrow group 
of political elites within their own separate countries.
<P>
	We have also an opportunity in Zaire, a country that is one of the 
poorest in the world, as Mobutu Sese Seko recovers from prostate 
cancer in France, to try to convince him that now is the time for us 
to work with the IMF and the World Bank to build up the 
democratic and economic structures within Zaire which are 
required for long term peace. Not only does this have to happen 
within Zaire but it also has to occur in Rwanda and Burundi.
<P>
	Without the restructuring that has to take place in these three 
countries, peace will not occur. All we will be doing by pouring 
money into the situation today is for the cycle of violence and 
starvation repeat itself at some time in the future.
<P>
	We persistently pursue short term goals. I implore the 
government to work with the international community to convince 
them that we should pursue not only a short term solution to save 
the civilian populations within eastern Zaire and Rwanda but also 
pursue a longer term solution for economic, judicial and 
democratic restructuring that has to take place in these three areas.
<P>
	It will require a stronger arm and more active influence. This is 
where the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can 
come into play. Initiatives from them within the country in terms of 
peace building between groups that were fighting each other, in 
terms of blocking off arms, redressing the poverty situation 
perhaps through microloans, systems along those of the Grameen 
Bank, will all help to ensure long term peace within the area. These 
initiatives are absolutely essential for peace to occur.

	As a country we do not consider our power in the international 
community to bring groups, nations and organizations together. 
Louise Arbour's being the head of the war crimes tribunal is but 
one example of our reputation as a nation. It is also an example of 
how we can be involved in international organizations to revamp 
them so they will truly address the problems that will affect us all 
in the 21st century but which very few governments and people are 
willing to address.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Esquimalt-Juan de 
Fuca observed in his reference to the Supreme Court of Canada that 
our judicial system now has more powers, now makes laws. He 
seemed to blame the charter of rights and freedoms and he claimed 
the public does not know about this. I submit that those 
observations are wrong.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada never makes laws. We know that 
and we have a duty to tell the citizens of the country that the 
supreme court does not make laws. The members of the Reform 
Party are laughing at this. They seem not to appreciate that the 
charter of rights and freedoms is a fundamental part of the 
Canadian Constitution, the supreme law of the land.
<P>
	When the Supreme Court of Canada interprets the laws passed 
by parliaments or any other legislative body in the country, the 
Supreme Court of Canada has a duty and obligation to have the 
laws tested in light of the charter of rights and freedoms, the 
supreme law of the land. In this respect the court does not make 
new laws; it only interprets them to ensure that laws passed by 
Parliament do not contravene the fundamental law of the land.
<P>
	The Canadian judicial system has received international acclaim 
and distinction for its independence, integrity, talent and creativity. 
It is creativity we see when the Supreme Court of Canada makes 
the ultimate interpretation when there is a potential conflict 
between laws passed by Parliament and the charter of rights and 
freedoms. When an interpretation is made and we happen to 
disagree with it, let us not conclude that the court has made laws. 
We have to re-examine ourselves as lawmakers to ensure the laws 
we pass can withstand the test of the supreme law of the land.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad the hon. member agrees with me in saying that the supreme 
court should only interpret laws rather than make them.
<P>
	I have a lot of respect for my hon. friend. I strongly urge him to 
speak to the police officers and representatives of the police forces 
and to speak to the prosecution lawyers who find the charter of 
rights and freedoms hamstrings them dramatically.
<P>
	I also suggest to the hon. member that the charter is actually 
discriminatory. In its tenets the charter specifically says that it is 
acceptable to discriminate against a group of people who have 
previously been deemed to have had some advantages. That is not 
free. That is not equal. That is not ensuring equal rights for 
everybody. That is damaging the rights of people and is 
discriminatory by its very nature.
<P>
	We had the bill of rights before this charter. The bill of rights 
worked very well. The police were happy with it, the courts were 
happy with it and the people were happy with it. Unfortunately in 
1982 the Liberal government of the day decided to bring in the 
charter of rights and freedoms which has turned our judicial 
process on its head. It has hamstrung the courts and the police 
officers in the trenches who try their very hardest under 
extraordinary circumstances to keep our streets safe.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	If the hon. member wanted to do the honourable thing, which I 
am sure he does, he would suggest to his party that we pursue the 
idea of going back to the bill of rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting that this debate is a result of amendments proposed by 
the Senate, particularly in light of what happened in the Senate 
yesterday when it turned back term 17 to do with the 
Newfoundland school system.
<P>
	This was a process undertaken by the people of Newfoundland in 
a truly democratic way, probably the most fundamental democratic 
process that could be arrived at, a referendum. As a person from 
outside the province of Newfoundland I would not offer any 
opinion as to the judgment of the people of Newfoundland. The 
people of Newfoundland in a true, fair, clear democratic process 
had an opportunity to speak and they did.
<P>
	The result of the referendum then went to the Newfoundland 
assembly, those who were elected by the people of Newfoundland 
in a free, fair, democratic process. My understanding is that that 
House voted unanimously in favour of the motion. Then it came to 
this Parliament and this Parliament in a free vote substantiated the 
results of the referendum.
<P>
	On Bill C-42, the Senate is now deciding in the same way that it 
did on term 17, to throw the bill back to this House. I think this 
indicates that within Canada's parliamentary process we truly must 
have absolute reform and come to a triple E Senate.
<P>
	We know that the Senate is effective because it has managed to 
turn back term 17. We know that the Senate is effective in that it 
has managed to turn back Bill C-42, which is currently being 
debated in the House. We know the Senate is effective but the fact 
that it is not elected, is unaccountable and unrepresentative of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6836"> 6836 </A></B>
<P>
anyone in this country other than the political masters who put the  
senators there in the first place says reams about the Senate itself.
<P>
	The Reform Party position always has been and will continue to 
be that while we require a House of sober second thought such as 
the Senate, it is absolutely essential that the House of sober second 
thought gain some credibility by going through a process of being 
elected and accountable.
<P>
	Specifically on issue of Bill C-42, the main motion being 
debated is an amendment to Bill C-42 introduced by the 
government in the Senate. That is rather interesting in itself. Bill 
C-42 went from this place to the Senate. Then in the place of 
supposed sober second thought some flaws in Bill C-42 were 
discovered. We have reason to believe that the government of the 
day decided to use this method of making the renovations to Bill 
C-42, rather than by directly taking them into account in this 
House.
<P>
	This House must be the place where legislation is made. It must 
be the place where legislation is voted on because this is the place 
where members are elected and are ultimately accountable to the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	The current Judges Act does not allow any judge to accept any 
employment other than from the Government of Canada. The 
Judges Act at the moment does not allow judges to receive 
compensation from anyone other than the Government of Canada.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has passed orders in council approving 
Madam Justice Louise Arbour to work in the UN commencing last 
July 1. This is part of a pattern, and if I may suggest a rather 
arrogant pattern, that seems to have infested both the Liberals and 
the Conservatives. Because they have been the governing parties of 
Canada since Confederation, they go ahead and do these things 
without reference to this elected Chamber.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	There is this order in council which permitted Madam Justice 
Arbour to work at the UN commencing July 1. The interesting 
thing, which shows the arrogance of the Liberals and of the justice 
minister, is that these orders in council are in direct violation of 
section 55 of the Judges Act. But the government said to itself: 
``That is no problem. We will use the rubber stamp of the House of 
Commons and simply get that turned around''.
<P>
	Why closure yet again? Many members during the last 
Parliament railed against the number of times closure was used by 
the Conservatives. Members stood in their places and made all 
sorts of noises about how unjust, unfair and immoral closure was. 
Now we see how the government has changed. It now brings in 
closure at will.
<P>
	Why do we have closure today? Because if this bill is not passed 
today the justice minister will have to issue a new order in council 
because the present one will expire on November 30. The justice 
minister maintains that the order in council is valid because 
Madam Justice Arbour is still being paid by the Government of 
Canada. He has ignored the prohibition on accepting other 
employment which is laid out in the Judges Act.
<P>
	Many lawyers make their money on fine print. It is a rather 
interesting part of the whole justice process. Indeed, the niggling 
details will end up shooting down a plaintiff or a defendant in a 
civil suit. Lawyers make their money by worrying about the 
niggling details.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, I am given to believe that even in a criminal 
case which is currently before the Supreme Court-the Latimer 
case-they are talking about the details. There has been a 
conviction in that case and now Mr. Latimer's lawyer is saying: 
``But we did not take care of the details. Therefore, we are going to 
take it to the supreme court''.
<P>
	What did the justice minister say in the House on November 22 
in answer to a question from my colleague from St. Albert who 
raised the issue of Bill C-42? It is almost unbelievable. He said: ``I 
invite the hon. member to rise above the niggling legalisms upon 
which he now relies for partisan purposes and join with this 
government to make sure'' and so on. What kind of a justice 
minister does Canada have? He is the supreme lawyer in Canada 
and he says: ``I invite the hon. member to rise above the niggling 
legalisms''. Is that not what the law is all about? It is in the detail 
that lawyers make their money. Here we have the justice minister 
turning around and saying not to worry, not to sweat the small stuff.
<P>
	In this case the small stuff happens to be section 55 of the Judges 
Act. That section says that Madam Justice Arbour should not be 
doing what she is doing and that the government should not have 
put her in a compromised position which has occurred as a direct 
result of the boldfaced arrogance of the Liberals.
<P>
	Many Liberal members were very upset in the last Parliament 
about the numerous times closure was used by the Conservatives. 
They railed against it. It is really interesting that in rushing bills 
through the House the Liberals have used closure on Bill C-33, 
time allocation on third reading and report stage of Bill C-41 and 
limited committee discussion and time allocation at third reading 
and report stage of Bill C-68.
<P>
	And what do we have with Bill C-68? We have a whole bunch of 
question marks. This same justice minister came forward yesterday 
with his proposed regulations. What he is not talking about is that 
again he not only does not consult with this Chamber, he not only 
does not consult with the members who have been elected by the 
people of Canada, whether it is on Bills C-33, C-41, C-68 or C-42, 
he does not consult with anybody. The Liberals are a power unto 
themselves.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. I hesitate to 
interrupt the hon. member with some niggling legal point, but there 
is a rule of relevance in the Chamber. I urge the hon. member to 
address his remarks to Bill C-42, the bill we are discussing.
<P>
	I recognize that in discussion of the use of closure he has a point, 
but when he gets off into the details of other bills he seems to be 
straying a bit far from the subject. As he knows, I am very reluctant 
to interrupt him on such a point but I would urge him to address his 
remarks to Bill C-42, the subject of discussion today, and the 
amendment moved by one of his colleagues to that motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand what you are saying. 
With the greatest respect, I would suggest, however, that we have 
within the justice department and with the justice minister a pattern 
relating to Bill C-42 that I would like to explore.
<P>
	For example, section 745. We have today the clear, irrefutable 
evidence that what the justice minister should have done was 
completely abolish section 745 as the people of Canada asked for. 
This justice minister simply does not listen.
<P>
	I draw to the Speaker's attention the fact that when the justice 
minister would turn around and in an answer to a specific question 
directed to Bill C-42 and say ``don't sweat the small stuff, it is only 
niggling little detail'', I suggest that the niggling detail is exactly 
the issue that we have to be discussing in relation to Bill C-42.
<P>
	Again I cite as an example section 745. During the process of 
section 745 there was an obvious lack of consultation, a lack of 
taking into account the perspective of the people of this House and 
indeed the people of Canada. With regard to section 745 and the 
problem with it, and what they did with Bill C-45, by turning 
around and going forward with half measures they created a 
situation where they could attempt to make it appear as though they 
had actually done something.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I draw to your attention a rather interesting article 
from the Calgary <I>Sun</I> dated September 16. This particular 
columnist is talking about the Liberal failure to scrap section 745 
of the Criminal Code that lets first degree murderers out on parole 
after 15 years in jail. Because of section 745 butchers like Paul 
Bernardo and Clifford Olson are entitled to apply for parole.
<P>
	The Reform Party has been calling for the abolition of this 
heinous loophole for years but it is still in effect and should be an 
embarrassment to any Liberal, but not to the Liberal member he is 
speaking about who comes from Edmonton. Her little newsletter 
has a headline blaring: ``Murderers Denied Parole Rights Under 
Section 745''. But it is simply not true. The only changes that the 
Liberals have proposed is that murderers will not automatically get 
reviewed for release and that any new mass murderers are 
ineligible. Bernardo and Olson are still eligible for parole after 15 
years. This columnist suggests in Liberal speak that is probably 
success.
<P>
	It is the loopholes, it is the niggling details, it is the fact that this 
justice minister in coming to this House with Bill C-42 actually 
came to this House with, as it were, a Trojan horse. It was unclear 
at the time when he came to this House with the bill that in fact this 
bill had any real implications. Certainly it was unclear that it 
related to the issue that the Reform Party has been driving home for 
the last two days with respect to Bill C-42.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	It is not only the process that the justice minister comes to this 
House with a Trojan horse and gets Bill C-42 through in that way, 
but then the government has the audacity to go to the other place to 
make the amendments that it wants to make when it realizes that 
even this Trojan horse was not put together properly.
<P>
	There is a fundamental flaw with this House when the 
government treats this House like a rubber stamp and treats the 
elected representatives who are elected, after all, by the people of 
Canada in this way.
<P>
	Let us take a look at all the bills that have come before this 
House. I must say that in my own committee, in taking a look at the 
Copyright Act, what does that have to do with Bill C-42? I will tell 
this House what it has to do with Bill C-42. Having had this Trojan 
horse brought in, having had the details not at all clear, having had 
the Liberals treat this House with the disrespect that they have 
under Bill C-42, now when Bill C-32, the Copyright Act, is before 
committee I, as a responsible parliamentarian, must assume that 
there may be a Trojan horse even in that bill.
<P>
	Therefore under Bill C-42 we have the difficulty that when we 
have a government coming forward, treating the House with 
disrespect, bringing in things in a surreptitious way, we have to 
take a look at all the details of every bill.

	It is the niggling detail and it is the Reform Party that is drawing 
to the attention of this House and through this process drawing 
attention to the people of Canada that currently we have a justice 
minister, a justice department and the Liberal government that 
continuously come to this House and rather than looking at the kind 
of detail that I have just read to this House that the Reform Party 
has brought, rather than dotting the <I>i</I>s and crossing the <I>t</I>s and doing 
the job correctly, rather than treating this House with the respect 
that it and the people in this House deserve, the Liberals continue to 
come to this House and treat it like a rubber stamp: ``Oh, by the 
way, if we have a problem we will correct it after the fact''.
<P>
	There was an example of that even in the passage of Bill C-63 
the other day. With Bill C-63 there had been a number of things that 
had been brought up at the last minute in this House as a result of 
debate. The government should be commended in a small way for 
the fact that it did end up taking a look at some of the provisions in 
the bill that needed some fine tuning. I commend it for that, but I 
ask why we had to get into that process. Why did we not have an 
opportunity on Bill C-63 to actually get those issues onto the table? 
I suggest the reason was that government once again was treating 
Bill C-63 in the same way as it has Bill C-42 and all these other 
bills. It has treated this Parliament as a rubber stamp.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	The government very simply went through a committee process 
on probably the cornerstone legislation of our government or the 
governing of this country, democracy in this country. It simply 
went ahead and had a situation where it had two weeks of hearings. 
The interesting thing was that one of those weeks nobody was in 
Ottawa. We were out in our constituencies working. So it had only 
one week to actually consider the terms and the details of that bill.
<P>
	I suggest there is an absolute irrefutable pattern here that the 
Liberals continuously treat this House as a rubber stamp, treat the 
members of Parliament with disrespect. I say that they treat us with 
disrespect in that they expect us to just roll over and do what is 
asked. They may be good enough for the Liberal backbenchers but 
it is not good enough for this opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really did 
appreciate the speech which I just listened to by the member for 
Kootenay East. He talked about not sweating the details. I think he 
was quoting the Minister of Justice in question period last week.
<P>
	The point I would like the hon. member to give the House his 
opinion on is while Madam Justice Arbour has been asked by the 
United Nations to a do a tremendously worthy job on behalf of all 
humanity, to go over there and uphold international law and to let 
international law be a beacon of light for civilization around the 
world, would it not be a sleight on the job that she is going to be 
doing if we have to trample over the Canadian law to let her go over 
there to uphold the law?
<P>
	That seems to be the issue that the hon. member was arguing, 
that while no one is disputing the great responsibility and the fact 
that someone from Canada has been selected to do this particular 
position, in our haste to accommodate the United Nations to allow 
her to go over there and uphold the law we have trampled over our 
own rules.
<P>
	It seems to me rather strange that we would do that because 
surely it would cast some kind of aspersion on her capacity over 
there if we find that the laws of Canada have been broken to 
accommodate the United Nations. That is one point I would ask 
him to consider.
<P>
	The second point I would ask him to consider which I would like 
his opinion on too is this idea that Madam Justice Louise Arbour 
has been granted a leave of absence from the bench for as long as 
she is required because there is no return date in this particular 
motion. We do not know how long she is going to be gone, but she 
is on the bench. Although she has a leave of absence she is still a 
member of the bench in this country with the superior court in the 
province of Ontario.
<P>
	She is what one might call a referee in the game of law. Yet now 
she is going to be a player. On one side she is going to be the 
prosecutor at the international court in The Hague. We get into this 
situation of being both the player and the referee. We have people 
in this House who are quite familiar with the game of hockey, for 
example, who know full well that you cannot be a referee and a 
player because the whole thing just tends to fall apart.
<P>
	I would like to have the member's opinion on whether one 
should, can be or whether it is advisable under these conditions to 
be both a referee and a player and the fact that we have ignored our 
own internal laws to allow her to take over this position at the 
United Nations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, it was interesting that while my 
colleague was speaking I heard from the other side of the House 
that a person can be a player and a referee if it is a different game.
<P>
	I would suggest that if the chief referee of the NHL were to suit 
up for the Montreal Canadiens there probably would be something 
of incredibility on the part of people in the stands. They would 
simply not accept that. In fact, even in that, which is at a totally 
different level to what we are talking about when we are talking  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6839"> 6839 </A></B>
<P>
about the supreme court of Ontario, there is just no way that we 
could end up having it fit.
<P>
	There is more to it than that.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	The reality is that within our system we are at the mercy of the 
judicial system as to how it in turn interprets the law. There was a 
very interesting exchange earlier with the member for Winnipeg 
and my colleague from Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca about the whole 
issue of whether the supreme court actually ends up making law on 
the basis of the charter of rights and freedoms. As a result of Pierre 
Trudeau and the whole thought process of the Liberals where we 
now have a charter industry populated by very high priced lawyers, 
we now have an even more of a requirement for there to be an 
absolute, positive, total, utter chasm between prosecution and the 
defence and the judiciary.
<P>
	To my colleague, I would say that the ends do not justify the 
means. Louise Arbour will be a prosecutor in The Hague while still 
a member of the impartial bench of Canada. The justice minister is 
on record as saying in a Senate standing committee that there are 
no provisions in the judges act allowing her to accept this 
appointment. That is an important issue. There are no provisions in 
the judges act allowing her to accept this appointment. He said that. 
Yes, I agree with my colleague, one cannot play the game and be a 
referee at the same time no matter what the circumstances are.
<P>
	An exemption for a particular person from public policy such as 
Madam Justice Arbour is called a private bill. Again, this did not 
come to the House as a private bill. Public policy goes through the 
House as a public bill. There is no provision in the rules for a 
hybrid, public-private bill.
<P>
	Again we are referring to the justice minister of Canada, the 
chief lawyer of Canada, who is saying do not sweat the small stuff, 
do not worry about the niggling details. This is not good enough, 
not nearly good enough. I would think that any lawyer in Canada 
would realize that for the justice minister to say do not sweat the 
small stuff, do not worry about the details, would have to question 
the total confidence of a person in as high a position as the justice 
minister of Canada.
<P>
	The justice minister is contravening the rules of this House by 
forcing this amendment through in a public bill. What has made it 
even worse is that he and the government are in a process of not 
only forcing it through the House but forcing it through the House 
by closure. We know there has been closure on some bills in the 
House which has been rather interesting. We have even seen 
closure and situations of people taking different positions in the 
House. It seems as though there is a question in the mind of this 
government as to whether it can actually get down to governing in a 
proper way. It has simply gone power hungry, power crazy on  
closure rather than taking the time through a process of negotiation 
with the Reform and with the Bloc, the official opposition, to get 
bills through the House in an orderly manner. But it is not doing 
that.
<P>
	We have tabled a multi-point amendment. It makes the condition 
of Madam Justice Arbour's leave of absence more stringent. We 
insist that in this process details must be adhered to. And not 
withstanding the laissez faire, do not worry about the detail attitude 
of our justice minister, we are going to continue to act as the 
guardians of the Canadian justice system, notwithstanding the fact 
that the justice minister says do not worry about the details.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to be given the opportunity to speak to Bill C-42.
<P>
	I want to be absolutely sure in what I say here that you 
understand that I am dealing with Bill C-42. I am speaking 
specifically on the consequences of the political interference to a 
large extent in the judiciary today. In doing so I will cite a number 
of examples which will show that what is happening in Bill C-42 is 
indeed part of the problem with the judiciary today. The examples 
come from my riding.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I have recently been involved with the first example. Some 
people will be shocked to hear it. They will wonder what exactly is 
going on. They will wonder how the judiciary is accountable and 
where we are going from here. My first example is the case of a 
young lady who was victimized in Aldergrove, British Columbia in 
my riding.
<P>
	She met an Abbotsford resident, Darren Ursel, in a bar at the 
Alder Inn where she had gone to meet a friend who did not turn up. 
This young lady had a soda because she does not drink alcohol. She 
and Ursel got talking. Ursel suggested they go for tea. They hopped 
in his car, drove to Ocean Park Pizza, and stopped at a bank along 
the way so he could use the ATM. They had tea and coffee and he 
drove her back to the parking lot at the Alder Inn where her car was 
parked. And there the horror started.
<P>
	He did not let her out of the car. He tried to kiss her. She did not 
want to. He became forceful and held her down. He then invaded 
her privacy with things that are a lot more disgusting than I should 
even mention in this House, and I will not. This fellow violated this 
woman in the worst ways one can imagine.
<P>
	He went to court in my riding. The judge said that what Ursel did 
was aggressive, angry and sadistic to some degree and that at other 
times Ursel was tender. The judge took into account that Ursel had 
no criminal record, was remorseful and had done everything in his 
power to deal with the situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6840"> 6840 </A></B>
<P>
	It sounds familiar. Bill C-41 was mentioned a little while ago 
in relation to conditional sentencing. So let us see what good old 
Judge Harry Boyle gave Mr. Ursel. He found him guilty, all right. 
Ursel was sentenced to two years less a day conditional 
sentencing; not one day of incarceration. This is conditional 
sentencing: ``If you do it again you will be sorry''. He was put 
on three years probation.
<P>
	Today that young lady is in very bad shape. The community is 
appalled at that decision, and understandably so. What it really 
says to me is the judge really said the first rape is free, there are no 
consequences. That kind of lack of accountability in this country is 
absolutely appalling. Most people in my riding think that judge 
should be removed from the bench and so do I.
<P>
	Ursel is walking the streets today, but the young lady is not. We 
have not taught him a darn thing about the horrendous acts he 
undertook. If I told members what he did they would be that much 
more ashamed of the decision that was made.
<P>
	To some extent that leads me to another example in my 
discussion of Bill C-42. Later I will explain why this is all 
happening in Bill C-42. I want to talk about a young man named 
Arron Stewart. I know his mom and dad are listening and so I will 
present the facts as they gave them to me.
<P>
	On March 26, 1995 their son, Arron Michael Stewart, was killed 
by a single stab wound to the heart. He was 23 years old. The 
individual responsible was an 18-year old, Scott Kent.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	When a group of males from Delta were leaving a party an 
altercation took place between a Langley male and one from Delta. 
They were separated by another Langley male. Another young 
fellow was accused of becoming involved in a fight and kicking 
another fellow down.
<P>
	Kent was hit in the face by one of these young men and, in 
retaliation for kicking and mouthing off, Kent returned to his 
residence, assessed the damage to his face, stole a knife and 
returned to the scene. It was the crown's contention that Kent was 
going after another young fellow.
<P>
	Kent was stopped and was asked what he had in his hand. They 
had seen a knife. It was mentioned that the knife was in this 
fellow's hand. The knife was presented. Young Aaron approached, 
pushed another fellow out of the way for his protection and within 
seconds he was stabbed. He died 15 minutes later.
<P>
	This is only a very short snapshot of the events. Suffice it to say 
Aaron was no threat whatsoever to Kent. The evidence presented at 
the trial suggested that Aaron 's role was that of peacemaker. He 
tried to disarm or defuse the situation. According to Kent, Aaron 
was going to assault him.
<P>
	The defence's position was self-defence. Given all the evidence 
it was, at best, difficult to believe and a very hard sell.
<P>
	Kent was on probation for assault causing bodily harm at the 
time. Aaron had no record whatsoever.
<P>
	The judge instructed the jury, over 40 pages, not to take this 
information as a propensity to violence. That is what the judge said, 
that he has a previous record but do not consider it.
<P>
	Bob and Audrey Stewart say they feel that Aaron's life was taken 
in a violent manner, and it was. They felt that Kent was guilty of 
second degree murder. On two occasions a plea bargain for 
manslaughter was put to the crown and rejected. They were 
confident that justice would prevail and Kent would be held 
accountable.
<P>
	On October 30, 1996 at 12.15, after 16 hours of deliberation, 
Kent was acquitted. The last thing the parents remember the judge 
saying, while he was smiling, was: ``You are free to go''.
<P>
	This young fellow murdered an innocent young man. He had 
already been charged with assault. He was free to go.
<P>
	This is one of the few countries in the world where a person can 
stab someone else and not be penalized. I often wonder how it is 
possible for someone to be free to go when they attempted to plea 
bargain for manslaughter, virtually admitting what had happened.
<P>
	Where do these decisions come from and why? I have studied 
many Canadian judicial decisions over the last several years. I want 
to relay a few which pertain to Bill C-42. Some of them will 
surprise people, but I have become hardened to the kind of 
decisions which are made these days. I have talked to a lot of young 
people about these decisions and they are appalled. They do not 
know how to stop it. They do not know what to do.
<P>
	How do judges get on a bench? Are they political appointments? 
Basically. With Liberal governments being in power in Canada for 
so many years how can we expect anything other than many Liberal 
judicial decisions?
<P>
	One of the Liberals, I believe, just said ``and a few more yet''. If 
that is so, then we can expect more Liberal judicial decisions like 
the ones I am going to read to the House.
<P>
	B.C. Supreme Court Justice Sherman Hood, before acquitting a 
man of sexually assaulting a North Vancouver waitress, said: ```No' 
sometimes means `maybe' or `wait a while'''.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	Has anyone in their life ever heard such disgusting rulings? That 
is an easy one. In the Northwest Territories  circuit court Judge 
Michel Bourassa said that sexual assaults ``occur, when the woman 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6841"> 6841 </A></B>
<P>
is drunk and passed out, the man comes along, sees a pair of hips 
and helps himself''. That is from this country's bench.
<P>
	Many people listening may have heard B.C. county court Judge 
Peter Vanderhoof describe a three-year old girl. She could be 
anyone's child. After sentencing her attacker to 18 months 
probation for sexual interference as they call it today, he called the 
three-year old girl ``sexually aggressive''. Now I ask, is that 
reasonable? Is that in any way typical of what Canadians expect 
from this country's bench? Where do these decisions come from?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> What does this have to do with the Judges Act?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> An individual over on the 
Liberal side just asked me how this relates to the Judges Act. I 
think I will leave that up to the listeners because he certainly does 
not understand what I am talking about. He does not understand the 
reality between this House politically appointing judges to 
positions and how it affects world decisions like C-42 is doing with 
Louise Arbour. He does not understand that but I think other people 
will.
<P>
	I recommend that members read the book <I>Contempt of Court</I> by 
Carsten Stroud. They will see how relevant many of the things in 
this book are to C-42. Some of us from British Columbia will 
remember the case Stroud refers to: ``David Snow was charged in 
Vancouver with kidnapping two women and trying to strangle a 
third. I quote from the judge's decision: I cannot conclude that the 
placing of the wire around the neck of the victim and the placing of 
the plastic over her head are sufficient to establish intent to kill''.
<P>
	If the Liberal member does not understand the relevance 
between the political impact of Bill C-42 and appointing judges to 
the bench, in many cases Liberal judges making Liberal decisions, 
then that is exactly what I am trying to deliver in this message: You 
do not understand and therefore you should pick up and get out of 
here.
<P>
	Let us talk about Port Hardy, B.C. provincial court judge Brian 
Saunderson who gave 57-year old Vernon Logan an absolute 
discharge. This was a decision from the bench. Even though Logan 
pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography, the judge said: 
``The law banning child pornography violates the charter of rights 
because it is an infringement of one's freedom of thought, belief or 
opinion, as unfettered access to reading material is necessary to 
exercise those freedoms''.
<P>
	Members are getting rowdy over there because they do not like 
the message but it is just too bad what they do not like because they 
are going to have to listen to it. If the Liberals opposite listened a 
little more they might understand what some of us are trying to tell 
them. These  judicial decisions are hurting people. They are setting 
bad precedents.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	My favourite judge, Howard Wetston, about whom I have 
spoken several times, recently decided in yet another ridiculous 
ruling that federal prisoners have the right to vote under the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I quote: ``Preventing 
prisoners serving more than two years from voting is too sweeping 
an infringement''. So first degree murderer Richard Sauvé won his 
case and now they all vote.
<P>
	I cannot say that the member is now gone, can I, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Nobody knew when he was here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Sometimes when we do not 
understand what is going on it is better to vacate.
<P>
	In Montreal last July two teens were sentenced to three years 
each in enclosed custody and two years of supervision after 
pleading guilty to reduced charges of second degree murder in the 
brutal killing of an elderly couple. The judge described the killings 
of the elderly couple as senseless and despicable. In delivering the 
sentence he also forbade those two young fellows who killed the 
elderly couple from possessing firearms and explosives for five 
years. Now is that not a dandy? In another two years they will be 
able to have explosives.
<P>
	This country has seen it all. I am very concerned, as are my 
colleagues, about the relevance of politics in the judiciary today, 
the consequences of which are bad judicial decisions. Bill C-42 is 
doing just that. It will create bad judicial decisions. What do we do 
about it?
<P>
	We heard about the judges who used cocaine and booze as an 
excuse for murder. Psychotic killer Michael Kruger got a few 
thousand dollars for being inconvenienced during a labour dispute 
in a prison. The judge said he was ``inconvenienced for denial of 
showers, therapy and a swimming pool''. That is kind of sick.
<P>
	Now that I have told the House what some of the problems are, 
what are the solutions?
<P>
	The two most important qualifications of judicial appointments 
in this country must be knowledge of the law and integrity. They 
should not be who you know, whom you work for and what 
political party is in power.
<P>
	Lawyers must always be examined before their appointment to 
the bench. They should be examined on their competency in the 
areas of law where they will be making the decisions. If they fail, 
they should not be appointed. We must end political appointments, 
not begin them with Bill C-42. We must end them.
<P>
	There has to be more predictability in sentencing in this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6842"> 6842 </A></B>
<P>
	There has to be a continuous testing, or time limited 
appointments on the judiciary. The names of candidates for 
judicial appointments should be made available to the public with 
their background information. Who they know, who was in the 
last corporate boardroom, and who raised money for the campaign 
should not enter into it. The justice minister should not be making 
legislation to make it convenient for an appointment.
<P>
	There should be a national code of conduct and conflict of 
interest rules for judges. I am not dreaming this up. This came from 
a report commissioned by the Canadian Judicial Council. Was it 
done? No. The judicial council said that disciplinary hearings 
against judges should be open to the public. And why not? What is 
wrong with that? Except it does not fit in with the mode of being 
involved with a political appointment or the politics of the issue.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	For absolutely certain the mandatory retirement age of judges 
should be lowered from 75 years to 65 years as a minimum. I think 
it should be lower.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> How low?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I am asked how low. Let us 
limit the terms of chief justices in most courts to seven years. How 
about that?
<P>
	Do not think for one moment that is coming from a political bias. 
That is coming from the judicial council. Maybe these members 
should listen.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was very interested in my hon. colleague's presentation. 
Certainly he reviewed not only the Judges Act as it relates to Bill 
C-42, but the very effect of that act on the appointments that are 
made and the results of those appointments. The hon. member gave 
us an indication of what is happening in the courtrooms across this 
land.
<P>
	I was particularly interested in a situation he referred to with 
regard to an Aaron Stewart. I know my colleague's interest and I 
know that he works with people on the ground. Is my colleague 
aware of how the victims in that situation have responded to what 
has happened? How do they feel about this country's judicial 
system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, as it happens, 
Bob and Audrey Stewart never had the opportunity to present a 
victim's impact statement in that case. In fact today the prosecution 
in British Columbia is deciding as to whether or not the case will be 
appealed. If it is not, certainly we will be dealing with that 
immediately.
<P>
	I want to provide the House of Commons and the Canadian 
people with a real victim impact statement from two parents who 
did not get the opportunity to present it: ``Nothing prepared us for 
the early morning events of March 26, 1995. Two Courtney 
detachment  RCMP officers came to our home to inform us that our 
son Aaron Michael Stewart was a victim of a stabbing incident at a 
house party in Langley. He had died within 15 minutes. Our 
nightmare began.
<P>
	``In a single moment our lives were changed forever. Our grief 
was and is indescribable. Aaron was a wonderful son, brother, 
grandson, nephew, cousin and friend. We had done our level best to 
raise Aaron and we had nothing but pride in him. Life is very 
precious. We thank God for the 23 wonderful loving years we had 
with Aaron. We were truly blessed. Death is always very difficult 
regardless of age or circumstance.
<P>
	``The violence surrounding Aaron's passing just increased the 
pain. Given his love of life and his youth, his death can only be 
described as a senseless tragedy. A tragedy of this magnitude 
happens to other people. Never do we imagine the possibility of it 
happening to us.
<P>
	``We find it difficult to even remember the last 19 months. We 
were thrown into funeral preparations, courtroom appearances and 
media coverage, to say nothing of trying to deal with our own grief 
and that of our family and friends. Compounding this was the 
shock and outrage we all felt.
<P>
	``We put our faith in the legal system fully expecting justice to 
prevail. The show cause hearing afforded the accused bail, a 
$10,000 surety and an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. We were appalled 
and addressed our concerns in writing to the deputy regional 
crown. A new prosecutor was named and we were afforded the 
opportunity to be a part of the process.
<P>
	``On two occasions defence counsel requested a plea bargain to 
manslaughter. The crown advised us of these requests but we were 
assured the violent nature of the crime warranted the charge of 
second degree murder. The requests were rejected. The eight days 
of preliminary inquiry in December 1995 only increased our 
resolve. There were 30 or 40 statements taken on that morning and 
over 20 witnesses called by the crown during the inquiry. We were 
very grateful for the overwhelming support shown by family and 
friends. We were never alone to face this ordeal.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The next step in our attempt to seek justice was the trial, October 
of 1996. After three weeks of testimony our world ended, the jury 
handing down an acquittal. Justice did not prevail. Where do we go 
from here?''
<P>
	I can only say to Robert and Audrey Stewart that we will not give 
up the fight for justice. We will not give up the fight for legitimate 
process through the judiciary. I think the Liberals should take note 
of what I have said here today and go back and think about all those 
victims out there and try to spend a little more time helping victims 
and not criminals.
<P>

<B><A NAME="6843"> 6843 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a couple of days ago I 
had the privilege of having a rather lengthy conversation with a 
few security guards here on the Hill. Many of them, having been 
here for a number of years, are a source of much more knowledge 
and perhaps intellect than most of the members opposite and so 
they give me reasonably good guidance.
<P>
	One thing that came up from two or three of them was why do we 
not have an elected judiciary in this country? I tried to explain to 
them the pros and the cons of this as I saw it. I wonder if the hon. 
member, since we are talking here in Bill C-42 about a band-aid bill 
when the government should be revising the whole lousy system, 
would give me his views on whether or not we should have an 
elected judiciary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, many people in 
this country today think we should have an elected judiciary. There 
are good points and consequences to that decision.
<P>
	Overall, if we look at the American model, there is a tendency 
for judges to respond to a lot of political pressure from individual 
groups and so on. I am not sure how well that serves the process.
<P>
	The difficulty here is that governments have really been 
involved in appointing judges. Members say it is an independent 
process, but it is really not. We can tell by Bill C-42 that a 
government is directly getting involved with the judiciary.
<P>
	I like the suggestion from the Canadian Judicial Council that the 
terms of chief justices should be limited to seven years. That would 
make a difference. With some of the judges who have made bad 
decisions, as I have related here today, then we would only be stuck 
with some of these guys for a maximum of seven years but usually 
six, five, four or three.
<P>
	If I had my way I would prefer to see a shorter term than an 
election of judges.

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 83(1), I have the honour to lay upon the 
Table a Notice of Ways and Means motion with respect to the 
amendment to the Excise Tax, the Income Tax Act and the Customs 
Tariff.
<P>
	I am tabling explanatory notes at the same time and I ask that 
you designate an Order of the Day for consideration of the said 
motion.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JUDGESACT">JUDGES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion in relation to the 
amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-42, an act to amend the 
Judges Act and to make consequential amendments to another act; 
and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
those who are watching, we are debating amendments proposed to 
Bill C-42. Bill C-42 attempts to legitimize the government's moves 
to allow Madam Justice Arbour to take a position as a prosecutor in 
the Hague.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	It has been said before that the issue here is neither Madam 
Justice Arbour nor her credentials; nor is there any question of the 
honour that has been accorded to her by the UN when it asked her 
to take this position. The issue is the process that has been followed 
in order to bring this about.
<P>
	It is extremely and disturbingly clear that the process followed 
by the government has demonstrated a disregard which amounts to 
contempt of the due process of the law. There has been disrespect 
for our legislation. There has been disrespect for the House. There 
have been all kinds of games played in order for the government to 
get its wishes through.
<P>
	The most disturbing thing about this is that it has become a 
pattern of the government. As a new member of the House, having 
sat here for the last three years, I have become more and more 
concerned and upset about this pattern of behaviour, this pattern of 
dealing in the House. It is not too strong a statement to say that the 
democratic process is being eroded little by little, day by day, in the 
most overt way possible by the government.
<P>
	I believe the government is doing so because it believes the 
citizens of Canada will not know, will not realize, will not be able 
to really see, as they carry on their daily lives, what is happening in 
this institution so it feels it can away with this sort of thing.
<P>
	There are some very glaring contraventions of what would be 
right and proper. Mr. Speaker, I know you will be interested in 
hearing some of my concerns because you voiced them in the last 
Parliament, as did many of the opposition members. We have all 
seen the erosion and the blatant disregard and contravention of 
democratic process in the House.
<P>
	The Judges Act does not presently allow any judge to accept any 
employment except from the Government of Canada. In order to 
get around that, an arrangement was made whereby this justice 
would continue to be paid by the Government of Canada from 
funds provided to it by  the UN. Technically the cheque was being 
cut by the Government of Canada although the funds originated 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6844"> 6844 </A></B>
<P>
somewhere else through another arrangement. With a little sleight 
of hand, a little deception, a little under the table juggling, a clear 
provision of the Judges Act was simply rejigged because it was 
inconvenient.
<P>
	The Judges Act does not allow judges to accept employment 
from any employer other than the Government of Canada. Of 
course, the employer in question is not the Government of Canada 
but the UN which has asked Madam Justice Arbour to be a 
prosecutor in the Hague.
<P>
	The government found a certain provision in the Judges Act to 
be rather inconvenient in terms of what it wanted to do. There 
seems to have been plenty of evidence over the last three years as I 
have watched the operation of the Liberal government, that one of 
its guiding principles is the end justifies the means. Its guiding 
principle is: ``If we think something should be done, if we intend to 
do something, then whatever means it takes to accomplish that, 
even if we have to sweep aside some rather inconvenient 
democratic conventions, so be it''.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	We see that in committee. Committee chairmen, instead of being 
chosen freely and fairly by their peers, are chosen by the Prime 
Minister and his advisers. Then a charade is played out in 
committee and government members simply stand up like trained 
seals and vote for whoever they are told is going to be the 
committee chairman.
<P>
	If there are procedures in the committee which are inconvenient 
to the minister or the government, because committees are 
supposed to be the masters of their own process, there is a vote by 
the majority, the government members on the committee, which 
sweeps aside long established democratic processes in order to get 
on with the job. After all, as government members, they know what 
is best in committee. Why should the rotten opposition members be 
able to hold up the works?
<P>
	It is extremely disturbing. Government members should be very 
concerned about what is happening by this process. I do not think it 
is a secret to anybody that the democratic process, democratic 
conventions, democratic protections and checks and balances are 
cavalierly being ignored, swept under the table and run roughshod 
over in order for government to do what it is going to do anyway.
<P>
	The government does not want to talk about how it deals with 
issues and how legislation, due process and democratic convention 
are being contravened. If we dare to stand up and talk about it, 
suddenly there is a problem-
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We are 
dealing with the Judges Act. I assume we will get to that point, with 
the member's consent?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to know that the 
member is paying close attention. It will certainly be a different 
experience for some of us on this side of the House.
<P>
	In order to get around the inconvenience of the prohibitions in 
the Judges Act with respect to the appointment of Madam Justice 
Arbour, as it gets around a number of other inconvenient standing 
orders and conventions and laws that might impede the way the 
government wants to do things, the Minister of Justice simply had 
the cabinet pass an order in council approving the appointment of 
the justice to work for the UN commencing July 1. We are only 
now debating legislation that would actually legitimize the work of 
this justice. Of course the Senate did not approve of the legislation 
which it received from the government and amended it.
<P>
	Again the pattern appears, where clear laws and conventions are 
simply ignored at the wish of the government. Canadians need to 
be extremely concerned about the way the government deals with 
issues, legislation and conventions that are inconvenient to it.
<P>
	The government is using closure almost on a daily basis. That is 
a procedure which the government, when it was in opposition, 
called morally wicked and railed against. We have closure on this 
bill. Closure cuts off debate. The government is not allowing the 
voice of duly elected representatives to be heard. We cannot voice 
our concerns, voice our criticisms or voice our alternatives to the 
way this issue is being handled. That is not something the 
government wants to see. It is not something which my colleague 
who keeps getting up and trying to interrupt the remarks and the 
concerns that I am bringing forward wants to see.
<P>
	I hope that Canadians watching this debate will wake up and 
realize that we are seeing the erosion of the democratic process. It 
is the erosion of the commitment to follow the rule of law. I find 
that reprehensible.
<P>
	An order in council is legitimizing what is clearly prohibited by 
an act of Parliament. After the fact the government is trying to ram 
something through in order to deal with the situation.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	Also, there is an exemption for a particular person which is being 
dealt with in this bill. Such an exemption has always been dealt 
with by a private bill. Public policy goes through the House as a 
public bill, but this sort of policy goes through the House as a 
private bill. Again, the rules of the House are clearly being 
contravened by forcing this bill, this amendment, through as a 
public bill.
<P>
	We see the disdain of the government for the democratic process 
in the way this whole thing is being carried out. We see the disdain 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6845"> 6845 </A></B>
<P>
in so many ways, by bringing in closure, in the way committees are 
simply run as kangaroo operations in many cases and ignoring 
clear democratic conventions.
<P>
	Last night we saw that the government does not even want to 
allow Canadians to decide who to support in their own ridings for 
their own candidates for the Liberal Party. I think it is very clear 
that we are going to have to speak out more loudly and more 
pointedly so that Canadians can begin to realize we simply must 
insist that when issues are being dealt with and when legislation is 
in place that it is respected and not simply ignored or dealt with in 
the most expeditious way possible in order for the government to 
get what it wants. This is dangerous.
<P>
	Surely government members must be able to see how repugnant 
their actions are by their support of closure, interruptions of 
speeches that try to point out how the process needs to be tightened 
up and even their support of this bill which clearly contravenes 
legislation that has been passed by the House simply because the 
government finds it inconvenient. It does not allow them to do what 
they have decided they want to do. Therefore the legislation in this 
instance has to be changed.
<P>
	This is a very difficult situation which must be dealt with. We 
must look at the larger issues which are being raised about the way 
the bill through the government is dealing with the issue.
<P>
	Canadians who are watching this debate should take the time to 
phone the office of their representative and find out how the 
process is being carried out. Where there is a prohibition for 
something the government wants to do, the government does 
anyway by an order in council. When the matter is finally dealt 
with in the House, the government does all sorts of things to ignore 
democratic convention by bringing in closure in order to ram 
through what the government has decided on. This is very 
dangerous and very unfortunate. I hope Canadians will speak out 
against this sort of thing.
<P>
	In Bill C-42 we have a situation where a whole legislative 
scheme is being changed to allow one situation to be dealt with. No 
matter how good the end result is which is being sought, the means 
can do nothing but raise concern and disapproval in the minds of 
Canadians and some members in the House who have a duty to 
represent Canadians and make sure that the process dealing with 
their interests is fair, open and balanced. We need to spend some 
time considering not only some particulars of the bill but the way it 
is being dealt with.
<P>
	We have a Judges Act which protects the impartiality, the 
structure of our judiciary. There are provisions in the act to deal 
with the very important integrity and operation of our justice 
system. Because of the anomaly, a different situation, that whole 
act is being amended in this way in a very unconventional way for 
one individual.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	We in the Reform Party have tabled a multi-point amendment 
that puts conditions on this kind of leave by a member of our 
judiciary. The judges of our country are here to serve Canadians in 
an impartial, unbiased and unimpeded way. We have, as the House 
knows, put forward some amendments in order to make this kind of 
absence more stringent to make sure the conditions under which 
our judges are able to mix some of their priorities are dealt with in a 
way that makes it very clear that the interest of Canadians, the 
interest of our judicial system and judicial duties are carried out as 
clearly and unimpeded as possible.
<P>
	I urge this House to consider those amendments carefully, to 
look at the fact that these amendments are intending to serve the 
process of this House and respect the legislation of this House and 
also to make sure that our judicial system does not have mixed 
priorities, a mixed focus, that the interest of the people of Canada 
come first and foremost with those who serve us on the bench. I 
would urge the members of this House to support the amendments 
that we have put forward to Bill C-42.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the member to comment, if she would, with regard to 
orders in council, what the definition of that is, what it really means 
and what we have been led to believe what it means and how such a 
prescribed way of doings things can apply in this particular bill 
through orders in council.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to respond to Bill C-68 where 
orders in council were used where it appears to say that the 
Minister of Justice when he deems it necessary may use orders in 
council to make certain decisions.
<P>
	It is my understanding that this is for emergency situations, and 
very extreme events would have to lead to its use. Here in this 
particular bill it appears to me that it was used just because the 
minister chose to do so. Who should deem an order in council to be 
used and how should it be used?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question.
<P>
	Even before I thought of running for election, before I thought of 
getting involved in politics, I had heard concerns raised in a 
number of quarters about the increasing use of orders in council 
which is simply a way for the cabinet to put something into effect 
without having recourse to the legislative process.
<P>
	As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, and as some Canadians are 
aware, the use of this rather high handed method of putting policy 
in place has increased steadily over the years. As my colleague 
pointed out, it is now being used in ways that originally it was 
never intended to be used.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6846"> 6846 </A></B>
<P>
	It simply is another example of illustrating the concern which 
I tried to raise respecting the way Bill C-42 has been dealt with 
and brought forward. There is a disrespect for the checks and 
balances in our democratic system for due process, for democratic 
conventions.
<P>
	I appeal to government members. Only the support of all 
government members lets this kind of process go ahead. I know 
sometimes it is very frustrating when government members feel 
that opposition is simply putting forward roadblocks just to put 
them forward.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	However, the democratic process must be allowed to work. It 
may be inconvenient and frustrating but it is used to protect 
everyone in this country. As it is continually eroded, particularly in 
this House which is supposed to be the bastion of the our 
democratic ideals, I find it extremely worrisome. I would think it 
would worry the members of the government as well. Only 
members of the government can stop this sort of thing and simply 
tell the cabinet and those who are telling them what to do that we 
have to let this process work. That also applies to orders in council, 
closures, work on committees and everything else that is done in 
this House. We just have to put a stop to the direction we are 
moving in and bring us back into a more balanced way of dealing 
with things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the hon. member for her intervention.
<P>
	I was listening to my 17-year old twin boys a couple of weeks 
ago, who were studying the Canadian government in their social 
studies class. I caught the tail end of their conversation and this is 
what one said to the other: ``What we really have in Canada is a 
pretty much fairly elected dictator''. That was their assessment 
when they talked about how parliament and how government work 
in this country.
<P>
	They were talking about things like the use of orders in council 
and something which they probably know best, Bill C-68, the gun 
control bill, where the Prime Minister publicly threatened any 
government MPs that if they dared to vote against a government 
bill again he would refuse to sign their nomination papers. This 
would mean that their political career would be ended if their 
papers were not signed by the Prime Minister. They cannot run as a 
Liberal candidate. Many got elected only because they were on the 
Liberal's slate last time.
<P>
	Maybe my sons are not normal 17-year old kids to be talking 
about this kind of thing, but I am proud that they were and came to 
this conclusion.
<P>
	I would just like to ask the hon. member to comment on the 
conclusions that my sons had come to about how government 
works or does not work in this country in terms of being a truly 
democratic system.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would answer my colleague by 
saying that I should have mentioned that in my speech. I am glad 
these things are brought up. I did touch on this when I talked about 
having a governing party which does not even allow people in this 
country to decide who is going to be their candidate. As my 
colleague mentioned, we know this because it has been made 
public. However, I am sure that is just the tip of the iceberg because 
so many people are afraid to speak out about these things.
<P>
	We know that backbench members especially are threatened that 
they will not be allowed to run as candidates again. Conversely, we 
know that there are some candidates who have been told that they 
will not have to face any competition for the nomination if they do 
the bidding of the Prime Minister. This again is another situation in 
the democratic process that is extremely worrisome.
<P>
	I think we saw this with the elections bill that was just passed in 
this House where governments will now have all the 
foreknowledge and power to call an election at their own whim and 
whenever the circumstances are right for them. It now gives the 
opposition even less time to present their case to the Canadian 
people. Instead of 47 days, they now only have 36 days. By the 
time all the government messages that have been carefully crafted 
leading up to the election are de-spun who knows how easy it will 
be for the electorate to sort through the choices that are before it.
<P>
	There are so many things where this government is more and 
more simply saying ``we are going to do what we want and if 
anything gets in our way or impedes that, we are simply going to 
sweep that kind of opposition aside''. Again I would appeal to 
members of this House to put a stop to this kind of movement in 
that direction.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to question the member who just spoke with regard to a question 
that was given to her from a previous speaker who said the Prime 
Minister, in particular, had threatened Liberal members of 
Parliament note to vote against the gun bill.
<P>
	If the hon. member wants Canadians to stop the cynicism toward 
politicians, that is the worst rubbish I have heard. I would like that 
hon. member to respond. Did she really believe what that member 
said to her in his question?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not a member of the Liberal 
caucus and never expect to be. The information I have to go on is 
what Liberal caucus members themselves tell other members of the 
House and members of the public and the press. Those allegations 
have been widely reportedly. I do not think they have been 
challenged to any substantial degree. I would suggest that those 
kinds of messages do not get out unless there is some substance to 
them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6847"> 6847 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-42.
<P>
	My hon. colleague for Calgary North and other members have 
done a very good job of pointing to the injustice of this particular 
piece of legislation. They have pointed out that the minister when 
he was before the Senate said that there was no means to bring 
about the type of changes that he is now bringing about. I am not 
going to belabour that aspect of it. My colleagues have done a 
wonderful job of bringing all of that to light.
<P>
	I would like to talk about how this government really does have 
misplaced priorities. Bill C-42 is a perfect example of that. In a day 
and an age where we have rising violent crime in this country, 
should we not be bringing in legislation that deals with crime in 
this country instead of worrying about ensuring we have a 
prosecutor in The Hague?
<P>
	Some people across the way are saying we do not have violent 
crime in this country or that it is on the decline. Between 1960 and 
1995 the incidence of violent crime per 100,000 people has gone 
from about 200 to just about 1,000. I do not care how it is looked at, 
that is a huge increase. During the last 35 years violent crime has 
gone up over 350 per cent and it is still on an upward trend. That is 
violent crime overall.
<P>
	Youth crime is a very similar type of trend. In 1986 the incidence 
of violent crime per 100,000 was 400 and now it is up over 900. 
The hon. members can state opinions all they want but when they 
look at the real facts it is pretty clear. It is pretty clear to most 
Canadians, by the way, even if Liberal members do not believe it. I 
am trying to make the point that the government's priorities are 
very mixed up.
<P>
	The justice minister seems to have a pretty funny idea of just 
what his job is. Since he came into power about three years ago the 
government has done virtually nothing to deal with the huge 
problem that we have with crime in this country. The justice 
minister brought down legislation that extends gay rights. He 
brought down legislation that introduced gun control. It it going to 
cost a lot of money.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Wild Rose points out all the time, for the 
amount of money they are going to spend on gun control getting 
honest citizens to register their guns they could put another 20,000 
cops on the beat out there and that would do a lot more to protect 
this country against crime than getting honest folks to register their 
guns. That is another example of how the government has its 
priorities mixed up.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	The third example, which we are talking about today, is a case of 
breaking both legs to ensure we can send a prosecutor to The Hague 
to prosecute war crimes. We do not have any problem with doing 
that, but if the government would invest the same amount of energy 
in dealing with crime in this country, if it would spend the same 
amount of energy in giving prosecutors and police the necessary 
tools to deal with crime in this country, we would have a lot safer 
country.
<P>
	The justice minister has had three years to bring in all kinds of 
legislation to deal with some of the problems we have in this 
country. He could have dealt with youth crime, with our extremely 
leaky parole system. We just had the example the other day of 
dangerous illegal refugees and sometimes immigrants in this 
country the government will not deal with.
<P>
	We finally pressured the immigration minister recently to deal 
with the problem of a dangerous sex offender who was released 
back into the population of Calgary. We continued to pressure her 
until she finally got around to doing something.
<P>
	There is no excuse for the government to focus on legislation 
like Bill C-42 when we have all kinds of problems in our own 
backyard. I am concerned about how this affects individual lives, 
about how it really impinges on our freedom.
<P>
	Not long ago I travelled with the finance committee to Toronto. I 
went for a jog one morning through Etobicoke. I was struck by the 
number of houses with bars on the windows, on all the bottom 
windows. I remember running by a car and seeing a ``Club'' on the 
steering wheel. I can imagine if I went up to the doors of houses I 
would see signs saying this house is protected by such and such an 
alarm, or beware of dog. There would probably be all kinds of 
deadbolts and latches on doors.
<P>
	Clearly Canadians have decided they cannot count on the 
government to protect them against crime so they have had to 
resort to various means to protect themselves. That is a very sorry 
commentary on what this government has done with respect to 
dealing with crime. It has gone to great lengths to introduce Bill 
C-42 but what has it done for the ordinary Canadian? Zippo. 
Nothing. It has done absolutely nothing.
<P>
	Not long ago were speaking of Ontario. Not long ago the country 
was gripped by the Bernardo trial. The whole country tuned in 
because it could not believe what had happened in this country with 
somebody like Paul Bernardo raping and murdering young women. 
Perhaps the most offensive thing of all was that in light of that 
horrible crime this justice minister would not even consider a 
return to capital punishment.
<P>
	This justice minister wants to get Bill C-42 through but he will 
not even listen to the 70 per cent of Canadians who say they would 
like to have a debate on capital punishment and would like to return 
to the days when we had capital punishment in this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6848"> 6848 </A></B>
<P>
	That is standing justice on its head. The justice minister does 
not have a clue what justice really means. I do not think he has 
any idea. When people sit in their homes because they are afraid 
to go out at night, that does not indicate that we have justice in 
this country.
<P>
	In my own little community when my wife sends our boys off to 
school only a few hundred yards away she worries like crazy until 
they get home after school, and why would she not? Why would 
she not worry after we read what we read in the newspapers these 
days?
<P>
	Violent crime in Canada has increased by 350 per cent since the 
sixties. Violent youth crime in Canada has more than doubled in the 
last 10 years. So why would people not be worried about that? Can 
we blame them?
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	We get petitions in this place all the time. We get petitions 
calling for the government to do something with dangerous 
offenders, to tighten up the parole system and to reintroduce capital 
punishment. What happens with them? These are the voices of 
ordinary Canadians who are concerned about their lives. What 
happens? Nothing.
<P>
	The government responds by introducing Bill C-42. It jams 
through legislation that has nothing to do with the agenda of 
ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	It was not very long ago that Canadians were railing against the 
justice minister's weak changes to section 745 of the Criminal 
Code. I do not have to tell members in this place that ordinary 
Canadians want to see section 745 removed. They do not want 
weak amendments. They do not want to see Clifford Olson and 
Paul Bernardo come back into their lives through television. These 
people will be coming forward to apply for early release. 
Canadians think those people should spend the rest of their lives in 
jail or worse. Many people would like to see them face the death 
penalty. Quite frankly, I am one of those people. It is unbelievable 
how we protect people like Bernardo, Olson and others. It is crazy.
<P>
	I cannot believe we are debating Bill C-42 when we should be 
debating legislation which will protect the lives of ordinary 
Canadians.
<P>
	Our party has taken a different stance from that of the 
government. While the government is setting up cozy little deals 
for its friends in the judiciary, my colleague from Fraser Valley is 
putting together a victims bill of rights. He is concerned about 
ordinary Canadians who have suffered at the hands of animals who 
are currently sitting in these Holiday Inns which we call prisons. 
He has come up with all kinds of legislation which would give 
victims rights in the courts, so that instead of having the justice 
system stand up for the rights of criminals, we would have a justice 
system, for once in this country, which would stand up for ordinary 
citizens and people who have been victimized by crime.
<P>
	Why not give victims some standing in the courts when their 
lives have been turned upside down? Why not allow victims some 
say when these cases come before the parole board? Why not force 
some of these criminals to come up with compensation? That 
should be a basic right for victims. They should have the right to go 
after the criminals to get the money back which they lost due to a 
crime which was committed against them or their family. That is 
basic common sense. That reflects the common sense of the 
common people.
<P>
	We have two agendas in the country. We have the agenda of 
regular, law-abiding, ordinary Canadians who think there should be 
punishment for crime and that justice means that if someone 
injures someone or harms their property that they should pay a 
price for it. Then we have the government approach, which is quite 
different. The government agenda is radically different. It is 
completely disconnected from the agenda of regular people. Its 
agenda indicates that somehow criminals are the victims and we 
need to protect their rights. My goodness, they cannot vote in jail? 
Let us ensure that they can vote. That is the government's 
approach. We cannot have them eating macaroni and cheese for 
dinner. We have to ensure that they get fillet mignon.
<P>
	My colleague from Fraser Valley West spoke last spring about 
the spring ball at a prison in Ontario where, believe it or not, the 
prisoners were being served fillet mignon. I would argue that 
ordinary Canadians, thanks to the high tax policies of the 
government, very seldom have a chance to eat fillet mignon. 
According to the Liberal government nothing is too good for the 
criminals and the murderers of this country. Let us make sure they 
have a golf course. As a matter of fact, ordinary Canadians would 
be alarmed and amazed to know that we have golf courses for the 
criminals in this country.
<P>
	Instead of dealing with injustices, what does the government do? 
It brings forward Bill C-42. While the criminals are out golfing, 
while they are playing racquetball in Matsqui prison, Canadians are 
just scraping to get by, putting bars on their windows to be 
protected from the criminals out there.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	It was not very long ago when a couple of criminals walked 
across the golf course in British Columbia to freedom only to go on 
into the United States to allegedly kill somebody. This is absolutely 
unbelievable.
<P>
	What is the priority of the government? To bring down Bill C-42 
which has nothing to do with protecting the lives of ordinary 
citizens.
<P>
	Not very long ago a prisoner who was playing racquetball at 
Matsqui prison in British Columbia slipped on water that was on 
the floor because there was a leak in the roof. He sued the 
government, won and taxpayers chipped in $20,000 to this prisoner 
who had obviously been convicted of a crime, had done something 
wrong to society, but he was not being punished. He was being 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6849"> 6849 </A></B>
<P>
rewarded. He was playing racquetball. Then he took it to the 
Canadian public again, and got $20,000.
<P>
	Does this legislation do anything to prevent that from 
happening? I do not see anything about that in here. The 
government's agenda is completely disconnected from the 
Canadian agenda. I do not care what party members come from. 
When they go to the doors of Canadians, first of all a lot of them 
are afraid to come to the door because there is so much crime out 
there. They do not know who is at the door. But when members do 
get a chance to talk to them they say the government has got to do 
something.
<P>
	In three years the justice minister has done absolutely nothing to 
deal with the serious issues. It has all been window dressing.
<P>
	The justice minister comes across as very sincere. That is a 
wonderful skill for a politician. However, it takes more than words 
to convince Canadians that the government cares about the havoc 
that is being wreaked on Canadian lives. It takes more than words. 
What we want is action.
<P>
	I do not want to just talk about some of the things the 
government has done wrong. I want to introduce some ideas. 
Perhaps this would be an idea for the government when it brings 
down its next legislation so that it starts to take more seriously the 
concerns that Canadian have. Bill C-42 certainly does not address 
anything that Canadians are truly concerned about.
<P>
	This place would be greatly impoverished if I did not take a 
chance right now to quote from Reform's fresh start for Canadians 
so that I can point out some of the things that the government 
should be doing.
<P>
	A Reform government would enact a victims' bill of rights 
which puts the rights of law-abiding Canadians ahead of criminals. 
What a radical idea, putting the rights of victims and citizens ahead 
of criminals. Too bad Bill C-42 does not do that.
<P>
	The Reform Party would reform criminal justice to provide safer 
communities, safer streets and safer homes. We would have bars on 
prison windows instead of bars on the homes of ordinary citizens. 
What a crazy idea. Too bad the government has not thought of it 
yet.
<P>
	We would hold a binding national referendum on the return of 
capital punishment. As I pointed out a minute ago, right after the 
Bernardo trial, a poll was taken and something like 70 per cent of 
Canadians said: ``We want to see a return to capital punishment''. I 
think the people deserve to have their voices heard. We are trying 
to allow that to happen right now. It should happen in the form of a 
national referendum.
<P>
	We would repeal the Liberals' costly firearms registry, Bill 
C-68, and replace it with meaningful laws to fight the criminal 
misuse of firearms. I mentioned it a minute ago but it is such a 
good statistic I think it bears repeating. The hon. member for Wild 
Rose said in a speech here in Ottawa the other night that if we could 
replace the registry and use that money for something else it would 
allow us to put 20,000 police back on the beat in Canada. Can you 
imagine how much safer our communities would be having 20,000 
more police out there?
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	One thing we want to do and which is mentioned in our fresh 
start program is reform the parole system and abolish early release 
for first degree murderers. What a revelation. I am sure my Liberal 
colleagues across the way would be amazed to hear such talk. 
Imagine abolishing the chance of parole for first degree murders. 
What a wonderful idea.
<P>
	We would replace the Young Offenders Act with measures that 
hold young criminals accountable for their actions. There has been 
a dramatic increase in youth crime. The Liberals have tried it their 
way and it does not work. Reform's fresh start would make it 
happen.
<P>
	Finally, we would pursue crime prevention through social 
policies that strengthen families and communities. That is a debate 
for another day, but I could speak for a long time on that issue 
alone.
<P>
	Suffice to say that Bill C-42 has nothing to do with the agenda of 
ordinary Canadians. Despite the fact that the government has been 
in power for three years, it has failed completely to deal with issues 
that Canadians are truly concerned about. I would encourage 
people in the House and across the country who are listening to 
consider the Reform Party fresh start because I believe it deals with 
the concerns of ordinary Canadians in a way that the Liberal 
government policies do not and would truly make them feel safer in 
their homes and communities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to pick up on some comments that were made 
in the debate with respect to what I think is an untruth. I would use 
a much stronger word, but I cannot according to rules of the 
Chamber.
<P>
	It is simply untrue that the Prime Minister has threatened not to 
sign nomination papers simply because people-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Tell it to the press. Tell it to the press.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> How do you know?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Patience, gentlemen. It is simply untrue that he 
said that. I really resent the fact that the party that claims to speak 
for Canadians and which believes in truth, should actually purvey 
something which is absolutely untrue.
<P>
	Let us compare for a second the party discipline of the Reform 
Party and the Liberals. It is true that in the Liberal Party and the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6850"> 6850 </A></B>
<P>
Liberal caucus there has been  dissent. It is true that this dissent has 
occurred during bills like the gun control bill.
<P>
	I would remind members of the Reform Party that the nine 
people who voted against the bill got very minimum discipline.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Minimum? Minimum?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> He does not even understand the problem. He does 
not have a clue. I do not believe it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Why should there be any discipline?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, you see, this is the party that cannot 
allow another member to speak.
<P>
	There are many members in the Liberal caucus like myself who 
have voted against bills, motions and amendments in the House. I 
have voted against a bill at second and third readings.
<P>
	I was not banished from my party and I received no threats about 
my nomination. In fact, I continue to believe that I am highly 
regarded by the Prime Minister and by my colleagues. I simply 
voted against a motion that I believed was wrong. I voted my 
conscience. I voted for my constituents. I voted what Reformers 
claim they do, but do not do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> You will be disciplined.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Many of my colleagues have done the same thing 
because the Liberal caucus and party accepts what we are MPs who 
sometimes must act on our conscience. There has been no 
discipline, no banishing to the back of the bus, as has been the case 
with the Reform Party.
<P>
	If we make a comparison, we find that the member for 
Athabasca, the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan have been 
thrown out of the caucus.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West): </B>What about the member for 
York South-Weston? Where is he today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> The member for York South-Weston did leave the 
Liberal caucus. But I would point out that he voted against a 
confidence motion and he personally attacked a minister of the 
government. He also played to the press. We are a party and a 
caucus where if a member has reason for dissent, if a member acts 
according to his or her conscience and does not go directly to the 
press, then they remain a member in good standing.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I accept that 
the member can make comments, but I am looking for a question. 
As we get close to the end of the 10-minute period, I see no 
question coming.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There are comments and questions. Both are 
legitimate. However, I know in my heart that the hon. member is 
coming to his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If my colleagues in the 
Reform Party would just give me the opportunity to pose the 
question I shall.
<P>
	I remind the Reform Party that it banished two members from its 
caucus for speaking out and later lost a member entirely. It 
banished the member for Calgary Southeast entirely. Seven MPs 
will be resigning, all because of the form of party discipline that the 
leader of the Reform Party imposes.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member for Medicine Hat-
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order. The hon. member is stating something that is not true. The 
last individual he was talking about, who he said was banished, that 
is not true.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are going to take that question right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is simple. Is the Reform 
Party not the party of the iron fist? Is this not the party of 
punishment? Is this not the party of intolerance when it comes to 
dissent among members of its caucus?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is complete nonsense. I point 
out, as the member acknowledges, members in his party have been 
disciplined and kicked off committees. They have been warned that 
if they do not go along with legislation they will be kicked out of 
the party and will not have their nomination papers signed.
<P>
	I also want to point out that it has been the Reform Party that has 
led the way in introducing parliamentary reform by allowing our 
members to speak up for their constituents. Our members stand up 
and vote for their constituents and have done so on numerous 
pieces of legislation. No one sees our leader saying that our 
members are not allowed to do that. Absolutely not. In fact I would 
argue that the Reform Party, of all parties, has introduced the whole 
notion of parliamentary democracy and democratic change. 
Hopefully some day the iron fist in the Liberal Party-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wish I had been here earlier. It sounds like it's a 
good one.
<P>
	Not that I want to cut this off but it is almost two o'clock. I am 
going to stick around after question period because I want to hear 
the rest of it. We will go to Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte, Lib.):</B>

special volunteer from my riding, Mrs. Doreen Janes of Corner

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6851"> 6851 </A></B>
<P>
	Recently Mrs. Janes was selected to receive a Canada Volunteer 
Award Certificate of Merit. This award recognizes her 
involvement with the Huntington's Society of Canada since 1980.
<P>
	Mrs. Janes lost her loving husband to this terrible neurological 
disease. Since that time she has been involved in numerous 
community events, leading the fight against Huntington's disease. 
Her unselfish work and dedication have helped rebuild the local 
chapter of the Huntington's Society. Doreen has enlisted family, 
friends and anyone who shared her genuine interest to donate their 
time to this deserving cause.
<P>
	The local chapter is now able to provide a network of 
educational resources to persons affected by the disease and to their 
families. She continues to make herself available to sit down and 
talk to all those affected. Doreen shows us why Canada is one of the 
greatest countries in the world.

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today I want to speak briefly to the issue of child poverty.
<P>
	Recently the Liberals have awakened to the human consequence 
of their misguided social and fiscal policies of the last quarter 
century: hungry children, fractured homes and hopeless youth.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	A federal debt of over $600 billion is not just a number. It is $26 
billion in increased annual tax grabs since the last election. It is an 
average family with $3,000 less than in 1993 to meet their needs. It 
is skyrocketing divorce, unchecked poverty, teen suicides and 
violence. It is the working poor working poorer.
<P>
	More money and more Liberal programs with more bureaucracy 
will only perpetuate the failure.
<P>
	Reform policies will leave hard earned money where it belongs, 
in the hands of families. Reform policies will remove over one 
million Canadians from the tax rolls altogether. Reform policies 
will allow parents to direct their attention to their children instead 
of the tax man.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Amnesty International has just released its report on the human 
rights situation in Turkey.
<P>
	According to the report, since the early 1990s the number of 
violations of fundamental rights in that country has multiplied, the 
excuse being national security. Extrajudicial executions, 
disappearances, torture and the repression of freedom of expression 
have become widespread in Turkey. This is an intolerable situation.
<P>
	I therefore wish to ask the Canadian government to act as a 
responsible member of the international community and put 
pressure on the Turkish government to respect international law on 
fundamental rights, legislation which it freely ratified as indicated 
in its own Turkish legislation. Canada has, in any case, a duty to 
promote respect for human rights.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at a national child welfare conference in Ottawa 
yesterday, Premier Roy Romanow and the province of 
Saskatchewan were acknowledged as leaders in caring for our 
nation's children.
<P>
	In the words of the award presented to the premier, 
Saskatchewan was acknowledged for its commitment to investing 
in children as a key priority and a co-ordinated approach to policy 
development and delivery.
<P>
	We are very proud of our province, our provincial party and our 
provincial premier.
<P>
	Members may remember that in 1989 a resolution brought 
forward by then NDP federal leader Ed Broadbent to eliminate 
poverty by the year 2000 was passed unanimously in this House. 
Since then 46 per cent more children are living below the poverty 
line, a shameful illustration of the failure of this government to act 
on one of this country's most critical issues.
<P>
	In congratulating Premier Romanow and the province of 
Saskatchewan, I also encourage the federal government to follow 
Saskatchewan's lead and make the elimination of child poverty a 
priority and begin that effort today.

the Sky Hawks. This team gave an outstanding performance at the 
198th Permanent Joint Board on Defence meeting in Trenton. 
Indeed everyone was impressed with the show, including the 
audience from the United States. I was particularly pleased to see 
the Canadian flag on the team's parachutes which symbolizes our 
Canadian pride.

constituent of Niagara Falls. On December 1, 1996 she will 
officially receive the Gabrielle Léger award for her work in 
preserving a significant part of the historical Lundy's Lane 
Battlefield site.
<P>
	Miss Redmond was educated at Queen's University and has had 
a long and honourable career as a teacher, serving at Stamford 
Collegiate in Niagara Falls from 1926 until her retirement in 1967. 
Among the many students who considered Miss Redmond a mentor 
was Judy LaMarsh, former Liberal member of Parliament for 
Niagara Falls and a former federal cabinet minister.
<P>
	The Gabrielle Léger award, given under the patronage of Madam 
Gabrielle Léger, wife of the late Governor General Jules Léger, is 
the highest award given by the Heritage Canada Foundation.

	I am proud to say that the crew members of the Hercules 311 
which rescued a crew member aboard a Danish fishing vessel on 
November 12 were dispatched from CFB Greenwood 14th Wing in 
my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants. Members of this crew 
braved frigid temperatures and blizzard conditions in order to

	I also want to recognize the work of the crew members aboard 
the Canadian forces Griffon helicopter that crashed, and their 
rescuers who are also from CFB Greenwood 14th Wing, for their 
bravery in the face of tremendous adversity.

disturbed by the intransigence of the Israeli Prime Minister. This 
week he again defied the Palestinians and the international 
community by going to the Jewish settlements on the West Bank to 
support their plans for expansion. Such plans are a real time bomb.
<P>
	Instead of taking serious risks by pursuing a policy of 
confrontation, Prime Minister Netanyahu ought to speed up 
negotiations relating to the peace process and wind up the talks on 
the Israeli withdrawal from Hebron.
<P>
	We hope that this new episode, which comes after the tunnel in 
Jerusalem, will not trigger a new wave of violence. The Canadian 
government should openly condemn this behaviour by the Israeli 
authorities.

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, why 
is it that Canadians are forced to put up with the elites of this 
country deciding what is good for us? We saw it when the Tories 
brought in the GST; people we elected to represent us said: ``We 
don't care about your objections. This is good for you and we are 
voting for it''.
<P>
	This Prime Minister has followed that elitist tradition. For 
example, he intends to grant one of our provinces distinct society 
status even though that would go against the wishes of the majority 
of Canadians.
<P>
	Now in the case of Canadian Airlines we have some of the union 
elites taking hefty dues from workers, then arrogantly telling them 
that workers are not capable of deciding what is in their own best 
interest. The CAW and CUPE members of Canadian Airlines 
should be allowed to decide for themselves whether the 
restructuring plan is good for them and their families.
<P>
	The old way of thinking is to have elites tell us what is good for 
us. The new way of thinking, the Reform way of thinking, is to give 
Canadians more say, be it in the union halls or in the Parliament of 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
co-op housing in Canada has a long and successful history. This

families their only realistic opportunity to buy and own their own 
home. In  the city of London and in my riding of London-Middle-

sex, co-op housing is the best solution to the housing needs of 
many of my constituents.
<P>
	For many years the federal Government of Canada has played a 
vital leadership role in ensuring this important housing option is 
available to Canadians. As the provinces of Canada seek to assume 
the lead role in the field of housing, it is absolutely necessary that 
the federal government retain some involvement. My constituents 
feel that consistent and acceptable national standards in co-op 
housing will only be assured if the federal government maintains a 
presence in this vital field.
<P>
	The irresponsible attacks on the health care system by the 
governments of Alberta and Ontario have caused serious concerns 
that the next victim of the right wing slashers will be co-op 
housing. This government must never let that happen.

World AIDS Day will further our awareness of AIDS. I hope in

research through its national AIDS strategy. With the assistance of 
this government initiative, drugs such as lamivudine, or 3TC, have

to speak about the great things that are happening in Elliot Lake in 
my northern Ontario riding of Algoma. Known as the jewel in the 
wilderness, Elliot Lake has undergone an amazing transformation 
in the past few years, moving from a city dependent on uranium 
mining to one with a diverse economy, a growing population and a 
renewed sense of optimism.
<P>
	Innovative efforts like the ongoing mine decommissioning 
research and Elliot Lake's retirement living program, which has 
attracted thousands of new residents to the area, have heralded the 
dawn of a new day for Elliot Lake.
<P>
	Due to focused and concerted efforts on the part of Mayor 
George Farkouh, Elliot Lake city council and other community 
leaders, a number of promising economic diversification initiatives 
have been launched which should attract new and promising 
enterprises to the area.
<P>
	We must build upon the successes to date to ensure this positive 
trend continues. I call upon both levels of government and the 
mining companies which benefited for so many years from 
operations in Elliot Lake to continue their commitment to work 
with the community to reach its goal of long term economic 
stability.

parents and a number of stakeholders met in Ottawa this week to 
attend a conference on the children of Canada as the future of this 
country. In doing so, these people want to reiterate their 
commitment to the children and young people of Quebec and 
Canada and promote ways to create a better environment for their 
development.
<P>
	At the same time, an entirely different event is taking place in 
Toronto, which also affects children. I am referring to the Canadian 
conference on young people as consumers. A major objective of 
this conference is to help companies sell their products to young 
people.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois agrees with the position taken by teachers 
and parents who object to the philosophy behind this conference.
<P>
	We condemn this marketing strategy which is targeted to 
vulnerable children. We cannot let all the values of our society be 
subordinated to the sole concept of profit.

Ursel to two years less a day conditional sentence, no jail time, and 
three years probation.

	Judge Boyle sent some clear messages to criminals: in rape cases

Canada never provided a more conducive environment for

<P>
	Generally speaking, we are very pleased with the report. We only 
hope that the Government of Quebec will put an end to the 
uncertainty generated by its separatist project, so that Quebec can 
also benefit from the investments that the Japanese are about to 
make in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Transport made a last minute offer 
yesterday evening to save Canadian Airlines from financial 
disaster. He is apparently prepared to provide a rebate on fuel taxes.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Could the Minister of 
Finance tell us whether the jet fuel tax rebate the Minister of 
Transport refers to is just for companies in financial difficulty, as 
we first learned?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this gives me the opportunity to 
announce that the government has remained consistent with its 
message that there will be no bailout of Canadian Airlines. The 
government has come forward with a tax rebate program on fuel for 
the aviation industry. It will allow carriers which have significant 
losses over a number of years to claim rebates against aviation fuel 
taxes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the process is a rather odd one. Usually, the Minister of 
Finance announces reductions or increases in taxes. Things seem, 
shall I say, a bit in disarray in the government. It was much the 
same thing in the case of cigarettes and the Minister of Health, until 
the Minister of Finance set him straight. Perhaps he will have to set 
his colleague in transport straight. I nevertheless have a question 
for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Given how easy it is for a company to post a deficit using certain 
accounting practices, would the Minister of Finance not agree that 
a program like this, intended solely for companies that show an 
operating deficit, might encourage all Canadian airlines to show a 
deficit through the use of certain accounting tricks in order to 
benefit from a substantial reduction in fuel tax too? Does this 
measure make any sense?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6855"> 6855 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will first address the subject of 
procedure that the hon. member raised. When the Minister of 
Transport is busy doing his job across the country, and in this case 
in British Columbia facilitating discussions on all sides in the 
Canadian Airlines dilemma, then it falls to the duty of the 
parliamentary secretary to answer the questions in the House of 
Commons and I have the privilege to do that.
<P>
	On the issue of substance in the hon. member's question, it is 
important to understand that there are still some details to be 
worked out on the aviation fuel tax rebate. Quite frankly that rebate 
will only apply if certain conditions are met.
<P>
	As we have stressed day after day for the last month, there will 
be no bailout from the federal government for Canadian Airlines. 
The conditions are that the British Columbia government and the 
Alberta government come on board. Just yesterday the Minister of 
Transport congratulated Premier Ralph Klein for coming on board 
on that restructuring plan. Of course the Canadian Airlines family, 
that is the company and the union membership have to come on 
board. That entails all six unions. Finally, American Airlines and 
the creditors to the airline also have to be part of the restructuring 
package.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is absolutely incredible that companies showing a 
deficit will enjoy a partial reduction in taxes. Is this not 
encouraging companies to show a year end deficit, to show they are 
in the red, so they can enjoy the government's generosity?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance not agree that this makes no sense 
and that the solution for the airlines has to be much more thought 
out, much more credible-one that could resolve the problem and 
not create perhaps another ten more?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this government believes that our 
two national airlines are of major national significance and 
importance. Quite frankly, they are equal.
<P>
	Maybe I could put it into a better perspective for the leader of the 
Bloc. Most of us in the House have children. I have two daughters 
and I consider both of them to be equal, but they have individual 
and different needs.
<P>
	In this situation, I find the questions from the opposition 
member rather hypocritical because quite frankly they have distinct 
needs.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would ask you to please stay away 
from terms like hypocritical. They sort of stir up our emotions in 
here, and we do not need that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, we learned that the premier of British Columbia was 
in Dallas for a meeting with American Airlines officials to explore 
the possibility of American buying a larger share of Canadian 
Airlines International.
<P>
	Did the BC premier receive the assurance of the federal 
government that increasing the foreign ownership of Canadian 
would not be a problem?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to the best of my knowledge we are 
unaware of the discussion that took place between the Premier 
Clark and the president of American Airlines. No foreign 
investment discussion has been initiated or requested by Canadian 
Airlines to the Minister of Transport.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how can the Minister of Industry regard a merger between 
Air Canada and Canadian Airlines as an insult to western Canada 
when his own government does not see any problem with American 
Airlines taking over Canadian Airlines?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government refuses to get into 
a dialogue that the hon. member wants to draw us into because we 
believe that Canadian is going to become a viable, strong airline in 
this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are pleased to see that the federal government has 
indirectly lowered the aviation fuel tax for Canadian Airlines. We 
disagree with the way that it has been done, but we do think it is a 
step in the right direction. And if it is done, it should save Canadian 
about $20 million a year in the short term.
<P>
	The other stumbling block, as members know, to the 
restructuring of Canadian Airlines is that the leadership of the 
CAW and CUPE will not let their members vote on the company's 
restructuring proposal.
<P>
	Every Canadian employee should have the basic democratic 
right to vote on their own future and the futures of their families.
<P>
	My question is to the parliamentary secretary. Does the 
government agree that Canadian's employees, in particular the 
members 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6856"> 6856 </A></B>
<P>
of the CAW and CUPE, should  be permitted to vote directly on the 
company's restructuring proposal?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yes we do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are glad to hear that. Flight attendants and ticketing 
agents at Canadian are demanding a vote on the company's 
restructuring proposals but their own union bosses are refusing to 
let them exercise their democratic right.
<P>
	Buzz Hargrove does not work at Canadian. He does not have a 
personal stake in whether the airline succeeds or fails and he does 
not appear to care. Canadian employees must have the final say on 
their own jobs and the future of their airline.
<P>
	Since the parliamentary secretary said he agrees the employees 
have this right, what specific action is the government taking to 
ensure that Canadian's employees will be able to vote directly on 
the company's restructuring proposals?
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess the hon. leader of the third 
party was listening to the same interview as I was listening to this 
morning on ``Newsworld''. We probably heard the same thing, that 
some of the employees were talking about how they have been 
trying to contact their leadership at the Canadian auto workers.
<P>
	First, the CUPE employees have been told apparently that they 
will be able to have their vote on December 7. They believe that is 
too late and they would like to get on with the opportunity of voting 
tomorrow if possible.
<P>
	Mr. Hargrove's job is not on the line, according to the employee 
on ``Newsworld'' this morning, that he is ignoring the facts, he has 
not done the due diligence search on the books of Canadian that the 
pilots union and the largest union, the machinists union, have done. 
They say that the threat is real. Mr. Hargrove is doing what he is 
doing despite the fact that quite apparently his membership wants 
the opportunity to have that vote on this restructuring package.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question is not whether this position is the position of 
the employees. My question was what is the government going to 
do about it to ensure that their rights are exercised.
<P>
	There is a section in the Canadian Labour Code, section 108.1, 
that authorizes the Minister of Labour to direct that a vote of the 
employees be held on a collective bargaining agreement offer by an 
employer if it is deemed to be in the public interest.
<P>
	Surely it is in the public interest that Canadian Airlines 
employees be permitted to vote directly on a restructuring 
proposal, but that it does not appear to be covered by the code.
<P>
	We and the employees of Canadian would appreciate a direct 
answer to this question. Would the government be willing to 
introduce forthwith an amendment authorizing the Minister of 
Labour to direct an employee vote on restructuring offers such as 
that being put forward by Canadian Airlines to its own employees?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is not regular collective bargaining. Therefore the 
section the member refers to in the Labour Code does not apply in 
this case.
<P>
	This is a negotiation between the two parties. Therefore the 
Minister of Labour has no authority to intervene. It is up to 
management and the unions to decide and find the necessary 
procedure to have a vote on this matter.
<P>
	However, if both parties would like me to intervene, on their 
request I would be glad to and I am ready to appoint a mediator so 
they can facilitate their negotiations.

	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	We have just learned that the space agency chairman, Mr. Evans, 
is claiming monthly rental fees of $1,300 for a luxurious apartment 
in Montreal. In addition, Mr. Evans has the use of an official car to 
travel between Saint-Hubert and Montreal on a regular basis.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister confirm that, while all 
employees of the space agency are required to live in Montreal, the 
agency chairman does not, although he is provided with a $1,300 a 
month apartment at taxpayers' expense?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
true that relocated employees usually have the option of changing 
their place of residence. But the Treasury Board manual does 
provide for some exceptions on the basis of a number of objective 
factors that I would like to outline.
<P>
	Under section 5.9.1 of the personnel management manual, there 
are cases in which employees are required to live outside their 
metropolitan or headquarters area for a number of months or years. 
The Deputy Minister must consider all aspects of the employee's 
situation, including the length of stay, family considerations, 
whether the employee rents or owns, to determine if it is practical, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6857"> 6857 </A></B>
<P>
more economical and less disruptive for the family to help the 
employee maintain a second residence or to authorize relocation.
<P>
	In this case, relocation costs would have been much higher than 
the rental subsidy.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, why is it then 
that all other employees are required to live in Montreal, save one, 
a former advisor to the Minister of Industry, namely Mr. Evans, 
who receives special compensation? This is outrageous, especially 
since Mr. Evans earns between $117,000 and $142,000 a year.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I 
just said, this is not a special situation. There is a Treasury Board 
regulation authorizing the Deputy Minister to make a choice and 
determine the employee's conditions of employment.
<P>
	In this case, not only must the employee work in Ottawa two 
days a week, but his spouse works in Ottawa and they have young 
children. There is no doubt in my mind that the Treasury Board 
policy was properly interpreted and applied.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to follow up on the question from the leader of the 
Reform Party to the Minister of Labour which the Minister of 
Labour did not answer.
<P>
	The Reform Party has offered to facilitate the government's 
passing amendments immediately and as quickly as possible to 
extend the provisions of the Canada Labour Code that allow a 
democratic vote of the workers of Canadian on the offer of the 
management on the basis of public interest.
<P>
	There are provisions in the code right now that are too narrow for 
that but we would certainly be willing to extend them to these 
circumstances. Would the Minister of Labour be prepared to do that 
forthwith?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, right now there is a labour code that has been in the county 
for over 20 years. I would like to remind the member that we are in 
the process of amending the existing legislation which is before the 
committee. Therefore we are following the regular process.
<P>
	Let me remind this House that what we are arguing about is not a 
collective bargaining system that we know and that we are trying to 
improve. Restructuring a company is a business transaction and 
both parties should  find a way to reach an agreement without the 
government's having to intervene all of the time.
<P>
	I am surprised that the Reform Party would ask such a question 
when not long ago the critic of labour for the Reform Party said that 
we should get rid of the Minister of Labour and any labour 
department. Now it is asking the Minister of Labour to intervene 
right away. Those members should make up their minds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
we are asking for is for the employees of Canadian Airlines 
themselves to be able to intervene in their own future rather than 
take the 100 per cent pay cut that some of their union leaders seem 
to want them to take.
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that we have a public and pressing 
interest here? We do not have time for the games. The future of the 
company and jobs are at stake. We do not have time for a lengthy 
mediation. Will he introduce in this House legislation that will 
allow the workers to speak on their own economic future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in case the Reform members did not understand, I will 
repeat this is not a collective agreement negotiation. This is a 
restructuring business plan. I do not think it is the business of the 
government to interfere in the relationship between the 
membership of the unions and its leadership. Let the membership 
take care of its own leadership problems.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Monday, in the House, I asked the Minister to tell us when the 
new employment insurance regulations would be ready and 
available. He replied, and I quote: ``I looked, among other things, 
at some interpretation documents concerning the act that will 
ensure everyone can properly inform beneficiaries in the coming 
weeks''.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	In light of the serious consequences that the new employment 
insurance provisions taking effect January 5 can have for 
unemployed workers, can the Minister of Human Resources 
Development tell us when the regulations will be ready, and 
whether they will include transitional measures?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we will shortly be making some 
very minor administrative changes to the regulations. Now, I would 
like to reassure the opposition that these changes will in no way 
affect service to our clients and that the regulations will be 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6858"> 6858 </A></B>
<P>
communicated to our offices promptly. But the changes are 
extremely minor and will not affect service to clients.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
interpretation document the minister has referred to, the following 
appears, and I quote: ``For claims effective January 5, 1997 or later, 
a minimum of 910 hours of work is required'' to qualify, in other 
words, an increase from 26 15-hour weeks to 26 35-hour weeks. 
For the average person, this is a huge difference.
<P>
	On January 5, will the minister enforce the legislation as it 
stands, or will there be transitional measures softening the blow for 
the average person?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have already explained on a 
number of occasions in the House that the system was of course 
going to come into effect at the beginning of January, as scheduled. 
Certain workers will, of course, receive less coverage, but those 
working under 15 hours will now be covered.
<P>
	There are people who, until now, were caught in a cycle-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> That is not what we are talking about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Be serious for once.

why the opposition does not want to hear the answer. They are

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> That is not what we are asking.

January. Interpretation measures have already been communicated

children living below the poverty level. The government's action in 
this area is a miserable failure.

somewhat offensive rhetoric, considering the great importance of 
child poverty, but this is no laughing matter.
<P>
	What took place yesterday was a remarkable consensus between 
the provinces and the federal government. What we have done 
today is serious work, not petty rhetoric. The Government of 
Canada has doubled the income supplement for low income 
families. We have introduced an employment insurance program 
which includes measures to put Canadians back to work faster and 
to protect low income recipients with children.
<P>
	Our government spends $5 billion a year on Canada's children. 
That is what we are doing.

	Last year the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the Tobacco

Canadians and the tobacco industry?

	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	We were told when Canada signed the softwood lumber deal 
with the United States that it was because the industry wanted it. 
However, there is growing evidence that lumber companies are 
unhappy with this deal. Many companies are facing bankruptcy 
because of inadequate or no quota. Others are facing shutdown and 
job losses, all at the same time that the government is realizing 
increased taxes through penalties charged on softwood lumber 
companies.
<P>
	When will the government admit it was wrong to accept the 
export caps and scrap the softwood lumber deal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member should know that a better rendering of 
the history of the agreement on softwood lumber would 
demonstrate that it was arrived at through a full, deep and engaging 
consultation with all the softwood lumber firms that closed. The 
proposals that were put on the table were really a product of the 
companies themselves.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
sure who the trade minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
were consulting, but it certainly was not the hundreds of companies 
that are feeding information to us that they are in serious trouble 
because of this deal.
<P>
	A recent survey we conducted shows the industry is ready to 
fight this case instead of living with the quota system. They want 
the government to scrap this deal and if the United States 
countervails us, to fight this at the World Trade Organization. Will 
the minister commit to that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no question that the establishment of a quota 
system put limits on the amount that could be exported to the 
United States; limits that were at historically high levels.
<P>
	Many of the companies went ahead and used up their full quota 
before the year was out. The minister has already put in place a 
reserve bank which companies can draw on to increase their 
production.
<P>
	The reality is that the provincial governments that were involved 
representing the lumber interests, the companies and the industry 
affiliations were all deeply involved in coming up with a plan. 
They cannot change their mind half way through the course. They 
have to live with the consequences because it was their decision to 
make.

	The Program for Older Worker Adjustment, funded jointly by

the provinces that POWA will end on March 31, 1977. Ottawa will 
accept no new applications, but has agreed to honour its financial 
obligations in cases currently being processed.
<P>
	Knowing that the workers of the Peerless company, considered 
eligible for the POWA program by the Canada-Quebec joint 
analysis committee, are still awaiting their benefits because Ottawa 
is refusing to release the funds, would the minister confirm that 
applications made by older workers between the announcement of

<P>
the government's withdrawal from this program and March 31,

<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

totally inappropriate introduction by the opposition member on my 
lack of compassion for children. I can tell you that yesterday was a 
great day for children in Canada and I am delighted to have been 
part of it, despite the rhetoric the other side takes such pleasure in.
<P>
	The federal-provincial program you mention was so successful 
that its budget was used up much more quickly than planned. It is 
also a fact that not all provinces participated and that certain 
provinces do not want us to continue.
<P>
	I too am concerned about the future of POWA. It is however a 
program that will have to be terminated. In the coming years, the 
less populous provinces-

québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre, the SQDM, has 
already set money aside, more than 500 workers currently eligible 
for the program will be deprived of benefits because he is not 
honouring his financial commitment to POWA? That is the reality.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, would the Government of 
Quebec like to continue the program? It would be interesting to 
find out. What I can say is that up to now only the more populous 
provinces have agreed to take part and that the less populous 
regions have been put at a disadvantage by the system.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is trying to find another way to help 
older workers, which will be fairer to all regions, because too many 
of them are not participating in the system at the moment.

because of the softwood lumber deal negotiated with the United 
States, U.S. lumber companies are reaping huge profits from 
increased lumber prices. Meanwhile, Canadians are losing sawmill 
jobs.
<P>
	American consumers want this bad deal cancelled because 
according to the American National Association of Home Builders, 
the deal is costing Americans $3,000 more to build a house. 
Canadians want the deal cancelled because mills are forced to shut 
down, costing Canadian jobs.
<P>
	The only group benefiting from this softwood lumber deal is the 
American lumber lobby, the same group the government caved in 
to during negotiations.
<P>
	Will the minister take steps to immediately cancel the softwood 
lumber deal with the United States?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

earning export markets in Canada. It is simply a recommendation 
of lunacy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister should listen to my colleagues on this side: 600 jobs in one 
riding, 400 jobs in another riding. If chaos is being introduced, he 
has introduced it. Cancel the lumber deal. Cancel it now.
<P>

outburst.
<P>
	However, I remind him that this is a multi-billion dollar industry 
which provides hundreds of thousands of jobs. To provide an 
orderly arrangement with our largest customer requires us to play 
by the rules. We know that the Reform Party is not used to playing 
by the rules. They do not even know there are rules.

	If we are going to protect the industry and protect the jobs, we 
must make sure that the rules are honoured. Those rules were

<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

about official languages generated by the Government of Canada's 
proposal for an expanded role for the provinces in the design and

	I am very confident that the necessary safeguards have been put 
in place to ensure the linguistic needs of Canadians will be met

demand for that assistance in that language, no matter who delivers 
the program''.

<P>
	Last Wednesday, in response to a question about the Singer 
company, the minister claimed that lawyers from the department 
were engaged in talks and would be reporting to him by the end of

Clearly the minister spends too much time talking and not enough

<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

on the Singer company which I have not had time to read yet. In 
fact, what I spent too much time doing was discussing child 
poverty with the provinces all day yesterday in the council of 
federal and provincial ministers, all of which took place in a great 
spirit of co-operation.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	I can assure you that was the situation I talked about all day. Our 
department is very active, since the recommendation is on my 
desk, and I will look at it within the next few hours.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
minister confirmed what I just said. He spends his time talking and 
does not spend enough time on his files. That is what he does.
<P>
	This case has been dragging on for years. Three ministers have 
succeeded each other in this position in three years, and none of 
them bothered to pay any real attention to this case, and the present 
minister is no better than his predecessors.
<P>
	The minister wastes his time moralizing and showing how 
compassionate he is, but what explanation does he have for his lack 
of consideration towards a group of retired employees who were 
given a raw deal and whose average age is 80?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, precisely because I wanted to 
spend some time on this case, on the substance of the case.
<P>
	It has now been seven weeks since I became Minister of Human 
Resources Development. We are busy with negotiations on the 
transfer of manpower programs, as well as with the social union 
and the ministerial council. So when people say I waste my time 
talking, they are wrong. When I do say something, it has to be to 
the point. That is probably what bothers them. They do not like it 
when I talk, because we are working on co-operation.

because these workers deserve more than pretty speeches, we will

there was kind of a sordid little deal at work this last week. A

Support Corp., that asks its employees to give over $1,000 each to 
the Liberal Party. In return the company would give a bonus to 
cover the donation, the employees get their money back, plus a tax 
credit from Elections Canada. The company gets to write off the 
bonuses as a business expense and the taxpayer gets the shaft.
<P>
	This has broken in the news. The company has since withdrawn 
the offer and returned the cheques.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister agree that this type of activity is 
unethical and what steps will she take to make sure that this type of 
activity is not only unethical but will be illegal in the future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government in no way supports or condones this type of 
scheme. The government was not aware of it before it came into the 
press. Revenue Canada has already said it considers this scheme 
improper and the company has called it off.
<P>
	I am advised that amendments to the law are not required 
because the law currently says very clearly that this should not be 
done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> The company is 
certainly fortunate that it broke in the news if that is the case.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	I have spoken to officials in Elections Canada and the elections 
act apparently does not prohibit this type of activity. I would like 
the minister to consider that.
<P>
	This type of behaviour is also coercive toward employees. It 
forces employees to make a choice. The boss says give donations to 
the Liberal Party and it is written between the lines-you can read 
it-your future depends on it.
<P>
	This company received over $1 million in federal contracts. The 
president of the corporation paid tens of thousands of dollars to the 
Liberal Party. This thing stinks to high heaven and the minister 
knows it.
<P>
	How can the minister make sure that this sort of thing does not 
happen and what steps will he take to make sure it will not happen 
in the future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the election expenses provision of the law is administered by 
Revenue Canada, as I understand it, when it comes to the matter of 
income tax receipts and deductions. I am advised that Revenue 
Canada considers the practice in question improper. They intend to 
monitor these situations very carefully to help ensure they are not 
repeated.
<P>
	As I have said, I am advised that amendments to the law are not 
necessary. It is very clear that this type of scheme is not supported

my budget as an MP to support my wife in a school board election

<P>
	For one thing, my wife's name has never been mentioned in any

heard of the statement I found to be legitimate. She did not use any 
unparliamentary language.

	Statements by members are opinions of one member speaking in 
the House according to the fact as she knows them. I heard the hon.

inexact and of course when one hon. member stands in this place 
we take his or her word on the facts.
<P>
	However, perhaps in my leniency because I want to clear this up, 
I made the decision and I have given my decision that it is not a 
point of privilege. At that point, the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie rose to his feet and he did use language 
which was unparliamentary.
<P>
	This Speaker does not judge the content of any statements that 
are made here, but you have given the responsibility to your

we feel we should, otherwise we will act like her.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUSINESSOFTHEHOUSE">BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am asking the government what is on its legislative 
agenda for the coming days.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
will continue this afternoon with the business already listed. 
Tomorrow will be the day allotted for final consideration of the 
third reading stage of Bill C-29.
<P>
	Next week it will be December which means that there are only 
two weeks until the date on which this House is scheduled to begin 
its year end adjournment. In order to be helpful to the House, I wish 
to indicate our priorities for this period.
<P>
	On Monday at noon the government shall propose concurrence 
in a number of notices of way and means. It appears that it will be 
necessary for the House to consider again in accordance with 
section 47 of the Constitution Act 1982 the resolution regarding the 
terms of union with Newfoundland. This will be the subject of 
debate on Monday.
<P>
	Among the bills to be introduced on Monday on the basis of the 
notice of ways and means will be the bill regarding sales tax 
harmonization. It is our intention to commence debate on second 
reading of this bill on Tuesday.
<P>
	Early next week we expect the report of the finance committee 
on its prebudget consultations. As usual we intend to set aside two 
days for a prebudget debate.
<P>
	Those are our three priorities for December. As hon. members 
know, there is a long list of 32 bills awaiting consideration, 
including 14 bills in committee and nine bills at report stage or at 
third reading. Whenever we have the time during the next two 
weeks, we will also attempt to make progress on these measures 
and we will encourage the committees to attempt to do the same.
<P>
	I am saying this not as a form of pressure but in order to permit 
members to make their plans. As matters now  stand, it does not 
appear it will be in the public interest for the House and especially 
its committees to expect to go from December 13 to February 3 
without sitting for legislative work.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to facilitate 
our planning in the Reform Party and to assist the government as 
much as we can, my understanding is that the Minister of Health 
will be introducing a major piece of legislation on Tuesday, the 
tobacco legislation.
<P>
	I would like the parliamentary secretary to the government 
House leader to indicate whether there is any other legislation like 
that or major bills yet to be introduced that we are not aware of so 
that we can work them into the plans of the House and facilitate 
things the best we can.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
intervention. I have nothing further to add other than what I said in 
the business statement.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JUDGESACT">JUDGES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion in relation to the 
amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-42, an act to amend the 
Judges Act and to make consequential amendments to another act; 
and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, when we broke just before 
question period, the hon. member for Medicine Hat had the floor. 
There were still a few minutes remaining, but I presume that he has 
chosen not to take up those minutes. I am going to go to the next 
speaker.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address the House today on Bill C-42. 
Before getting to the core of the bill, I would like to say a few 
words in response to some of the things that were said earlier today 
by members of the Reform Party with respect to the justice agenda 
of the government.
<P>
	It is amazing to me that it does not matter what we are talking 
about in the House, but the Reform Party always ends up going 
back to the issue of guns. Bill C-68 is one of our stronger law and 
order measures. I want to point out that 12 per cent of Canadians 
oppose that legislation, which is the exact percentage that support 
the Reform Party nationally, according to the latest polls.
<P>
	The member for Medicine Hat spoke at length about his 
perception, or perhaps it was his exaggeration of the way people in 
Canada feel about law and order. He suggested that the present 
Minister of Justice has not done enough. Let us talk about his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6865"> 6865 </A></B>
<P>
record and about the Liberal record on law and order issues, on safe 
homes and safe streets.
<P>
	Let us talk about the establishment of the National Crime 
Prevention Council which was announced in July 1994 by the 
Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General. It will work to unify 
crime prevention efforts across the country and to provide advice to 
both the Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General on issues of 
law and order, in particular on crime prevention. Crime prevention 
is something which in the words of the member for Burlington who 
is well versed on these issues will help us prevent there being 
further victims in our country.
<P>
	Bill C-68 on gun control, Reform's favourite, strengthens our 
gun control legislation. It provides for stiff four-year mandatory 
minimum sentences for the use of a firearm during the commission 
of a violent crime.
<P>
	Really, that is what this is all about. It is about guns. With these 
boys, it is always about guns.
<P>
	Bill C-37, the Young Offenders Act. Reform opposed this one 
too. It establishes tougher sentencing for violent young offenders 
while encouraging the rehabilitation of young offenders and 
discouraging the use of prison sentences for non-violent crimes, 
something Reformers talk about a lot but voted against.
<P>
	Bill C-41, sentencing reform, is something that really gets them. 
This one includes principles and approaches to sentencing that 
consider public safety, the needs of the victims-where have we 
heard that before-for restitution, principles that serious offenders 
should be treated differently than minor first time offenders. 
Because it seeks to protect people that the Reform Party does not 
want to protect, because of the inclusion of those two little words 
``sexual orientation'', Reformers voted against the whole thing.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-104 concerns forensic DNA analysis. This improves the 
investigative tools available to police by clarifying circumstances 
for which a judge may issue a warrant allowing police and peace 
officers to obtain bodily samples for forensic DNA analysis. This 
bill has already done good in terms of criminal investigations in 
our country.
<P>
	Bill C-72 amends the Criminal Code so that people remain 
accountable for violent acts committed while they are intoxicated.
<P>
	There is the self-defence review. On October 4, 1995 the 
Solicitor General and the Minister of Justice announced the 
appointment of Madam Justice Lynn Ratushny to lead a review of 
cases involving women convicted of killing their abusive partners, 
spouses or guardians.
<P>
	Bill C-9 re-establishes the Law Reform Commission.
<P>
	Bill C-16, the contraventions act, increases efficiency in the 
justice system.
<P>
	Bill C-33 is the Canadian Human Rights Act amendment. Of 
course Reformers are opposed to that one too. One might ask this 
question of them: By giving rights to others, how could that 
possibly diminish any rights that they have? But they do not care 
because there are those words ``sexual orientation'' again and off 
they go.
<P>
	Bill C-17 contains Criminal Code improvements and they are 
opposed to that. Every attorney general in this country wants Bill 
C-17. It modernizes the Criminal Code. They need it to help them 
in law enforcement, but the Reform Party thinks it is important for 
us not to take advice from attorneys general and instead to cram 
unworkable and ridiculous procedures down their throats.
<P>
	Bill C-25, the regulations act, will be reported in the House 
tomorrow. It reforms and updates the regulatory process to make it 
more efficient.
<P>
	Bill C-27 concerns child prostitution, child sex tourism, criminal 
harassment and female genital mutilation. It amends the code to 
make sure that those who commit certain violent acts against 
women and children face tougher penalties.
<P>
	There are also Bill C-41, child support; Bill C-45, the judicial 
review of parole ineligibility; Bill C-46, production of records in 
sexual offence proceedings; and Bill C-55, the high risk offenders 
legislation.
<P>
	If that is not enough, there were a few things that we did which 
were not even in the red book or that were not promised. We 
launched a national flagging system as part of the Canadian Police 
Information Centre to help crown attorneys deal more effectively 
with high risk offenders at the time of prosecution. We established 
an anti-smuggling strategy to combat illegal trade in tobacco, 
firearms and alcohol. We continue to implement the war crimes 
strategy announced in January 1995. We expanded efforts to fight 
organized crime by seizure and forfeiture of assets and provisions 
against money laundering, and on and on and on.
<P>
	Never, I would venture to guess in the history of our country, has 
there been a more prolific Minister of Justice. Never has there been 
a government so closely aligned with concern for Canadians and 
for their safety.
<P>
	This morning the member for Medicine Hat went out of his way 
to reinforce what Reform hammers home and that is the scare 
tactics, the irresponsible creation out of the air of statistics that are 
not valid. Crime has not increased. Youth crime has not gone up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
ask about the Reform scare tactics and what part of Bill C-42 does 
that fit into.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6866"> 6866 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> That is not a point of order. The hon. member 
for Windsor-St. Clair.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, the boys are restless today. In any 
event, let us get down to the nub of this. The nub of this is that we 
have responded to Canadian concerns. The 12 per cent solution is 
unable to respond to those concerns. What do they do? They stir it 
up and they let it go.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	They do that in debate on a bill which is of very great 
importance. They say it is not important to ordinary Canadians. 
However, in my riding there are many ordinary Canadians who talk 
to me on the weekend when I am home and who call my office. 
They were concerned about what was going on in the former 
Yugoslavia. They were concerned about what is happening in 
Africa. They want Canada to participate. They want Canada to do 
something to make things better. One of the things we can do is 
contribute the time and the resources of a wonderful Canadian 
jurist to prosecute for the international war crimes tribunal.
<P>
	There is a tradition and I am often able to find it linked directly 
to my home community of Windsor, Ontario. In the fifties, 
following the second world war, a gentleman by the name of Bruce 
J.F. Macdonald, who was then a crown attorney and who 
subsequently became a judge of the court of the County of Essex, 
as it was then, became one of Canada's prosecutors at Nuremberg. 
As a result, many Canadians who live in Windsor have a great 
interest in this. We hear about it from time to time.
<P>
	One of my constituents has just completed scholarly work, a 
book, on the history of Canadian involvement in war crimes 
prosecutions.
<P>
	The Hon. Madam Justice Louise Arbour of the Ontario Court of 
Appeal is not someone we have foisted upon the international 
court. She was chosen by the secretary general of the United 
Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, as a result of a 
recommendation from the outgoing prosecutor, Mr. Justice Richard 
Goldstone of South Africa. She was the first choice of the UN for 
the position of chief prosecutor.
<P>
	This does not in any way take away from her ability to continue 
as a judge in our court of appeal in Ontario when she returns. In 
fact, I would dare say that the legal community of Ontario and the 
citizens of Ontario would be well served by having a woman on the 
bench who will be a heroic figure as a result of her work with the 
United Nations. She will be a heroic figure who will return to sit on 
the bench of the Ontario Court of Appeal.
<P>
	The position that the Reform Party is taking on this bill 
diminishes her. It is a terrible shame. This woman is honourable. 
She is distinguished. She is learned in the law. We in Ontario 
should be and are very proud of her. The fact that she has been 
asked to assist the world community in a very difficult, high profile 
task with the international war crimes tribunal is a great honour to 
us.
<P>
	For the Reform Party to take the position which is has is 
shortsighted and obstructionist.
<P>
	This bill is a small part of the justice agenda of the government. 
However, it reaches beyond our borders. It is important for the 
Canadian people to understand and recognize our stature in the 
international community. It is particularly important that we be 
allowed to serve, as a country, our friends around the world.
<P>
	World peace is a very important and precious commodity. This is 
one small way in which Canada can yet again contribute to a 
desirable end.
<P>
	I would like to suggest that the comments of the hon. member for 
Medicine Hat, in view of the so-called fresh start that the Reform 
Party is proposing, were unfair to the Minister of Justice, in 
particular, but in general they were unfair to the government. 
Making and keeping our streets safe is a very important goal. It 
takes more than rhetoric to do that.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	At a recent address in Toronto, the Minister of Justice said that it 
takes more than just statutes written in a book on a shelf 
somewhere in Ottawa. That is insightful. It takes a lot more than 
that. So while the Reform Party is busy criticizing the government 
for what it considers to be our inaction in matters of justice, 
perhaps its members should take a look at their own proposals.
<P>
	Community safety has to do with the health of those 
communities and the health of those communities has to do with 
their levels of economic development and with the type of social 
safety net those communities have.
<P>
	We are struggling hard in this government to deal with the deficit 
which we almost have licked. We are struggling hard to put the 
country's finances back in order. We are struggling hard to do all 
these things so that Canada will remain strong, so we will have 
economic development and jobs, so we will have a good social 
safety net and so we will have a safe place for our children to grow 
up in.
<P>
	I do not believe that giving people a tax rebate that they do not 
want and that they are not asking for is the way to do that. Our 
government's approach is a much healthier, much better organized 
and much more insightful approach to the problems of Canadian 
society.
<P>
	But we do not do anybody any good when we get up in the House 
of Commons and rant and rave about bars on windows, locks on 
doors and people cowering in their houses. That is not the normal 
state of being in our country. The Reform Party knows that and 
Canadians know that. We do not serve them well by suggesting that 
crime is out of control or beyond the control of our law 
enforcement agencies. We do not do our citizens any good by 
simply pandering to the basest fears of citizens who are being 
misinformed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6867"> 6867 </A></B>
<P>
by politicians who are simply exploiting their fears. We do not do 
any good when we do that.
<P>
	As a government we have to do what the justice committee is 
doing with respect to youth justice, for example. We have to go out 
there and we have to find out what is going on. When we define the 
problem and we see what is going on and we see the state of things, 
then we have to look to those who are involved in the area, to 
parents, to children who are at risk and who are in trouble with the 
law, to teachers, to educators, to social workers, to crown attorneys, 
to police officers and others. We have to go to them and ask them 
what we have done that is not working. We have to ask them what 
we can do that will work and what we need to do more of.
<P>
	I look at the six point plan of the Reform Party. Point number 
four has to do with making our streets safe again. How do 
Reformers want to do that? They want to eliminate the Young 
Offenders Act. There are certain linkages in society. It is very 
shortsighted to think there is a quick fix. In the Reform lexicon, 
first they tell people there is more crime and then they tell people 
that they will have capital punishment to deal with it.
<P>
	There is a lot that goes between the commission of the crime and 
the final result. There is an awful lot that goes before the 
commission of the crime. That is what we have to deal with, crime 
prevention.
<P>
	Instead of going on and on about Bill C-42, instead of trying to 
take up the House's time and the government's time with a bill that 
simply allows Canada to be honoured on the international stage by 
having one of our leading jurists go to Europe to prosecute war 
criminals, instead of worrying about that, why do we not talk a 
little about what we can do for our children who are at risk to 
offend, about what misery they are living in, what problems they 
are having that are putting them in harm's way? Why do we not 
work on trying to fix that? Why do we not work on trying to find 
more jobs for Canadians?
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	Why do we not stop worrying about tax cuts and worry about 
how we are going to get jobs for those parents so that their children 
can grow up in safe, economically healthy and emotionally healthy 
surroundings? These are the important issues that are troubling 
Canadians.
<P>
	On the issue of ordinary Canadians, I would like to point out that 
the House of Commons, quite frankly, is full of wonderful and 
devoted people on all sides of the House who are ordinary 
Canadians who have been called to an extraordinary calling and 
most of whom do a very good job at it. We do represent the views 
of ordinary Canadians and we represent them very well. Ordinary 
Canadians put us and our policies here and asked us to follow our 
agenda.
<P>
	When it comes to the justice agenda, we have done what we 
promised. We have delivered on our promises and in a reasonable 
and productive way which finds a balance between the rights of 
Canadians who are before the courts and the rights of Canadians 
who have suffered. We try to take care of our people because that is 
what we were elected to do. As good Liberals, I would suggest we 
are meeting those obligations and our promises to the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	If along the way a wonderful circumstance arises for our country, 
a circumstance which allows us to take one of the most prominent 
jurists in our country and place her in a position of international 
importance and responsibility, who are we to stand in the way of 
that? Who are we to fuss over that wonderful prospect for our 
country?
<P>
	Madam Justice Arbour is serving Canadians and the citizens of 
the world. We should be proud of her and help her do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
couple of quick questions.
<P>
	I assume the member is a lawyer, which is not too important, but 
if she is maybe should would understand the definition better than I 
would. It is my understanding that orders in council were brought 
into this House for the purpose of emergency decisions, things that 
come up that are really of emergent nature, like during wartime 
giving ministers the authority to do certain things that were 
required because of a very emergent type situation. It has been my 
understanding and it has been confirmed by other politicians from 
the past that orders in council were not to be used as they were in 
Bill C-42.
<P>
	I think what is in question is that the orders in council were in 
direct violation of the Judges Act. Since it is in violation of the 
Judges Act should it not be debated and questioned? We certainly 
would not want orders in council to start being abused. We know 
that possibility exists and that is what we do not want to happen.
<P>
	Second, could the member explain to me why the numbers in the 
victims' groups such as CAVEAT, CRY, MADD, FACT, et cetera 
are growing by the hundreds? They are demanding more and more 
each day that we do something about the problems. If things are so 
rosy, could the member explain to me why the membership in these 
victims' groups is growing steady and why we have millions of 
signatures on petitions that have been tabled in this House 
demanding that we do something about the crime in this country?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not suggest that things were rosy 
or that the numbers were rosy. What I suggested was that the 
Reform Party speakers who have gone before me on this debate, 
one in particular, the member for Medicine Hat, have exaggerated 
the state of the Canadian psyche in terms of their fears. Quite 
frankly, politicians, journalists, commentators and others who do 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6868"> 6868 </A></B>
<P>
that are pandering to fear and attempting to create in the minds of 
Canadians a false impression.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	Victims groups have come to the government on many occasions 
and on many bills. In fact I have met with a great many victims 
organizations and not part of organizations, in my riding and in my 
capacity as a member of Parliament and a member of the justice 
committee.
<P>
	What is important in dealing with these groups is that we have a 
full and frank discussion and that we then work toward helping 
them. What is equally important is to work to prevent crime so that 
there are fewer victims. On the issue of victims, the government 
has a good and a steady record of listening, of consulting and of 
dealing with their concerns.
<P>
	On the issue of orders in council I am afraid I am not clear on 
what the hon. member was alluding to, but I would like to suggest it 
is important for us to get on with Bill C-42. It is important for us to 
let Madam Justice Arbour know that she has the support of 
Canadians in the very important work that she is doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
ask the hon. member a couple of questions.
<P>
	In her speech she said it was important to get on with this and to 
pass Bill C-42 because it is important to get on with fighting crime. 
There are all kinds of crime: white collar crime; violent crime; 
embezzlement; forgery, you name it. The Criminal Code is inches 
thick.
<P>
	What concerns Reform is that on October 7, when the Minister 
of Justice was before a Senate committee he said, and I am 
paraphrasing: ``There is no provision in the Judges Act for Madam 
Justice Louise Arbour to accept this appointment with the United 
Nations''. Madam Justice Louise Arbour is already over in the 
Hague working in this new position. It conflicts with the Judges 
Act and it conflicts with the minister's actual words. Yet at the 
same time he puts through an order in council which states that the 
whole thing is legitimate. Hence, the Reform Party is asking these 
questions, I believe quite legitimately. I would like to hear the 
member's comments on that.
<P>
	Second, she says the justice committee is working hard and 
doing its job well. We know full well that the hon. member for Wild 
Rose had to come into the House to get the chairman of the justice 
committee-the member in question-to do the job that she is 
supposed to do as chairman of the committee, which is to listen to 
the Reform members who want to make motions.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you have ruled that the Reform Party's position was 
perfectly correct. We had the opportunity to make these motions 
which were ruled out of order by this particular member, who is the 
chairman of the  justice committee. I do not feel that is doing the 
work in the justice committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the first question let me quote 
precisely what the Minister of Justice said. He did not say what the 
hon. member for St. Albert has suggested. In fact, he said: ``There 
is no provision in the Judges Act for a federally appointed judge 
such as Madam Justice Arbour to be granted a leave of absence 
without pay to work for an international organization such as the 
United Nations. Nor does the act permit the salary and expenses of 
a judge during a period of leave to be paid by any organization or 
entity other than the Government of Canada, or in the case of 
expenses by the government of a province''.
<P>
	His point was this. The amendments contained in Bill C-42 
which have the full support of the chief justice of Canada and the 
judicial council would permit this type of arrangement to be 
entered into by Madam Justice Arbour.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	The issue is not whether she can work, the issue is whether she 
can legally be paid by the United Nations to do so. It is a 
technicality to allow Canada once again, I repeat, to be honoured in 
the international forum by having one of our leading jurists conduct 
a very important function.
<P>
	With respect to the other matter, unlike the Reform Party, as 
chair of the justice committee I am prepared to make a ruling, to 
stand by that ruling and to await the word of the Speaker. The 
Speaker has spoken on the motion, not exactly the way the hon. 
member has suggested. I was pleased to have his advice and I am 
pleased to abide by that ruling.

	She also tried to take credit for a number of bills for which she 
read out the numbers, bills that achieved certain things in the 
justice area. Most of these bills would never have been presented if 
there had not been a Reform presence in this place. Most of those 
bills did not go even a fraction as far as the people of Canada would 
have liked them to go.
<P>
	The one that was really outstanding and which she tried to take 
complete credit for from the Liberal perspective was Bill C-102, 
the DNA bill. The fact is it was the member for Wild Rose who 
initiated that bill. Everyone will remember that right here in the 
House during question period he manoeuvred the Minister of 
Justice into giving a commitment to deal with the bill within a 
48-hour period. It is the member for Wild Rose who deserves 
congratulations for that. It was a fantastic bill.
<P>
	The very first case which was solved using that bill was in my 
riding of North Vancouver. I am certainly one person, and my 
constituents are a whole group of people who are very grateful to 
the member for Wild Rose for having initiated that bill.
<P>
	Another thing the member for Windsor-St. Clair said that 
really needs correction is that Reform would introduce capital 
punishment. How many times do we have to say this to get it 
through to these Liberal members who obviously have some 
hearing impairment? It is Reform's position that we would put the 
question of capital punishment to the people of Canada directly in 
the form of a binding referendum.
<P>
	I suspect that the member for Windsor-St. Clair knows what 
the outcome would be. The fact is there is no Reform policy on 
capital punishment per se, but there is a Reform policy on giving 
the people of Canada the right to decide. If the outcome was that 
the people of Canada wanted the return of capital punishment, I am  
sure it would be terribly distressing to the member for 
Windsor-St. Clair who seems to think that she knows better than 
the people of Canada how to handle justice issues. I can understand 
why she would be upset at Reform policy, but I would not want 
anybody out there to get the wrong impression about what Reform 
policy is on capital punishment.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	As the member for Wild Rose mentioned, the membership in 
victims groups is growing by leaps and bounds. It is just exploding 
because of the lack of action on things like the Young Offenders 
Act. The member could not possibly tell me with a straight face 
that she does not still receive lots of letters and phone calls 
complaining about the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The fact is that the twiddling with the edges of it that occurred in 
this House, compliments of the justice minister, were ineffective. 
They just made it worse. They have not done anything to deal with 
the real problems in that act.
<P>
	Finally, in dealing with items that were raised by the member in 
her speech, when she talked about prevention of crime, I gave a 
speech in this House a couple of months ago where I gave detailed 
statistics from the Institute of Justice, statistics which indicated 
quite clearly from the United States that states which had higher 
incarceration rates had lower rates of crime. The estimate was that 
over a 20-year period there were tens of thousands of rapes 
prevented by having repeat rapists locked in jail. Hundreds of 
thousands of burglaries and robberies were prevented by having 
known robbers and burglars kept in jail.
<P>
	A component of crime prevention is recognizing the people you 
are not going to rehabilitate and protecting society from those 
people. If we could get it through the heads on the other side of this 
House to start looking at that, we would not have these ridiculous, 
idiotic decisions coming out of immigration and refugee boards, 
coming from judges across this country that are just letting all sorts 
of criminals run free in our environment. Most Canadians are fed 
up to the hilt with it and they just wish we could get on with 
protecting society.
<P>
	The motion which is being debated is an amendment to Bill C-42 
introduced by the government through the other place. It removed 
the section dealing with a new public policy allowing judges to 
accept international assignments. The government replaced it with 
a specific exemption to the Judges Act to allow Madam Justice 
Louise Arbour to accept a position at the UN as a prosecutor for 
international war crimes at the Hague.
<P>
	It is interesting that the Senate made this amendment and sent it 
back. I have been quite surprised at the amount of involvement of 
the other place in the activities of this House over the last couple of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6870"> 6870 </A></B>
<P>
years. They have modified and sent back items to this place a 
number of times.
<P>
	It has been Reform policy for a long time that the other place 
needs an overhaul. It needs to be made elected, equal and effective. 
It is actually quite impressive that there has been some sober 
second thought. Some material has been sent back here. I am 
actually quite impressed in some ways.
<P>
	There is an interesting little twist which has to do with that place 
which comes out of something that took place in this House on 
December 7 last year when the justice minister announced that 
B.C. would henceforth be considered as a fifth region in the 
country on a par with the prairies, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic 
Canada. A journalist in the Vancouver area, Barbara Yaffe, wrote a 
piece about this and it was quite interesting.
<P>
	A problem has been created as a result of that and it really has 
not had much exposure in the House. The B.C. Liberal members 
have been fretting about it. I guess they were hoping that it would 
never come to public notice but it has. If B.C. is a fifth region, why 
does it not have an appropriate share of the Senators?
<P>
	Historically each of Canada's four regions were accorded 24 
Senators. As a result of being lumped in with the prairies in the 
previous four regions model, B.C. has only six Senators. As a fifth 
and separate region, surely its Senate numbers should be adjusted 
up to 24 or at the very least have the rest of the other place adjusted 
downward in numbers so that proportionately it is back in balance.
<P>
	That is a very interesting idea. It could really have an effect on 
the type of actions that are taken by that other place in returning 
bills like this Bill C-42 with amendments and degrees of sober 
second thought for us to reconsider in this place. That would be a 
major improvement for the other place. I hope it has not been too 
embarrassing to have brought that up in the House today for 
consideration.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Returning to Bill C-42 specifically, we have been very 
distressed, as a number of members have mentioned, that time 
allocation has been moved on the bill. The number of times that 
time allocation has been moved over the past few months is very 
distressing. If memory serves me right, time allocation has been 
used by this government more often than by the Mulroney Tories. 
After all the hoopla in the red book about how democratic this 
place was going to be, it has actually turned out to be a complete 
disgrace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Worse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Worse, as my colleague says. 
Much, much worse.
<P>
	One of their own members has spoken out publicly about how 
bad it has become. On August 9, 1996 at a  meeting of the Rotary 
Club of Toronto, the York South-Weston Liberal MP gave a 
speech which he titled: ``Honesty, Ethics and Accountability: Does 
it exist in Canada's political system?'' He spoke about all sorts of 
things, including closure. He talked about how MPs, in order to 
advance in the power structure of this place, usually have to 
sacrifice the public interest to their own ambitions.
<P>
	We have a situation where members of the government will vote 
for closure or time allocation because they are afraid that if they do 
not, there will be some sort of punishment coming down the pipe. 
Yet they know in their hearts there should be more discussion on 
issues such as this one which has come back from the Senate.
<P>
	The member for York South-Weston said in his speech: ``The 
real power, the ability to influence, is concentrated in the office of 
the leader of each of the parties. It is most pronounced in the case 
of the government, where the power is in the Prime Minister's 
office, or the PMO as it is known. Surprising as this may sound, in 
fact, this country is run by half a dozen people, half of whom are 
unelected. This may not be something that Canadians realize, but it 
is something they should be extremely concerned about. These 
unelected officials have a tremendous influence over public policy 
and the careers of individual MPs. They determine who is rewarded 
and who is punished, and with that control they have the real 
influence, and with that influence they have the real power''.
<P>
	That says a lot about the types of processes that take place in the 
House which lead to closure on a very important issue like this one.
<P>
	We are not criticizing the individual justice who has been 
honoured with a request that she go to the United Nations to work 
on a special tribunal. That really is not the point. The point is the 
way the government has handled this issue which could potentially 
place a judge in a conflict of interest position upon her return to 
Canada.
<P>
	Time allocation and closure are not the only problems we have in 
this place. There are other problems which impinge upon the 
ability to properly function democratically and to discuss these 
issues in a fair and honest manner. One of those issues was brought 
up by my colleague, who mentioned that he had to go to you, Mr. 
Speaker, for a ruling as to whether he was free to speak in a 
committee of this House.
<P>
	There are serious problems with the committee structure. In fact, 
the member for York South-Weston in his speech to the Rotary 
Club of Toronto, in talking about chairs of committees said: 
``Committee chairs should be elected by their peers as opposed to 
the present soviet style system. Elections for chairmen are 
currently a farce. The PMO selects a person and government MPs 
go through a phoney ritual to vote for the PMO choice''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6871"> 6871 </A></B>
<P>
	That was certainly borne out by my observation of the system. 
For example, in September not only did the Vancouver area 
Liberal MPs vote for the PMO choices for chairs, but they also 
voted for members of the Bloc to be the vice-chairs. They voted 
for separatists. We know they are controlled by the PMO. That 
is very clear.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	As the member for York South-Weston said as he closed his 
speech that day: ``Restoring real power to individual MPs will ease 
cynicism and restore confidence in our system of government 
because it will make every single voter more powerful. By 
reforming the parliamentary system, the current concentration of 
power will naturally break down and that will, in my opinion, be a 
large step in the right direction''.
<P>
	That is very telling. It is a shame to hear today that the Liberal 
government has intervened to disband the riding association of the 
member for York South-Weston, to impose its Liberal bagmen 
appointed riding association to remove from nomination a member 
who chose to represent his constituents. It is a disgrace that we 
have to bring that sort of thing to the notice of the public. It should 
not be happening. Individual MPs in this place should have a great 
deal more power.
<P>
	It extends so far into everything we do. I had a complaint from 
the Canadian Plywood Association in my riding. A market access 
subsidy in plywood is provided to eastern based manufacturers but 
has been discontinued for western manufacturers. Where is the 
fairness in that? These things are mostly done for political reasons. 
It makes people very upset in the west that they are constantly left 
out of decisions or are treated very shoddily. Certainly the 
Canadian Plywood Association is very upset by that decision. I was 
asked to mention that in the House so I am pleased I was able to 
bring it into my speech today.
<P>
	Bill C-42 in allowing the appointment of a judge to the UN to 
work on a tribunal on war crimes really relates to the whole area of 
justice. We have heard several Reform MPs talk about how the 
justice system has deteriorated here in Canada and what a disgrace 
it is. I certainly have had my share of problems with illegal refugee 
claimants in my riding who continually commit crimes so they can 
use the system to stay in Canada.
<P>
	There is quite a dramatic case in my riding. I will quote from 
another local columnist who states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If you are caught doing something naughty, like forging and selling passports, 
make sure you come up before B.C. Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Patrick 
Dohm, who is full of the milk of human kindness.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The judge sentenced an Iranian passport expert to all of three months, to be served 
at home with an electronic beeper.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The maximum sentence for forging passports is 14 years. What 
does Associate Chief Justice Patrick Dohm do? He gives him three 
months at home with an electronic beeper. What an excellent 
opportunity for a home based business. The man was working from 
home in the first place, no taxes to pay, no business licence and no 
GST returns. It is a wonderful home based business facilitated by a 
decision of an associate chief justice. Is it any wonder that people 
are disturbed with the way our justice system has gone when they 
hear that sort of thing.
<P>
	The considerate court went on to say that the offender, Mr. 
Ashrafinia, was just a spoke in the wheel of a larger passport 
forgery operation. Now I ask, does being a spoke in the wheel mean 
that there is no responsibility and he should only get three months 
for forging passports? This man was charging $1,200 and $1,500 
per passport. It sounds like a pretty profitable enterprise, especially 
since there is no GST or taxes to pay. Anyway, we should probably 
bring out the violins because the lawyer complained. He said that 
jail time for his client would be a hardship because he does not hear 
very well. There it is.
<P>
	I am also quoted in this article as saying that I hope that we never 
start electing our judges because elected judges would probably 
begin reflecting community values and that associate chief justice 
would then have to start handing out the sorts of prison terms we 
would expect for that sort of disgraceful conduct.
<P>
	In fact, if this House would pass my private member's bill 
dealing with the Immigration Act, we could deport these people in 
lieu of a sentence. We could get rid of them right out of the country 
without having to worry about years and years of Immigration and 
Refugee Board appeals, all sorts of nonsense that just drags the 
system on and on and on.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	The member who spoke before me said that the Reform Party 
uses scare tactics to get people upset. The fact is the newspapers are 
full of this stuff. I have here a folder which is full of pages and 
pages about the disgrace of our justice system. It goes on day after 
day after day.
<P>
	In the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> of Friday, October 25: ``Deportation of 
Ontario drug dealer overturned as unfair''. It is unfair to deport a 
drug dealer. The article states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A federal judge has overturned the deportation of a convicted drug dealer, dealing 
a blow to a controversial law allowing some people to be deported without a hearing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Justice Barbara Reed, of Federal Court of Canada, ruled it was unfair to deport 
Jeffrey Hugh Williams because the law did not require he be told why he was 
considered a danger to the Canadian public.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Tell me, does a convicted drug dealer need to be told why he is a 
danger to the public? My goodness, to the Liberals opposite, 
obviously he does. So we are stuck with him and he is released out 
into the public again to do it all over again. Mr. Williams is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6872"> 6872 </A></B>
<P>
34-year old who came to Canada from Jamaica when he was nine. 
He was  sentenced to a four-year prison term in 1992 for possession 
of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking.
<P>
	I had another case in my riding. It took me five years working 
prior to my being an MP and as an MP to get rid of a convicted 
home invader and heroin trafficker in my riding. The Immigration 
and Refugee Board after he had been convicted of home invasion 
and imprisoned-home invasion is something that Canadians never 
even thought about 10 years ago and here we have home invasions 
going on.
<P>
	Anybody who lives in the Vancouver area knows that home 
invasions have become something that we read about fairly 
regularly in the newspapers. If the member who spoke before me 
thinks there is not a problem, she should live in Vancouver for a 
little while.
<P>
	This man was locked up for home invasion. The Immigration 
and Refugee Board listened to his appeal hearing on the deportation 
order and said: ``He feels so remorseful about it, he is really not a 
bad person. We will give him another chance''. Within three 
months he was on the streets again dealing drugs.
<P>
	The IRB is so naive it should be disbanded right away. All of this 
relates right back to the whole way that this government 
approaches things. It brings closure on very important justice bills 
and forces us into having to deal with all these issues in just a 
matter of hours.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the member for Windsor-St. Clair, who I can say is 
probably the worst chairperson of a justice committee that I have 
ever seen, was really self-serving and over the top in the defence of 
the Liberal justice agenda. She went on to talk about the Reform 
Party opposing merely for the sake of opposing.
<P>
	We say three things about our role in this House. First we have a 
duty as an opposition party to hold the government to account and 
test the veracity and merit of what it brings forward in legislation 
and how it delivers its governance. Second, we desire to 
compliment the government when it goes in the right direction. 
Third, if we heavily criticize, we must be prepared to present 
thorough and realistic alternatives on the table for all to examine.
<P>
	We are doing this specifically with Bill C-42. I have in my hand 
the Order Paper which contains the specific amendments we have 
brought in which would make this bill acceptable to our party. I 
would like the member to talk about the unacceptable approach the 
government has taken and also to highlight the solutions we have 
brought to this House to be voted on that would find Bill C-42 
acceptable to us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, that was a 
great comment about the committee process that was raised by the
<P>
member and also questions on what we would do in bills like this 
one. I would like to treat that in a general sense because I have 
experienced similar sorts  of problems. He talks about the justice 
committee and how bad that chairperson was.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	I was on a subcommittee dealing with Bill C-25. We had a whole 
day of hearings supposedly set aside and what happens? The 
Liberal majority passed a whole bunch of clauses in that bill. I 
think it was clauses 26 to 109 or 119 in one batch. Just one lump 
sum. The whole thing.
<P>
	How can you deal with a very complicated technical bill or very 
complex justice bills by passing 70, 80, 90 clauses in one batch? 
The only reason it happens is because in that committee we were 
told absolutely, distinctly they would not tolerate any substantive 
amendments.
<P>
	That is the sort of abusive process that goes on behind the scenes 
in this place. It is this kind of abusive process that raises the sort of 
comment that was just mentioned by my colleague for New 
Westminster-Burnaby, the whole issue of chairmanship of 
committees, what happens there and our inability to introduce 
meaningful amendments.
<P>
	For example, we had a number of amendments to Bill C-42. The 
hon. member for Crowfoot, seconded by the hon. member for St. 
Albert, put forward an amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``that'' and 
substituting the following: ``a Message be sent to the Senate to acquaint their 
Honours that this House disagrees with the amendment 1 made by the Senate to Bill 
C-42, an act to amend the Judges Act and to make consequential amendments to 
another act, and that this House agrees with the principle set out in amendment 2, but 
would propose the following amendments:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) insert the words ``for a period not to exceed three years'' after the words ``judicial 
duties'' in section 56.1(1);</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) strike out all the lines in section 56.1(2) and substitute the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``If Madam Justice Arbour elects to take leave pursuant to section 56.1(1) she may 
receive moving or transportation expenses and reasonable travel and other 
expenses, in connection with her services as Prosecutor, from the United Nations''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) add the following words to section 56.1(3):</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``notwithstanding any prohibition against accepting any salary fee, remuneration or 
other emolument described in section 57'';</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) add the following words to section 56.1(5):</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``and that benefits payable under these sections will be paid or will commence to be 
paid at the expiration of the leave of absence without pay''.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Even if people were not able to follow that closely because they 
did not have the bill before them, I think that everyone would be 
able to tell that a lot of thought went into the wording of that 
amendment. It is substantive. There is a lot of meat to discuss and 
we really should have extensive discussion of that in the  House. 
Instead of that we get these things rammed through. We get 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6873"> 6873 </A></B>
<P>
closure, we get committees shutting us down and it really is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to have the hon. member comment on something that I 
talked about in the House earlier today. It is a conversation I 
overheard between my 17-year-old sons. They were talking one 
night while doing their social studies homework. They study 
Canadian government. They were discussing some things about the 
Canadian government which clearly are not democratic.
<P>
	One of my sons in commenting to the other said: ``Really, what it 
seems to me we have in this country is a Prime Minister who is 
pretty much fairly elected''. I could not have put it better myself. I 
was so proud of them, their teacher and their fellow students for 
having come to that conclusion. I believe that really reflects the 
system that we have in this country.
<P>
	We have seen closure used so many times routinely. Orders in 
council are used instead of bringing issues before the House. We 
have heard of the Prime Minister threatening Liberal MPs that if 
they do not toe the party line they will not be running as Liberals 
again. This was done publicly as I am sure it is done privately.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Could this member comment on my son's evaluation of 
government in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, I can best 
handle my total agreement by reading a short quote from the 
speech given by the Liberal member for York South-Weston to 
the Rotary Club of Toronto on August 9: ``The whip's role is to tell 
people when and how to vote.'' It is a sad reflection on our system 
of government when people, presumably intelligent people, have to 
be whipped into voting a certain way. It is also contrary to the 
public interest and it feeds the cynicism and almost contempt that 
Canadians have for their elected representatives. ``The notion of 
disciplining reasonably intelligent adults who were given the trust 
of their constituents is a practice that Canadians reject. If the leader 
cannot count on the majority of members of his own team to 
support a particular policy based on its merits, obviously there is 
something wrong with it.
<P>
	``Allowing free votes on every issue would show true leadership 
in this country, whether it is the leader of the government or of any 
of the opposition parties''.
<P>
	That answers perfectly the comments that were made by the 
member's sons when they recognized, without even having to be 
here, that it is basically a five-year dictatorship.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have been sitting here listening to the Reform Party talk 
about everything under the sun: the meetings in York 
South-Weston, the colour of grain, the Prime Minister, the red 
book. Reformers have been talking about things that happened 
years ago. One wonders what the opposition parties are up to.
<P>
	A very simple piece of legislation is before the Chamber today. 
It is a wonderful piece of legislation. The bill has only seven 
clauses. A moment ago the hon. member talked about 80 and 90 
clauses in a bill. I do not know what bill he was talking about. This 
bill has seven or eight clauses.
<P>
	He just talked about amendments to the bill that had to do with 
remuneration of judges while the judges were away. The bill 
clearly spells out that the judges will not receive remuneration 
from the Government of Canada while they are in those capacities 
in the international arena.
<P>
	So it is again that there is something wrong, especially with the 
Reform Party members. We could say they are frustrated. They are 
frustrated with the lack of support they have from the Canadian 
people and they are frustrated with the amount of support the 
government has from the Canadian people. Therefore they direct 
their attacks in very selective areas.
<P>
	As the opposition points out, this debate is on amendments from 
the Senate, which the Reform Party does not like. They say they do 
not like anything from the Senate. What was the last bill with 
amendments from the Senate that the Reformers absolutely loved? 
Which bill was it? There were amendments from the Senate which 
indicated the direction of the Senate.
<P>
	The Reform Party members and the Bloc members stood up and 
they loved it. They fell over one another. They were so happy, 
overjoyed. They fell over one another they were so happy. They 
were overjoyed. They were just heating up. They loved it. The 
Senate could not have done better. The Senate should have gone 
even further. ``We love the Senate. Come on Senate, bring us 
more''.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	What was that? Does the House recall? It was not very long ago. 
Yes, I can see that you remember, Madam Speaker. It was the 
gigantic tax breaks that the Senate wanted to give to the rich. 
Remember that?
<P>
	That was an international bill as well. This bill deals with 
international activities of our judges. That bill dealt with 
international activities of money that was made in Canada and 
invested in foreign nations. They loved that international bill.
<P>
	What did they particularly love about the bill? They loved the 
portion of the bill that said the huge foreign companies operating in 
Canada would get a 50 per cent tax cut. They loved it. Of course, 
the Government of Canada would not allow the Senate to go as far 
as these political parties wanted it to go. Those dividends, those 
profits from the subsidiaries, would have gone back to the parent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6874"> 6874 </A></B>
<P>
companies in another international setting in that other 
international bill. They loved it.
<P>
	As well, they loved the reduction in the taxes on royalties and 
trademarks. That is the money that goes to international firms that 
have their head offices in other parts of the world. The Reform 
Party just loved it. Reformers loved it so much that they did not 
even want to speak on it. The Senate brought in the amendments 
and they were tripping over one another telling each other: ``Do not 
speak on this''. They selected only one member to speak on it.
<P>
	The other section that these Reform Party people loved was the 
interest that was made on investments in Canada by international 
banking institutions. That is the 30 per cent tax cut that they wanted 
to see.
<P>
	There were other things which are too numerous to mention. 
However, we can tell that Reformers are very selective in what they 
like about the Senate. When the Senate follows their party 
philosophy of giving more to the rich, of supporting the banks, of 
supporting the international profits made in Canada and cutting 
taxes, they love it.
<P>
	It did not stop there, as we will recall. The Bloc loved the last bill 
which the Senate sent to us. That bill said that people who have 
property in the United States and other nations worth over 
$600,000 should receive a tax credit in Canada for it. They just 
loved that provision which was sent from the Senate.
<P>
	The opposition is very selective in whether it likes or dislikes 
from the Senate.
<P>
	They do not particularly like Canada's reputation on the 
international scene. Our reputation in the rest of the world has 
dramatically changed in the past three years. The Government of 
Canada, under the administration of the hon. member for 
Saint-Maurice, has been in power for three years. The Reform 
Party and the Bloc should be standing up every day and praising the 
Government of Canada for its international reputation.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	I suppose the reason the opposition parties are so frustrated is 
because their policies, the things they said in their policy materials 
before the last federal election, were about the international scene. 
Reformers talked about Canada's reputation. Their policies were 
about Canada's deficit in relation to the GDP, but compared to 
whom? It has to be compared with somebody. The leader of the 
Reform Party kept comparing Canada to the United States, Japan, 
Germany, France, the United Kingdom and even Italy in some of 
his speeches. What has happened?
<P>
	In the last three years-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It's best you don't talk about the G-7.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> The hon. member talks about the G-7. Today there is 
the OECD in Paris with economists from 28 nations. When they
<P>
looked at Canada, what did they say about the G-7? Who did they 
name as being the most progressive, the nation with the lowest 
deficit/GDP of the G-7, the one with the most economic growth 
this year and next year and the year after, the one that was placed on 
the best financial footing of all?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Who was that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Which country was it? Was it Italy?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Was it France?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Was it the U.K.?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Was it Germany?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Was it Japan?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Was it the United States?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> There is only one left. It was Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> When Reform Party members look at these 
international reputations, when they look at the international 
setting of Canada, when they look at our reputation in other 
countries, they do not particularly like what they see on the basis of 
economics, the very basis on which they ran their last election 
campaign.
<P>
	There is a simple solution to the problem of the Reform Party. It 
should tear up its policy papers. It should tear up its budgets. How 
do Reformers expect the people of Canada to follow their party 
when they are suggesting that we cannot afford medicare any 
more? Imagine a political party in Canada today that says we 
cannot afford medicare any more. Notice they are not denying it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Tell the truth, George.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> The hon. member says that I am stretching the truth.
<P>
	I keep their budget in my desk just for the occasion when they 
say that I am not telling the truth about their platform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> What page is it on?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> It is on page 24. The document is called ``The 
Taxpayer's Budget: The Reform Party's plan to balance the federal 
budget, provide social and economic security for the 21st century''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Lost your place, eh?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6875"> 6875 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> You can't find it, George?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I was not going to read all of it but I will now. This is 
according to the Reform Party of Canada. This is why its members 
are so frustrated with their lack of support: ``The public may in 
time agree that although access to a broad range of basic health 
care should be guaranteed to everyone, the original medicare 
model in which everyone received everything health care 
professionals wished to deliver is not only intolerably expensive, it 
is undesirable''. Imagine. What a position for the Reform Party of 
Canada to take.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	Reform members not only say to the Canadian people that we 
cannot afford our medical services and medicare, they also say that 
if they are elected they are going to see the medicare system go 
down the tubes. They make other ridiculous claims. They want, for 
example, the banks to own our roads.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Oh yes. They want the banks to own our bridges. 
They want the banks to own our airports. I notice nobody across the 
way is saying no to this because I was going to read it out. It is on 
page 14. It states: ``Typically, physical infrastructure refers to 
traditional features like highways, ports, railways and airports. 
Given our current fiscal climate, however, governments are 
ill-equipped to spend money on massive improvements. In Canada, 
privatize airports and allow private sector companies to build and 
maintain roads and bridges''. Tollgates. Imagine the tollgates in 
Canada if the Reform Party ever got elected.
<P>
	If one notices, there is a likeness. There is another political party 
in Canada that now has practically identical policies to the Reform 
Party. That party passed at its most recent conference a resolution 
stating that we no longer can afford the Canada pension plan. 
Imagine passing a resolution at a national conference stating that 
we can no longer afford the Canada pension plan. While the 
Government of Canada and the provinces are struggling to try to fix 
it, along come the Tories, that great Tory party that was wiped out, 
having a policy meeting and stating: ``Let's allow people to invest 
their money in a bank account and take the interest''.
<P>
	It made the same statement as the Reform Party of Canada when 
it talked about medicare. It stated: ``Canada can no longer afford 
our present medicare system and for other reasons'', they claim, ``it 
is undesirable''.
<P>
	What we have is a situation where we are asked today to pass a 
bill that will allow judges to take part in international activities on 
invitation from other nations, international tribunals and 
organizations. We have the obstructionist tactics of the official 
opposition and the third party in the House, namely the Reform 
Party, to pass a simple bill of seven clauses.
<P>
	The reason is that the Reform members are frustrated. The bill 
came from the Senate. They only want to see things from the 
Senate that match their policy, that is, give more to the rich, give it 
to the billionaires, give it to the big corporations. That is what they 
supported in the last amendments from the Senate and that is what 
they love to see. That is what they put through the House with only 
one speaker for a period of seven or eight minutes.
<P>
	The other reason why the Reform members are so frustrated is 
because Canada is seen today on the international scene as 
progressing more than any other industrialized democracy in this 
world. We are now placed on the top by every international 
standard, from the IMF to the OECD whose job it is to examine the 
economies of industrialized democracies around the world. That is 
why Reformers are so frustrated. They do not know what they are 
going to do because they know they are going to end up in defeat 
again after the next federal election.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
that was certainly a very eloquent, very refreshing, very exciting 
speech of the hon. member and certainly one that Canadians would 
appreciate.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member could talk a bit about what could be the 
reason for this hesitancy on behalf of the Reform Party to 
participate in international tribunals, to take part in very just and 
worthy enterprises within the international community. Canada has 
a tremendous reputation in the international community for 
participating, for helping, for working hard to make sure that the 
rule of law is obeyed and enforced at all levels.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member could tell us why the Reform Party 
is so reluctant to participate in these very noble endeavours.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Madam Speaker, first of all let me congratulate the 
hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill River for the 
magnificent job he has done in this Chamber since his election and 
his great contribution to the passage of legislation and also the 
great speech made by the hon. member for Windsor-St. Clair a 
few moments ago.
<P>
	In response to the hon. member's question, the answer probably 
is this. Since the Reform Party has been a member of this Chamber 
it has seen Canada internationally become somewhat of a hero not 
just in the economic field, not just in the field of peacekeeping, but 
also in the field of making international law, of standing up for the 
environment, of passing legislation that says that nations around 
this world can no longer plunder the resources of the sea and get a 
way with it; that Canada has led the way in the United Nations, at 
the United Nations conferences of the sea and the environment and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6876"> 6876 </A></B>
<P>
has consistently led the way in practically every issue that has dealt 
with the environment in the past three years; and also our economy.
<P>
	I think that is why mainly the opposition party really does not 
want to become involved in any of these international activities of 
the Government of Canada. But of course the one exception is if 
these international agreements that we pass in the House help 
along, I suppose we could say their policies, that will assist in some 
way in their philosophical direction; that is, in giving tax breaks to 
the very wealthy or in having tax treaties, for example, that is fine.
<P>
	The House will notice that whenever a tax treaty is introduced 
they always have been, if we examine the committee proceedings, 
very interested in giving huge tax breaks to the international 
corporations of the world who do business today. They are not too 
anxious to talk about transfer pricing or anything like that, but they 
are certainly interested in those across the board tax cuts to those 
very large U.S. corporations who do business in Canada and 
elsewhere in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to begin by commending the hon. member opposite for 
being a very eloquent speaker. That is a rare gift and it is very 
entertaining indeed to listen to the hon. member. I do congratulate 
him for that. The substance clearly is another issue entirely. There 
was a noticeable lack of substance to the member's speech.
<P>
	I am here to talk about Bill C-42 which is a bill which was 
presented to the House from the Senate. I want to make it clear that 
what we are objecting to today is process. We are not objecting to 
Madam Justice Louise Arbour being appointed to do this 
international service that the member opposite talked about. Just to 
make it very clear, it is process which we are concerned with.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	We have seen a complete lack of regard for democracy and a 
complete lack of democratic process in this House over the past 
three years. Actually, sometimes it sickens me. Closure is invoked 
almost daily. Legislation is rammed through by order in council 
day after day after day.
<P>
	The Prime Minister tells government members of Parliament 
that they had better not vote against a government bill because if 
they do, they will not be running again as members of the Liberal 
Party. The Prime Minister did that when Bill C-68 was being 
debated in the House. That is a threat which clearly throws out the 
whole concept of democracy. The Prime Minister says to his own 
members of Parliament: ``I am going to end your political career if 
you do not toe the party line''.
<P>
	The former Liberal MP in his speech in Toronto to the Rotary 
Club stated it very well. He said that the Liberal government is run 
by the Prime Minister and two or three key people.
<P>
	We are arguing against the process. Reform does not believe that 
this bill should be passed. Therefore, pursuant to Standing Order 
26(1), I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House continue to sit beyond the ordinary hour of daily adjournment for 
the purpose of considering amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-42, an act to 
amend the Judges Act and to make consequential amendments to another act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I would like to 
inform the hon. member for Vegreville that I cannot accept this 
motion since a time allocation motion dealing with this particular 
bill has already been accepted in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. The time 
allocation order that you refer to states: ``and, 15 minutes before 
the expiry of the time provided for government business on the 
allotted day of the consideration of the said stage of the said bill, 
any proceedings before the House shall be interrupted''.
<P>
	We now have a motion, which is in accordance with our Standing 
Orders, which extends the time provided for government business. 
The time allocation motion is still in effect except that if the House 
approves the motion by the member for Vegreville, the House 
would now make another decision with respect to the time provided 
for Government Orders. Therefore I believe, Madam Speaker, you 
will find the motion in order because it is within the time allocation 
motion made earlier today by the government.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> On your point 
or order, the hon. member for St. Albert, I remain and I stand on the 
decision I have made on the motion for the member for Vegreville. 
We are now continuing debate. Does the hon. member for 
Vegreville want to continue on debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, as I was saying before I presented 
the motion, Reform will not support Bill C-42 because of process. I 
was talking about what has been wrong with the process in this 
House for the three years we have been here and before. This is not 
new.
<P>
	This government has had three years to at least make it look like 
it is honouring some of the commitments which it made in the red 
book with regard to making this place more democratic, making 
government more accountable. In fact we have seen that it has 
moved farther and farther away. The government is now farther 
away from having a democratic government than anything we have 
ever had before. That is why we had better talk about process here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6877"> 6877 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to comment on what should take place in this 
House and some changes that Reform has put forth. They are in 
our fresh start platform. They are part of our guarantee to 
Canadians that what we promised during an election campaign 
will be honoured. In this fresh start guarantee as we call it we give 
the power to the people in this country. We give the power to the 
people.
<P>
	Some Liberals across the way are pretty uncomfortable with this 
and so they should be. They have heard the threats from the Prime 
Minister. He has told them they had better support government bills 
or they will not be running as Liberals next time. They know what 
happened this morning. A former Liberal member had his whole 
executive thrown out by the Liberal Party. How democratic is that? 
His whole party executive in his constituency was thrown out by 
this government. That is the most recent demonstration of the lack 
of democratic process in this place.
<P>
	Reform wants to change this and we have put forth several 
specific proposals for doing that. They have actually been 
presented in the House before.
<P>
	One example is the right to recall a member of Parliament. We 
want to give people the direct power to fire their members of 
Parliament between elections if they are not representing the 
constituents' views in this House. Clearly members of Parliament 
are not representing the views of their constituents in this House if 
they live under this threat by the Prime Minister. They will not be 
allowed to run again under the Liberal Party banner because the 
Prime Minister will not sign their nomination papers.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	We know there are not many members of Parliament who win as 
independents. Some of these Liberals sitting across the way should 
be thinking about that because quite possibly some of them will not 
be allowed to run again under the Liberal banner. Their chances of 
getting elected as independents are very slim. There are very few 
who could in fact do that.
<P>
	The member of Parliament for Beaver River has twice sponsored 
a bill in this House which would have given to the people the power 
to fire their member of Parliament between elections if the member 
was not representing the wishes of the constituents. Twice it was 
shot down by the Liberals and the Bloc who voted against the bill 
on both occasions. They teamed up and shot down this bill which 
would have given that kind of power to the people.
<P>
	There was a second piece of legislation which was sponsored by 
the member for Mission-Coquitlam, a Reform member of 
Parliament. It would have put in place freer votes in the House of 
Commons. It was a very simple change which would have made it 
so a government bill could be defeated without defeating the 
government. It would require a separate non-confidence  motion to 
pass the House to bring the government down. The bill was shot 
down by the Liberals and the Bloc.
<P>
	And they are laughing about denying Canadians the right to be 
represented in this House by members of Parliament who are 
responsible to the people rather than to the government and the 
Prime Minister. They are laughing about that kind of thing. Quite 
honestly I find that sad. It is sad. I would not laugh about that.
<P>
	The member for Mission-Coquitlam sponsored the bill, a 
change that was made in the House in Britain probably 20 years 
ago. It was shot down by the Liberals and the Bloc, a second major 
change.
<P>
	Let us talk about what would have happened had the recall bill 
and the bill which would have put in place freer votes in the House 
of Commons passed. Imagine what that would give to Canadians. It 
would give Canadians a power that they have never had before.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister and the whip of the party tell the 
members that they will toe the party line whether or not their 
constituents back the bill, at that time the people back home would 
say: ``You listen to us because we will recall you. We are going to 
fire you before the next election''. The choice for the member 
would be either not to have the nomination papers signed or to be 
fired by the people back home. It would give more power to the 
people back home.
<P>
	The freer votes would give members of the governing party, 
these same people who are heckling and laughing at these changes 
which really would give the power to the people, the right to 
represent the majority of their constituents in this House without 
the fear of defeating the government. They could defeat a bill. We 
as an opposition party might bring forth a non-confidence motion. 
Only if the motion passed would the government be defeated. The 
bill would not pass but the government would not be defeated.
<P>
	These two changes would completely change the relative power 
of the people and of the Prime Minister and the little select group 
that runs the country now. They would change the system from a 
system that my two 17-year old sons recognize pretty much as an 
elected dictatorship. That is their own evaluation of our system 
which I think is very accurate. They would change the system to 
one in which Canadians really did have the power over their 
members of Parliament and where their views really would be 
represented in this House. That will be a change that Canadians 
will welcome and a change that is long overdue.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Those two changes alone completely retilt the balance of power 
toward the people. We are also proposing a triple E Senate, a 
Senate that is elected by the people, not appointed by the Prime 
Minister and that small group of people who run the country, 
according to my sons' evaluation, with an equal number from each 
province,  not the imbalance that we have now, and a Senate which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6878"> 6878 </A></B>
<P>
is effective enough to stop legislation that is unfair to any region of 
this country.
<P>
	I know and people from Alberta and western Canada certainly 
know that we should have had that when the national energy 
program was put in place. It would have never been put in place. 
The triple E Senate would stop this kind of nonsense.
<P>
	Another change that we put in our fresh start guarantee is the use 
of national referendums to settle issues like capital punishment, 
abortion and physician assisted suicide. These are important social 
issues and important to a wide range of Canadians. This change 
would put power directly in the hands of the people. They would 
not have to go through their member of Parliament any more. This 
would give people an equal say on settling these important issues, 
abortion, capital punishment, physician assisted suicide and so on. 
That is a change which Canadians certainly would welcome.
<P>
	These members scoff and laugh at that change because they just 
do not understand that we could have a system that is that 
democratic. That is the kind of system Reform wants, the kind of 
system supporters of Reform want and the kind of system that we 
are going to do our best to put in place.
<P>
	At this time I would like say that these changes are changes that 
Canadians do support right across the country. These are changes 
that this Liberal government has had three years to put in place and 
which Liberal governments of the past have had 20 years out of the 
past 30 to put in place. They have not been put in place.
<P>
	It is a sad commentary on the lack of a belief in true democracy 
on the part of this government, and Canadians, I believe, will not 
tolerate it. This next election will be as much about making the 
system democratic as it is about anything else. Reform is the only 
party that will offer a true democratic government in this country. 
We know that because the Liberals have shot down all these 
motions and bills that we have brought forth which would have 
made the changes needed to make this country democratic. They 
should be ashamed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
thank you for this opportunity to make a few comments and ask 
some questions of the hon. member for Vegreville with respect to 
Bill C-42.
<P>
	This is certainly a great opportunity for Canada to participate in 
the international stage and once again show the leadership that 
Canada is known for. It is probably enforcing and assisting to 
enhance the role of the rule of law in the international forum. We 
know that it is out of respect for Canada's integrity, its peaceful 
nature and its reputation for fairness that it has been asked to 
participate at such a high level in prosecuting war crimes,  war 
crimes that involve some of the most heinous and violent activity, 
activity which can only be viewed as an abomination. Certainly, 
right thinking people who view nations as having a responsibility 
to participate in enhancing this role and in bringing those to justice 
who have perpetrated these crimes would support participation.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party is suggesting that there is a technical breach. 
There is not. It is quite clear that proper authorization was given to 
Madam Justice Arbour to participate in this forum. The purpose of 
this bill is to allow the United Nations to pay Madam Justice 
Arbour directly in order to allow compliance with United Nations 
rules. Clearly the steps which have been taken have been entirely 
appropriate in complying with the law and in changing it in order to 
facilitate the applicability of UN rules.
<P>
	I put a question to hon. members of the Reform Party. When it 
comes to international activity, to helping other nations, to standing 
up for the rule of law, international fairness and morality, and to 
ensuring that we take a tough stance against violence in the 
international forum, why is it that every time we seek to engage in 
such noble purposes the Reform Party tries to undermine us by 
bringing forth erroneous objections? I would like to know why the 
Reform Party is stalling and filibustering when this activity is so 
important to Canada and its reputation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, I am saddened that the member of 
the governing party has completely distorted what Reform has 
done on international issues. Our member of Parliament for Red 
Deer has done an admirable job in giving advice to the foreign 
affairs minister, in particular, with respect to serious situations. 
That advice has been heeded in some cases, although not enough.
<P>
	We made it very clear that we do not object to this judge's doing 
that work. We object to the process that is being used. We object to 
the government's breaking the law. We do not think it should be 
violating the Judges Act. That is what we believe.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I have some questions for the Reform Party.
<P>
	I have listened to the debate throughout today and yesterday and 
I have heard some very disturbing comments. The member for St. 
Albert said yesterday: ``Surely they could have found someone 
else. Surely there is somebody else who could do this important 
job. Surely there is somebody else who is equally qualified''.
<P>
	I do not know why Reform members have such problems being 
proud that a Canadian was chosen by the United Nations as the best 
person to do this job and why they have such a problem facilitating 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6879"> 6879 </A></B>
<P>
a competent  Canadian who has been internationally recognized as 
being capable of doing this job.
<P>
	Perhaps Reformers are suggesting that Madam Justice Louise 
Arbour should do this job and not receive any salary while she is 
doing it. I am totally confused about what their purpose is. I do 
know they have chosen to waste a full day to debate a bill and to 
complain at the same time about wasting the time of the House of 
Commons in dealing with this.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	They have complained that we are not obeying the law. We 
recognize there is a section of law that has to be changed to 
accommodate this very unusual situation. Canada and Madam 
Justice Arbour have been honoured by this appointment.
<P>
	Why, if they are so concerned about this, have they spent the 
entire day debating everything except the subject matter of the bill 
before us at a cost to the Canadian taxpayers of $80,000 an hour for 
every hour the House of Commons sits? Why do they have so much 
trouble accepting that the international community wants to honour 
one of our own? Why have they chosen to spend more than a full 
day debating issues unrelated to this bill, issues that they can 
choose to debate on any opposition day? I wish they could answer 
those questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, once again, we are not objecting to 
Madam Justice Louise Arbour. We are not reflecting on her 
character or her capabilities in any way. We have made that very 
clear throughout this debate.
<P>
	We are objecting to process. We clearly do not believe the 
government should break the law even if it is only breaking it by a 
little bit. We do not believe it should be violating the Judges Act. 
Let us make the appropriate changes in a democratic way.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Questions and 
comments.
<P>
	We will resume debate with four minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I move 
that the member for Wild Rose now be heard.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I will 
recognize the hon. member for Wild Rose, but I would like to 
advise him there is only one minute left in the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, one 
minute of debate. That is not much. If you are going to talk about 
what is wrong with this government you need about four days.
<P>
	Just a quick note. Among all the things we heard today was that 
the Prime Minister was not going to sign the nomination papers of 
those who would not vote the right way like on the gun bill and a 
few other things.
<P>
	The members on that side of the House kept saying that is not so. 
I wonder if they could explain this article:
<P>

	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-335, an act to amend the Bank Act (foreign banks), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is an honour for me to rise to debate 
at second reading my private member's bill, Bill C-335, an act to 
amend the Bank Act, with particular focus on foreign banks. I am 
sorry that the committee did not see fit to make this bill a votable 
item. However, we are here to discuss the issue and to make a 
point.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to open the Bank Act to foreign 
competition so that they can provide more money to small business 
people in Canada and create more jobs.
<P>
	This bill amends the Bank Act to require the minister to consider 
a commitment to serving small and medium size business in 
Canada as a factor in deciding whether to grant letters patent to 
foreign banks to operate in Canada.
<P>
	It is interesting to point out at the outset the interest which the 
banking industry has taken in this bill. I have received 
correspondence from the Canadian Bankers Association which 
states that over 80 per cent of small businesses have their loans 
approved and that Canadian banks are giving strong support to 
Canada's small businesses.
<P>
	I have statistics which were prepared by the hon. member for 
Trinity-Spadina which indicate that the Bank of Montreal 
increased its loans to small business by $110 million in the period 
September 30, 1995 to December 31, 1995. The CIBC decreased its 
loans to small business by $152 million. The National Bank 
decreased its loans to small business by $600,000 during the same 
period. The Royal Bank decreased its loans to small business by 
$111 million. The Scotiabank increased its loans to small business 
by $171 million. The TD Bank decreased its loans to small 
business by $116 million. The net loss to business people in Canada 
was $104 million in that period as compared with the previous 
period.
<P>
	I mention these statistics because, as we all know, banks have 
announced profits of over $6 billion this week. That is a 20 per cent 
increase in their profits, but they have decreased their loans to 
small business.
<P>
	Recently Toronto-Dominion's incoming chief executive told an 
audience in Ottawa that a strong and healthy country requires 
strong and healthy banks. It is also true that strong and healthy 
banks require a strong and healthy country.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	Small businesses create over 80 per cent of the new jobs in 
Canada. Greater competition in the banking system will accelerate 
the funding of small and medium size businesses and create more 
jobs for Canadians. Economic growth will allow Canadians to 
work. It is better than depending on social work programs.
<P>
	I believe the increased competition will generate better service 
and lower the costs that Canadians now pay for their banking 
services.
<P>
	This week I picked up three brochures from the Bank of Nova 
Scotia, Bank of Montreal and CIBC. When I checked their service 
charges some of them were identical. Just like the gas stations, they 
charge the same price. For example, it costs the same amount for an 
NSF cheque, for each cheque you write, for monthly service 
charges. It does not matter which bank you go to, all charge the 
same price. Maybe my colleague can tell me that in western 
Canada they do not do the same but here in Ottawa, the nation's 
capital, that is how they charge.
<P>
	My bill mirrors the opinion of two recent parliamentary 
committees, the Senate banking committee and the House of 
Commons finance committee. In separate reports they both 
recommended that we open the system to foreign banks in order to 
have more competition so consumers and business people alike 
will have flexibility in dealing with their bank.
<P>
	In announcing the House of Commons standing committee on 
finance recommendations, the chairman and my colleague, the 
member of Parliament for Willowdale said: ``This will allow 
greater flexibility for and more financial assistance for more 
financial institutions to come into Canada and provide more 
competition and services to Canadians''. The recommendations of 
the committee are in response to the federal government's white 
paper on financial reports released earlier this year.
<P>
	Foreign banks have been restricted by current restrictions and 
have warned that their numbers will decline unless the rules are 
eased. There used to be 62 foreign banks operating in Canada and 
now we have only 46. The less foreign banks we have the less 
competition there is and more freedom for the banks to charge as 
they wish.
<P>
	The foreign banks have indicated that easing the rules will 
prompt them to expand their lending activities and look for new 
markets in the area of small and medium size businesses. Other 
foreign banks that have not yet entered Canada will take a second 
look and come in to operate in this market.
<P>
	I should point out that the Canadian Bankers Association is in 
agreement with the committee's proposals. A spokesman for the 
CBA said that the proposed changes will bring economic benefits. 
The CBA's position is: ``This is very positive for the foreign  
banking community. If the proposals are adopted, it would make 
Canada attractive to foreign lenders. I would expect you would see 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6882"> 6882 </A></B>
<P>
the Americans looking at entering the market again, and the British 
banks''.
<P>
	The changes proposed by Bill C-335 will ensure that any foreign 
bank wishing to operate in Canada will intend to make and will be 
capable of making a contribution to the financial system in Canada 
by promoting the financial stability of and providing support for 
small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	The Young Liberals at their convention also pushed through a 
resolution critical of chartered banks' record in financing small and 
medium size businesses. These young Canadians recognize the 
importance of this sector and their resolution shows that greater 
attention should be paid to how the big six banks meet this 
important need. After all, the future belongs to them. They are 
concerned with their future. We have to support them in their 
resolution so we can see competition in the banks.
<P>
	In conclusion, I ask for the consideration of my fellow members 
in debating the merits of Bill C-355. My bill is consistent with the 
policy of the Government of Canada and with the findings of the 
parliamentary committees. It should be viewed as an extension of 
the job creation strategy of the government.
<P>
	The central point of government policy is that the ownership of 
financial institutions is a privilege, not a right. With privileges 
come responsibilities and this bill merely requires new foreign 
banks to satisfy the minister as to how they will meet those 
responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this debate on Bill 
C-335 introduced by the member for Don Valley North.
<P>
	The aim of this bill is to amend the Bank Act in order to require, 
as it says in the summary of the bill, the minister to consider 
commitment to serving small and medium size enterprises in 
Canada as a factor in a decision whether to grant letters patent to a 
foreign bank to operate in Canada.
<P>
	In other words, so the ordinary folks may understand, the intent 
of this bill is to add another condition to those already governing 
foreign banks wanting to do business in Canada, a sort of 
requirement to provide more help to small and medium businesses.
<P>
	I would first like to point out that there are already, as I have just 
mentioned, conditions governing the entry of new banks into the 
Canadian market. They should be identified, before we discuss the 
relevance of the condition added by the member for Don Valley 
North.
<P>
	Section 27 of the Bank Act provides a number of conditions 
foreign banks must satisfy in order to receive their letters patent, 
and they are as follows: the nature and sufficiency of the financial 
resources of the applicant or applicants as a source of continuing 
financial support for the bank. They want to know whether the bank 
will be viable once it is operating in Canada.
<P>
	The second condition is the soundness and feasibility of plans of 
the applicant or applicants for the future conduct and development 
of the business of the bank.
<P>
	The third is the business record and experience of the applicant 
or applicants.
<P>
	The fourth condition is whether the association will be operated 
responsibly by persons who are fit as to the character, competence 
and experience suitable for involvement in the operation of a 
financial institution.
<P>
	Finally, the fifth and last condition, the best interests of the 
financial system in Canada.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-335 is to add one of these conditions, and, 
again, this is to require, or to encourage, the banks-this is not 
made clear in the various clauses in the bill-to assist small and 
medium sized businesses. It would be hard not to be in favour of 
this. Of course we recognize the good intentions of this bill and, as 
far as its principle is concerned, we have no objection to such a 
condition being added.
<P>
	It would, however, be a good idea to clarify a number of points. 
Perhaps it is a printing error, or merely an error in the French 
version, but since I am a former French teacher, these are matters 
of interest to me.
<P>
	In clause 2 of the bill, where small and medium enterprises are 
defined, a medium size enterprise is defined as follows in 
paragraph (<I>a</I>), and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``moyenne entreprise'' Entreprise qui, avec les entreprises qu'elle contrôle et celles 
qui la contrôlent:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) soit compte au plus cent, mais moins de cinq cents, employés-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	There seems to a problem with the wording. My understanding 
of this section is that a medium size enterprise is an enterprise that 
has more than 100 employees and fewer than 500. That is what is 
meant.
<P>
	In paragraph (b), there is also a reference to a medium size 
enterprise that has an activity other than manufacturing, an 
enterprise that has more than 50 employees but no more than 500 
employees. We should say fewer than 500 employees. I therefore 
suggest that the hon. member check the wording of clause 2 and 
perhaps make appropriate corrections that would improve the 
clarity of his bill.
<P>
	A few moments ago I said we had no objections to the purpose of 
this bill which is to ensure that the banks serve small and medium 
size businesses, especially at this time of the year when most banks 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6883"> 6883 </A></B>
<P>
file their financial statements and we see fantastic, even excessive 
profits being made by Canada's chartered banks.
<P>
	This week, the Bank of Nova Scotia announced profits of over $1 
billion. Last week, it was the Bank of Montreal announcing profits 
of more than $1 billion. We can expect that next week, at the latest, 
the Royal Bank will confirm a substantial increase in its profits.
<P>
	When we look at the profits banks make on the backs of the little 
people, it stands to reason they should care about small and 
medium size businesses. We should not have to tell them so.
<P>
	I also want to take this opportunity to point out the work done by 
the hon. member for Portneuf. Last week, together with colleagues 
from the other parties in this House, he presented a request to 
Canada's chartered banks, asking them to reduce the interest rates 
charged on credit card balances. We all know these rates are 
extortionate, and this is not an overstatement. In some cases, we 
would call it outright robbery. I think the banks will have to 
examine their consciences. If this debate does no more than recall 
these facts, it will have achieved something.
<P>
	As for the bill itself, I would like to add a few comments. I said 
earlier that the wording of the sections defining small and medium 
size enterprises was not entirely satisfactory. And I think defining a 
small or medium size business on the basis of number of 
employees alone also creates problem. There should be other 
criteria such as turnover.
<P>
	The bill gives the impression that it is up to the minister to grant 
or not to grant letters patent to a foreign bank to operate on the 
Canadian market. I think there may be a conflict of interest if the 
minister alone is responsible for the decision. There should be 
more details in the section that deals with the decision to be made 
by the minister.
<P>
	In concluding, I wish to point out that this bill is not a votable 
item. We in the official opposition support the purpose of the bill, 
but we want to take this opportunity to point out to the members of 
this House, and especially to the government, the need for a 
broader debate on the activities of banks in Canada and especially 
on how their enormous profits are used.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I agree with one of the premises underlying the hon. 
member's bill. Canada's financial system would benefit from more 
competition generally and foreign competition in particular. This 
view is reflected in the Reform Party's minority amendment to the 
government's report on the hearings on the review of the financial 
sector held by the finance committee this fall. In this amendment 
we opposed the government's proposed legislation which would 
have made it more difficult and expensive for foreign banks to 
operate in Canada.
<P>
	However, I cannot agree with the second part of the hon. 
member's legislative initiative which would require foreign banks 
to commit themselves to increased lending to small business as part 
of obtaining a licence to operate in Canada. I oppose this provision 
on two grounds.
<P>
	First, it is out of touch with a modern relationship between 
business and government. It is sometimes efficient and equitable 
for government to set general rules of operation to assure public 
safety, as for example the rule which requires banks to maintain 
equity at a certain per cent of its deposit base. This rule assures the 
systemic stability of the banking system in case of a serious 
economic slowdown and many bankruptcies.
<P>
	However, it is not wise for the government to set out specific 
rules about the composition of the banks' loan portfolios. Such 
regulation represents an indirect tax on the banks which they pass 
on to other clients. It also represents an indirect subsidy-
