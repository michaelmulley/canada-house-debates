	<B>Mr. Bob Wood (Nipissing):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
express my concerns to the House regarding the proposed 
changes to the electoral boundaries and in particular to those 
changes which would affect the ridings in northern Ontario.
<P>
	The present proposal calls for the elimination of two seats in 
northern Ontario. It is my view that this would lead to a further 
erosion of the voice of northerners in Parliament. It would 
reinforce the image that northern Ontario is a sparsely populated 
hinterland whose concerns and aspirations really do not need to 
be heard.
<P>
	In realigning these boundaries the commission formulated all 
its changes based on population levels alone. Certainly this is 
not the most comprehensive method which could be used for 
such an important undertaking.
<P>
	Northern Ontario encompasses two-thirds of the province and 
is home for a significant number of French, English and native 
Canadians. Our region is as diverse as any other region in 
Canada. Therefore it should have electoral boundaries which 
encapsulate those regional enclaves which share many of the 
same economic, geographic and cultural characteristics.
<P>
	I believe that if these new boundaries are accepted they will

violence is not accepted in any case.
<P>
	As this is the International Year of the Family we all need to 
put a stop to the senseless abuse of women and children. 
Awareness and thinking are a start. However only a positive,

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The government's decision to close the military college in 
Saint-Jean is ill-advised. The government knows it yet 
obstinately refuses to reverse its position, despite the fact that it 
has now had to adjust downward the reported savings it would 
make as a result of this decision.
<P>
	Furthermore, in an awkward attempt to save face, it is 
proposing to strike a fool's deal with Quebec whereby it would 
lease the college facilities to the province for $1 a year. Since 
the college would be stripped of its very soul, this is indeed a 
poisoned gift.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not recognize that there is something 
shameful about this proposal to lease the empty facilities in 
Saint-Jean for $1 a year and that in so doing, the government 
would be shifting the burden of the college's operating costs 
onto Quebec's shoulders, without even giving the province the 
opportunity to buy the facilities?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have discussed this matter with the Premier of Quebec who told 
me that he could make use of the facilities at Saint-Jean. The 
federal government no longer needs them because the strength 
of our military work force is being reduced to 65,000. One can 
easily understand why the United States, with two million 
soldiers, has three military colleges. However, with a military 
work force of 65,000, Canada does not need three military 
colleges.
<P>
	However, if these facilities can be of some use to the 
provincial government or to other agencies, we will be happy to 
make some arrangements with them because this would save 
some jobs in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. We are proposing a 
reasonable solution to a specific problem. The government had 
no choice but to close some of Canada's military colleges 
because it had to reduce defence spending. Had we listened to 
the Leader of the Opposition, not only would we have closed 
Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean, but we would also have 
shut down CFB Bagotville located in his region.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am convinced that, despite telephone pressure from 
the leader of the government, the Quebec Premier will put 
Quebec's interests before those of the two Liberal parties.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that, in case of a likely and 
quite advisable refusal by Quebec to become a mere tenant of 
the federal administration, his government will save much less 
than expected by closing the college in Saint-Jean, as it will 
have to continue shelling out at least  $6 million a year in taxes 
and upkeep for the white elephant it created?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
that were the case, no military base should ever be closed. Sure, 
it creates problems. But to hear the Leader of the Opposition say 
that we should not try to maintain a certain level of employment 
at the military college with the provincial government's 
co-operation, when he went over there to take part in a 
demonstration with people who, only 22 years ago, were 
opposed to a Quebec university awarding a diploma to 
Saint-Jean graduates because it was a federal presence of the 
Canadian armed forces in Quebec, and to see that Quebec 
nationalists and the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society would do such 
an about-face, that is too much for me!
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will give more of it to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> I find it very strange to hear him say, in 
sugary tones, ``Who will criticize us for creating a minimum of 
jobs in Saint-Jean?'' It is like the fox saying, ``We should still 
keep a few chickens in the henhouse'' after it just finished eating 
a few of them.
<P>
	<B>An. hon. member:</B> Right on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a 
constructive proposal to the Prime Minister by guaranteeing the 
Bloc's full support for a decision to keep a French-language 
college in Saint-Jean and an English-language college in 
Kingston by reducing in an equitable fashion the number of 
officer cadets in both colleges, so as to maintain the opportunity 
for francophones to prepare for a military career in their 
community and in their language.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as we said, only 16 per cent of French-speaking officers in the 
Canadian Forces graduated from the college in Saint-Jean. They 
are giving the impression that officers who attended Laval 
University, the University of Sherbrooke, the University of 
Montreal, the University of Quebec in Chicoutimi or the 
University of Quebec in Trois-Rivières instead of the college in 
Saint-Jean are not as good because they did not go to a military 
college.
<P>
	With our smaller armed forces, the military college is no 
longer necessary. The Leader of the Opposition told us we 
should cut defence spending by 25 per cent. If we had followed 
his advice in Quebec, we would have closed not only the 
military college in Saint-Jean but also the military base in 
Bagotville and probably other bases in Quebec. But we found 
the Opposition Leader's proposals unacceptable under the 
current circumstances. We must maintain a certain level of 
employment and a higher level of military forces than he 
recommended.

figures, with no breakdown whatsoever, which do not reflect.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, before making the 
regrettable decision to close the only French speaking military 
college, did the Minister of National Defence ask for a complete 
review of the financial impact of maintaining two colleges with 
a reduced number of cadets, based on established objectives? 
Did the minister have a complete and accurate review done?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first, the Collège de Saint-Jean and the Royal Military College 
in Kingston are both bilingual institutions. Yes they are.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice): </B>Yes they are. As I said in this 
House, there are graduates from Kingston who took all their 
courses in French and also wrote their exams in French. The hon. 
member once again showed his ignorance earlier when he said 
that English-speaking cadets will have to go to Kingston to 
become officers. This is not the case.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	They will do just as well in Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, 
Toronto or Halifax. They will attend local universities and 
obtain the required officers' training. In fact, only a small 
proportion, approximately 15 per cent, of English-speaking 
cadets currently receive their degree from Kingston, Saint-Jean 
or Royal Roads. In other words, the college only serves to train a 
very small fraction of officers.
<P>
	Those are the facts. But we did not listen to the opposition. I 
do not think the hon. member is very committed to defending 
Saint-Jean. Yesterday, he made a big fuss at a press conference 
which lasted five minutes, and when the media people were 
finished taking pictures, he left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the 
Prime Minister does not realize is that it did not take longer than 
five minutes to see through the government and its charade.
<P>
	Since, by his own admission, the Prime Minister cannot 
provide us with a satisfactory answer-and neither can his 
Minister of Defence who has been ``shut out'' of this 
matter-since he admits not having commissioned a study on 
the costs of maintaining both colleges with a smaller student 
population, how can he seriously talk about saving $23 million? 
On what basis can he make that statement?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have told this House several times-never mind how loudly the 
hon. member puts his question-that it does not take endless 
studies to see that in the United States, they have three military 
colleges for two million servicemen and women. We have 
reduced our military spending as suggested by the opposition 
and the Canadian Armed Forces now have a strength of only 
65,000.
<P>
	I do not need to spend more money to see or to have experts 
tell me that we do not need three military colleges for 65,000 
members. We will have one good bilingual college in Kingston 
instead of two, one in Kingston and the other in Saint-Jean, as 
we had before.

the Quebec hydro tower; and second, the failure of the federal 
budget to reverse the choking trend of public debts and deficits.
<P>
	What is the Prime Minister prepared to say to investors and 
lenders to alleviate their fears concerning these two factors?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

continues to be very strong. Of course I am not going to make 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2355"> 2355 </A></B>
<P>
any comment on the value of the Canadian dollar, which 
fluctuates.
<P>
The hon. member is a little late. I spent 27 years of my life 
commenting on the prospective value of the Canadian dollar. He 
missed it by four months. I am sorry but he is four months too 
late.
<P>
	I have been told by the Prime Minister not to comment on the 
value of the Canadian dollar. However I will comment on the 
Canadian economy. It is strong. We have had manufacturers' 
shipments up 7 per cent year over year. We have had business 
confidence improving over the last little while and consumer 
confidence has been improving somewhat as well.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is nothing new and nothing substantive in what has been 
said. All of this was said before and yet investors and lenders are 
not reassured.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister say something more substantive? 
Does he or does he not have a contingency plan to deal with 
foreign perceptions of political and financial instability in 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canada is a very good and very stable country. We have had a 
good budget presented and we have a plan that is very clear.
<P>
	The market can speculate all it wants. However we are not 
changing the policies of the government on speculation in the 
market from one day to the other because investors from abroad 
know very well that there is not a better place in the world to 
invest than Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister mentions the budget but the budget is part of 
the problem. The fall of the dollar and the rise in interest rates 
for whatever reasons call into question the most basic 
assumptions in the budget.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister as a bare minimum direct the finance 
minister to prepare a fiscal contingency plan including a 
moratorium on all new spending programs to increase 
international confidence in the Canadian dollar?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker 
the Minister of Finance presented a budget in this House. It will 
be voted on in a few days. We are not going to have a budget 
every time the leader of the Reform Party wants one.
<P>
	We need political stability. We need a good plan. We said to 
the market that we will be reducing expenditures and we are 
doing that. Today some people are complaining because we are 
reducing expenditures, but we are keeping to our plan. We have 
a good plan and we will achieve our goal of 3 per cent of GDP for 
the deficit within three years.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government is desperately trying to broaden the tax base and 
regularly puts out feelers on how this could be done. Its latest 
effort came yesterday when some Liberal members supported 
applying the GST to health care and medication, which I think is 
pretty outrageous.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister share the position taken by his 
members who, in the course of their work on the GST review, 
came out openly in favour of taxing health care and medication?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we appointed a committee to review the GST, as we said we 
would, and its members received submissions. All parties are 
represented on the committee. In the end we will have a report, 
and we will examine that report and then decide whether it will 
become government policy.
<P>
	We do not want to act without consulting the members of this 
House. The hon. member complains that Liberal members are 
not afraid of having ideas; I am very proud of members who go 
to committees and are not afraid of exploring new avenues. I 
need their help, but in the end, the government makes the 
decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
these developments are very disturbing, and I would ask the 
Prime Minister to be a little less flippant in his answers, because 
this particular issue is fundamental. We are not talking about 
submissions by witnesses but about his own members who came 
out in favour of applying the GST to health care and medication.
<P>
	I will direct my question again to the Prime Minister. Does he 
or does he not support applying a new GST to health care and 
medication? That is what people want to know.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member knows perfectly well that all taxes collected by 
the government go into the government's consolidated fund and 
that this money is used to pay for all the government's programs.
<P>
	Perhaps some people will suggest that we should 
compartmentalize expenditures and revenues, but that is pure 
speculation. The government intends to go on collecting taxes 
and taking these taxes to maintain health care programs. 
Furthermore, our party has made a clear commitment to 
maintaining a free and universal health care system for all 
Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister stated that the business 
community reacted positively to the recent budget. I believe he 
is overstating the case. The fact is that the business community 
gave qualified acceptance based on the finance minister's 
promise of a second round of spending cuts. The Prime Minister 
has publicly contradicted the finance minister, saying that all 
the cuts for the next three years are in this budget.
<P>
	What assurances can the Prime Minister give business people 
that promises made by the finance minister will be kept by this 
government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, the budget was quite 
clear in its representations as to what budget cuts would be 
made. Those budget cuts will reach our goal of a deficit of 3 per 
cent of GDP in the third year of our mandate. That was a clear 
and unequivocal statement in the budget and that remains. It was 
well received by the business community despite what the 
member says.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government's failure to seriously address Canada's deficit and 
debt problem directly contributed and contributes to the 
increases in interest rates and a drop in the dollar.
<P>
	On behalf of business people and Canadians who want real 
jobs, when will the Prime Minister recognize the real problem, 
the high cost of financing the national debt? When will the 
government begin to lower its spending so that we can lower 
taxes and really help the economy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, the last employment 
statistics indicated that jobs went up in this country in every 
region.
<P>
	It is this government's budget that has contributed to that 
strength in employment. It is this government's budget that is 
going to contribute to the strength of this country's economy in

question is for the Prime Minister. Last Saturday, along with 
more than 1,200 people representing labour, community and 
citizens groups as well as the assembly of bishops, I attended the 
forum on social solidarity in Quebec. These people have joined 
forces to counter rising poverty in Quebec and cuts to social 
programs.
<P>
	Will the government admit the obvious and will it recognize 
that cutting programs at a time when people are in dire straits is 
not the way to curb the deficit?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> To begin with Mr. Speaker, the opinions 
expressed by the demonstration last week express the concerns 
we all have about ending poverty in this country. We as a 
government are very committed to that goal.
<P>
	It is for that reason we have undertaken a major review and 
reconstruction of most of our programs. In so doing we can 
enable those who are presently long term unemployed, who have 
been out of the workforce for a long time and who do not receive 
proper training, to have the resources dedicated to their ability 
to get back into the workplace.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has said many times that the best solution 
to poverty is a job. We are very much dedicated to reorganizing 
and reallocating the resources of this government along with the 
co-operation of the provinces to tackle this very serious 
problem and to give some real hope to those people who were 
demonstrating last weekend.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, in spite of 
his magnanimous remarks, will the minister not concede that 
what unemployed workers need is a real employment strategy,

reduction policy which calls for cuts to social programs?

<P>
	The budget presented by the Minister of Finance took a 
number of initiatives: Stimulating growth in the areas of high 
technology and small business by developing a whole new 
strategy for giving access to capital. Funding a major 
infrastructure program that will kick-start the economy. 
Funding a number of initiatives to deal with the unemployment 
problems of young people. Initiating reductions in payroll taxes

for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister sits here today and tells us that he is not 
going to do anything with the budget. The minister of state sits 
here and says that everything is okay and everything is great in 
Canada.
<P>
	It is time we recognized there are signals not only from this 
government that are harming the marketplace, but there are 
signals from the marketplace that the Prime Minister and the 
ministers of this government should take into consideration, and 
they should do it today.
<P>
	I wonder if the Prime Minister recognizes, and this is one of 
the signals that he should recognize, that interest rate spreads on 
10-year Canada-U.S. bonds have increased since the budget 
came down and continue to increase. This government must act.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Would the hon. member please put his 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the Prime 
Minister recognize those signals from the marketplace and if he 
does, what is he going to do about them in terms of rearranging, 
changing and adjusting the fiscal plan of this government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. 
member for his reading of the marketplace and how interested 
he is in interest rate spreads. I have studied them quite 
considerably over the years and would tell him that interest rate 
spreads at the present time are not much different from what 
they have been. Indeed, the short term rates are very much lower 
than they have been in the recent past. Our budget is a dead-on 
plan.
<P>
	We look forward to seeing that budget and the Canadian 
economy prosper considerably in the year to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
government recognize there are other signals out there?
<P>
	Long term rates are on the increase, 1 per cent above what was 
projected in the budget. We have a drop in the dollar value. 
There are foreign investors that have lost confidence in 
investing and have taken their money out of this country.
<P>
	What is the Prime Minister prepared to do under those 
conditions to adjust the budget to meet the needs of the signals 
in the marketplace?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I suggest that the hon. 
member look at the budget a little more carefully.
<P>
	The interest rate assumptions in the budget for long term rates 
are, as he states, a little bit low but short term rates are where the 
changes take place. Long term bond rate changes affect maybe a 
seventh of the total over any year.
<P>
	I would say that our budget is dead on in that. With the interest 
rate assumptions that we have made in the budget and if the 
interest rates continue where they are right now, we will come in 
at a lower cost of interest than we had in our budget.

their dealings with government.
<P>

How does the government plan to fulfil its promise to introduce 
the single business registration number by May 1994 and how 
will this number reduce costs?

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> I

we will introduce it Canada-wide. Over the succeeding two 
years businesses will have the opportunity right across the 
country of opting into the single business number.
<P>
	It will make a substantial difference, although it is a relatively 
straightforward and simple change, to the cost of compliance

<P>
	On April 25, 1986 in the House, when she was in the

which ministers could expand their own political bases and their

rooms. The ministerial regional office in Halifax has a 
washroom; it does not have a powder room. Perhaps I could use 
one.
<P>
	However I want to say to the hon. member that the purpose of 
ministerial regional offices is to cut costs so that ministers of the 
crown can carry out their responsibilities across the country. 
That is why in Quebec City, Montreal, Halifax and elsewhere 
across the country ministerial regional offices are put in place. It 
is to service the people of Canada at a much lower cost, as 
opposed to going to private hotels to retain the services therein.
<P>

expenditure figures which I could only obtain under access to

spending spree took place in one of these regional offices just 
prior to the 1993 election.

Speaker, that was not the question. Therefore, it is not surprising 
that I did not receive an answer.
<P>
	There is, however, one question that the minister can surely 
answer, as it relates to a matter that is not before the courts. I 
will speak slowly so that the minister hears it clearly.
<P>
	This question relates to the argument of genetic purity used to 
justify the eviction of the families from Kahnawake. Does the 
minister not recognize that this kind of argument reflects a 
discriminatory attitude which blatantly contravenes the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not really care if the hon. 
member speaks quickly or slowly; I understand the question.
<P>
	The question that he asked is before the courts in the sense 
that the charter of rights will be addressed along with the Indian 
Act. If there is an adverse reaction it is the responsibility of the 
House and the government to come back with legislation that 
reflects these things. At that time the member may have to deal 
with it.
<P>
	Hopefully it will be dealt with to the hon. member's 
satisfaction before the courts in which I have more faith than he 
does.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	Why is the federal civil service offered the six months' pay in 
lieu provision of the workforce adjustment plan and in the case 
of the military up to two years' pay for adjustment for base 
closures when we already have a UI plan in place as a safety net 
for people who become unemployed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the member knows, a significant number of people from the 
defence department are being asked to leave, to retire, and they 
are being given departure incentives to do so. This is normal 
when dealing with some 16,500 people in jobs that we need to 
remove in order to meet the budget commitments with respect to 
reducing the deficit.
<P>
	That program has been put in place. They can choose not to 
accept it if they do not wish to, in which case the workforce 
adjustment policy would come into play and they would be 
offered an alternative job. I am talking about the civilians who 
are roughly 50 per cent of that group.
<P>
	We have dealt with these people in a most fair and equitable 
fashion in an attempt to reduce the size, to reduce the budget. At 
the same time we are providing some protection for our 
employees which is a priority of the government. If they can be 
retrained and go into something else, we want to ensure they will 
have an opportunity to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, I point out 
it is a very rich program and I would argue it is a two-tier system 
of unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Considering that the Auditor General has been very critical of 
the application of the workforce adjustment program, will the 
Treasury Board president commit to reconsider the need for this 
program and the new adjustment plan for the military, 
considering that we will soon have a reformed UI plan to deal 
with these types of problems.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
can only repeat that in a very short period of time we have to 
reduce the size of the military in order to meet our deficit 
reduction plan.
<P>
	Does the Reform Party not want us to meet our deficit 
reduction plan? Does it not want us to get spending down? That 
is what we are trying to do.
<P>
	We cannot move that many people that quickly without some 
incentive program to help them and that is exactly what we are 
doing. The costs of the program will be met and we will still 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2361"> 2361 </A></B>
<P>
meet our deficit reduction program of getting to 3 per cent of 
GDP in three years.

	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if I could raise a point of order 
with you to get your guidance for the entire House during 
question period.
<P>
	It has been the tradition of the House that questions arising 
from committees not be raised during question period. That is 
consistent with Beauchesne's section 411(3).
<P>
	A pattern has been developing among all members of raising 
matters with ministers of the crown that are in fact before 
committees. I wonder if you could give us some guidance as to 
what your expectations are.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As a general rule the Chair would of course 
discourage any questions on matters which are before a 
committee at that time and the Chair will try to see to it that if 
there are questions on matters before a committee that they not 
be put in the House.
<P>
	That would be the intention of the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate that you are trying to clarify this and I appreciate the 
parliamentary secretary for bringing it up.
<P>
	Maybe you could also clarify something for him. In his 
answer to me yesterday during question period he raised the fact 
that the matter had been brought up in committee. I wish you 
would clarify that as well, both the question and the answer.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I refer the hon. member to Beauchesne's 
section 411(3):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some further limitations seem to be generally understood. A question may 
not:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) seek information about proceedings in a committee which has not yet made its 
report to the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are dealing here with the proceedings themselves. If there 
are general questions the Chair would be more apt to permit 
them. That is why many times when questions are put I ask hon. 
members to rephrase them so they will be more general in 
nature. I hope this will be of guidance to all hon. members.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply 
want to emphasize that of course we can refer to what is going on 
in a committee. It is customary to be able to refer to it in a 
question and not necessarily to deal with an issue under 
discussion. That is the nuance which the hon. member should 
respect.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is not only a nuance; it is understood that we 
can ask general questions about committees, but I would prefer 
that we not ask questions about committee procedures because 
that is now covered by our Standing Orders.

critics, some of whom were unable to be here on the previous

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased on the 
National Capital's Celebration of International Water Day to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2362"> 2362 </A></B>
<P>
able to rise to inform the House that another red book 
commitment of the government is being kept. It proves that as a 
government we mean what we say and we are serious about 
governing in a new and sustainable way. It is particularly 
significant on the National Capital's Celebration of 
International  Water Day because water is the basic form of 
sustenance that each human being needs to live.
<P>
	Earlier today I wrote to the able chair of the Standing 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development to 
ask that the committee study the ways in which the concept of an 
environmental auditor general might be instituted to ensure that 
our government's actions are carried out in a sustainable 
manner. In doing so the government keeps several of the Prime 
Minister's commitments. By seeking the advice of the standing 
committee we recognize in a non-partisan manner the 
importance of consulting members of Parliament before we 
introduce legislation. By asking the committee to hold hearings 
we recognize the importance of consulting Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	In <I>Creating Opportunity</I>, we stated clearly that the 
environmental agenda can no longer be ignored and that 
government needs to recognize the fundamental link between a 
healthy economy and a healthy environment. We said that all 
government departments need to adopt economic and 
environmental principles that converge, integrate, are 
accountable and show leadership.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On February 22 my colleague, the Minister of Finance, kept 
our first red book promise. He announced a task force of 
government, industry and non-governmental organizations to 
carry out a review of the barriers and disincentives that currently 
exist in the tax system to sound environmental government 
practices, and to find effective ways to use economic 
instruments to support sustainable development.
<P>
	Canadians are justifiably proud to have a Minister of Finance 
who recognizes that economics and the environment are not 
competing agendas but complementary realities. I congratulate 
him and I know that the members of this House feel as I do.
<P>
	``Creating Opportunity'' laid out our plan for an 
environmental auditor general as the second task of the 
government's move toward sustainability. That is why I have 
asked the committee to look at what the focus of an 
environmental auditor general might be. Members of the 
committee will consider how an assessment of current 
government practices and policies and departmental policies 
and practices should be incorporated into the functions of an 
environmental auditor general.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have asked the committee to consider means by which we 
can achieve our objective properly, keeping in mind the 
government's commitment to budgetary restraint. In particular, 
I want to avoid duplication and overlap.
<P>
	The committee might consider whether we can learn from the 
experiences of provinces or other countries which have created 
similar offices.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is the government's hope that the committee will be able to 
report to the House of Commons by the end of May.
<P>
	The point is simple. The government under the leadership of 
the Prime Minister is determined to place environment at the top 
of Canada's agenda, determined on this National Capital's 
Celebration of International Water Day to make our country a 
leader in sustainable development.
<P>
	If we are serious then our government must show leadership 
in getting our own house in order. We cannot expect high 
standards of others, whether they be business, labour or other 
countries, unless we impose and demand high standards from 
ourselves.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am continually grateful for the serious and non-partisan 
manner in which all members of this House approach the 
important environmental issues facing our country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure it is in that non-partisan spirit that the standing 
committee will examine the role of an environmental auditor 
general. I look forward to the wisdom of all the members of the 
committee and indeed all the members of the House of 
Commons on this serious initiative which will start the 
government on the road to putting sustainable development into 
action, not only by our words but also by our deeds.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the Minister of the Environment for sending us a copy of 
her ministerial statement this morning, and I urge her to keep 
doing so.
<P>
	As vice-chairman of the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development, I am pleased to be 
able to discuss in a non-partisan manner the role of a future 
environmental auditor general.
<P>
	I believe that the announcement made this afternoon by the 
Minister of the Environment clearly demonstrates her desire to 
keep the commitments made in the red book. So, the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2363"> 2363 </A></B>
<P>
promises it will consult us, as well as Canadians and Quebecers 
through public hearings.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	It is a good thing to consult, but the recent budget tabled by 
the Minister of Finance was a very concrete opportunity where 
the government could have demonstrated its will to do 
something about the environment.
<P>
	Of course, the Department of the Environment is one of the 
few whose budget was increased. We can only be thankful for 
this 4.1 per cent increase. However, some measures go against 
sustainable development, even if the minister alluded to a 
committee which will try to promote it. The best example of this 
short-term vision, which is the opposite of the objective of 
sustainable development, is the fact that the government 
increases-listen to this-the government increases by $18.4 
million the budget to clean up the St. Lawrence River, but 
reduces by $5 million the budget to clean up the Great Lakes, 
when we know that 40 per cent of the pollution in the St. 
Lawrence River comes from the Great Lakes. So much for 
sustainable development. On the one hand, the government 
increases the budget to clean up the river, while on the other 
hand it reduces the one for the polluted waters which flow into 
that river. Whatever happened to cohesion and co-operation 
between departments?
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment says that she wants to put an 
end to overlapping. Right now, the most obvious overlapping is 
the one blocking any action concerning the <I>Irving Whale</I>. 
Transport Canada commissions study after study that 
Environment Canada never sees and they keep sending the ball 
back and forth. In the end, nothing concrete comes of it. When 
you see two federal departments get in each other's way like 
that, thus delaying concrete action, it is easy to understand that 
the people of Quebec want to have in their own hands the power 
to make decisions.
<P>
	In her speech, the hon. minister stated, and I quote: ``The 
government is also determined to make our country a leader in 
sustainable development. The government will be able to show 
leadership in getting our own house in order''. The Official 
Opposition is prepared to believe these fine words except that, 
when we hear from Statistics Canada that this country exported 
200,000 tons of hazardous waste to Asia and Latin America 
from 1990 to 1993, we wonder if that is the kind of house 
cleaning involved in the ministers plans.
<P>
	The minister told us that the government and the Prime 
Minister must recognize the fundamental link between 
economic health and a healthy environment. She also praised the 
Minister of Finance for recognizing that economy and 
environment are not competing, but complementary.
<P>
	It is true that environmental considerations are prominent is 
the red book. It is also true that it conveys the importance of 
integrating the economy, and thus the industry, with the 
environment. This spirit of co-operation was made manifest by 
organizing consultations on the environmental industry last 
January.
<P>
	Why is there nothing then to that effect in <I>Growing Small 
Businesses</I>, the information booklet on new programs and 
guidelines for small business?
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	I was quite surprised, Mr. Speaker, to see there is no mention 
of environmental concerns anywhere in the document's 52 
pages.
<P>
	The government must give its support to this sector, either by 
implementing programs or by promoting initiatives to 
encourage the private sector to adopt a sustainable development 
approach.
<P>
	It makes good sense, politically, to table a budget allocating 
more money to the Department of the Environment. 
Unfortunately, these inconsistencies show that it is only a smoke 
screen.
<P>
	In closing, the Bloc Quebecois draws a parallel between the 
Auditor General of Canada and the environmental auditor 
general. Before rejoicing and showing off, we should know what 
kind of follow-up the government will give to the 
recommendations made by the environmental auditor general. If 
they are treated the same way as those made by the Auditor 
General of Canada, the situation is not very encouraging.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
compliment the Minister of the Environment on the initiatives 
announced today.
<P>
	The Reform Party looks forward to assisting the minister and 
Canadians in achieving her well intentioned objectives. I 
compliment the minister on asking advice from the standing 
committee because it is a non-partisan manner of consulting 
with members of Parliament and through them, Canadians.
<P>
	She has spoken about her government's commitment to 
budgetary restraint. I applaud her efforts to avoid overlap and 
duplication of environmental standards and enforcement 
between jurisdictions. Completing the process by May 31 will 
minimize the costs and frustration of a long drawn-out process.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports ensuring that all Canadians and 
their descendants dwell in a clean and healthy environment. The 
party supports sustainable development because without 
economic development and the income generated therefrom the 
environment will not be protected or enjoyed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2364"> 2364 </A></B>
<P>
The Reform Party supports the view that environmental 
considerations must carry equal weight with economic, social and 
technical considerations in the development of a project.
<P>
	The Liberal Party's red book statement on the environment 
closely parallels ours. On page 64 of the red book it states: ``It is 
past time for the federal government to act on this understanding 
by adopting economic and environmental agendas that 
converge''. However in appointing an auditor general the red 
book also states: ``Individuals could petition the environmental 
auditor general to conduct special investigations when they see 
environmental policies or laws being ignored or violated''.
<P>
	I acknowledge that in the minister's statement she said she 
wants the standing committee to look at the focus of an 
environmental auditor general. I believe this is exceptionally 
important because as a result of over eager activities of some 
extreme protectionists, some businesses are beginning to 
express concern about the potential of what I call green tape. 
Green tape is rules and regulations that could unnecessarily tie 
up reasonable, productive economic activity. They have 
expressed concern that the office of an environmental auditor 
general could easily become the captive of narrow interest 
groups.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party will be active participants in 
the process of examining the role of an environmental auditor 
general. As stated, we support sustainable development, 
recognizing that without economic development and the income 
generated therefrom the environment will not be protected or 
enjoyed.
<P>
	I agree with the statement the minister made about two 
months ago in this House that we all want to guarantee a 
prosperous economy, a healthy environment and a bright future 
for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point 
of order. With your permission I would like to seek consent of 
the House to make a brief statement as chair of the committee of 
the environment and sustainable development.

Kootenay East and the member for Comox-Alberni, I would 
like to assure the House that we are looking forward very much 
to completing this assignment.
<P>
	We will put our efforts into completing it in the spirit that has 
been expressed in this House in recent minutes. We will 
certainly endeavour to report to the House within the time 
limitation indicated by the minister. We look forward to 
implementing this promise contained in the red book of the last 
election campaign.
<P>
	We also look forward to the fact that in future Canada will 
have either an auditor general for the environment or a 
commissioner for the environment. We look forward very much 
to keeping other promises we made in the last campaign.

1,300 more names on a petition to add to the several thousand 
that have already been presented from my riding.
<P>
	These petitioners draw to the attention of the House of 
Commons that sections 41 and 42 of the Constitution Act, 1982 
provide that an amendment to the Constitution of Canada in 
relation to certain matters may be initiated by a resolution of the 
House of Commons.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to follow up on its election promise to 
protect and strengthen Canada's publishing industry by renewing the Baie 
Comeau policy adopted in 1985 and by declaring that a public investigation will 
be held into the circumstances surrounding the takeover of Ginn Publishing by 
Paramount.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, there are many different reasons for 
submitting a question for debate. For instance, a decision was 
made and one feels it should be questioned because it was 
wrong, or it may be necessary to shed some light on the 
circumstances surrounding the decision-making process or on 
what was actually done. Or again, one would want to prevent a 
recurrence of something that just happened and which was 
unacceptable.
<P>
	We have here a situation where all these reasons converge to 
require a public debate on a transaction that has just been 
authorized by the government. We are, of course, referring to the 
decision made by the government and the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage on February 18  to authorize the sale of Ginn 
Publishing Canada, a Canadian publishing company based in 
Toronto, to Paramount, the American communications and 
publishing giant.
<P>
	The conclusion of this transaction is shrouded in mystery. I 
would say it is an enigma. Consider the following sequence of 
events: everything started in July 1985, when Cabinet met in 
Baie-Comeau and adopted, at the request of the Minister of 
Communications at the time, the so-called Baie Comeau policy 
which was aimed at further protecting the Canadian publishing 
industry.
<P>
	The gist of the policy was, first of all, to authorize the creation 
of new Canadian publishing companies or the acquisition of 
Canadian publishing companies, provided, and I quote, ``the 
proposed investment takes place within the framework of a joint 
enterprise controlled by Canadians''.
<P>
	Second, the policy provided that in the case of the direct 
acquisition of a company controlled by foreign interests but 
operating in Canada, the transaction could be authorized, 
provided that control over ownership was transferred to 
Canadians within two years, at a price reflecting market value. 
Third, the strongest component of the Baie Comeau policy, in 
my opinion, is the section pertaining to indirect transactions 
which ensures that in the case of foreign takeovers, Canadian 
publishing houses controlled by foreign interests are returned to 
Canadian owners. This means that 51 per cent of the shares of 
these Canadian subsidiaries must be transferred to a Canadian 
owner in the event the parent company operating abroad 
undergoes a change of ownership.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	What are the objectives of this policy? Many members of the 
cultural community have congratulated themselves for 
supporting it. The following assessment was made by the hon. 
member for Mount-Royal, the Liberal Party critic at the time, 
who had been following this issue very closely. On June 7, 1993, 
she delivered in this House a speech in which she assessed the 
implications of this Baie Comeau policy. She asked what the 
results of this policy were? She stated the following and I quote: 
``Initially it was very exciting. It was very positive''.
<P>
	And she goes on to give examples. ``The major retail chain, 
W.H. Smith, became Canadian controlled. An important book 
wholesaler, John Coutts Ltd., returned to Canadian ownership. 
The Doubleday Book Clubs were brought under Canadian 
control with a resulting fivefold increase in sales of Canadian 
authored books. For the first time''-still according to the 
Liberal critic at the time last year-``Canadian controlled 
publishers handled an increasing share of the distribution of 
imported books''.
<P>
	Let me continue to describe the sequence of events. In 1986, 
one of the first effects of the policy was-and here we are 
getting to the heart of the matter-to require Paramount to 
return Ginn Publishing and G.L.C.  Publishers to Canadian 
control. And events continued to unfold.
<P>
	In 1989, after the expiration of the two-year period required 
by regulation following Paramount's decision to put Ginn 
Publishing and G.L.C. Publishers up for sale, since no private 
buyer had expressed an interest in these companies, the federal 
government, acting through the Canada Investment 
Corporation, intervened to acquire 51 per cent of the shares of 
these two companies at a cost of $10 million. The government 
had no choice but to act to ensure that Paramount did not retain 
control over its shares following the expiration of the two-year 
waiting period.
<P>
	A very important event occurred in January 1992, namely the 
amending of the Baie Comeau policy. This came about as a 
result of the enormous pressure exerted on the federal 
government and on the Conservatives, primarily by the 
Americans. The Conservative government caved in to these 
pressures and watered down its Baie Comeau policy which had 
achieved excellent results since 1985, even according to the 
Liberals in the House. So, the policy was amended. While the 
direct takeover of Canadian publishing houses by foreign 
interests was still prohibited, as far as indirect takeovers were 
concerned, however, foreign investors could now acquire 
ownership of a Canadian publishing house, provided that they 
made commitments likely to benefit the Canadian publishing 
industry. They were required to demonstrate that Canada was 
likely to derive a net benefit from this transaction. This change 
occurred in 1992.
<P>
	We can ask ourselves what all of these provisions mean and 
why the fuss over the publishing sector? The answer is that we 
wanted to step in to protect the publishing industry, a cultural 
industry that is clearly very much at risk in Canada. In 1991-92, 
Canadian publishers controlled only 50 per cent of a $1.2 billion 
market. During this same period, 80 per cent of Canadian 
authors had their works published by Canadian book publishers. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2369"> 2369 </A></B>
<P>
The imbalance between the two is clear. Canadian publishers are 
far more likely than foreign controlled publishing houses to 
publish the works of Canadian authors.
<P>
	Therefore, since the publishing industry is important to 
Canada and to Quebec and indeed to all Canadians and since it 
plays a meaningful role in the protection of our cultural identity, 
it must be protected. And that was what the Baie Comeau policy 
purported to do.
<P>
	Of course, when the policy was watered down, howls of 
protest arose from cultural circles. Everyone in cultural 
circles-I would say it was a rare case of unanimity in Canada 
and Quebec-protested, including the Liberal Party now in 
office.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	On February 14, 1992, we heard in this House the hon. 
member for Mount Royal, who is now a member of the Liberal 
Cabinet, complain about what happened and ask very tough 
questions to the then Minister of Communications, and I quote: 
``Is the government going to permit the foreign takeover of 
Canadian publishing subsidiaries like Harper-Collins, 
Collier-Macmillan and Grolier which are presently before 
Investment Canada? Is it going to sell off $150 million of our 
book publishing industry to foreigners?'' That amount was 
worth a lot more back then.
<P>
	So here we are today with a new government whose members 
harshly criticized the watering-down by the Conservatives of 
the very welcome measures they had taken in July 1985.
<P>
	We would have thought that this government would tighten 
the screws in line with the old Liberal tradition to defend 
Canada's cultural identity. We thought that a Liberal 
government more sensitive to the important realities and 
symbols of cultural identity would come to the rescue of this 
threatened industry. The red book even contained a very explicit 
commitment in this regard, that the government does not like to 
quote very often but that I will quote today: ``A Liberal 
government will help Canadian books, films, and sound 
recordings to increase their share of the domestic market 
through the establishment of policies and legislation with 
respect to marketing, distribution, and exhibition''. They talk 
about culture in very lyrical terms that must have won them 
many votes in the last election.
<P>
	And I quote: ``Culture is the very essence of national identity, 
the bedrock of national sovereignty and national pride. At a time 
when globalization and the information and communications 
revolution are erasing national borders, Canada needs more than 
ever to commit itself to cultural development''.
<P>
	Nobody could have put it better. But as for honouring its 
commitment to protect cultural industries, the first time this 
government was put to the test, it failed miserably and 
disappointed a lot of people.
<P>
	I am talking, of course, about Ginn Publishing that Paramount 
had to return to Canadian interests in 1989 under the Baie 
Comeau policy. We do not know exactly what happened, we may 
find out in this debate, but Paramount eventually managed to get 
Ginn back with the agreement, I would say the complicity or the  
complacency at least, of the heritage minister. How could a great 
victory for Canadian cultural identity be erased with a stroke of 
a pen by the minister who must defend Canada's heritage, a 
member of a government that promised to do the opposite? How 
is it possible?
<P>
	Because the current legislation and even the 1992 guidelines 
contained the policies considered by the Liberal Party to be 
diluted, feeble, insufficient. Even the Liberal Party had, through 
its heritage minister, violated the Tories' already very diluted 
rules. In other words, they were more lax than the Conservatives 
themselves by allowing Paramount to regain Ginn Publishing. 
Under the rules in the 1992 policies, it should have been 
demonstrated that Ginn was in financial trouble, which is not the 
case. It should also have been demonstrated that Canadian 
buyers had the opportunity to make an offer. Nothing of the sort 
happened, no matter what the people opposite are saying. All 
Canadian publishers feel they have been pushed aside. All 
Canadian publishers are unanimous in their complaints. We 
would have found people to buy this publishing house but 
everything was done on the sly to allow the American company 
to reclaim Ginn quickly.
<P>
	I would like to table a letter proving that at least one Canadian 
buyer expressed interest on May 7, 1993. This letter was 
addressed to the then owner of Ginn by Canada Development 
Investment Corporation.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to file this letter before the House because it is 
evidence that there was at least one Canadian interested.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the 
member to table the letter?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> This letter is very important because it gives 
irrefutable evidence that there was at least one Canadian owner 
who was very much interested in buying the interests in Ginn. 
The letter is dated May 7, 1993 and is signed by Mr. Ronald 
Besse, chairman and president of Canada Publishing 
Corporation. It is addressed to Mr. Patrick Keenan, then 
chairman of CDIC, and reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Mr. Keenan:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would like to formally express my interest in purchasing the 51 per cent 
equity held in Ginn Publishing by the Canadian government. We are a 
successful educational publisher, 100 per cent Canadian owned, and we have 
identified Ginn as a company with excellent synergies with our future business 
plans.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2370"> 2370 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Would you please have someone contact me if you are interested in selling 
this equity position.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have this evidence. The government felt obligated to say 
no to the transaction. Why did it not say yes? The only answer is 
that-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> The previous 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> This government had the decision to make. 
We all know we have a new government and the decision was in 
the hands of this government.
<P>
	Why did the government say no? The excuse was a previous 
verbal commitment by someone existed that might go back as 
far as 1989. We do not know exactly. There are many questions 
to ask.
<P>
	The first question would be: Where is the legal advice that the 
government is invoking? The government is basing its decision 
on the fact it has been provided with a legal opinion from the 
justice department supporting the decision to let the transaction 
go, the sellout. We never saw this legal opinion. I think we 
should have it. It should be tabled.
<P>
	Second, where is the contract confirming the deal between 
CDIC and Paramount dated 1989? We have never seen it. If it 
exists we feel it would be very important for us to see it.
<P>
	Third, who has made this commitment? This is quite a 
mystery. Is it possible for a national government policy decision 
to have been taken because someone we do not know said 
something to someone else in a meeting on a date we do not 
know? Is it possible that everything has swerved because of 
that? The question has been asked and I think the government 
should answer it.
<P>
	We must ask ourselves whether there effectively was a sale of 
Ginn to Paramount in 1989. Where is the contract to establish 
that?
<P>
	There was an interesting sequel to the letter sent to CDIC by 
Canada Publishing Corporation. It is very interesting because 
the letter was sent on May 7, 1993 and on August 13 of the same 
year the corporate counsel of Canada Publishing, Mr. John 
Evans, met with Mrs. Benita Warmbold of CDIC to express 
Canada Publishing's interest in acquiring the 51 per cent equity 
in Ginn in accordance with what the letter said before. There was 
a meeting, a letter, and another meeting.
<P>
	Then what happened? On August 19 the chairman of Canada 
Publishing Corporation who signed the letter, Mr. Ronald Besse, 
received an answer from Paramount. The answer came from 
Paramount through a phone call inquiring: ``Why are you doing 
that? What are you trying to do? We are not interested in selling 
our equity in this company. We would like to control the whole 
company''. That was the answer from the American company.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Those are the facts. The government used its ministerial 
discretion to get out of the obligations under the guidelines. The 
only motive was that he had a verbal agreement, a verbal 
commitment. We should know the name of the person. Is it a 
minister? Is it a public servant? Who is it? We should know it.
<P>
	I do not think the minister is right when he says in answer to a 
question in the House that we should protect the name of the 
person. I do not think this man, this person, has a right to 
anonymity. Surely the public has the right to know who killed 
the Baie Comeau policy and who was instrumental in depriving 
Canada of one of its publishing companies.
<P>
	I see that my time is coming to an end. We are asking the 
government to table the legal opinion. We are asking the 
government to table the contract between CDIC and Paramount. 
The government should not be afraid to confront anyone in court 
with the facts, with the public policy and the fact that only one 
man or one woman would have reached an anonymous, hidden, 
secret verbal agreement on behalf of Canadians, throwing aside 
the policy of government discussed in Parliament.
<P>
	As far as legal opinions are concerned, I am a lawyer and I 
have seen many legal opinions in my life. There is always one 
legal opinion against another legal opinion. I respect the people 
in Department of Justice but we would like to see the legal 
opinion. I know lawyers; there must have been some nuances in 
the legal opinion. They should describe the full circumstances 
wherein such a commitment would have been made.
<P>
	We have the right to ask for it. We have the right to ask the 
government to change its policy and go back to the Baie Comeau 
policy. We would like the House of Commons to vote on the 
question of knowing if there should be, as we think there should 
be, a public inquiry into those obscure circumstances.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois for his speech.
<P>
	There is no question the Ginn Publishing scandal leaves many 
unanswered questions. It is proper to pursue it to find out exactly 
what transpired in the sale of Ginn Publishing.
<P>
	To me that is not the largest issue. The largest issue is whether 
or not we should be erecting barriers to protect Canadian 
culture. I personally believe the Canadian publishing industry 
can stand on its own two feet. All aspects of Canadian culture 
and the people behind it-the creators, the singers, the writers 
and the performers-are more than capable of standing up and 
competing with culture from around the world.
<P>
	I have a question for the Leader of the Opposition, a person 
who would have his own country if he could and presumably 
would be part of a free trade agreement. Why would he want to 
return to a Baie Comeau type  policy if he believes strongly that 
his own people can compete in the world?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2371"> 2371 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for asking 
a very relevant and important question.
<P>
	We are free traders. We think there should not be any 
economic barriers between our partners, that we should have 
completely free exchanges in every aspect of our economic life. 
When it comes to cultural identity, when it comes to the soul of a 
country, whatever country it is, we have a duty to protect it.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	That is why one of the main victories won by Canada during 
the negotiations with the Americans on the free trade agreement 
was the cultural exception. It was a great victory. It was the first 
time that Americans had to accept from any country in the 
world, from any of their partners, that they should respect the 
cultural identity and the cultural sector of a country. It was taken 
out of the scope of the free trade agreement.
<P>
	We should not forget also that this question has been very 
much at the heart of the political landscape and preoccupations 
of Canada. For example if you look at the Investment Canada 
Act you will see two provisions where it is really strongly 
affirmed that the cultural sector is a special case. For example 
section 20 of the Investment Canada Act states that one of the 
criteria to approve transactions is the ``compatibility of the 
investment with national, industrial, economic and cultural 
policies''.
<P>
	If you look more precisely at section 15, which is a very 
strong provision, it states very clearly that cultural activities are 
very special and that we should assess quite differently any 
transaction that would bear on this sector when it comes to be 
reviewed by Investment Canada. Subsection (a) of section 15 
reads: ``It falls within the prescribed specific type of business 
activity that in the opinion of the governor in council is related 
to Canada's cultural heritage or national identity''.
<P>
	To resume my answer, there is a wide consensus from every 
part of Canada, from every walk of life, that we should protect 
our identity from a very strong and invading neighbour. The 
Americans have a universal civilization and culture. It is quite 
dynamic. We admire them. But in a way we have a duty to 
protect what we are. If we do not protect what we are we will 
never be in a position to do anything right. There would never be 
any dialogue if we have nothing to say. We have a contribution 
to bring to the universal realities, to the universal values, and it 
stems from what we are so we have to protect what we are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure other members besides myself and indeed Canadians 
are somewhat amused at what the Leader of the Official 
Opposition is doing.
<P>
	He just said a few moments ago that he wants to protect our 
identity. We have to protect what we are. I  find it passing 
strange that someone who is dedicated to separating from the 
rest of Canada would want to protect what we are.
<P>
	I was wondering if the Leader of the Opposition, a dedicated 
separatist, can explain exactly why he is standing up today 
defending Canadian culture. Can it be interpreted as a change in 
his basic philosophy? Can he explain to Canadians and indeed to 
Canadians in the province of Quebec what he is doing fighting 
for Canadian sovereignty, Canadian identity?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that the main 
reason, maybe the sole reason for which I am a separatist, as my 
colleague just said, is exactly because I want to protect what I 
am. I want to protect Quebec sovereignty.
<P>
	I fully expect the rest of Canada to protect its own identity. It 
happens there are two identities in this country. That is my 
feeling. That is my vision of the future for us and of the present 
reality.
<P>
	The rest of Canada is perfectly legitimate in fighting for its 
sovereignty against the Americans for example. It is perfectly 
legitimate to fight for your own identity. No one is better placed 
to understand that than a Quebecer. We think that Quebecers 
have won a great victory for the last 350 years in protecting their 
identity.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	In this case, both our identities are threatened. If any 
government allows the invasion of the American publishing 
industry into Toronto it should be possible also in Montreal. As 
long as we are in the federation in Quebec, we are exposed to the 
same threat. I do not accept that.
<P>
	This is a case where we have a common cause. This is a case 
where the interests of the rest of Canada and of Quebec are the 
same. Therefore we should act together. I would expect the 
national government which made such strong commitments to 
respect that.
<P>
	This is a case where the government can fight the good fight 
for Quebec and the rest of Canada, for our own respective 
identities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by picking up 
on my colleague's remarks.
<P>
	For a moment it sounded hopeful when we heard the Leader of 
the Opposition speak about Canada's interests. I know that this 
member who has fought for Canada and has a deep feeling for 
Canada must have moments of doubt, especially when we are 
dealing with an issue like this one today. Maybe eventually he 
will convert back to his Canada-first policy, which he once had. 
I say that sincerely and hopefully. I hope it is a temporary 
difference we are having.
<P>
	My question has to do with the actual transaction. The 
original transaction on this Ginn Publishing deal stemmed from 
when Gulf and Western had to offload it. When there was no 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2372"> 2372 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian purchaser, the CDIC  purchased it for $10.2 million. 
However there was a condition attached to that transaction and it 
was that if the policy of the government changed, if the Baie 
Comeau policy changed, then Paramount had the option to buy 
back Ginn Publishing.
<P>
	Can the leader not see that there was a sale and agreement that 
was consummated in 1986? This was really a conclusion to that 
deal because of the policy shift. As a government, in effect, we 
were boxed in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would very much like to assure 
my hon. colleague and friend that there is nothing personal in 
our differences. It is really a question of collective perception of 
what the future should be, what should be best for our two 
collectivities, what kind of political structures would achieve in 
the best way the welfare and development of Quebec and the rest 
of Canada. Therefore, it is nothing personal but just personal 
consideration.
<P>
	If it were possible to bridge our differences through personal 
appreciation, through friendship, I am sure it would already 
have been done. However even though we have all those good 
feelings and respective consideration for each other, it was not 
possible when it came time to table collective and concrete 
proposals to satisfy Quebec's aspirations. It is collective and it 
is the political dynamics of the country that has conducted us 
where we are.
<P>
	Coming back to the specific deal, the hon. member said there 
were conditions attached to the 1989 transaction. There might 
be but we do not know. How come there was a very extensive 
contract? I suppose it exists. That is why we asked for it. There 
was a very extensive and comprehensive written contract as 
there always is when there is a transaction where all the 
conditions were stated and clearly expressed. How can we 
explain that one of the main conditions of the contract, one of 
the main considerations of the contract was taken out of the 
document? How can we explain that? It never happens.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I practised law for 22 years. I was involved in these kinds of 
deals. It never happened in my life that someone took the liberty 
of contracting a verbal agreement which was not couched in the 
contract. It is very dangerous too because chances are that the 
court would not sanction the commitment. That is why I do not 
believe for one moment that the legal advice is binding on the 
government. It is quite possible if the government hired good 
lawyers, and they have lots of good Liberal lawyers, it could go 
to court and fight for Canada and fight for the cultural interests 
of Canada.
<P>
	Why does the government not do that? It did it for a $6 billion 
contract when it cancelled the helicopter deal in Quebec. It did it 
for the Pearson International Airport with a $1.6 billion contract 
which will be brought to court now. We read in the papers that 
the government will be sued for close to $200 million, but it did 
it  anyway because it thought it was in the interest of the people.
<P>
	Why does the government not do that with something which 
amounts to about $10 million, which is not a very big amount of 
money for a government, but so huge, so symbolic and with 
cultural interest?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion 
before us today calls for the reinstatement of the Baie Comeau 
policy which was adopted by the previous government in July 
1985.
<P>
	The late Conservative government introduced a foreign 
investment policy for the book trade in July 1985 which came to 
be known as the Baie Comeau policy. The objective of the policy 
was to Canadianize the book publishing and the book 
distribution industry by flowing distribution revenues from 
imported books through Canadian controlled firms. More 
specifically when a foreign investor acquired a book publisher 
or distributor in Canada it was obliged to divest control of the 
business to Canadians.
<P>
	While I am sure all members of the House, including I might 
add rather ironically the leader of the Bloc, would agree that 
Canadianizing the book trade is a laudable objective, the chosen 
instrument of the previous government, the Baie Comeau 
policy, simply did not work. It is patently absurd to demand a 
reinstatement of that policy.
<P>
	To begin with the policy was implemented through the 
Investment Canada Act, a statute also instituted by the 
Conservatives. This legislation was designed to attract foreign 
investment into Canada, not to discourage it. This led to a 
situation in the publishing industry in which foreign investors 
created sham Canadian corporations; that is firms which met the 
technical definition of Canadian control under the act but which 
effective control continued to rest with the foreign investor.
<P>
	Under the free trade agreement the guarantee of fair, open 
market value to investors obliged to divest control exposed the 
government to significant financial risks without any benefit to 
Canadian publishers. Furthermore the policy was not linked to 
any incentives for Canadian ownership. To put it another way 
the Canadian control sector of the industry was too weak to 
profit from any opportunities provided by forced divestiture.
<P>
	There was nothing to prevent foreign publishers who acquired 
these Canadian subsidiaries from withdrawing to the U.S. and 
serving Canadians directly from there. This completely 
undermined the objective of supporting a strong Canadian based 
industry and a strong east-west distribution system. For 
example Grolier Canada and Doubleday Canada were both 
implicated in indirect acquisitions between 1985 and 1992. A 
significant portion of their warehousing and fulfilment 
operations were transferred to the United States. A government 
cannot simply rely on indirect acquisitions, that is transactions 
in which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2373"> 2373 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian businesses are incidentally involved in  international 
mergers and acquisitions to achieve domestic policy goals.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The track record of the Baie Comeau policy was an extremely 
disappointing one. The one instance in which Canadians gained 
a 51 per cent interest in a foreign book publisher occurred 
because the taxpayers themselves stepped in and made the 
purchase.
<P>
	I refer, of course, to the CDIC's purchase of the 51 per cent 
interest in Ginn Canada for which the taxpayers paid $10.3 
million to a hostile foreign partner. As a result of the 
government's recent decision to resell its interest in Ginn back 
to Paramount, the taxpayers will recover this investment.
<P>
	The publishing community has criticized the government's 
decision to resell Ginn and company to Paramount. Let me 
underline the fact that the government weighed all the facts 
before it made its decision.
<P>
	In January 1992 the previous government announced a new 
package of measures for the book publishing industry. I use the 
term new advisedly. What the government did in fact was claim 
for itself a longstanding Liberal approach to book publishing 
policy. That approach was based on a mix of program and policy 
instruments which together formed the basis of a comprehensive 
and coherent industrial and cultural strategy for the book 
publishing and the book distribution sector.
<P>
	The two key elements of the 1992 announcements were, first, 
a revised foreign investment policy and second, increased 
funding for the book publishing industry development program. 
The revised foreign investment policy marked a return to the 
regime which prevailed under the Foreign Investment Review 
Act and which had been introduced by a Liberal government in 
the 1960s. The book publishing industry development program 
was initially introduced by a Liberal government in the late 
1970s.
<P>
	Increasing Canadianization of the book trade in Canada has 
always been an objective of the Liberal government and it 
continues to be so today. Foreign investment policy is one 
instrument for achieving that objective but it must be applied in 
a way which will achieve tangible results.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The guidelines of the amended foreign investment policy are 
as follows: new investments in the book publishing industry will 
be limited to joint ventures under Canadian control; takeovers of 
Canadian-controlled companies will not be allowed.
<P>
	Under extraordinary circumstances, the government might 
consider an exception to this guideline. In such a case, the 
government must have credible evidence from the vendor that 
the company is in obvious financial  distress and that Canadians 
really had an opportunity to buy it.
<P>
	If a non-Canadian is chosen as a potential buyer, his proposed 
investment will be subject to a net benefit review.
<P>
	If a foreign investor wishes to sell a Canadian company 
regardless of any other transaction, Canadians will have an 
opportunity to bid; indirect acquisitions by foreign companies 
will be allowed provided that they are of net cultural and 
industrial benefit to Canada and to the Canadian-controlled 
publishing industry.
<P>
	More specifically, Investment Canada will normally seek to 
obtain one or more commitments from the foreign investor, such 
as the commitment to support Canadian authors, in particular by 
establishing joint ventures with Canadian-controlled publishers 
so that the Canadian authors whom they publish have access to 
new national and international markets; the commitment to 
support the book distribution infrastructure, for example by 
distributing imported titles through an exclusive 
Canadian-controlled publisher/distributor; by maintaining in 
Canada fully integrated warehousing and fulfilment operations 
for recent publications and back-list items; by participating 
actively in co-operative projects with the industry on 
marketing, distribution and order fulfilment operations.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Contractual access to the company's marketing and 
distribution infrastructure in Canada or its international 
network by Canadian-controlled publishers whose interests are 
compatible;
<P>
	Financial and professional assistance to institutions that offer 
teaching and research programs in the publishing field.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to the results 
obtained by this government for the Canadian-controlled 
publishing sector by applying this policy on indirect 
acquisitions.
<P>
	In the case of Maxwell Macmillan, this government was able 
to obtain a commitment from Paramount to entrust the 
distribution of high-volume imported books, a Canadian market 
estimated at some $4 million in 1993, to Canadian-controlled 
publishers and agents. This is a very important precedent 
because the previous government was unable to obtain similar 
commitments for indirect investments, as in the Harper-Collins 
case.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In announcing the Baie Comeau policy the previous 
government was effectively putting all its eggs in one basket. 
The megaproject approach to automatic forced divestiture has 
proven to be illusory. The focus on automatic forced divestitures 
as a cure for the ills of the publishing industry has been proven 
to be counterproductive. The only time it ever worked was when 
the taxpayer was forced to send money to a large  U.S. 
multinational 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2374"> 2374 </A></B>
<P>
corporation whose need for Canadians' hard-earned cash was at 
best questionable.
<P>
	Surely Canadian taxpayers' money, increasingly limited as it 
is, ought to be spent in Canada on the Canadian-owned 
publishing industry. The Liberal approach to book publishing 
policy has been seen to strike a balance between financial and 
foreign investment policy, providing publishers with the 
financial resources to grow and seeking undertakings from 
foreign investors which will benefit the Canadian-owned and 
controlled sector of the industry. It is a longer term strategy but 
ultimately a more effective one.
<P>
	No policy is ever perfect. There is always room for 
improvement. This government does not question the objectives 
underlying the instruments now in place to support the book 
trade. As far as the foreign investment policy is concerned we 
are more than willing to sit down with the publishers and discuss 
what improvements could be made to the guidelines.
<P>
	I would like to make this as clear as possible: This 
government strongly believes in the economic growth of the 
Canadian-owned publishing industry and in the industry's 
progressive Canadianization. Any improvements to the policy 
guidelines would be made in the spirit of these policy 
objectives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to talk to you briefly about the publishing 
industry development assistance program.
<P>
	The main purpose of this program is to strengthen the ability 
of the Canadian-held and controlled sector of the industry to 
publish and market Canadian literary works, nationally and 
internationally.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	This program was implemented especially to encourage 
Canadian-held and controlled publishing houses to increase 
their efficiency and to reward those that are able to improve 
their long-term economic viability; to give Canadian-held and 
controlled companies the tools they need to become more 
competitive so that they can build up capital and finance their 
growth and development; to facilitate the development of the 
market, in particular through new publishing technologies; to 
promote Canadian ownership; to ensure the continued diversity 
of types of books by Canadian authors that are published.
<P>
	The beneficiaries of the program are publishing houses that 
are at least 75 per cent Canadian-held and controlled, as well as 
industry groups and associations. The annual budget for the 
program is about $24 million.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government also provides significant financial support to 
Canadian-owned and controlled publishers, distributors and 
booksellers for the physical distribution of books across the 
country as well as for the marketing in Canada of Canadian 
titles. This is of crucial importance in a domestic market which 
is small, linguistically fragmented and spread across a vast 
geographical area.
<P>
	Indeed, national and international marketing support is also 
crucial to enable companies to recoup their production costs in 
our small domestic markets.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Now I would like to say a few words about the copyright 
policy.
<P>
	At present, exclusive publishers and agents have no official 
legal protection for enforcing contractual book publishing or 
distribution agreements in Canada. This very regrettable 
situation makes us almost unique among our main trading 
partners. It results in a loss of income for Canadian publishers 
and makes it more difficult for them to maintain a solid financial 
footing.
<P>
	In an effort to consolidate the financial base of Canadian 
publishers and distributors, we intend to make two amendments 
to the Copyright Act as part of Phase II of the review.
<P>
	The Copyright Act should be amended to strengthen the 
protection of copyright holders from pirate works, to provide 
better protection to exclusive licence holders for their 
publishing rights on the Canadian market, and to give better 
protection to exclusive distributors for their distribution rights 
on the Canadian market.
<P>
	These changes will not create new rights under the Copyright 
Act; however, they will give exclusive licence holders and 
exclusive distributors the possibility to sue for enforcement of 
their territorial rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If I may, I would like to draw a parallel with magazine 
publishing. The government's objectives in this sector are the 
same as they are for the book trade: to strengthen the Canadian 
industry and ensure that Canadians have access to a wide range 
of Canadian writing.
<P>
	The report of the task force on the Canadian magazine 
industry is expected very shortly. I can assure the House that the 
government intends to respond quickly to the task force report in 
a way which will strengthen the Canadian magazine industry's 
economic foundation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage for her comments.
<P>
	She mentioned in her speech several measures that the 
government is taking to protect Canadian publishing and 
Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2375"> 2375 </A></B>
<P>
culture. I would point out that the effects of protective-type 
measures like that are very punitive, particularly for the 
consumer of culture. They lead to higher taxes, higher costs and 
less choice. They uphold  inefficient businesses and they really 
do imply that somehow our culture is inferior to the culture that 
comes from other countries.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	I also point out that culture is very dynamic and it is always 
moving and really is subject to change. The borders cannot stop 
that influence any more. We see a lot of that coming in anyway. I 
would argue that it is also necessary to have that type of 
influence to keep a culture fresh. Without that we get an inbred 
culture and a very nationalistic, very petty and very mean 
culture. That is a problem that a sovereign Quebec would have to 
deal with.
<P>
	I also believe that when governments interfere and make 
arbitrary decisions on what constitutes culture it is extremely 
inappropriate. Culture is a very personal matter and we must let 
the consumer be sovereign.
<P>
	Why does the government not want to let the consumer drive 
the cultural industry in Canada? Why is it afraid to let 
consumers make those types of decisions? Why is it afraid to let 
consumers decide what constitutes art, what constitutes a good 
novel and what constitutes the type of culture they want to be a 
part of and enjoy?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard the hon. member earlier 
applauding the initiative of the Leader of the Opposition when 
he mentioned that this government should not have proceeded 
with the sale of Ginn.
<P>
	In purely financial terms which the Reform Party is always 
harping on, the Reform Party should be applauding the initiative 
taken by this government. In its own very narrow terms, the sale 
of Ginn gives the Canadian government $10 million for its 
coffers.
<P>
	This is an interesting twist because the Reform Party is 
always preaching that the government should get out of the 
business world except when it becomes an issue in the media.
<P>
	Let me reassure the hon. member that if any responsible 
government wants to tailor a sound cultural policy, and I hope 
the hon. member wants a sound Canadian cultural policy, if it 
chooses not to lose its shirt on one deal, it is sound judgment and 
sound cultural policy. This government will not be throwing 
Canadian taxpayers' money away.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chance to respond 
and to suggest some other possible approach for the 
government.
<P>
	We are not advocating that we return to the Baie Comeau 
policy at all. We do not believe in that. What we are saying is 
that if there were a policy in place and there were some rules to 
be followed, then those rules should be followed. If we are going 
to set some guidelines, then let us make sure that everybody 
knows what they are and follow them.
<P>
Having said that, we support moving away from cultural 
protectionism and we would hope the government will realize that 
is no longer appropriate in the world. The type of protectionism 
we have in this country today simply is not working. It leads to 
some division in the country in that the government makes 
arbitrary decisions about what constitutes something as personal 
as culture.
<P>
	I would argue that is an inappropriate role for the government. 
That is why we have an uproar when the National Art Gallery 
buys paintings with taxpayers' money that most people cannot 
see the value of.
<P>
	My comments are to encourage the government to move away 
from that type of protectionism and to let the consumer decide 
what constitutes culture.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians had the good 
judgment to elect a Liberal government.
<P>
	It is the intent of this government to present Canadians with 
sound cultural policy initiatives which I hope even the hon. 
member will come to appreciate.
<P>
	I am still confused about the apparent contradiction in his 
statements. Is it the member's intent that we should buy back 
Ginn? Is that what he is suggesting by his earlier statements?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will refrain from entering into the debate between the 
government and the Reform member about Canadian culture, 
consumer choice, other than to say that we can only have 
consumer choice if there is something to choose from.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	If multinationals occupy all of our theatres, all of the 
bookstores, all of the magazine racks and Canadians do not have 
a choice, how in the hell can one have choice? That is my 
question, pardon the language, to the member of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	In the same vein, I would like to ask the member of the 
government about enhancing Canadian choice and at the same 
time allowing the sale of both Macmillan and Ginn to Paramount 
which will reduce choice.
<P>
	Would the government be in agreement to have a full and open 
investigation on this since obviously it was the former 
Conservative government that entered into this bad deal? 
Obviously there were not written agreements but verbal 
agreements, some say by a cabinet minister making a phone call.
<P>
	There are indications that when a publisher visits Ottawa 
enquiring about Ginn and gets a response from Paramount there 
is something very odious and very fishy going on here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2376"> 2376 </A></B>
<P>
	Would the parliamentary secretary agree that a full and open 
inquiry is needed to bring the body on the table to properly look 
into what happened so that we and the rest of Canadians would 
know what exactly the former government undertook to sell out 
Canadian cultural interests?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, the publishing world must be 
looking at this debate to rank the abilities of the aspiring 
mystery writers in this Chamber.
<P>
	There is no mystery surrounding Ginn. The Minister of 
Canadian Heritage and the Minister of Industry have both been 
rich in their explanation on the sale of Ginn. They have provided 
us with the richest details on the sale. The deal is transparent.
<P>
	I must be suffering from a lapse of memory because I do not 
recall the hon. member's speaking up in defence of Canadian 
cultural industries when his party went to the U.S. to produce a 
campaign video. Perhaps he is gripped with the culture of 
convenience or the convenience of the cultural issue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Regina-Qu'Appelle will have the floor in a few moments, as I 
think he is aware.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since time allotted for questions and comments has expired, I 
now give the floor to the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the motion we are debating today is probably one of the 
most important that we have had to deal with in this House since 
the beginning of the session. It concerns Canadian identity and 
cultural sovereignty and its consequences, and the identity and 
cultural sovereignty of Quebec.
<P>
	In effect, the motion refers directly to that important form of 
cultural expression represented by the book publishing industry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let us look at a few facts, Mr. Speaker. In 1985, Mr. Masse, 
who was commucations minister at the time, announced a new 
policy regarding investments in publishing companies in 
Canada and Quebec. This policy became known as the Baie 
Comeau policy and its goal was to ensure that the Canadian 
publishing industry can play its role fully in all regions of 
Canada.
<P>
	To this end, Mr. Masse declared his department would view 
favourably transactions to create new companies as well as 
corporate acquisition initiatives, so long as the proposed 
investment were mostly Canadian. Direct or indirect acquisition 
of companies by foreign concerns would be authorized provided 
that the control of these companies was returned to Canadians or 
Quebecers within two years.
<P>
In 1986, the federal government authorized Paramount to take 
over Prentice-Hall on condition that Paramount divest itself of 
its shares in Ginn Publishing for the company to become 
Canadian-controlled.
<P>
	In 1988, the government bought 51 per cent of Ginn's shares 
through Canada Development Investment Corporation to make 
sure Paramount would not hold the stock indefinitely, in 
accordance with the Baie Comeau policy. Observers did point 
out the high cost of the transaction at the time, CIDC having 
negotiated the acquisition price directly with Paramount instead 
of through an adjudicator as required in the Baie Comeau policy. 
Furthermore, at the time of purchase, CDIC stressed that it 
intended to sell the company back to Canadian interests.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	In 1992, the Baie Comeau policy was reviewed by Perrin 
Beatty. The imperative was maintained, in that a non-Canadian 
was not authorized to acquire an existing company under 
Canadian control. However, foreign investors were allowed to 
acquire Canadian and Quebec publishing companies if they 
were able to prove that these companies were in dire financial 
straits and that Canadians and Quebecers had had a fair chance 
to bid on the companies.
<P>
	In the U.S., on February 14, Viacom purchased Paramount. 
Investment Canada will soon be looking at the repercussions of 
this transaction in Canada.
<P>
	Four days later, hardly five months after they came to power, 
the Liberals agreed to sell two publishing companies to 
Paramount: Ginn Publishing, whose shares were sold back to 
Paramount at the price paid in 1989, that is, $10.3 million, and 
Maxwell Macmillan, purchased by Prentice-Hall Canada, a 
Canadian subsidiary of Paramount.
<P>
	Here are some of the issues raised by these transactions.
<P>
	Let us start with Ginn Publishing. Since February 18, the 
government has said repeatedly that it had to sell back to 
Paramount the shares it had purchased in this company in 1989, 
at the price paid in 1989, on the basis of a verbal agreement 
made by someone in the previous government.
<P>
	The question we have been asking since the beginning of this 
affair has remained unanswered so far. I will ask it again today: 
Who made a commitment, when, and where, to sell the Ginn 
Publishing shares back to Paramount? A ghost who haunts the 
office of the Minister of Canadian Heritage and leaves verbal 
traces? I am inclined to believe this when I read in <I>Hansard</I> what 
the minister said last Thursday in reply to one of my questions, 
and I quote: ``I said that I did not see the contract, since it was an 
oral one and naturally could not be seen''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2377"> 2377 </A></B>
<P>
	Why does the government continue to abide by verbal 
agreements supposedly made by the previous government? 
Why, in this case, is it making a decision that goes against the 
interests of the publishing industry and violates Canada's policy 
on foreign investment in this industry?
<P>
	Why does the government not rescind that decision? After 
being sworn in, it courageously fulfilled one of its promises and 
cancelled the helicopter contract, even though it knew that there 
would be costs involved. And the government did not hesitate to 
cancel the privatization of Pearson Airport, even though it ran 
the risk of being prosecuted.
<P>
	Why does the Liberal government so directly and openly 
violate Canadian policy on foreign investment in the field of 
publishing? This policy clearly states that the takeover of an 
existing company under Canadian control by a non-Canadian 
will not be authorized. This is as clear as can be.
<P>
	Why does the Liberal government violate so wilfully this 
policy by rejecting all the offers and requests for information it 
has received regarding this issue? Why did it not follow up on 
the representations made by Reidmore Books in Edmonton, and 
by Canada Publishing Corporation, McClelland &amp; Stewart and 
Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside, in Toronto, to name but a few?
<P>
	These Canadian companies have publicly stated their interest 
in buying Ginn Publishing. Why did the Liberal government not 
call for tenders, in compliance with the intentions stated in 1989 
by the Canada Development Investment Corporation?
<P>
	Unfortunately, the list of questions is incomplete. But the real 
lesson to be drawn from this episode is that as soon as the 
government has the possibility to choose between Canadian 
interests and those of some mysterious entity influencing what 
goes on behind the closed doors of the Cabinet meeting room, it 
forgets Canadian interests. Tell me then: What weight do those 
cultural exemptions included in agreements signed with the 
United States carry? This political decision is a national 
disgrace.
<P>

	In the end, one wonders if Ginn Publishing was ever really 
under Canadian control. The Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance said in this House that, technically 
speaking, CDIC had indeed bought Ginn Publishing in 1989, but 
that a number of legal issues still had to be settled with 
Paramount before shares could be offered to Canadians. The 
parliamentary secretary added that, in fact, CDIC was not in a 
position to actively look for someone to buy its shares in Ginn, 
as long as some issues remained unsettled.
<P>
The situation appears to have been such that, according to Jamie 
Portamn, a journalist with the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, Paramount 
retained veto power over the choice of the eventual buyer. And 
when Ron Besse sent his lobbyists to the Liberal Party, it was 
Paramount that phoned him to find out what he wanted.
<P>
	Could it be that those legal issues still to be settled, mentioned 
by referred the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance, are only excuses used by the government to have time 
to amend its nationalist policy on ownership of publishing 
companies?
<P>
	Could it be that this delay between the coming and going of 
shares from Paramount to Paramount was only to allow CDIC to 
make an interest-free loan of $10.3 million to Paramount, with 
money paid by Canadian and Quebec taxpayers? In this episode, 
Canada lost, while Paramount won.
<P>
	How can the government claim that federalism is the best way 
to protect Canadian and Quebec cultures when it is prepared to 
so openly violate its own policy and sell our publishing industry 
to Americans? Are there two policies regarding investments in 
the publishing industry: The one which Canadians know but 
which is not implemented, and the one which non-Canadians 
know and which is dictates government action?
<P>
	As regards the takeover of Ginn Publishing, I agree with Mr. 
Karl Siegler, the President of the Association des éditeurs 
canadiens, when he says that what is at stake here are Canadian 
cultural sovereignty and identity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Every country in the world protects its cultural industry. At 
the first opportunity that presented itself in Canada to the 
ministers of Canadian heritage, industry, finance, and finally to 
the cabinet as a whole, they preferred to abandon the defence of 
Canadian cultural interests. That does not bode well for the 
future. We must continue, therefore, to watch this bunch of Don 
Quixotes very carefully as they cannot count on the presence of 
essentials to bring them down to earth again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by saying through 
you to the hon. member that in no way, shape or form are we 
defending the previous government's Baie Comeau book 
publishing policy. I believe the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister of heritage stated that quite clearly in her previous 
remarks.
<P>
	The difficulty that we have in this particular transaction is the 
fact that in 1986 when Gulf and Western committed to sell 51 per 
cent of Ginn within two years, it could not find a Canadian 
buyer. At that time the government directed the CDIC to offer to 
buy the 51 per cent. We are talking now in 1986. This is not three 
weeks before an election date, like when you compare it to the 
helicopter transaction where we had taken a public policy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2378"> 2378 </A></B>
<P>
position during the campaign. It is not like Pearson International 
Airport where the deal was done two weeks before the final vote 
and we declared  our position. This was a transaction that 
emanated in 1986.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	We inherited this completed transaction. Does the member 
think that when a transaction went back that far that there is 
some responsibility on us or is the member suggesting that we 
just ignore all of these contracts, some of them going back three, 
four and five years?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> The 
problem with my hon. colleague's question, Mr. Speaker, is that 
it makes reference to several questions we have asked in this 
House, to which contradictory answers were given. We have 
never been able to get a clear answer from this government. 
They duck questions, claiming that it was the previous 
government that had entered into an agreement with Paramount. 
We ask to see this agreement, but it cannot be produced. We are 
told it was a verbal agreement. What is a verbal agreement 
worth? Who made it? We have asked that question over and over. 
Who spoke to whom, when, why? Basic stuff. We never got an 
answer.
<P>
	The Baie Comeau policy was changed by Mr. Beatty, a 
member of the Conservative government, in June 1992 I believe. 
The government, which may or may not carry out a given 
transaction, can still keep an eye on things. It did not hesitate to 
expose itself to a $200 million lawsuit from Pearson 
International Airport. So do not try to delude me into believing 
that decisions in cultural matters are not as political as those 
regarding helicopters! I think that they are hiding behind 
something; I think that they are trying to protect someone. What 
is to gain? For whom? It is suspicious! That is why we are 
requesting a public inquiry into this matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am truly delighted that the Bloc is taking such an interest in 
Canada's identity and cultural situation. I find myself lacking 
considerable sympathy with the member for Medicine Hat who 
seems to think our cultural industries can survive entirely on 
their own. I wish I could ask him whether or not he has bought a 
Canadian book recently but I do not have that opportunity.
<P>
	My question to the hon. member opposite is this. In the 
context of the powerful cultural invasion from the United States 
does she feel that we are better off, both anglophones and 
francophones, united against cultural aggression from the 
United States rather than separate?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would say that a degree of commonality will continue to exist 
between us as Canadians even if we become separate in Quebec.
<P>
Our goal in this debate is to protect Canadian culture. When we 
leave, we want Canada to be strong and have a strong cultural 
identity. We do not want it to be assimilated by the United 
States. We want it to be able to sell us and continue to trade with 
us elements of our cultures. Part of our heritage will not just 
disappear. We will not cut all trade relations with Canada just 
because we have gained sovereignty. On the contrary! We will 
want to continue to trade with Canada, but if we get a better price 
in the United States for books, Canada will starve culturally 
because we will buy directly from our neighbour to the south.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time allocated to questions and 
comments has now expired. My apologies, hon. colleagues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I was following the exchange between the member for 
Regina-Qu'Appelle and the parliamentary secretary too 
closely and I misread my list. Before the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, it should have been the turn of the 
Reform Party, the member for Calgary Southeast. It seemed 
easier, rather than interrupt the member, to let her finish and 
then to go back to the Reform Party which should have had the 
floor. I will have the second round for the Bloc after the member 
for Calgary Southeast has spoken. With your permission I will 
call on the hon. member for Calgary Southeast.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak with deep concern on an issue that has been 
percolating in the news for weeks and has come to the floor of 
the House numerous times in question period. I am talking 
specifically about the sale of Ginn Publishing Inc., what I call 
the Ginngate affair.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has put forward a motion that appears to 
protect the Canadian cultural identity. It is appearing to 
champion Canadian culture. However, the BQ represents no 
cultural, political or economic interests outside of Quebec. It is 
hoping that Canadians will believe that the Bloc Quebecois, a 
separatist party, actually cares about the interests of the whole 
country.
<P>
	The members of that party have stated unequivocally that they 
are in the House to look after the interests of Quebec and to set 
the stage for separation.
<P>
	This motion is not about culture. This motion is about how 
business is conducted in this country. The motion of the Bloc 
calls for an investigation of the process that was followed in the 
sale of Ginn Publishing.
<P>
	The Baie Comeau policy will not protect Canadian culture. 
What will protect Canadian culture is an open and competitive 
marketplace. However, I do agree with my Bloc colleagues that 
there is a need for a thorough investigation, a complete one, of 
the sale of Ginn Publishing, not to protect Canadian culture but 
to ensure that the marketplace is fair and open.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2379"> 2379 </A></B>
<P>
	It is clear that the former Tory government violated its own 
policy. But this government has done worse. It has lacked the 
political will to halt the sale, claiming that some vague and 
tenuous legal obligation requires it to sell. This is in direct 
conflict with the stance these members took when they were in 
opposition.
<P>
	Let us look at the history of the sale because this is where it 
becomes clear that there are many irregularities within the 
process of the sale as it unfolded. Let us look first at the players.
<P>
	There is the past Tory government that began the cover-up. 
There is the current Liberal government that has continued the 
cover-up. There is the Canadian book publishing industry, the 
Canadian public and the members of this House, all of whom are 
the victims of this whole affair.
<P>
	Here is a brief history of Ginngate. In 1985 the Tories 
implemented the Baie Comeau policy. In 1985 Paramount 
bought Ginn. In 1988 the CDIC bought Ginn from Paramount. In 
1992 the Tories abandoned the Baie Comeau policy. In 1994 the 
CDIC sold Ginn back to Paramount. This is an innocuous 
history. But let us dig a little deeper.
<P>
	During the 34th Parliament when some members of the 
present government were in opposition, Gulf and Western, an 
American company, bought Ginn Publishing Incorporated. 
When this sale occurred the Baie Comeau policy of the former 
government was in effect.
<P>
	The Baie Comeau policy required that a foreign owned 
business which had acquired a Canadian magazine or book 
publishing company must sell controlling interest back to a 
Canadian firm within two years. If the foreign company was 
unable to do this the Canadian government would buy the 
controlling interest of the Canadian firm. The government 
would direct the Canadian Development and Investment 
Corporation, CDIC, to buy controlling interests and then it in 
turn would attempt to sell that interest to a Canadian firm.
<P>
	In 1988 the federal government ordered the CDIC to buy 
Ginn. This sale appears to be in keeping with the Baie Comeau 
policy. However, there are two problems here. First, Investment 
Canada never investigated Paramount to determine if it had 
made a real and earnest attempt to sell Ginn to a Canadian buyer.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, the CDIC was supposed to pay only a fair market 
value for Ginn. However the government would not disclose 
how much was actually paid for Ginn. The amount of the 
original sale has never been officially reported to the House or to 
the Canadian taxpayer. It has been alleged that CDIC offered and 
paid a value much higher than what Ginn was worth, an 
estimated $10.3 million, the same amount that it is now reported 
to be getting from Paramount for Ginn.
<P>
Experts in the industry and competitive bidders suggest that the 
company was worth only about $3 million or $4 million in 1985. 
Why then did CDIC pay up to three times the fair market value 
for this company? The Canadian taxpayers have the right to 
know.
<P>
	The former government would not tell the House the amount 
that was paid, and this government seems quite content to follow 
in those footsteps despite its commitment to open and honest 
government. Small wonder, is it not, that a poll released today 
shows that only 2 per cent of Canadians believe what their 
parliamentarians say?
<P>
	If the government continues to show this kind of disdain for 
all the members of the House and the people of Canada, it will 
suffer the same fate as that of the previous government.
<P>
	The facts raised thus far in and of themselves merit an 
investigation. However the fiasco continued. Once the CDIC 
controlled Ginn, it was required to find a Canadian buyer. Under 
the Tories the minister of regional industrial expansion 
guaranteed to the House that every effort would be made to 
respect the principle of Canadian ownership and primacy within 
our book publishing industry. However, between 1988 when 
CDIC bought Ginn and 1994 when Ginn was sold to Paramount, 
no Canadian buyer was able to acquire a controlling interest in 
the company.
<P>
	I know of three Canadian companies that tried to buy Ginn 
Publishing. All of their attempts were thwarted. Gage 
Distribution Company, McClelland &amp; Stewart and Edmonton's 
Reidmore Books all made efforts to buy Ginn. None of their 
efforts were taken seriously. In one instance when a bidder 
wished to discuss the sale he was directed to the board of 
Paramount, not to CDIC. Who was conducting the sale? CDIC or 
Paramount?
<P>
	The Reform's position is clear. We do not oppose foreign 
ownership. We do oppose the former government violating its 
own policy. We oppose the process of a sale that treats Canadian 
firms unfairly and precludes them from bidding on a company. 
We oppose the government's willingness to weakly follow suit 
and to keep Canadian companies from competing fairly in the 
marketplace. Instead the government undertakes a weak 
decision and watches specific expertise in the book publishing 
industry become compromised and lost. Job redundancy in Ginn 
means job loss for Canadians.
<P>
	The Liberal red ink book becomes gasping rhetoric. The 
government claims that it wishes to create jobs. We have heard it 
all before: ``We have a plan: jobs, jobs, jobs''. But the plan in 
this instance seems one that destroys job opportunities. We need 
to keep the jobs we have in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2380"> 2380 </A></B>
<P>
	On another point, when the Liberal Party was in opposition it 
spoke vociferously against the sale of Ginn. Now that it is the 
government all that was said seems to have been forgotten. Let 
me take a few minutes to remind the House and members of the 
government when in opposition of the position they took on the 
sale of Ginn. I have some historical statements from the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, the Minister of 
Industry and the Secretary of State for the Status of Women. All 
these ministers when in opposition spoke at great length against 
the sale of Ginn.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	In 1985 the member for Winnipeg South Centre pleaded with 
the minister of regional industrial expansion, and I quote from 
<I>Hansard</I>, ``to give a very clear signal to foreign investors that at 
least in this one area we are not going to accept foreign 
ownership; in this one area we are going to protect our Canadian 
culture''. He went on to ask:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Will the government establish a very clear statement in the publishing industry 
that the dominant element must be Canadian? Will he reject the application for 
Ginn and Co.? If he believes in Canadian culture, why did he not make a decision 
today and turn down the application?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That same member made another plea in 1985. He stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Surely if the legislation denotes a consideration for cultural industries, then 
sufficient time should be allocated to ensure that all the questions pertaining to 
the acquisition are properly examined, and, most important, that the minister 
has sufficient time to make arrangements for alternative buyers in the Canadian 
marketplace.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This sentiment could not mirror any better the intent of what 
we would like to see accomplished. We are not calling for the 
government to reject outright the sale of Ginn. We simply want 
to ensure that from 1985 until today all reasonable means have 
been followed to allow Canadian companies a fair opportunity 
to bid on Ginn Publishing. This is about business.
<P>
	The minister's comments clearly demonstrate his support 
once upon a time for our position. We anticipate his support and 
that of his colleagues on our motion.
<P>
	Further, the member for Mount Royal expressed a concern 
that bears investigation. She asked:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is the government prepared to admit that it is betraying its own policy, that it 
is backing off under pressure from the Americans in the interests of free trade?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The member thought the question deserved an answer in 1988. 
Now that she is a minister surely she is able to provide for the 
House the answer to the question she asked.
<P>
	The member for Mount Royal stated that the government paid 
too much for Ginn when she said that the equity was purchased 
at an incredibly inflated price. If the sale bothered her in 1989, 
does it not bother her today? When the member was in 
opposition she appeared concerned about how taxpayer dollars 
were  spent. How can she now show such a lack of willingness to 
investigate the misuse of taxpayer dollars? The government is 
contemptuous in the extreme.
<P>
	The next statements demonstrate perfectly why an 
investigation is needed. They demonstrate that the government 
does not know what has transpired regarding the sale of Ginn. 
The government should have access to all pertinent information 
needed to clarify the situation and to answer all the questions. 
Yet it still does not have its story straight, or so we are led to 
believe.
<P>
	On February 22 of this year the Minister of Industry admitted 
to the House that Ginn was up for sale but that no acceptable 
offers were made. Just two days later the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance stated that CDIC was at no 
time in a position to market its interest in Ginn.
<P>
	The government first admitted that the company was up for 
sale but two days later it admitted that it had never been up for 
sale. This blatant contradiction staggers me. Which of these 
stories is true? These glaring inconsistencies cause great 
suspicion. The government claims there is a verbal commitment 
requiring the sale of Ginn to Paramount, but the government will 
not tell the public who made this alleged legal commitment and 
it will not tell the public what that legal commitment was.
<P>
	What is this government hiding? If all these commitments are 
legitimately legal and binding as the government suggests, why 
will it not demonstrate this to the House and to the people of 
Canada?
<P>
	Since it has come into office the government has broken at 
least two legal commitments. It is facing legal action for 
cancelling the Pearson International Airport contract. That has 
been mentioned before in the House today. The government also 
moved quickly to cancel the EH-101 deal. That decision cost 
millions of dollars in compensation and many Canadian jobs. 
This is precedent setting. Where is the consistency?
<P>
	We need a public investigation of the government's 
contradictions and inconsistency to determine what has really 
happened with Ginngate.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	It is clear that many questions need to be answered by the 
government. I sent a letter to the Prime Minister asking five 
questions. It has not yet been acknowledged. I conclude from 
this that either no one knows the answers to my questions or, if 
known, there is no desire for full disclosure. Whatever the case, 
the only way to get clear answers is for a public investigation. 
Such an investigation would answer the preceding questions and 
the five following ones that I put to the Prime Minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2381"> 2381 </A></B>
<P>
	First, how can the government explain the contradictions 
evident in this sale with the red book policy on the protection of 
Canadian arts and culture?
<P>
	Second, how does the government explain away the offers to 
purchase Ginn by several members of the Canadian business 
community during the period from 1989 to 1994?
<P>
	Third, what happens to our Canadian publishing industry after 
February 15, 1999 when Paramount's investment agreements 
cease?
<P>
	Fourth, why was a specific job loss figure not included in the 
press release of February 18, 1994? I understand that job losses 
could reach as high as 60 per cent.
<P>
	Fifth, how can the government ignore the provisions of the 
Investment Canada Act and undertake a private agreement 
which precludes the sale of a Canadian firm to a foreign 
company except in extraordinary circumstances?
<P>
	Again Reform supports the notion of an investigation to allow 
for freer competition in the Canadian cultural marketplace. This 
motion is not about protecting Canadian culture from within or 
from being co-opted by foreign cultural influences from 
without. It is about allowing the market to run its due course 
without needless and harmful protection or undue government 
regulation.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that a strong Canadian cultural 
community has a positive influence on Canada's national 
identity. We will not help to develop this community by 
implementing protectionist measures. Canadian magazine and 
book publishers should be allowed to flourish in an open 
competitive marketplace.
<P>
	Erecting barriers to protect this industry implies that 
Canadians produce a mediocre or inferior product and cannot 
compete. This is simply not the case. Canada has a magazine and 
book publishing industry that is capable of competing with any 
market. I propose that we let it do so.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting the words ``by renewing the Baie 
Comeau policy adopted in 1985 and''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The table officer indicates the 
amendment that has been moved is in order. It is an acceptable 
amendment.
<P>
	Before returning to debate, there is still the period of 
questions and comments to the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member had five questions for the Prime Minister and now I 
have three for her.
<P>
First, the hon. member refers to the fact that three Canadian 
companies were willing to bid for Ginn. Does she have any idea 
whether each of them is willing to pay $10.3 million or not?
<P>
	Second, if they were not willing to pay that sum but something 
closer to $3 million, where does she propose the $7 million 
difference might come from? Does she propose adding it to our 
national debt?
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	The third question is really a more philosophical one. I would 
like a little understanding of whether we or the previous 
government should have intervened or not intervened on the sale 
of Ginn.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
appreciate the questions from the hon. member. I will take his 
questions in order.
<P>
	The hon. member asked about the three Canadian companies 
that were prepared to purchase Ginn. In telephone conversations 
that we have had with those companies there was a willingness 
and a searching for an opportunity to become involved in the 
tendering process. There is some question about the inflated 
value at this point about Ginn and that answer will also suffice 
with respect to question number two.
<P>
	I have a sense that when we look at that inflated price it comes 
back to the lack of revelation in terms of the actual purchase 
price of CDIC of Ginn Publishing in the first place. There is 
some real confusion with respect to how that was initiated and 
took place.
<P>
	Because there are still so many questions surrounding the 
initial sale and the moneys that exchanged I have to say to the 
hon. member that he too is speculating on those numbers with 
respect to the many millions of dollars paid.
<P>
	On the matter of philosophy, I do believe that 
entrepreneurship is a spirit in this country that needs to be 
generated and promoted. I am very much in favour of 
competition in the free marketplace. I do believe that 
governments should get out of business. That is my bottom line.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, allow me to congratulate the hon. member of the Reform 
Party on her speech which, in my opinion, was very sound. I 
want to thank her for recognizing the timeliness of the motion 
put forward by the Bloc and by my colleague from Rimouski. I 
would, however, like to make two brief comments.
<P>
	First, I would just like to gently remind my hon. colleague 
that the official opposition is very concerned about Canadian 
culture. The proof of this is that we initiated and welcomed a 
debate on this subject.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2382"> 2382 </A></B>
<P>
	As the official opposition, we are acting responsibly and with 
conviction. And if we are here in this House reaffirming our 
primary goal, which is to create a francophone country in the 
Americas to complement the Canadian, American or Spanish 
cultures and all countries of the Americas, it is only because we 
wish to put a new country on the map.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> I am not sure, Mr. 
Speaker, if there was really a question to answer there. However, 
I have to say to the hon. member that it is a very difficult issue 
when we are looking at cultural identity. I feel great concern 
when we have a challenge put forward to us almost daily on the 
floor of this House from a party that is bent on separation. Those 
opening remarks in my presentation were placed there because 
of the very different ideologies through which we came to this 
discussion.
<P>
	I do acknowledge that the Bloc Quebecois has been adamant 
and unceasing in its search for an answer to this question. 
However, I acknowledge it on the basis of process. Like we are 
trying to do, it is trying to uncover process. That has very little 
to do, in my view, with the differing cultural ideologies that we 
bring to the floor.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a 
brief comment on the hon. member's answer to the last question.
<P>
	It was clear that there were no offers made to purchase Ginn 
from these three Canadian companies. What she told us was that 
they may have expressed an interest in that which is very well 
and good but it is a long way from actually making an offer. 
CDIC has told us clearly that there was no offers ever received 
for the purchase of these companies from anybody. There were 
opportunities on several occasions for offers to be made but 
there was never an offer made.
<P>
	The hon. member has said she might be interested, that might 
be nice. It is nice after the fact when one never has to cough up 
the $10.3 million, but there was never really an offer made and 
the hon. member has just stated that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really 
question the tone and tenor of the hon. member's question.
<P>
	I question whether CDIC is telling the truth. There were three 
companies that were contacted by telephone by my office and 
they indicated that they had wanted to purchase Ginn Publishing 
Incorporated.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Did they make an offer?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am trying 
to answer this question to the best of my ability and I would like 
to do that without interruption.
<P>
I do not recall saying that would be nice or this would be nice. I 
stated in my text that all of their attempts had been thwarted. 
The three companies again are Gage Distribution Company, 
McClelland &amp; Stewart and Edmonton's Reidmore Books Inc. 
They all had made efforts to buy Ginn Incorporated. They are 
Canadian companies and should have had an opportunity to 
participate in the tendering process. They did not have that 
opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
find the question from the government side either naive or 
misleading. Even the minister and CDIC have admitted that they 
could not accept any offers because there were so many 
technicalities that still had not been resolved.
<P>
	For the government member to now stand up and say they 
never received any concrete offers is ludicrous to me. That is my 
statement.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to acknowledge the hon. member's comments and express my 
appreciation for his support on this last question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, this is quite complicated 
now. We are going back, with your permission, to the time 
allotted to the Official Opposition. The Official Opposition 
allotted part of its 20 minute slot to the hon. member for 
Regina-Qu'Appelle. Accordingly, I call on the member for 
Regina-Qu'Appelle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to sincerely thank the members of the Bloc for giving me 
an opportunity of participating in the debate.
<P>
	It is an issue that I have been following. I had the privilege of 
raising it the first time in the House. I think it is an important 
issue that affects the cultural well-being and cultural future of 
this country and one that deserves a full debate.
<P>
	I do not quite understand how government members are 
putting down the Bloc for showing its interest and concern about 
Canadian culture. I ask the government how can it argue that 
federalism is the preferred system under which to protect and 
enhance the unique cultural make-up of Canada and Quebec's 
distinct culture and society in Canada as a unique whole when it 
is willing to sell off the country's cultural markets to the 
Americans?
<P>
	I am more concerned about what these people are doing across 
the way in terms of the viability and future of Canadian culture 
than I am right now about the Bloc.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	These are the folks who are selling them off to the United 
States. They are the ones who should be hanging their heads in 
shame. It is quite amazing that they are still in the House and 
willing to protect and defend a decision that the former Tories 
made.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2383"> 2383 </A></B>
<P>
	We have asked about this over and over again in this House, 
particularly the Bloc members because they have had the 
opportunity of revealing some of the specific details, including 
who made this verbal agreement. The government keeps 
stonewalling. We have been pressing and asking for a full public 
inquiry. There are things that have occurred here that demand a 
full and public inquiry. Let us bring it all out in the open. Let us 
see what the former Tories entered into in this wicked, wicked 
affair.
<P>
	Surely anybody who is interested in Canadian culture can 
smell a rat here. Why not bring it out in the open? Why not 
expose the rat for what it is? My basic question to the Liberals is 
who are they trying to protect in this? Why are they so adamant 
about not bringing this out into the open?
<P>
	To tell the truth, I was deeply shocked-and I do not say this 
in a rhetorical manner but in full sincerity-when I heard what 
the government had approved. I really expected something 
much different. I had worked with the Liberals in opposition, 
particularly on the communications and culture committees, 
trying to defend Canadian culture against those Tory years of 
rape and plunder and total unconcern for Canadian cultural 
identity. We worked shoulder to shoulder when the sale of 
Prentice-Hall and the whole episode with Ginn occurred. We 
stood shoulder to shoulder in opposition to this.
<P>
	Now I must say there is no difference. The same show goes on. 
What is going on here? Initially I was concerned that the 
bureaucrats had misinformed the ministers. I could understand 
that with a new government coming in. Although, I expected a 
little more of the Liberals, the natural ruling party, since they 
after all had some experience in government and knew how to 
take control over the public service to make sure that the 
political agenda and not the bureaucratic agenda was the one in 
control.
<P>
	I had been assured by the parliamentary secretary and 
everybody not to blame the bureaucrats, the ministers knew 
what they were doing. Let the ministers, then, be responsible.
<P>
	Again I ask why not bring it out in the open? Why not have a 
parliamentary inquiry? Why not get to the bottom of it? There 
are numerous questions that remain unanswered and that 
deserve answers.
<P>
	As well, this may be a case study of how a large American 
multinational like Paramount is able to exercise its will over an 
area that is so important to us as a nation, our cultural identity.
<P>
	We fought the free trade agreement and we fought NAFTA and 
we tried to ensure that there were provisions in there through 
which we would protect our Canadian cultural identity, unlike 
the Reform position of letting the market take care of 
everything. When the market takes care of everything it takes 
care of Canadian culture all right because we do not have a 
chance at all of being heard. The mass marketing of music, film, 
video  and books and magazines will swamp Canadian culture 
and Canadian musicians and writers and publishers' ability to 
get in and be heard by other Canadians will totally diminish.
<P>
	I hope this will be an education for the Reform Party in the 
years it is in Parliament where this begins to sink in, where it 
begins to realize that there are limits as well to where the market 
can flourish. The national interest precedes the notion of the free 
market when it comes to cultural institutions. Because once a 
nation loses its sense of identity, when Canadians cannot hear 
and see other Canadians, we have lost ourselves as a nation. That 
is why book publishing policy, particularly textbooks, is so 
essential, so important. That is why I plead with the government 
to please allow this to go forward as a proper inquiry.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Let us make certain if, and I underline the word if, the Ginn 
decision is not reversible that this will never, ever happen again. 
The only way of ensuring that is to put the body on the table and 
dissect it. Let us see who and what created the situation we find 
ourselves in where foreign owners of our book publishing 
industry now are producing most of our textbooks that we use in 
our schools in this country.
<P>
	I understand that around a quarter per cent of all the textbooks 
in Canadian schools are published by Canadian publishers.
<P>
	There is so much to get into. I am just filled with notes here on 
all the different questions to be asked. I could go on for several 
hours on this. We have been talking about Ginn. There are all 
sorts of questions about the other approval that the government 
made when it also approved the acquisition by Paramount of 
Maxwell Macmillan.
<P>
	There are contradictions here. CDIC approved this. If CDIC 
approved this, that means it has to be treated as a direct 
acquisition and not as an indirect acquisition. If it is a direct 
acquisition, then we should be able to ask CDIC ``Did you find 
or did you attempt to find a Canadian purchaser?'' The law now 
states that if there is a direct acquisition, and I believe the 
parliamentary secretary read it: ``If a non-Canadian wishes to 
sell an existing Canadian business independent of any other 
transaction, the vendor will be expected to ensure that potential 
Canadian investors have full and fair opportunity to purchase''.
<P>
	The good question is: Did the government go out and look for 
a potential Canadian to purchase Maxwell Macmillan before the 
government approved Paramount's takeover of Maxwell 
Macmillan?
<P>
	That is one of the many questions that have to be asked and 
answered. Only in a full, open and public inquiry will we be able 
to ask these questions and try to get the answers that are needed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2384"> 2384 </A></B>
<P>
	Other questions have to be asked. For example, all of 
Paramount's operations in Canada, including its film 
distribution, will have to-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Excuse me. I am sorry to interrupt the 
member but it is now 5.33 o'clock. It is my duty to interrupt the 
proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to 
dispose of the business of supply proceedings now before the 
House under the provisions of Standing Order 81(16).
<P>
	The question is on the amendment. Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies)</B> 
moved
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take the necessary 
measures to ensure that the St. Lawrence Seaway remains navigable on a 
year-round basis, namely through a more effective allocation of the ice 
breakers in operation in eastern Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the St. Lawrence River and the Seaway 
are a major asset for Canada and Quebec. Historically, this huge 
river and its network of tributaries has been a major route of 
penetration into North America.
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the first towns were founded on its shores 
and their prosperity came from their shipping activities. This is 
the case for Montreal which developed mainly because of its 
port facilities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2388"> 2388 </A></B>
<P>
	Today, the St. Lawrence Seaway, with an operating budget of 
$78 million and almost 900 employees, has an annual volume of 
more than 30 million tonnes. More than 5,000 ships go through 
the system every year. It provides a major transport 
infrastructure, not only for Canada and Quebec, but also for the 
whole of North America.
<P>
	Today as in the past, the river remains the main corridor for 
the transportation of goods into the interior of the continent.
<P>
	The motion I introduced today asks the government to provide 
for measures that will ensure the St. Lawrence Seaway remains 
navigable on a year-round basis, namely through a more 
effective allocation of the ice breakers in operation in eastern 
Canada.
<P>
	The Canadian Coast Guard is responsible for navigation on 
the St. Lawrence. It has enough ships, ice breakers, helicopters 
and communications equipment to carry out that mission.
<P>
	However, last winter, ice jams paralysed traffic on the river. 
During 29 days in February and early March, some 40 ships were 
held up for various periods of time. A dozen ships had to be sent 
to St. John harbour, in New Brunswick because they could not 
moor in Montreal. The Coast Guard had simply not installed the 
booms that control freeze-up and ice flow, thus preventing ice 
jams.
<P>
	Needless to say that the losses resulting from this incident 
were catastrophic and enormous. Of the 560 longshoremen who 
normally work in Montreal harbour during the winter, barely 
200 were called in sporadically during that period and those who 
did not work were not paid because this was an act of God.
<P>
	The port of Montreal alone incurred losses estimated to $1.5 
million during those few weeks.
<P>
	Substantial losses were also incurred by road and rail carriers 
awaiting delivery of merchandise on board the immobilized 
cargo ships and consignees suffered inventory and production 
problems.
<P>
	As for ship owners, water carriers and insurers, according to 
Frank Nicol, the president of the Shipping Federation of 
Canada, their losses totalled tens of millions of dollars. And that 
does not include the losses due to flooding incurred by 
individuals, particularly along the shore, where the ice jams 
occurred.
<P>
	Aside from these immediate, short-term losses, the port of 
Montreal now finds itself under the obligation to defend its 
reputation as a port open on a year-round basis in front of 
potential users who may well decide to land their cargo 
elsewhere, and this at a time when transportation infrastructures 
and communications are playing a major strategic role in the 
positioning of regions. It was a terrible blow for the entire east 
side of  Montreal, which has already been hard hit by 
unemployment and job losses.
<P>
	I will remind this House that, based on a document prepared 
by the greater Montreal mayors' convention, forty or so 
shipping lines connect the port of Montreal to over 200 ports 
around the world. It creates tens of thousands of direct jobs, and 
more than 20 million tonnes of goods, or 40 per cent of the total 
volume for Montreal, transit through the port''.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	The Coast Guard blamed the ice jam phenomenon on climatic 
conditions, and Mr. Frank Nichol added: ``We were hit hard by 
the weather and we were not ready''.
<P>
	Yet, it is not the first time that the Coast Guard is blamed. In 
1980, the commission investigating the circumstances 
surrounding the collision of the Athanasia Comninos with the 
railway and roadway bridge in Quebec City said this: ``If federal 
authorities want the St. Lawrence River to remain navigable in 
winter, it is unacceptable on their part to tolerate at any time that 
ship captains be faced with ice jams such as the one which the 
pilot of the <I>Comninos</I> had to dealt with. The solution calls for 
the river to remain free of ice and, seemingly, this implies a 
greater use of the ice breakers in operation''. Again, this report 
goes back to 1980.
<P>
	In 1982, another commission, this time on the <I>Hudson 
Transport</I> tragedy in the St. Lawrence River, headed by Judge 
James K. Hugessen, was even more critical of the Coast Guard. 
It said: ``Obviously, the Coast Guard attaches a low priority to 
its search and rescue responsibilities. The Coast Guard is 
certainly renowned, but not because of its role in this particular 
case'.' Following part of the testimony given by the then 
regional director of the Coast Guard, Judge Hugessen added 
this: ``His admiration fills us with deep contempt. It is 
symptomatic of the need for a fundamental review of priorities 
and attitudes in the management of the Coast Guard''.
<P>
	The report concluded with those comments: ``Winter 
navigation in the river and the gulf has now reached a level such 
that it can no longer be considered an exceptional occurrence. 
Hundreds of men and thousands of tons of goods use this 
waterway, which is dangerous in the best of circumstances, and 
particularly so in winter. We assume that Canada reaps an 
important economic advantage of winter navigation in the St. 
Lawrence. Otherwise, this waterway should be closed in the 
wintertime. If the seaway is to remain open, Canada must 
arrange for adequate search and rescue services''. And this 
involves icebreakers.
<P>
	The effectiveness of the Coast Guard in Quebec and in eastern 
Canada, notably as regards the allocation of vessels and land 
personnel, leaves something to be desired. Of the 19 icebreakers 
operated by the Canadian Coast Guard, 11, or roughly 60 per 
cent of the fleet, are based in the Maritimes. This figure includes 
the only three heavy icebreakers operated by the Coast Guard.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2389"> 2389 </A></B>
<P>
	Yet, ice jams virtually never occur in this region and we fail to 
understand why the majority of our icebreakers-including all 
of our heavy icebreakers-are based hundreds of kilometres 
away from the locations where the ice jams occur, either because 
the seaway is too narrow or the water flows more slowly, as is 
the case in the Montreal area. Only two medium icebreakers and 
three light icebreakers are based on the St. Lawrence. They 
account for only 25 per cent of the Canadian Coast Guard's fleet 
of icebreaking vessels.
<P>
	When an icebreaker moored in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, is 
deployed to break up an ice jam on Lac St. Pierre, it should come 
as no surprise if the damage intensifies before the vessel 
manages to arrive on the scene.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the port of Montreal should have been better 
protected last winter. We really did not need to have these 
problems.
<P>
	This glitch, which could have been avoided, only adds to the 
problems already encountered by the port of Montreal and the 
St. Lawrence Seaway.
<P>
	Since 1977, the overall tonnage of goods shipped has steadily 
decreased. In fact, tonnage declined from 57.5 million tonnes to 
31.4 million tonnes in 1992, an especially catastrophic year, 
primarily because of a marked decline in wheat shipments.
<P>
	We know that, in the last two years, Ottawa has spent 
hundreds of millions of dollars on direct and indirect subsidies 
to Western rail carriers for the transportation of grain to West 
Coast ports under the Crow's Nest Pass agreements and that a 
direct effect of this has been a considerable reduction of 
activities in the port of Montreal.
<P>
	We also know that the maritime industry as a whole is in 
decline and that, at a time when the MIL Davie shipyard in 
Lauzon is in its death throes, Canada is still wondering whether 
it will ask this shipyard to build the Magdalen Islands ferry or 
buy a ship from a foreign supplier.
<P>
	The Japanese would never do such a thing. They would build 
the ship themselves and provide work for their own citizens 
rather than putting them on unemployment. In this day and age, 
Canada would be well advised to follow the Japanese example.
<P>
	In 1945, Japan was a third world country. It is much smaller 
than Canada, with five times the population, few natural 
resources and no energy sources; it is very far from its markets 
and yet, in a 40-year span, it became one of the world's major 
economic powers.
<P>
	In contrast, Canada, with its huge territory, abundant natural 
resources, nearly inexhaustible energy sources and the world's 
biggest market on its doorstep, managed to accumulate a $500 
billion debt and to kill the job market.
<P>
The only certainty in the government's recent budget is that the 
debt will reach $600 billion in three years and that the 
unemployment rate will remain high. Under these 
circumstances, it is important to go ahead and make the changes 
that can be made right away.
<P>
Under these circumstances, it is imperative to maintain 
maritime activity in the St. Lawrence on a year-round basis and 
to have the Coast Guard simply do its job. That is why we are 
recommending to the government to ensure a more effective 
allocation of the ice breakers in operation in the St. Lawrence, 
specially in February and March, to avoid these preventable 
events in the future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies for raising this motion.
<P>
	Let me begin by informing the House, as the previous member 
has, that the St. Lawrence seaway is truly a national treasure. He 
pointed out that it is one of the transportation corridors and an 
important link in the economic well-being of all of Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member indicated, and should understand, that the 
2,000 miles of the waterway extend from the Atlantic Ocean all 
the way to Thunder Bay, which is located at the head of the Great 
Lakes. Aside from the lakes and rivers of the system, ships 
traverse 6 canals and 15 locks, of which 13 locks are Canadian 
and 2 locks are American, before they reach the end of the 
seaway.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since the St. Lawrence seaway opened in 1959, Canada has 
not stood still in advancing navigation in the seaway.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Indeed, we have been able to take advantage of much new 
technology that has been developed to combat ice formation in 
locks and canals. This technology has allowed the St. Lawrence 
Seaway Authority to add a number of days to the shipping 
season. The navigation season on the waterway from Thunder 
Bay to Montreal now extends from late March to late December.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Current technology, however, does not permit us to keep 
every lock and the canal system open to navigation throughout 
the entire year. In order to sail the seaway in winter we would 
need to keep the locks and canals ice free, have buoys in place 
year round, as well as have many additional icebreakers to 
escort vessels and keep the broken ice moving throughout the 
system.
<P>
	It is quite simply impossible for an icebreaker, and the 
member should understand that his motion is faulty in this 
respect, or any other vessel to enter a lock filled with ice without 
causing extensive damage to the lock infrastructure.
<P>
	Therefore escorting vessels above the first lock at St. Lambert 
would be next to impossible, even with extensive retrofitting of 
the lock and canal structures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2390"> 2390 </A></B>
<P>
	As my hon. friend may be aware, the federal government has a 
primary mandate to provide flood control services on the upper 
St. Lawrence River. The Canadian Coast Guard is responsible 
for providing these services and has done so since 1904.
<P>
	Icebreakers operate in the river throughout the winter to keep 
a channel open as far as Montreal for the unobstructed 
movement of broken ice downstream. This activity prevents ice 
jams from forming and also permits the passage of ships except 
for the periods, and I am sure that the member would recognize 
this, when there have been abnormally severe weather and ice 
conditions.
<P>
	The river has been kept open year-round since the late 1950s.
<P>
	Flood control is not a by-product of keeping the port of 
Montreal open, as some would have us believe. The opposite is 
the case.
<P>
	I think it is very important that people understand that 
icebreakers are in the St. Lawrence to prevent potentially 
devastating floods.
<P>
	By ensuring that the St. Lawrence River remains navigable 
year-round as far as the port of Montreal, the Canadian Coast 
Guard does support the maritime commerce and consequent 
industry and port employment along the St. Lawrence and the 
Saguenay River.
<P>
	There is also a need, then, to keep the maritime traffic moving 
through the Gulf of St. Lawrence to allow vessels access to the 
St. Lawrence River.
<P>
	In the motion presented before this House my hon. friend 
refers to the effective allocation of the icebreakers in operation 
in eastern Canada.
<P>
	I am happy to report to the House that a fleet resources review 
study was undertaken by the Canadian Coast Guard in 1990 to 
respond effectively to broad responsibilities in high priority 
areas of safety and environmental protection while improving 
efficiency and reducing costs.
<P>
	Following this study, a fleet restructuring plan was enacted. 
The plan was phased over a three year period and involved 
increasing multi-tasking and double crewing which is known in 
the trade as lay-day system.
<P>
	To improve our resource utilization the coast guard removed 
10 ships from active service and reallocated fleet units between 
the regions. The reallocations were based on achieving the best 
match of operational requirements and equipment capability in 
each region to ensure multi-tasking capability nationwide.
<P>
	The Canadian Coast Guard has retained the ability to redeploy 
icebreaking resources where and when needed as the situations 
dictate while it has trimmed excess capacity.
<P>
	For example, last year from February 3 to March 5 two 
powerful icebreakers were redeployed in the maritime region to 
assist three icebreakers and one air cushion vehicle from the 
Laurentian region to break up the ice jams in the Lac St. Pierre 
region which were  causing extensive flooding along the river 
between Montreal and Trois Rivieres.
<P>
	The east coast icebreaking fleet consists of one heavy 
icebreaker, one heavy icebreaking supply tug, four medium 
icebreakers, 13 light icebreakers and one icebreaker hovercraft. 
Of these, eight are based in the maritime region of the coast 
guard, six are based in the Laurentian region, four are located in 
the Newfoundland region, and two are located in the Great 
Lakes region.
<P>
	All of these icebreakers are in full operation at this time in 
eastern Canada, preventing flooding and escorting ships on the 
St. Lawrence River.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	Historically problematic ice conditions begin in the upper St. 
Lawrence River and progress through the season eastward to the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence, as the hon. member would know. Heavy 
ice conditions can simultaneously occur in different areas such 
as the east coast of Newfoundland and in the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence depending on the influence of weather systems.
<P>
	As a result of the ice jams experienced during the winter of 
1993, the Canadian Coast Guard developed an action plan to 
implement short and long term solutions to try to prevent a 
similar occurrence, Mother Nature's abilities to surprise 
notwithstanding.
<P>
	Several studies of the St. Lawrence River and Lac St. Pierre 
were done to evaluate methods of increasing water currents and 
ice evaluation in problem areas, constructing and placing more 
efficient steel booms and repairing man-made islands to help 
maintain a solid ice coverage outside the main shipping channel 
and analyzing the links between snow and ice coverage, river 
currents, water levels, wind and tide in the developments of ice 
jams.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian Coast Guard is absolutely committed to the 
provision of icebreaking services on the St. Lawrence River up 
to Montreal in support of year-round accessibility for shipping 
and in order to provide the necessary flood control measures for 
the safety of the local population along the St. Lawrence River.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are no plans at this time to change the number or 
capacity of Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers in eastern 
Canada. As my hon. friend can see, we are actively addressing 
the most important aspects of service delivery to Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting that some of the things I have to say were already 
mentioned by the hon. member. He gave a very good speech 
indeed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2391"> 2391 </A></B>
<P>
	I rise to speak to the motion that the government take 
measures to ensure that St. Lawrence Seaway remains navigable 
on a year-round basis by reallocating icebreakers in operation in 
eastern Canada.
<P>
	Before we get too excited about such an idea, it is necessary to 
determine the future of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway 
system. We also have to look at the cost impact of such a move 
and whether once again we redirect much needed resources from 
the maritimes to Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	An essential part of the Great Lakes seaway system is the St. 
Lawrence Seaway proper. This was a joint venture of Canada 
and the United States which was opened in 1959. It extends from 
Montreal to Lake Erie and is composed of a system of 15 locks 
and canals divided into two sections, the Montreal-Lake 
Ontario section consisting of five Canadian and two U.S. locks, 
and the Welland Canal with eight Canadian locks.
<P>
	Since the early eighties there has been growing concern and 
considerable debate over the future of the seaway. This has 
occurred for several reasons. One of the reasons is a significant 
decline in grain and iron ore traffic because of persistently weak 
and changing market conditions for grain and steel exports. 
Another reason is the fragile financial state of the lake carrier 
industry, and finally the continuing requirement on the part of 
the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority, the pilotage authorities and 
ports to be financially self-sufficient.
<P>
	Many a study has been undertaken on the future of the seaway 
and the redirecting of our east coast icebreaker fleet has little to 
do with the issue of demand for the ports along the waterway.
<P>
	The motion before us suggests that the way to stimulate more 
traffic in the seaway would be through a significant extension of 
the system's shipping season beyond the current eight and a half 
to nine month operating period.
<P>
	Many reports have pointed out that it is technically possible to 
do this even in heavy ice and poor weather conditions. However, 
it is acknowledged that there would be an increased cost to keep 
the system open. This is a cost which will be borne by the 
Canadian taxpayer once again.
<P>
	Do we need an already overburdened taxpayer paying more 
for a cause that is somewhat dubious at best? Should we not 
clarify the future of the waterway before making costly 
adjustments to the way it is being managed?
<P>
	The federal government, the provincial governments and the 
municipal governments have entered into an infrastructure 
program which will cost us $6 billion.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	They are committed to a child care program that will cost us 
$1.5 billion. They are overspending their annual budget by $40 
billion. I ask again whether one needs to give this government a 
licence to spend more money.
<P>
	Since the seaway opened there has been an extension to the 
shipping season of four weeks on the Montreal-Lake Ontario 
section and two weeks on the Welland. In addition, cost benefit 
studies have been done which indicate that an extension of the 
season cannot be justified on economic grounds alone.
<P>
	It simply makes no economic sense for the seaway system to 
remain in operation during the period of cold weather and heavy 
ice. There is not sufficient icebreaking capacity to do the job and 
because of the narrow channels it is very difficult to keep them 
open as the ice closes in behind the icebreaker very quickly.
<P>
	Furthermore, there are large questions regarding the required 
flow of water for hydroelectric plants during the winter season 
in periods of heavy ice. Broken ice is also a serious problem as it 
can damage hydroelectric generators. Ice booms are placed 
across the seaway under the control of the power authority to 
ensure that ice does not damage its generators.
<P>
	Therefore the seaway is not opened until March 28 for that 
reason. What the authority is concentrating on doing is 
providing at least eight and a half months of safe, trouble free 
and efficient navigation while giving at the same time 
consideration to gradual incremental extensions of any season 
based upon the weather, facilities, costs and the amount of 
business.
<P>
	This common sense approach to business is more practical 
and economical than launching a major effort to provide a 
longer winter navigational season. There would be considerable 
extra cost and it is by no means clear that a sufficient amount of 
extra traffic would be generated to justify the greater cost and 
effort.
<P>
	Let us look for a moment at the two main responsibilities that 
the Canadian Coast Guard has. The first responsibility is to 
provide route assistance by escorting vessels through the ice on 
the St. Lawrence. The second responsibility is flood control on 
the upper St. Lawrence.
<P>
	Flood control is necessary because when the ice gets thick it 
acts as a dam. It backs up the water and floods over the banks. 
Therefore it is necessary for the icebreakers to get through, open 
it up and release the pressure on the head of the ice.
<P>
	Escorting costs $7.9 million each year. Out of a total of about 
3,000 hours dedicated to escorts, 566 hours were attributed to 
vessels running into Montreal. The flood control costs are about 
$10 million a year.
<P>
	There are various types of Canadian Coast Guard ships. Six 
types are classified as icebreakers providing year-round 
operations or heavy ice control. The others are used for small 
and medium vessel escort in light ice  or shallow water 
conditions or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2392"> 2392 </A></B>
<P>
they are used for life boat class for all-weather operations in 
semi-sheltered waters.
<P>
	Let us look at the actual number of ships and their locations. 
The hon. member from the opposite side mentioned similar 
numbers and I got mine from the coast guard this afternoon. The 
difference between the numbers from one speaker to the next is 
actually as fast as those ships are redeployed in different areas.
<P>
	In the maritimes there are 26 vessels but many of those 
vessels are for shallow water or cannot really break ice. They are 
used for other operations. Six of those vessels are classified as 
icebreaking ships.
<P>
	The maritime region is classified by the coast guard as the 
area around Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and some of New Brunswick. 
The Newfoundland region has 13 vessels, four of which are of 
icebreaking capability.
<P>
	The west coast has 27 ships with only two icebreakers. In that 
climate icebreakers are not that necessary. The Laurentian 
region has 23 vessels and five icebreakers and the central region 
has 24 vessels and two icebreakers. That is a total of 83 vessels 
broken down into those various classes.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to emphasize some critical points in this discussion. 
The icebreaking fleet on our eastern seaboard totals 17. Of that 
total, seven are in central Canada and the others are in 
Newfoundland and the Halifax area. The ice is so dynamic 
where it shows up, and because of weather patterns and so on, 
the fleet is based in four places for ease of getting to the 
problem. The economy of these four bases is affected by 
redeployment.
<P>
	Why do we have a motion before us that will have a negative 
effect on the maritimes to the benefit of the area located around 
the St. Lawrence, which is Quebec and parts of Ontario? The 
economy is not good in the maritimes and I do not think we 
should be trying to present a proposal that would harm the 
maritime economy.
<P>
	The coast guard must have the say on temporary 
redeployment as the need arises, not the government. We should 
stay out of that business. It knows best where to redeploy its 
fleet. Perhaps if we concentrated on paying our bills, reducing 
our debt and eliminating our deficit we could expand the coast 
guard to look after such a problem and allow our young people 
the opportunities to restore the maritimes to its proud heritage as 
guardian of our seas.
<P>
	I think the coast guard knows best. That is about all I have to 
say, except that I would not be in favour of this motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to discuss this very important motion 
brought forward by my friend from 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies that the government should take 
the necessary measures to ensure the St. Lawrence seaway 
remain navigable on a yearly basis and doing this through a 
more effective allocation of the icebreakers and their operation 
in eastern Canada.
<P>
	I was interested in the comments just made by my friend from 
the Reform Party. He is interested in the costs of keeping the St. 
Lawrence open on a year round basis, the effect it would have on 
the coast guard and the impetus the coast guard could bring to 
this very important issue of icebreaking, not only along the St. 
Lawrence River but on the Great Lakes and their additional 
duties in the Arctic. If one considers the Great Lakes and the St. 
Lawrence system, Canada is really a country that is water bound 
on three sides and on the southern perimeter by half the length of 
Canada. Therefore, we are from sea to sea to sea to sea and 
therefore a maritime nation.
<P>
	I was particularly interested in the remarks of my friend from 
Quebec who mentioned the unfair subsidies that create an 
artificial freight rate with respect to grain and oil seeds. This is 
generated because of sections in the Western Grain 
Transportation Act which create an artificiality in the movement 
of grains whether they are to the ports of Prince Rupert, the port 
of Vancouver or the port of Thunder Bay and eventually from the 
port of Thunder Bay to the downriver ports in which he has an 
extreme interest.
<P>
	Our side has yet to make a decision about what we are going to 
do in the future, whether we continue to pay the shippers, in this 
case the Canadian Pacific Railways and the Canadian National 
Railway, or whether we pay the producer so that we can 
maximize the return to the farming community. More important, 
by withdrawing support of the subsidy paid directly to the 
railways in this country we can then create a level playing field 
for all transportation loads. We let the farmer, as we let the 
manufacturer of automobiles, furniture or any other 
commodities, make the ultimate decision on how to ship their 
product to market. If we take away that artificial subsidy that is 
creating distortion in our freight system now in Canada, we then 
allow the farmer to maximize his or her return and choose the 
most effective way to ship his or her product to market.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	As my friend knows, at certain points in Canada we will find 
that it is more effective-and I think that point goes beyond the 
western boundary of Manitoba, to go beyond that point-to ship 
and use the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence seaway in order to 
transport those products of grain, oil seeds, potash and coal than 
by using other ports.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2393"> 2393 </A></B>
<P>
	I respect that comment. It is one of the issues that we will be 
addressing in the very near future.
<P>
	The issue that we are really talking about when we discuss the 
opening of the St. Lawrence seaway for a full 12 months is 
whether the St. Lawrence seaway-Great Lakes system is still a 
viable transportation route in Canada. It is an infrastructure that 
we have built and paid for, to answer my friend's question. It is a 
transportation route that was approved in 1954 and 1956 and 
completed in 1959. It was paid for through the Government of 
Canada. There was some support from the United States for the 
two locks that it owns and still operates.
<P>
	In the last seven years there has been a complete refurbishing 
of the Great Lakes locks especially around the Welland canal in 
the amount $175,000. It has just been completed. The system in 
itself today is very viable and in good shape.
<P>
	Your colleague in the front row who is going to speak after me 
is part of the subcommittee that we on this side of the House 
have formed to analyse whether the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence 
is a viable transportation route in this country. If it is not viable 
we want to know what we have to do as a government to make it 
a viable transportation route and what changes are needed that 
are presently obstructing the use of the St. Lawrence-Great 
Lakes system and the down river ports that create so much 
employment in Montreal, Quebec City, Baie Comeau, Sept-Iles 
and all of the other areas in the province of Quebec. There is an 
ability there to recreate those jobs that were lost because of the 
flow of grain going to other centres.
<P>
	I look forward to your support on the subcommittee that has 
been formed on the viability of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence 
seaway. Your colleague and our colleague from the Reform 
Party form part of committee that will be bringing all of these 
considerations together. We will be studying them. We will be 
visiting your area hopefully in the near future. We would very 
much like to discuss in depth all of the pros and cons to the 
motion you bring before this House today which is: Is it possible 
to maintain the St. Lawrence River on a 12-month basis.
<P>
	We will be very interested to hear the proposals that will be 
forthcoming. I would like to continue this discussion at another 
time after we have had the opportunity to review all of the 
information and facts that are so necessary in order to make 
those vital decisions to ensure the stability of our maritime 
transportation system in Canada. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for 
allowing me to make those comments.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I believe the member used the 
expression ``you'' a number of times. He was no doubt referring 
to the Speaker.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague, the hon. member for Anjou-Rivières-des-Prairies, 
submitted to the House a motion asking this Chamber to demand 
that the government take the necessary measures to ensure that 
the St. Lawrence Seaway remains navigable on a year-round 
basis, through a more effective allocation of the ice breakers in 
operation in Eastern Canada.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	As the member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, I 
wish to inform the House that I support this motion and that my 
Party as well as my constituents of 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans also support it. I will not 
repeat my colleague's arguments, I will only say that I endorse 
them, because they are sound, they are based on a reality we 
have faced year after year and that we have been denouncing 
since March 1993.
<P>
	My riding borders on the majestic St. Lawrence river. Our 
ancestors were navigators and boat builders. Many people still 
are. That means that anything relating to the Seaway is of great 
interest to my constituents and they are concerned when 
problems arise.
<P>
	My Party made me the official opposition critic for Transport. 
The St. Lawrence Seaway and the ice breakers allocated to this 
waterway are essential to the Canadian transportation industry.
<P>
	On March 10 of this year, the Minister of Transport took the 
floor to support the budget presented by his colleague, the 
Minister of Finance, on February 22, and he said: ``it is the 
government's intention to spend $619 million on the Canadian 
Coast Guard''. It is precisely to the Coast Guard that I wish to 
draw the attention of the House, and not so much to the amount 
which will be spent on it, but on the way it will be spent.
<P>
	The commissioner responsible for the Coast Guard mentioned 
several times that there were only two ways to go if we wanted to 
make the Coast Guard profitable: it must either become a 
government agency and receive grants or impose a user fee. The 
first option could be discussed if the government decides to 
present it to the House. It is not the status of the Coast Guard 
which is important, but its mandate and its budget. My party and 
myself do not wish to modify the Coast Guard's present status 
and we would very much like to be consulted if ever the 
government intends to change it.
<P>
	As for the second solution, that is a user fee, it would be a 
national suicide. Canada is a northern country where winter is 
often rough and long. An important part of the country has no 
access to the Atlantic or the Pacific. Commercial and economic 
centres are inland and waterways leading to them are ice-bound 
in winter. The main role of the Coast Guard is to guard 
waterways that are open to traffic year-round so that ships can 
pass  freely and respect delivery deadlines and shipowners can 
be competitive.
<P>
	Year after year we have seen major problems and the number 
of ships assigned to those routes is quickly dropping. At the 
beginning of the eighties, 125 ships were assigned to transporta-
<P>

<B><A NAME="2394"> 2394 </A></B>
<P>
tion on the St. Lawrence; now, there are only 79 left. Just think 
for a minute about what the effect of a user fee would be. It 
would kill all activity in the ports of Quebec City, 
Trois-Rivières and Montreal and in those of the Great Lakes, 
including Thunder Bay.
<P>
	It was mentioned that this fee could be based on the distance 
covered in Canadian waters. What do you think the shipowners 
would do? They would go to Halifax, Boston, New York maybe 
but certainly not to Quebec City, Montreal and Thunder Bay. 
The problem is a serious one. We must revive the St. Lawrence 
and assign to it all the ice-breakers that are required to keep it 
open. If we are to achieve that, the present government must 
take three main steps. First, it must distribute the ice-breakers 
equitably and reassure all employees of the Coast Guard about 
their future. Second, adopt a maritime policy for Canada; and 
third, examine the possibility of allowing shipowners to get a 
second registration.
<P>
	The allocation will be fair ifas it allows free movement from 
the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the Great Lakes. If ice-breakers 
have to be built, we are able to do it: we have shipyards, human 
resources and iron. When I have the time to do so, I will explain 
to my colleagues in this House the present allocation and 
composition of the Canadian Coast Guard fleet as well as its 
needs.
<P>
	Montreal harbour should never again be closed, as happened 
between February 4 and March 2, 1993, which entailed 
astronomical losses. The Canadian Coast Guard is reputed to be 
the best in the world, so whose fault was it?
<P>
	Canada does not have a real maritime policy like the United 
States which require that 60 per cent of the ships served by 
American ports be U.S. registered.
<P>
What are the conditions required to sail our waterways? What 
are the environmental protection requirements? All those 
answers should be put together in framework legislation; that is 
what is lacking in Canada.
<P>
	Several countries, like England and Norway, allow 
shipowners to get a second registration for their ships. Why 
would Canada not do the same thing in allowing Canadian 
shipowners to serve ports other than ours, without having to pay 
tax? Among the benefits of such a policy, more than 300 
unemployed deck officers, representing more than 50 per cent of 
our trained and qualified officers, could be put back to work. 
These workers would be able to feed their families and would 
spend their money in Canada.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is not the time to think about changing the 
status of the Coast Guard and the ice-breakers. It is not the time 
to impose user fees, but rather to provide the ships needed by the 
Coast Guard to maintain movement all year long in the 
navigable waters of the St. Lawrence River.
<P>
	Until Quebec becomes sovereign and takes back what it gave 
under contract to the federal government at the time of 
Confederation in 1867, we demand that the present government 
adopt a consistent transportation policy that will allow 
Quebecers to see ships from all over the world move freely on 
the St. Lawrence River 365 days a year and that will ensure the 
economic development of our cities, which badly need it in 
these times of recession.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> Since no other member wishes to 
speak, the hour provided for the consideration of Private 
Members' Business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing 
Order 86(1), the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of 
precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 7.20 p.m., the House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. 
tomorrow, pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.19 p.m.)
