	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, this House urge the government to recognize that the present social 
programs are failing and to investigate more secure options such as the 
Registered Personal Security Plan (RPSP), a system of personalized, 
tax-sheltered, RRSP-like savings accounts to which Canadians could 
contribute funds to be drawn during periods of unemployment, for personal 
upgrading/retraining and for retirement income.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, It is a tremendous honour and privilege 
for me today to introduce to the House and to the Canadian 
public an innovative new concept which the Reform Party 
believes will help preserve long term personal security for 
Canadians.
<P>
	With so much talk lately of cutbacks and change to social 
programs, citizens are naturally concerned that this will threaten 
the benefits they have been promised. Although the welfare 
state is crumbling, Reformers believe that we can work together 
to build a better and stronger way to provide for ourselves 
during times such as unemployment and retirement.
<P>
	Today we place before the House a motion which addresses 
this vitally important issue of how best to preserve and protect 
the personal security of Canadians:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, this House urge the government to recognize that the present social 
programs are failing and to investigate more secure options such as the 
Registered Personal Security Plan (RPSP), a system of personalized, 
tax-sheltered, RRSP-like savings accounts to which Canadians could 
contribute funds to be drawn during periods of unemployment, for personal 
upgrading/retraining and for retirement income.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Reform Party unveiled its registered personal security 
plan proposal in our taxpayers budget which we released on 
February 21 of this year. This was as a direct result of a 
resolution passed by Reform members at our October 1994 
assembly:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Resolved that the Reform Party investigate the feasibility of replacing the 
compulsory, government operated, privately funded taxpayer subsidized 
unemployment insurance program with a voluntary, personally financed, 
privately administered, government regulated registered unemployment savings 
plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Since then we have begun the process of discussion and 
consultation necessary to examine and test the idea both with 
experts and in the public arena. Through that process we will 
expand and refine our proposal and determine whether there is 
support for moving toward this entirely new way of meeting our 
personal security needs.
<P>
	The first question Canadians watching this debate will ask is: 
what is an RPSP or registered personal security plan? Simply 
put, an RPSP gives us instead of government ownership and 
control of the moneys we pay into UI and CPP.
<P>
	The second question Canadians might ask is: why do we need 
to change; what is the problem with the unemployment 
insurance program and the Canada pension plan we have now? I 
suspect that a lot of Canadians have already figured out the 
answer to this question.
<P>
	They have seen the report that the CPP fund will run out of 
money in 20 years. They heard the finance minister in his budget 
promising a paper on the changes required in the public pension 
system to ensure its affordability. They know this means 
something is deeply wrong. It is the same sinking feeling they 
get when the doctor says: ``We need to do a few more tests''.
<P>
	The finance minister also cut unemployment benefits. Of 
course this was all carefully worded by Liberal spin doctors. The 
cuts were styled as ``unemployment insurance reform'' which 
``will reduce the overall size of the unemployment insurance 
program by a minimum of 10 per cent''.
<P>
	In spite of this 10 per cent reduction in benefits, Canadian 
workers will still hand over the same amount of money to the 
government. The Liberal spin doctors dress this up by promising 
no increase in premium rates. One would hope not, considering 
the benefits are being cut.
<P>
	It would have been more honest for the finance minister to 
come right out and say that benefits would be cut by 10 per cent 
or more. In spite of the coy wording, Canadians figured out that 
they are getting a smaller benefit for the same money. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10648"> 10648 </A></B>
<P>
worry that it will  shrink a lot more as the government sinks 
deeper into debt.
<P>
	Over the past 30 years Canadians have been promised that 
government will meet the lion's share of their most important 
security needs, but there is increasing evidence that these 
promises cannot and will not be kept. Our compulsory 
contributions to government programs have not guaranteed us 
anything. We are living on borrowed money and mortgaging our 
children's future to pay for government programs that are 
simply not working. We would all like to hope that these 
problems will somehow disappear but in our hearts we know 
they will not.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Government pension plans as currently constituted do not 
enhance social security. They pour it down the drain. The 
government as a pension manager is like an alchemist who can 
only change gold into lead.
<P>
	There is something else to consider. Even if we were not 
losing programs, there are harmful social consequences from 
encouraging people to depend on government for their personal 
security. Canadians have a proud tradition of self-reliance, 
caring for our families and helping those less fortunate.
<P>
	Many of our citizens have a strong desire to take back control 
of their resources, their futures and their own welfare. They are 
willing to be self-reliant and to show compassion for the needy. 
All they ask is that they be able to keep more of what they earn 
and that government exercise careful stewardship of necessary 
tax dollars.
<P>
	If we move from failing social programs to a new plan, what 
will be the benefit? The greatest benefit is that your money will 
go into your own registered personal security plan, RPSP. The 
money is yours. The interest or profit from the investment of 
that money is yours. If you die, your loved ones get it. It is your 
property and your ownership of it does not depend on the 
management skills or financial health of government.
<P>
	CPP and UIC turn taxes that are too high into benefits that are 
too small. The RPSP turns taxes into productive investments and 
productive investments back into social security. In addition, 
there are tremendous financial advantages to this type of plan.
<P>
	Assume that an employee contributes five per cent to an RPSP 
account monthly, matched by five per cent from his employer. 
This is about the same amount as the present combined CPP and 
UI contributions. The employee works from age 20 to age 65. 
Also assume a moderate investment return of 8 per cent interest 
compounded quarterly.
<P>
	A worker earning only $1,000 per month or only $12,000 per 
year would retire on $3,432 per month before tax for the rest of 
his life and would leave an inheritance of $514,812 for his 
family or other beneficiaries. This is someone who earns only 
$1,000 per month. No doubt this will be astonishing to many 
people because they have not realized how much more they  
could receive under an RPSP fund than under the government 
CPP and UI programs.
<P>
	Let us look at what an average Canadian wage earner could 
expect from an RPSP. Someone earning $30,000 or $2,500 per 
month would retire on $8,580 per month before tax and would 
leave an inheritance of $1,287,031. Nothing like getting a huge 
raise when you retire.
<P>
	The Reform Party will be providing Canadians with tables of 
such returns for different levels of income which demonstrate 
why they deserve a whole new system to ensure personal 
security.
<P>
	Canada lags behind other countries when it comes to moving 
toward more rewarding and effective measures in this all 
important area.
<P>
	A system similar to the RPSP plan was successfully 
implemented in the United Kingdom in 1978. Current 
pensioners were made secure at existing levels of benefits, 
while future pensioners were given a chance to move into the 
more attractive retirement option.
<P>
	Britain's long term pension liability was reduced by more 
than 30 per cent in the first three years alone of the opting out 
plan's operation. This guaranteed that future taxpayers will not 
be overburdened as British baby boomers began to retire.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	Chile successfully privatized its pension system more than 15 
years ago, in 1981. Like Canada, an increasing number of 
Chileans were retired compared to citizens still in the 
workforce. The level of seniors' benefits was exceeding the 
level of contributions and, like Canada's CPP, Chile's pension 
plan was a pay as you go scheme.
<P>
	Because the scheme was broke, Chile moved to a mandatory 
savings plan requiring employees to place a minimum of 10 per 
cent of their taxable income into tax sheltered individual 
retirement accounts managed by competing private sector 
financial managers.
<P>
	The results have been remarkable. Private savings in Chile 
rose from 2.8 per cent of GDP in 1980 to 14.3 per cent in 1991. 
Very importantly, they have provided investment capital which 
has been pivotal in the near-miraculous financial renewal of 
Chile's economy.
<P>
	I believe that the experiences of the U.K. and Chile provide 
evidence that there would be tremendous advantages to our own 
country in looking for similar, innovative solutions to some of 
the worrisome uncertainties about our own personal security 
which we see looming on the horizon.
<P>
	These are some further benefits we see to moving our UI and 
CPP contributions into our own personal RPSPs. First, working 
Canadians would be gradually relieved of the burden of paying 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10649"> 10649 </A></B>
<P>
government pensions to those who are retired. As our population 
ages there will be far fewer working Canadians shouldering the 
cost of the benefit seniors have been promised.
<P>
	In just 20 years the number of seniors will have increased by 
40 per cent. At that time working Canadians will be trying to 
ensure their own personal security, pay staggering yearly 
interest rates on the debt we have run up, will still have our debt 
hanging around their necks like a millstone and, in addition, will 
be asked to pay our seniors' benefits since nothing has been 
saved up for that purpose.
<P>
	Not only do we have an obligation to relive them of that 
burden to the greatest extent possible, we should ask ourselves 
whether it is fair that they should be asked to carry such an 
onerous and unfair load on our behalf. We would be wise to see 
this coming and fix the problem while we still can.
<P>
	Second, RPSPs would provide Canadians with much greater 
retirement income than do the present plans. For example, a 
Canadian born in 1960 would receive only $2.60 for every dollar 
paid into CPP. For a Canadian born in 1980 the return drops 
dramatically to only 80 cents per dollar paid in, a dead loss.
<P>
	By contrast, moneys invested in an RPSP at even 5 per cent 
interest would yield an average lifetime return of $3 for every 
dollar invested. CPP is misnamed. It is not a pension plan but a 
tax to redistribute income from workers to retirees. If it were a 
true pension plan, properly invested, it would not be in trouble, 
it would be rich.
<P>
	Third, rolling UI premiums into RPSPs would provide 
substantially more security to the unemployed while also 
creating an incentive to remain employed. Canadians would 
have far greater control over their own unemployment income. 
They would have the security of knowing that their premiums 
are a long term, personal investment even if they are never 
unemployed.
<P>
	The Canadian Institute of Actuaries has shown that after only 
eight years, UI contributions administered through an RPSP 
would provide the same level of benefits as the maximum under 
the current UI program. Of course in subsequent years the rate of 
growth in the RPSP rapidly out performs the return from 
premiums paid into the current UI program. In addition, workers 
would have the enormous satisfaction of control and 
responsibility for personal well-being.
<P>
	Fourth, seniors could continue to earn income without having 
their retirement benefits clawed back as happens today with 
OAS.
<P>
	Fifth, RPSPs would benefit the poor. Because UI and CPP 
contributions are taken off the top of their pay cheques low 
income Canadians do not have anything left to put into personal 
savings. Under the Reform RPSP, payroll deductions from CPP 
and UI would gradually be transformed into automatic payments 
into each individual's RPSP. This means that many working 
class Canadians would be able to own a personal security 
account for the first time ever.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Sixth, moving into RPSPs would generate an enormous pool 
of capital for productive investment in our country, resulting in 
a host of new employment opportunities. This would create far 
more jobs than government spending ever could. Although 
RPSP managers should be able to invest in government bonds at 
their own discretion, we would recommend that RPSP moneys 
should not be accessible by government.
<P>
	Seventh, these personal security funds would be owned 
outright by Canadians as their personal property. They would 
not be vulnerable to government mismanagement or 
squandering. Prudent regulations would ensure sound 
investments managed by reputable firms. People do not want 
their retirement savings put into fur-bearing trout farms.
<P>
	Eighth, RPSPs would allow and encourage Canadians to free 
themselves from disabling and uncertain dependence on 
government and government bureaucracy. A return to the ethic 
of self-reliance would enrich the spirit and vigour of citizens 
and the country as a whole.
<P>
	We have begun the work of researching details which need to 
be addressed. We want to make the transition from the current 
unsustainable programs to personal RPSPs in a way which 
protects those already receiving benefits under the old plans. To 
achieve that we anticipate a long phase in period. We will decide 
whether any changes to the tax system are needed to move to 
RPSPs and we will demonstrate how a new direction in personal 
security will also benefit the poor in society.
<P>
	Also to be explored is whether the RPSP should be expanded 
to provide a savings component to fund education and training 
and other security needs.
<P>
	As the Reform Party continues to expand this new personal 
security concept, it will consult with a broad cross section of 
knowledgeable Canadians, including tax experts, actuaries, 
investment managers and technical researchers. It will also find 
a variety of ways to provide information to Canadians to 
encourage discussion and ensure an informed debate and 
decision at the end of the process.
<P>
	This will include surveying citizens on what they need and 
want; holding open public meetings to present the concept and 
hear from Canadians; and creating a concrete proposal 
summarizing all the research and consultation, which Canadians 
will be able to judge.
<P>
	In our view it is critical that we move now to carefully 
examine the issue of our personal security and options for the 
future. With every passing year the transition to a better and 
more workable solution becomes more difficult. This is because 
our population is aging rapidly. In addition, as our debt balloons 
and interest payments consume more and more of the national 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10650"> 10650 </A></B>
<P>
wealth every year, we lose needed financial flexibility to protect 
Canadians who already have retired or are nearing retirement.
<P>
	The World Bank has also pointed out the urgent need to face 
the imminent problems of our old age security system. Just a few 
months ago in its report ``Averting the Old Age Crisis'' the 
World Bank urged countries with rapidly aging populations and 
costly welfare state social programs to shift to greater 
self-reliance and individual initiatives to meet personal security 
needs.
<P>
	It is abundantly clear that all Canadians and especially their 
elected leaders and representatives need to take thoughtful and 
vigorous action to protect our future personal security and they 
must do so now. We are dismayed to see the Liberal government 
bitterly divided on where to take the country when it comes to 
this important issue. It has utterly failed to bring forward 
promised proposals for change.
<P>
	It is disturbingly clear that the people in charge have 
absolutely no vision for constructive change to a crumbling 
social system. Canadians desperately need such a vision. They 
need hope that there is a way to deal with the disaster they see 
looming ahead and which they know will rob them of the 
security and protection that every single individual needs and 
expects.
<P>
	It is for this reason that the Reform Party is doing everything 
it can to fill that need for our citizens. This is why it has come 
forward to introduce a proposal which it believes will provide a 
positive and beneficial solution to give hope to Canadians on 
this critical issue.
<P>
	The experience of other countries in the world, the 
recommendations of experts and analysts and just plain common 
sense all lead to the conclusion that a dollar left in the hands of a 
mother, a father, a family, a student, a senior, a caring and 
compassionate Canadian is more productive and will provide far 
greater personal security than a dollar left to be managed by the 
federal government. Let us get on with the job.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	I appeal to Canadians everywhere to examine the emerging 
concept of the registered personal security plan. Work together 
with us to shape its direction and determine its details. Do 
everything you can to ensure that your elected representatives 
support more workable and effective ways for you to manage 
your hard earned dollars, to provide needed security for yourself 
and your family.
<P>
	I say to Canadians, it is your money, it is your country, it is 
your future. Reformers believe that registered personal security 
plans ought to be a part of that future but the status quo will 
never change unless we work together to make it happen.
<P>
	I ask for your support as we move to find better alternatives 
for Canadians in the 21st century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with attention to the proposals of the 
member across the way.
<P>
	It seems to me it is the Reform Party that is divided all over 
the map. The leader of the Reform Party is in Washington trying 
to distance himself a little from the right wing agenda. 
Meanwhile, Reform minions in Ottawa are still talking about the 
old agenda prior to his departure to Washington where he had 
somewhat of a conversion although we are not holding our 
breath in that regard.
<P>
	I want to ask a question of the member under whose name that 
motion is today about the registered personal security plans that 
that party is offering as an alternative to Canadian social 
programs.
<P>
	Does she not think there is something deficient in social 
programs where we do not have the advantages of pooled risk 
that we have when society as a whole takes care of social 
programs?
<P>
	We cannot put money away unless we have money to start 
with. Our RRSPs are a form of tax shelter. In order to have a tax 
shelter, we must have money to shelter away to start with.
<P>
	For people who do not have that, does the hon. member feel 
they should be condemned to a life of poverty? Does she not 
think as I do that instead we should have programs to enable 
people to have better futures, to enable people regardless of 
their socioeconomic background to improve in life?
<P>
	Not all of us were born with gold spoons in our mouths.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is pretty clear that the 
Liberals are extremely worried about the fact that our leader is 
making an extremely positive impact in the country to the south 
of us. They know that Canadians also are waking up to the 
common sense, workability and hope that the Reform program 
offers. I know they are worried. They are trying to tear that down 
every chance they get, but Canadians are not going to be fooled.
<P>
	If there were such great advantages to the pooled risks that the 
member suggests are present in our present programs, why is the 
benefit of these programs continually being eroded? The 
government said barely a week ago that unemployment 
insurance benefits would be cut by 10 per cent or more. Where is 
the great advantage to the pooled risk there?
<P>
	This member says: ``What about people without no money to 
squirrel away?'' We are talking about how to manage the money 
we do put away better, UI premiums and CPP premiums. Most 
Canadians pay those, especially at some point in their life. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10651"> 10651 </A></B>
<P>
are being terribly mismanaged and wasted by the government 
programs that this member is trying to defend.
<P>
	It is time Canadians woke up and started doing something 
better and safer with their money. We are proposing a plan to do 
that. We believe we will be supported by Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at my 
town hall meetings in Edmonton East over the past year-we 
have had many of them-talking about these kinds of reforms, 
this idea has never come forward. I guess the reason that it did 
not is that many in society are unable to save.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	I see some real discrepancies. For instance, only 14 per cent of 
tax filers with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000 can make 
RRSP contributions. How will these people be able to make the 
savings that are requested? There are other discrepancies as 
well: 70 per cent of those with incomes above $80,000 
contribute to RRSPs.
<P>
	How can people who earn lower incomes prepare for potential 
catastrophic events?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not surprised the idea has 
never come forward in Liberal meetings. It takes leadership to 
provide new ideas and that is exactly what is missing from the 
government.
<P>
	I wish the member had listened to my speech. It would have 
helped her a great deal. In the speech I noted that workers 
earning only $1,000 a month, which is the working poor, by 
investing their UI and CPP forced contributions in RPSPs, 
would retire under the plan with $3,432 per month before tax. 
That is what will benefit the poor. No wonder they have no 
ability to save now. They are forced to pay these moneys to the 
government, which are mismanaged and poured down the drain. 
They have nothing left to save.
<P>
	Why not let them keep their money and save it for this kind of 
return? It would be a tremendous advantage to the working poor. 
I believe the member will see that and support it if she examines 
the proposal objectively.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I sat here in utter amazement as I listened to the 
hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell ask how people 
were going to squirrel money away when they do not have any 
money.
<P>
	That Liberal member could have answered his own question. 
He knows very well that over 60 per cent of the income of 
average working middle class Canadians is being paid out in 
taxes of all forms. It was a predecessor Liberal government that 
started the deficit and debt spending which was carried on by the 
Tory Party. Now we have almost a $500 billion debt and we are 
servicing that debt with about a $45 billion interest payment. If 
the incompetence of the Liberal Party back in the mid-seventies 
had not started this downward slide, Canadian taxpayers would 
have money left in their paycheques to provide for their own 
personal security.
<P>
	It goes back to what we have been saying. It is not fiscally 
responsible MPs like the Reformers that are the biggest threat to 
social programs. It is the incompetence of previous 
governments and the high taxes we pay in the country.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am not sure those remarks were 
aimed at the member who was speaking.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in 
the House to debate the hon. member's motion. The hon. 
member says our social security programs are failing. I fail to 
see how the hon. member arrived at that conclusion.
<P>
	Before we began reviewing our social security system we 
heard from Canadians loud and clear. They wanted us to retain 
these programs, programs that are interwoven into the social 
fabric of Canada. That hardly suggests failure. It does not mean, 
however, that Canadians thought we should just leave them as is.
<P>
	The government recognized social security programs have 
served us well for many years but that it was time for an 
overhaul. It was time to make them relative to the needs of the 
population of the 1990s. That is why we undertook, with the 
support of the majority of Canadians, the first step in the process 
of social security reform.
<P>
	Hon. members are well aware that we carried out massive 
consultations across the country. The Minister of Human 
Resources Development and the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development listened to the views of Canadians from 
all walks of life. More than 600 groups expressed their opinions 
on social security reform.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	To break it down briefly for hon. members, 20,000 Canadians 
took part in more than 200 town hall meetings held by MPs from 
all parties. More than 40,000 people completed and returned 
social security reform workbooks. We held a series of seminars 
where there was broad public discussion in 25 communities 
across the nation. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development has received more than 3,000 letters from citizens 
expressing their views on social security reform. Over 7,000 
people have accessed the minister's Internet bulletin board on 
social security reform and more than 35,000 people have called 
the social security reform hotline to request information or 
material.
<P>
	Hon. members will also recall that some of the hearings were 
rambunctious affairs, to say the least. While it is true that those 
who voice strong opinions may indicate disagreement with 
some program policy, one thing it certainly does not indicate is

complacency. Canadians care about their social security 
programs.
<P>
	The government realizes it must move ahead with social 
security reform in a timely and orderly fashion. The budget 
confirms this point. We know from the excellent budget 
presented by the Minister of Finance, a budget that is getting 
higher ratings than ``Hockey Night in Canada'', that Canadians 
agree reform of our social security system is moving in the right 
direction.
<P>
	We said from the beginning that meaningful social security 
reform could only take place in the context of a responsible 
fiscal framework. The budget has given us that framework. The 
budget clarifies that effective reform of our social security 
programs is absolutely essential, given that we must operate 
with limited financial resources. Let me put to rest the 
unfounded rumours that social security reform is dead. It is 
anything but dead.
<P>
	Here is where we are at. We have completed the very 
successful consultation process. The government is now 
studying the excellent report of the standing committee. Now 
that the budget has given us the fiscal parameters within which 
to operate, the next phase is to carefully develop an overall 
design.
<P>
	In other words, it is time for the architecture. The architecture 
comes before we start rebuilding the programs. It is a logical 
process. We need to develop a new structure before we abandon 
the old or the current one. A key part of the process will be 
consultations between the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the provinces. These consultations will seek 
to establish national principles.
<P>
	The government believes that Canadians are equal in every 
part of this great nation. We will strive to ensure that national 
principles apply to social security programs for all citizens.
<P>
	Canadians told us that one of the key areas for reform was the 
unemployment insurance program. Using the input we have 
received we intend to develop proposals for the UI program that 
take into account the views of hardworking men and women.
<P>
	We have already begun to act. Hon. members will recall that 
the government had enough foresight last year to make 
provisions that began January 1 of this year. If the government 
had not acted, UI premiums would have risen to $3.30. Instead 
they were reduced to $3. It is estimated that the payroll tax relief 
will create or preserve 40,000 jobs. We will be able to put 
additional savings from UI reform toward improved 
employment development services.
<P>
	There is more good news on the reduction of UI premiums. 
The economy is performing extremely well and we have every 
reason to believe it will continue to do so. For that reason we 
expect to reduce premiums again, possibly next year but 
certainly by 1997. I want to stress, however, that the government 
has not yet determined the amount of any cut to the premium 
rate. The figures we read in the press are only forecasting 
estimates.
<P>
	We plan to move ahead with UI reform this fall. As the budget 
clearly stated, we intend to have new UI legislation in effect no 
later than July 1, 1996. It is true that we are shooting for at least 
a 10 per cent target reduction in program expenditure. How fast 
we reach that target will depend upon the continued good health 
of the economy. It will depend upon program details that UI 
officials are currently working on.
<P>
	While reform of the social security system is an ongoing 
process, we know it will function more effectively and with 
significantly reduced administrative costs as part of the new 
Canada social transfer. The popularity of the budget tells me that 
Canadians are very excited about the innovative possibilities 
and the flexibility that the provinces will have to address the 
needs of their particular residents under CST.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Again I stress national principles and objectives will be very 
much a part of the new Canada social transfer. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development will be inviting all provincial 
governments to work together on developing a set of shared 
principles and objectives to provide a solid framework for the 
new CST. This is one way that all governments can reaffirm their 
commitment to the social well-being of Canadians.
<P>
	I think all hon. members will agree that the best form of social 
security is a well paying, rewarding job. Social security reform 
is very much a part of the government's job and growth agenda.
<P>
	With that in mind the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is bringing together the current programs that 
support Canadians in preparing for and attaining employment. 
They will be consolidated into a new human resources 
investment fund. The fund will pool resources from existing 
programs to develop a more coherent approach, establish 
priorities and make use of the best tools available to ensure 
Canadian workers find stable employment.
<P>
	The human resources investment fund will take a hard look at 
the role of the federal government. We will ask ourselves what 
we should be doing and determine the best way to eliminate 
overlap and duplication. Streamlining and consolidation will 
mean some savings in the coming two fiscal years. The result 
will be that federal employment related programs will make the 
most efficient use of available resources.
<P>
	The new programming will recognize clear and distinct roles 
for the federal government and the provinces. We will 
co-operate with the provinces to deliver services effectively and 
at the lowest cost possible to Canadian taxpayers. Together we 
can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10653"> 10653 </A></B>
<P>
ensure that Canadians are capable of functioning at a high level 
in the rapidly expanding global economy.
<P>
	We all know that today's motion is based on the ill conceived 
quasi-budget of the Reform Party and that document in turn 
owed more than a little to the Reform minority report on social 
security reform which contained proposals that the member 
proposing today's motion conceded were not thought through 
very well before they were rushed into print.
<P>
	I am most concerned by the Reform's so-called proposals. 
After examining them it is clear to me that these are old 
knee-jerk ideas that would move us backward, not forward. I 
cannot see how Reform's proposals would help Canadians find 
meaningful employment and reduce social ills such as child 
poverty.
<P>
	The Reform Party has come up with the catchy title 
``Taxpayers' Budget''. However when Canadian taxpayers get a 
close look at it they will see that if we adopted it taxpayers are 
the ones who would be snagged.
<P>
	First let us look at the subject of today's motion, the 
registered personal security plan or RPSP. As I understand it, 
Reform wants to replace UI, OAS, CPP and some health, 
education and training programs with an individually based 
savings plan. This means that when sickness or unemployment 
strike or when they take their retirement, Canadians will be 
expected to rely on their own means and the risk pooling 
features of our current social programs would disappear.
<P>
	Obviously lower income Canadians would be much more 
adversely affected by the proposal. I can see nothing in it except 
for the very well off who would have yet another instrument for 
feathering their nest egg.
<P>
	Next let us take Reform's proposals for UI. The party suggests 
cutting $3.4 billion from the UI program. That is easy to do on 
paper but the result in real terms would phase out maternity, 
parental and sickness benefits as well as the fishermen's 
program. The measure alone would take away maternity 
benefits from more than 160,000 new mothers, sickness benefits 
from 150,000 workers who are temporarily unemployed, and 
badly needed benefits for 30,000 fishermen.
<P>
	Who will shoulder the burden to help these individuals? 
Removing regional benefits would affect 1.3 million 
unemployed workers, which is more than 50 per cent of UI 
claimants. The Reform Party would slash income support by 
$4.5 billion. This blanket insensitive approach would drain 
billions out of the provincial economies-hardly what I would 
call a responsible move.
<P>
	This is not what Canadians want. As I have already outlined 
the government intends to revitalize its UI program. We need to 
look carefully at how and why people use unemployment 
insurance and then make adjustments accordingly. We will not 
wipe out key social benefits like those for maternity leave.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party tries to put forward a social conscience 
with its principle of equality contributions. Its taxpayers' 
budget states the burden of reduction must fall least heavily on 
the most vulnerable members of society.
<P>
	There is no doubt that all hon. members share those 
sentiments. The trouble is Reform's proposals would have 
exactly the opposite effect. Instead of helping those most in 
need, the taxpayers' budget would cut seniors' pensions by $3 
billion. How will this measure help vulnerable seniors meet the 
cost of living?
<P>
	Reform also proposes that the government eliminate all 
regional differentiation. How will this help the poorest regions 
of the country? It also suggests cutting aboriginal programs by 
24 per cent. Someone will have to explain to me how this 
measure will help our aboriginal brothers and sisters who are 
quite possibly the neediest group in Canada.
<P>
	The Reform Party's budget suggests cutting the Canada 
assistance plan transfer payments by 34 per cent and 
equalization payments by $3 billion, a 35 per cent cut. If the 
government did that I acknowledge it would certainly lessen the 
burden on federal coffers. Unfortunately it would devastate the 
poorest regions of the country. It would place the burden of 
deficit reduction on the most vulnerable members of society. It 
would contradict Reform's stated philosophy.
<P>
	Cuts like these would not renew our social security system. 
They would outright destroy it. Reform's approach to deficit 
reduction is simply reckless. It is easy to be reckless when one is 
not in the driver's seat.
<P>
	What about the proposal to slash $3 billion from seniors' 
pensions? The Reform does not provide any details on this 
proposal maybe because if it had done so it would have had to 
tell elderly Canadians that more than half of them would see 
their benefits cut and low income seniors would be among the 
losers.
<P>
	The government's approach is to review the needs of seniors 
into the next century and determine how best to meet those 
needs. We are not saying there should be no changes. We have 
never said that. However, a responsible government examines 
the repercussions of changes before taking action, and that is 
what we are doing.
<P>
	Reform wants to replace old age security and the Canada 
pension plan with an RRSP and registered personal security plan 
system. The concept has already been tried in the United States. 
It is called a personal bank account. It actually works very well 
provided one is fortunate enough to be wealthy. Those less 
fortunate are out in the cold.
<P>
	The Liberal Party's policy is for a sound and efficient income 
system that provides a balance between public pensions and 
private arrangements. In other words, the government's 
philoso-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10654"> 10654 </A></B>
<P>
phy on retirement combines realism with compassion, 
something the Reform Party should thing about.
<P>
	The Reform Party should also think its proposals through 
before presenting them and should come clean on how much 
impact it would have on the lives of Canadians and the social 
fabric of this great nation.
<P>
	The government certainly welcomes constructive suggestions 
from hon. members on the opposite side of the House. The 
proposals we see in the Reform Party's taxpayers' budget are so 
poorly thought out that it simply does not give us anything valid 
to work with.
<P>
	The popularity of the budget by the Minister of Finance 
speaks for itself. Canadians recognize that in order to retain 
strong, viable social programs we have to find the financial 
resources to fund them. That is why Canadians support the 
direction the government is taking. With the Canada social 
transfer we are entering a new era of social policy that will 
streamline our social security system and bring us into the 21st 
century.
<P>
	As a nation that enjoys one of the highest standards of living, 
there is no doubt in my mind Canadians reject the simplistic 
notion embodied in today's motion. They know the government 
is committed to the renewal of Canada's great legacy of social 
programs. I am sure they share my belief that the Reform Party 
is in no position to enact the motion before us today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to this speech. There were a couple of anomalies within 
it which we should think about.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	She indicated this was an old thinking, knee-jerk reaction. To 
me that is an oxymoron. Knee-jerk is something not thought of 
before.
<P>
	The principles we are espousing are based on both experience 
and thinking. We have found the country did best when there was 
the least amount of government, when there was less intrusion. 
To now say we should once again use those principles of 
self-sufficiency and encourage people to look after themselves 
and making it possible for them to do that is not knee-jerk. That 
is good, solid thinking.
<P>
	The member said Canadians reject this. She said that several 
times. That is not my experience. I have shared this concept with 
a number of people for over a year. I am pleased the ideas we had 
are now coming forward in the House. I have yet to hear a single 
person indicate anything but enthusiasm for this concept.
<P>
	With respect to the reduction of old age security benefits, the 
member made mention that Reform is saying we are going to cut 
back. I want to make it very clear, I want everyone to know we 
are forced into this, not by what Reform is doing but what 
governments over the last 30 years have done. We have run out 
of money and the Reform policy is to target the remaining 
money, as little as there is, to those who have true need.
<P>
	When we are talking about reducing old age security, we are 
talking about reducing to those who do not need it because they 
have an income over the national average.
<P>
	We would be most honest with Canadians if we were to say the 
Canada pension plan is at risk because we will not have the 
money. That is the result of Liberal and Conservatives 
governments. That has to come to an end.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has not heard the 
Prime Minister mention on several occasions that the taxpayers' 
budget proposed by the Reform Party has forgotten to take into 
account that our population is aging. The costs of old age 
security for our seniors will rise every year. It is not in the 
Reform budget. Maybe the member should take a look at that 
part and think it through.
<P>
	The Reform Party constantly claims over and over again that 
it represents the people, the interests of Canadians and listens to 
polls and to to Canadians. When 80 per cent of Canadians 
respond telling us they support public programs for elderly care, 
does that not send a message to the Reform Party? It should send 
a message to a party that claims to represent the people. When it 
hears that 77 per cent support public programs for child care and 
other programs, does that not send a message? I would think it 
sends a message.
<P>
	I would ask the Reform Party to take a look at our budget. Our 
budget talks about the problems we are going to face. It talks 
about the fact that we have to deal with old age security and all 
of our social programs, especially relating to our seniors. The 
budget has the foresight to deal with that.
<P>
	Perhaps the Reform Party should actually read the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, our budget does take into account the fact that the 
population is aging and that our social programs are 
unsustainable.
<P>
	The hon. member should realize that in a few short years we 
will be paying up to 15 per cent of our income into the pension 
fund alone to meet the expectations of those retiring in a short 
time.
<P>
	The member said social security programs are anything but 
dead. The studies by the Liberal government show the pension 
plan is in big trouble. There is less than two years of funds in the 
pension fund for payouts. The liability in this fund is about as 
great as our national debt, at over $500 billion. That is the 
liability in this fund.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	This does not give Canadians security. It should be 
immediately obvious to everyone in the House when you have 
that kind of liability it is not sustainable, the opposite of 
security.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10655"> 10655 </A></B>
<P>
	If individuals had been contributing into a self-managed 
fund, they would now have more security. The proposal we are 
putting forward gives the poor people a lot more security than 
they presently have with the mismanaged pension fund run by 
the government.
<P>
	Does the hon. member feel it is worth exploring a means by 
which we could make a transition from the present 
unsustainable system to a more secure system that gives 
individuals more control over their future? Does she not think 
this concept is worth exploring?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess the hon. member was not 
listening. In the budget the finance minister talked about the fact 
that we need to review our programs for our seniors.
<P>
	We have a system in Canada developed by Liberals, a system 
that met the needs of the 1960s and the 1970s when it was 
introduced; a system we are trying to up date that will meet the 
needs of the 1990s and the 21st Century. That is what this 
Liberal government does and that is what this Liberal 
government is about. That is what we will do.
<P>
	The hon. member is not aware, obviously, how programs work 
in other countries. I am very familiar with how they work. I have 
an aunt who lives in the United States. I know what happens 
when you become a senior citizen. I know what happens to 
programs you have paid into for four years and benefits that are 
cut off over time. I understand how that system works because I 
live with that system every day due to a family member who has 
an illness.
<P>
	I ask the Reform Party to do a little research into its 
suggestions before it puts them forward and that it realize what 
the Liberal government is trying to do.
<P>
	We recognize things have to change. We started the social 
security reform and we started the human resources 
consultations over a year ago. Members on that side took part in 
them. We are not afraid of that. We are aware of that. We 
mentioned in the red book that we would deal with the systems 
and that we would make changes and that is what we are going to 
do.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being almost 11 a.m. we will now go to 
Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the type of labour management crisis crippling 
Canada's shipping industry happens all too frequently. This has 
to be prevented in the future.
<P>
	This objective can be achieved without labour legislation. 
The government only has to declare existing railbeds a common 
carrier accessible to any railroad company. As a result, shippers 
can switch from the use of struck railroads to others that are still 
operating.
<P>
	In addition, the government should remove all restrictions on 
the use of shipping routes. As a result, if the docks in one city are 
tied up in a labour dispute, docks in other cities can be used.
<P>
	Under these conditions, labour disputes in the shipping 
industry will become extremely rare. The employers and 
workers know well what the market will bear. Industries hitherto 
protected from competition by government granted monopolies 
and regulation are exposed to the healthy winds of competition. 
They can no longer hold the Canadian public ransom.
<P>
	I personally urge the Minister of Transport to propose such 
legislation and deregulation. It can be enacted quickly.

competitive.
<P>
	In my riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka as in the rest of the 
country, small business ventures are often the key to the 
economy. This budget encourages small business growth. It 
encourages job creation. It encourages prosperity.
<P>
	The recent budget is but one part of our government's strategy 
of jobs and growth. It is already paying dividends. Let us look at 
some examples.
<P>
	First, the value of manufacturing shipments was $33.1 billion 
in January, up 25 per cent in just one year. Second, Statistics 
Canada's index of leading economic indicators, a measure of 
future economic growth, was up .5 per cent in February. Third, 
the manufacturing sector in February created over 53,000 new 
jobs.
<P>
	We have, as a government, been successful in creating a 
climate in which small business can create jobs for Canadians.

have received an even greater number of letters and phone calls. 
We can only conclude from this that we must find the proper

control through gun control.
<P>
	I am calling on my colleagues who represent urban ridings to 
hear the message from rural Canada that the law-abiding gun

Rather, let us become partners in the fight against crime and

yesterday in the House I asked for clarification from the

intended to benefit: landowners or actual farmers. I did not 
receive an answer to this very basic question. This is extremely 
frustrating since western Canadian farmers have a number of 
other questions they would like this government to answer as 
well.
<P>
	For example, is the purpose of the $1.6 billion payout to 
compensate for losses in land value, or is it meant to be a 
transition fund for farmers who have lost the Crow benefit but 
are still shipping grain? What accommodations have been made 
within the phase out plan for renters and lessors? How will the 
money be paid to farmers? When can farmers expect to receive 
the money? Specifically, what measures will be taken to allow 
the system to become more efficient and to give farmers more 
flexibility in marketing?
<P>
	The government must not keep western Canadian farmers in 
the dark on these issues any longer. Farmers must be able to plan 
with certainty and recoup some of the losses which will result 
from these cuts.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANADVISORYCOUNCILONTHESTATUSOFWOMEN">CANADIAN ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE STATUS OF 
WOMEN</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the government. I do not know to whom it 
is directed, but someone will surely rise to give an answer.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister said that to avoid 
patronage and prevent order in council appointments of friends 
of the government, the government decided to abolish the 
Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women. That is 
what she said, although it is rather surprising.
<P>
	Considering the important role played by the Advisory 
Council on the Status of Women, would the Deputy Prime 
Minister or another member of the government not agree that it 
was not absolutely unnecessary to abolish the council in order to 
avoid partisan order in council appointments and that the 
government should simply have opted for another appointment 
process that would guarantee the arm's length position of the 
members?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as part of our effort to have a government that is 
efficient and effective and very conscious of expense, the 
government has decided to merge these various programs under 
the very capable leadership of the Secretary of State for the 
Status of Women. I think this will turn out to be a very effective 
use of the necessary resources.
<P>
	The hon. member is always talking about the need to avoid 
overlapping and duplication. I am surprised he is not praising 
this initiative because it is exactly along the lines he is calling 
for, the avoiding of overlapping and duplication.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
sure you understand why I will have to repeat my question. As 
for eliminating duplication, there are whole federal departments 
we could get rid of, not an advisory council that serves the status 
of women, but whole departments that duplicate the work done 
by provincial departments. We have a few suggestions for the 
government if it needs some help in this area.
<P>
	Are we to infer from what the Deputy Prime Minister said that 
the committee appointed by the government to review the 
CRTC's decision on direct tv broadcasting, consisting of 
Gordon Ritchie, Roger Tassé and Robert Rabinovitch, is a 
committee appointed by order in council, thus involving friends 
of the government who are responsible for reaching a decision 
where several billion dollars are at stake, a decision that 
concerns all Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member wants to be logical, but where is the 
logic in his questions when he complains about our merging 
women's programs and at the same time criticizes duplication 
and overlap?
<P>
	Once again, if the hon. member wants to be logical, I would 
ask him to support our decision, so that women receive the kind 
of support they need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us 
get this straight. We referred to a statement by the Deputy Prime 
Minister in which she said that the Advisory Council on the 
Status of Women was abolished because it was a hotbed of 
patronage, because these were order in council appointments, 
and that the best way to avoid that was to abolish the council. 
That is what we are talking about.
<P>
	That being said, since, as the Deputy Prime Minister 
admitted, order in council appointments are partisan 
appointments and cabinet still insists on appointing the 
government's ethics counsellor, would the government not 
agree that it should change its approach, act on the opposition's 
request and have the 
<P>

of by order in council?

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies,

Again yesterday, the Minister of Canadian Heritage stated the 
following: ``Radio-Canada, my source, confirmed that no cuts 
were announced. I assume this means no staff cuts or layoffs 
have been decided''. However, all the papers announced 
yesterday that 750 positions would be abolished at 
Radio-Canada as the result of the cuts imposed by the 
government.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Finance confirm that Radio-Canada will 
face cuts of $350 million over three years as Vice-President 
Michèle Fortin reaffirmed on Monday?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we know 
that Radio-Canada's management will be well able to meet this 
challenge. No one here underestimates the challenges facing the 
CBC. In the end, Canadians will continue to enjoy the high 
quality broadcasting the CBC is famous for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a supplementary question.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance confirm that the government 
had told the CBC that the cuts for the three coming years would 
be $44 million, $96 million and $165 million, as Mr. Manera 
informed us when he resigned? The Minister of Canadian 
Heritage had refused to confirm those cuts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member likes to speculate, and they do not make very good 
gamblers.
<P>
	Currently it is up to the CBC to determine the best way to 
administer its limited resources within the financial realities 
that exist.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
trouble right here in Ottawa city; that starts with <I>t</I> and it rhymes 
with <I>e</I> and that spells ethics.
<P>
	All this week the Reform Party has been asking the Prime 
Minister to direct the ethics counsellor to investigate the Canada 
Post building contract and the influence of Jose Perez and 
political officials in the tendering process. The Prime Minister 
has refused our request on the grounds that these events took 
place under a previous administration.
<P>
	How would an investigation of the postal building contract 
differ from the investigation of the Pearson airport contract 
which also took place under a previous administration?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister pointed out that the ethics 
counsellor had been appointed to review complaints about 
ministers and other order in council appointees and possibly to 
look into the matter of lobbyists. The matter raised by the hon. 
member is not something for which the position of ethics 
counsellor has been created.
<P>
	I want to say to the hon. member that certainly, as the Prime 
Minister said, it was something that took place under a previous 
government. The Minister of Public Works who reports to 
Parliament for Canada Post is reviewing the situation. I am sure 
he will have more to say about it when he completes his review.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, irrespective of 
the minister's answer, a number of serious issues need to be 
addressed.
<P>
	Developers need to be assured that Mr. Perez had no unfair 
advantage. Taxpayers need to be assured that their money is 
being spent correctly and wisely. Most of all, Canadians need to 
be assured that either the politicians and bureaucrats did nothing 
wrong, or if they did do something wrong that they will be 
exposed.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. Will the government's 
presumed commitment to restoring integrity in the political 
institutions allow the ethics commissioner to investigate these 
issues?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the estimates of Canada Post have been tabled before 
the House and referred to the appropriate parliamentary 
committee.
<P>
	I suggest my hon. friend consider that the matter could well be 
raised when the Canada Post estimates are studied by the 
appropriate parliamentary committee. If my hon. friend is 
concerned about a stronger role for committees, he might 
examine this possibility.

missing; the perception of it is missing. This is not the first time 
the Reform Party has asked for the ethics counsellor to 
investigate issues on behalf of Canadians. Every time we get the 
answer no. It seems the Prime Minister is only willing to unleash 
his ethics lap dog when it is suitable to the government.
<P>
	If the government is unwilling to let the ethics counsellor 
investigate in matters of public contracts, why should Canadians 
have any trust at all in the ethics counsellor of the lobbyists act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think Canadians could ask why they should have any 
confidence in the kinds of questions asked by the Reform 
member when the facts are that the ethics counsellor has been 
appointed to look into matters involving ministers and order in 
council appointees, and when the Reform Party is not willing to 
follow up my suggestion that the matter could be explored when 
Canada Post estimates are being studied by the appropriate 
parliamentary committee.

<P>
	The Corporations de développement économique et 
communautaire de Montréal, or CDECs, are funded by Ottawa, 
Quebec and municipal governments. While the provincial and 
municipal governments have committed themselves to funding 
the corporations for the next three years, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development will only guarantee funding for six 
months. After this date, the department will no longer be 
responsible for funding CDECs.
<P>
	My question is the following: Are we to understand that, after 
hitting the economy of Montreal so hard in the last budget, the 
federal government will also refuse to commit to funding these 
frontline economic development organizations for more than six 
months?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I believe that, 
judging from how much the federal government has contributed 
to various initiatives in Montreal, it is obvious that it plays a 
very, very important role and we intend to continue to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr.

corporations play in job creation, will the minister responsible

will sign the tripartite agreement already reached between the 
three parties, and end the uncertainty and sign the agreement?
<P>

Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs

Mr. Speaker, we indicated in our budget that we would review 
various programs to make them more productive.
<P>
	We also indicated that we would apply federalism by the 
book, and spend our money in areas that fall squarely under the

<P>
	After denouncing last week the government's failure to tackle 
waste in the public service, we must rise again today to 
denounce the unfairness of the cuts. At this time, 14 per cent of 
full time jobs in the public service are held by contract 
employees without job security. These employees are generally 
young graduates and the majority of them are women.
<P>

sacrificing a new generation of our most dynamic and youngest

cut as part of our endeavours to get the deficit down and to cut 
government expenditures.
<P>
	It is the positions that are associated with those programs and

positions, some will be contractual positions. We will be 
monitoring the entire situation to make sure that at the end of the

receive from this important action?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
confirm that today the department initiated a dumping and 
subsidy investigation into imports of sugar from Korea, the 
European Union and the United States.
<P>
	This investigation was initiated in response to allegations 
filed by the Canadian Sugar Institute that sugar imports are 
being dumped into Canada and that foreign refiners have been 
receiving government subsidies which allow them to sell at 
prices which are sometimes below the cost of production.
<P>
	These alleged practices have reduced profit levels, forced 
Canadian refiners to reduce prices to unreasonable levels and to 
lay off workers. Therefore, the department will now investigate 
the allegations and should they be proven accurate, apply an 
extra duty which will take away the unfair advantage enjoyed by 
imports and once again provide a level playing field for 
Canadian refiners.

Mr. Speaker, perhaps to the Minister of Finance this time, can

value and not on the increased costs of shipping grain?

Speaker, all of the negotiations surrounding the method of 
paying that follows from the elimination of the WGTA have 
taken into account as many concerns as possible.
<P>
	No final determination has been made with respect to the 
method of payment. The discussion is ongoing as to how that 
will be handled. Without exception, throughout these

assured me we do have the controls to avoid the kind of 
problems that exist abroad.

although you can never tell what can happen, to the kinds of

	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Secretary of State for Latin America and

<P>
	It was reported today that an American congressman 
suggested Canada defer to U.S. foreign policy on Cuba. He was 
supporting a bill before Congress that would punish countries 
that ignore the U.S. embargo.

in Cuba?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to respond to 
my colleague's important question. The United States has draft 
legislation in place right now which would have a negative 
effect, especially on the principals and families of some 
Canadian companies investing in Cuba.
<P>

<P>
	We hope there will be amendments to this legislation before 
it is pursued in the United States. However, we have made it 
very clear that Canada will be pursuing and will continue to 
pursue an independent foreign policy. This is very well 
respected world wide.
<P>
	This week we are very pleased to be celebrating 50 years of 
friendly relations with Cuba and we expect to have many more 
such years in the future.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
over a year, the official opposition has been asking the Minister 
of Transport to explain why Marine Atlantic, which is a Crown 
corporation, had been authorized to operate two of its ships 
under Bahamian flags, and to correct the situation as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm today that all Marine Atlantic ships 
now fly Canadian flags, and can he tell us what measures were 
taken to ensure that Canadian government agencies do not 
operate ships under convenience flags?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the issue was raised some months ago, as the hon. 
member pointed out, we were looking at a situation which, in 
some cases, had been persisting for quite a long time. We have 
decided to commercialize Marine Atlantic's operations. In other 
words, we will sell all the ships.

	They also believe that these are not necessary in order to 
inform or to entertain. They are particularly concerned about 
abuse and violence in various forms that appear in the media.
<P>
	They ask the government to ensure that the CRTC regulate 
this and remove it if at all possible or certainly diminish it. They 
also believe that violence is counter to the values they try to 
instil in their families. They do, however, point out that there 
have been some gains. They appreciate the efforts that have been 
made to date.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
The firearms industry is substantial, especially when one 
considers related industries such as hunting. For example, the 
Canadian Wildlife Service (Environment Canada) reported that 
in the year 1991 over 1.2 billion dollars were spent by 
Canadians and Americans on hunting in Canada.
<P>
	Firearms control is designed to be cost neutral. The measures 
introduced continue to respect the legitimate uses of firearms 
for sporting and recreational purposes.
<P>
	Stricter firearm control measures are essential to public 
health and safety, and one cannot pub a price tag on the 
prevention of violence and the added security felt by Canadians.

<P>
	The <I>Indian Act</I> provides that the election for the chief and

the qualifications for the voters are set by the band, and the band 
has the sole authority to do this.

spilled into Lake Masketsi and the Tawachiche River, does Transport Canada 
intend to undertake an investigation to identify and correct factors which could

Transportation Safety Board, TSB, an independent agency

accident. The TSB will issue a public report once its 
investigation is completed. Any recommendations made by the 
TSB will be acted upon by Transport Canada should any factors

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on the Reform Party motion, 
which proposes to replace Canada's current social security 
system with a registered personal security plan.
<P>
	From the outset, the wording of the motion reflects its 
underlying philosophy or principles. The Reform Party wants to 
replace a social security system with a personal security plan. A 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10672"> 10672 </A></B>
<P>
social security system is a plan designed to look after the needs 
of the poor, so that they have the minimum required to live in 
adequate conditions. On the other hand, a personal security plan 
concerns a single individual, namely its beneficiary. Such a 
system has no social dimension: it only concerns the individual.
<P>
	The underlying principle of that proposal is obviously the 
prevailing ideology within certain groups promoting a free 
market, the law of the jungle and the ``every man for himself'' 
philosophy. This is not the principle which guided the building, 
in Quebec and in Canada, of the current social, economic and 
even political structures.
<P>
	This morning, I listened to the hon. member for Calgary 
North, who mentioned some countries which had set up plans 
somewhat similar to the one she is proposing. She referred to the 
United Kingdom under Mrs. Thatcher and Chili under General 
Pinochet.
<P>
	I do not think these examples would be acceptable to people 
who have any social conscience at all. The British experience 
under Mrs. Thatcher, for the past fifteen years or so, was not a 
particularly happy one. If we compare that experience with the 
option chosen by France which has taken a different approach to 
managing and funding social programs, we realize that people in 
the U.K. are not better off financially than people in France, at 
present.
<P>
	As for Chili under General Pinochet, we need only consider 
what happened during that period and what this every man for 
himself, this free market ideology produced. It produced 
torture, deregulation and anti-union behaviour and made the 
poor even poorer. I do not think people would welcome that kind 
of system in Canada, especially since we recently had another 
example of a government that applied this ideology.
<P>
	Which country was mentioned in glowing terms by the 
International Monetary Fund? Which country was, in recent 
years, applauded for its privatization model? Which country 
was cited as an example for its cuts in social programs? It was 
Mexico. And look at where Mexico is today. This is a country 
that wanted to implement a foreign ideology, a country that took 
steps that had a disastrous impact, first on the poorest in 
Mexican society and later on the entire Mexican economy.
<P>
	We cannot disrupt people's lives for ideological reasons, and 
we cannot apply half-baked theories developed by academics in 
their ivory towers. We cannot just go ahead and blindly apply 
these ideologies to advanced societies like ours.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Clearly, I do not support the motion presented by the Reform 
Party. I intend to analyse it, however, because there are some 
aspects that must be condemned outright and that are downright 
shocking.
<P>
	First of all, the motion proposes to reform existing social 
programs which are said to be failing, an expression that has a 
certain currency among certain groups. Who says social 
programs are failing? The people who do not need them.
<P>
	Why do we have social programs in Quebec, in Canada, in the 
western world? Workers and the least well-off have always 
sought protection against poverty resulting from sickness, 
unemployment and old age. Often, when people can no longer 
work because of age they are poor if they had only their job as a 
source of income.
<P>
	Western society, has always, and particularly in the past 20 to 
30 years, sought protection against the poverty resulting from 
these scourges. I think they have clearly succeeded. We have 
health care programs to help the sick, unemployment insurance 
programs to support those who have lost their jobs and old age 
security programs to provide a decent standard of living to 
seniors who have worked all their lives.
<P>
	I do not know how we can claim these programs are 
ineffective. I think Canadians and Quebecers know what is 
involved; they want to keep their social programs. I have two 
personal examples for you that will confirm what I am saying.
<P>
	When the Minister of Human Resources Development tabled 
his proposed social reforms, I called a meeting in my riding for 
anyone interested in the subject. Some 200 people showed 
up-people from community groups, the unemployed, union 
people-These people made it clear to me that we had to protect 
the social programs we enjoy in Canada today. We might have to 
change them a bit, but the conclusion was that they had to be 
protected.
<P>
	My second example is the petition given me by the movement 
known as Solidarité populaire, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. 
This petition contains nearly 11,000 names requesting the 
minister to keep the social security safety net in Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
	In the light of such a showing, I can only support those who 
elected me, particularly because I share their beliefs, and insist 
that the government maintain the social programs we currently 
have in Canada, adjusting them as necessary to suit 
circumstances and to improve their effectiveness.
<P>
	We hear a lot about the cost of social programs. Of course, 
unemployment insurance, old age security and health insurance 
cost money. To some extent, we can surely limit expenditures. 
We need think only of the duplication of federal and provincial 
initiatives, which we could stop.
<P>
	We could also consider cutting expenses by adapting certain 
programs to reduce their costs and so that the people running 
them give greater thought to costs. Given the effects of these 
programs in social terms, I do not think that current costs are 
exorbitant.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10673"> 10673 </A></B>
<P>
	The problem with these issues of cost is the lack of fiscal 
resources. Why are we lacking fiscal resources in Canada? 
Because our policies on employment are ineffective.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Certain circles, especially people from the Reform Party, 
have the following to say about employment policies: ``We do 
not need to have a policy on employment, because jobs are 
created by the private sector''. This point of view is slowly 
winning over some of our friends opposite, from the Liberal 
Party. What a pity. Although it is true that business creates jobs, 
in advanced societies like ours, the government should blaze the 
trail and take job creation initiatives whenever there is a need.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that we introduce initiatives based 
uniquely on a certain ideological or theoretical framework. We 
must look at the needs of the population and make sure that they 
are met, to the extent that this is possible.
<P>
	I would like to move on to a more thorough critique of the 
Reform Party proposal, as regards a personalized system. The 
concept of universality would be thrown out. People who have 
contributed to a plan would be able to use it, and people who 
have not made contributions, well, who knows what would 
happen to them. The principle of universality is important, 
because it acknowledges a citizen's right to receive services by 
virtue of being a citizen, and, if all citizens have equal rights, 
they should all have access to many different kinds of services, 
like health care, education, social security and old age security, 
just because they are citizens.
<P>
	Of course, those who are better off may possibly, through 
various means such as taxation, be required to pay back the 
benefits that they receive, but it still remains true, I think, that in 
a society, it is important that citizens collectively have the right 
to certain services, by the simple fact that they are citizens.
<P>
	Under the personalized system proposed by the Reform Party, 
everybody would contribute to the plan, everybody would invest 
money in a fund in order to pay for their own eventual social 
needs. But, what happens to people who, for one reason or 
another, do not contribute to the plan? What happens to people 
who are unemployed, who cannot afford to make contributions? 
The chronically ill? People whose lack of training prevents them 
from being part of the active population? What would we do 
about them? Would we create a dual social security system?
<P>
	And if we did, how would the people who have to contribute to 
a personalized plan feel? They will say: ``We are already paying, 
so why should we pay for others?'' In that case, will we let the 
poor pay for the poor? We can already see where a proposal like 
this one would take us. It would take us to a two-tier society 
with rich people living well and poor people starving.  
Quebecers and Canadians alike condemn that kind of society.
<P>
	The proposal refers to tax-sheltered savings accounts. This 
means that the personalized system will be tax-deductible in a 
way. In other words, the Reform Party is saying ``every man for 
himself'', except that the state will have to give tax deductions 
to those who contribute funds to this system. I think that this is a 
covert way of making the state pay. It is all very well to say: 
``Yes, people will invest, take themselves in hand, put money 
aside-''
<P>
	I heard our Reform colleague explain to us this morning that if 
you invest so much per year, you end up with a fortune after 15 
or 20 years. This reminds me of the financial advisors who visit 
people in their homes and tell them: ``If you deposit $500 every 
six months or $1,000 a year, with interest rates, you will become 
a millionaire''. After he leaves, you see yourself as a 
millionaire, but you are not one penny richer.
<P>
	While we are on the subject, our Reform colleague said this 
morning while explaining her system's benefits: ``Assuming 
that a person invest so much as such-and-such an interest rate 
and that this person is never sick or unemployed, he or she will 
be a millionaire in 30 or 40 years''. Such assumptions do not 
feed the poor, care for the sick or provide our old people with the 
support they need.
<P>
	As for tax-deductible RRSPs, you may think, Mr. Speaker, 
that I am against RRSPs in principle, but that is definitely not 
the case, neither for me nor for my party.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	In fact, in prebudget debates, we spoke in support of not 
taxing RRSPs, in spite of the fact this currently deprives the 
Canadian government of $15 billion in revenues, because we 
think it is not fair to change the rules of the game along the way, 
after a contract was signed or a tacit agreement has been reached 
by the government and citizens who invest in RRSPs. It had been 
agreed that these benefits would not be subject to tax.
<P>
	As a party, we are not against RRSPs. We do not want RRSPs 
to become taxable, but at the same time we cannot understand 
why one would want to apply the RRSP formula to everyone in 
our society.
<P>
	I see that I am running out of time, but I would just like to 
address one issue that our colleague raised this morning. What 
happens to those who invest in RRSPs if something goes wrong 
with the economy, if banks go under, if bad investments are 
made, if our currency is devalued, if the interest rates go down, 
if there is an economic crisis? I could go on and read you the 
entire Apocalypse. Many things can happen that will cause 
funds invested in RRSPs vanish. You could then come up to us 
and say: ``Well, I am poor now. You must help me''. If the 
Reform Party members were in power, here is what they would 
tell you: ``Look here, sir, you made investments and you lost 
money. You are a loser and  losers have no right to ask the 
society for help. When you lose money, you lose money, and you 
shut up''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10674"> 10674 </A></B>
<P>
	Basically, the Reform Party's proposal is for the rich, the 
healthy and the educated.
<P>
	The other problem with this proposal is this: these funds can 
and should be drawn only in an emergency. The proposed plan 
would replace the Unemployment Insurance Plan, the 
manpower training programs and the pension plans.
<P>
	What happens when an individual has the misfortune to 
become unemployed repeatedly over the course of several years, 
if he has the misfortune to be ill and therefore unable to 
contribute to his pension plan? What happens if that he drains 
his personal registered savings plan and ends up with nothing to 
fall back on.
<P>
	I think that the Reform Party's proposal takes a rather 
simplistic view of society and public finance. They are telling us 
that the public finance problem would be resolved if there were 
no public expenditures, which is rather simplistic, since it is so 
obvious. Except that public spending exists precisely because 
there is a public, a population, whose needs must be taken into 
account by politicians.
<P>
	Solutions such as the one proposed by the Reform Party may 
seem attractive to someone watching us on television, while 
relaxing in the living room. However, such solutions are not 
acceptable to the needy.
<P>
	In conclusion, since my time is running out, when faced with 
proposals such as this one from the Reform Party, we must 
remind our fellow citizens and politicians what social solidarity, 
society and community living are all about. Nowadays, these 
realities are too often forgotten. We hear about personal success, 
free market and registered personal security plan. This is a 
self-centred philosophy. I will not make a long speech about 
sacrificing everything, including ourselves, to help others, but 
we live in a society and we have a responsibility toward social 
solidarity.
<P>
	I invite Reform members to reflect on life in a society and to 
realize that we do not live only for ourselves but also for others, 
who also live for us. This is how we can all function in a society. 
And this is what we hope to preserve for a long time to come in 
Canada and in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to what my colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois had to say. He asked several questions which I think 
should be answered immediately.
<P>
	He asked who is saying social programs are inefficient. The 
Auditor General has said social programs are inefficient. I want 
to give the member some quotations from the Auditor General's 
1994 report in which he says rising social program use and high 
repeated use suggests that social programs may be creating long 
term dependency among some users.
<P>
	The Auditor General also says these social programs create 
disincentives to work when benefits from social programs 
compare favourably to earnings from jobs. He goes on to say 
employers and employees may be using unemployment 
insurance to support short term layoff strategies.
<P>
	Another point the Auditor General makes is that interaction 
among social programs may result in programs working at cross 
purposes to each other. One of the other things he says is 
unemployment insurance may be a factor in Canada's rising 
level of unemployment and the lower level of outputs that result.
<P>
	The Auditor General has said we need to take a closer look at 
this.
<P>
	My colleague then said this is an idea that rich people and 
Reform MPs have thought up. My colleague seems to think 
these are just our ideas. I do not think he has any idea of how the 
Reform Party works and how we arrive at our policies and 
principles. The very principles and policies we are discussing 
here today as Reformers have been brought to us by the poor 
people of Canada as an alternative to protect them.
<P>
	I would like to point out to my colleague how a grass roots 
party works. The idea we are debating today started with our 
members, not with our leader and not with a group of academics 
working on some government funded ministerial task force of 
some kind. Some of the best ideas that come forward come from 
the grassroots people, not from some top down, antiquated, 
political, bureaucratic system of some sort. The member should 
listen very carefully because these are not ideas that we have 
hatched in the back rooms of some office.
<P>
	I cannot understand where my colleague from the Bloc is 
coming from. For a party that wants the provinces to have more 
control, I do not believe he would argue with what we are 
discussing today. He is supporting more federally run, big, 
social programs. We are saying they should be decentralized 
even to the point where local associations and individuals would 
have more control over their affairs.
<P>
	One of the advantages of an RPSP is that there would be a lot 
less involvement of this big government in our lives. Taxes 
could be substantially reduced as individuals, local associations 
and charities would assume more responsibility for their lives in 
the communities. I believe this knew social order he alluded to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10675"> 10675 </A></B>
<P>
would have a positive effect even on reducing crime. He should 
take a closer look at what we are suggesting.
<P>
	I do not have a lot of time today to go into this, but there are 
other areas, such as higher education, where we could look at 
this concept. I will give a personal illustration. I have four 
children. I did not feel that when it was time for them to go to 
university or whatever institution they chose that I would have 
the wherewithal to send them there. Therefore, I laid a little bit 
aside every month when they were young. It was not very much. 
It was equivalent to the family allowance given by the 
government at that time.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	That small amount of money has grown to the point where 
now that they attend university, this RRSP type of saving pays 
for almost half of their education. The hon. member may not 
know, but I do not come from a wealthy background.
<P>
	The plan could be applied in so many areas. Poor people could 
actually provide for their children and provide more security for 
themselves.
<P>
	This country is in need of a major overhaul. The very idea the 
member suggests is unacceptable. Our country is not defined by 
our social programs, as many members are suggesting. I do not 
think Canadians can relate to the concept that we are Canadians 
and what makes us different from other countries in the world 
are the social programs we have.
<P>
	It is individual initiative, responsibility, sharing and 
co-operation. It is the charities we set up. It is caring for our 
neighbours and our communities. It is the freedom, the strong 
families and values we have established, the personal assistance 
we give to each other, not some great social program. That is 
what has built up this country.
<P>
	Thirty years of Liberal social engineering took away the 
personal responsibility. The very fabric of our society is being 
destroyed and the morale of the people is being broken.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to comment on what I have said. 
Does he not agree the government has failed miserably in 
running social programs? If he does not agree with our 
suggestion, what better suggestion does he have?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a few quick 
comments on what my colleague just said.
<P>
	Regarding the auditor general, I recall getting the impression 
from his report that he blamed Mr. Axworthy, to a certain extent, 
for proceeding with social program reform before thoroughly 
analyzing the efficiency of Canada's existing programs.
<P>
	I do not think that we can determine with any precision 
whether our social programs are efficient based on what the 
auditor general says. The auditor general has asked the 
government to review the situation.
<P>
	My second comment is about what my colleague from the 
Reform Party said when he claimed that his party's proposals are 
grass roots proposals. My proposals and the ideas I shared with 
you earlier also came from the people. I told you that I met with 
some constituents. I told you that people from 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean asked me to give Mr. Axworthy a 
petition which 11,000 people signed. Therefore, I can also 
safely say that my ideas come from the people. I think that 
people want to keep the social network or social net, which we 
all have in common.
<P>
	Now, regarding the opinion expressed that I should be happy 
to see social programs disappear because I am a sovereignist and 
because most of these programs are federal, and their 
disappearance could very well be politically opportune, simply 
because they are federal, this is not how the Bloc Quebecois sees 
it. Yes, indeed, we believe that the federal government should 
leave social programs to the provinces, because social programs 
do not lie within federal jurisdiction. What we are asking for is a 
system where the provinces would administer social programs 
in exchange for tax points corresponding to the cost of 
administering them.
<P>
	I think that federalists, like my colleague from the Reform 
Party, should be more careful when they talk about the 
importance of social programs, because some Quebecers say 
that the railway and social programs are what Canada means to 
them. The railway is being dismantled and so are social 
programs. Therefore, in the opinion of many people, Canada is 
also crumbling.
<P>
	Regarding the question I was asked about social program 
reform, I agree that the government ought to determine whether 
each social program meets the end it was designed for. I do 
admit that, in certain cases, it would be appropriate to adapt the 
program, and in others, to restrict them because they do not 
really meet any needs.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	In my opinion, Canada must continue to invest in social 
programs because Quebecers and Canadians are very proud that 
the neediest people in our society can still live in dignity.
<P>
	The solution lies in job creation, which will ensure that more 
Quebecers and Canadians are contributing money to the 
government. This is how we will be able to sustain the social 
programs which make us so proud and which make us the envy 
of many countries of the world.
<P>

<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me pleasure to address the issue before the 
House today.
<P>
	It is clear to everyone but I suppose the Liberal government 
that 30 years of social engineering have failed miserably. The 
main reason social programs have become unaffordable and 
unsustainable is that they create greater and greater dependency 
on social programs. No matter how these programs are designed, 
the end result would always be the same. More and more people 
use the system and eventually it becomes unsustainable because 
the government can no longer afford to pay the huge sums of 
money needed to satisfy everyone's so-called needs.
<P>
	This is why half the people on welfare today are described as 
employable. This is why our unemployment insurance program 
actually creates unemployment. Economists call this moral 
hazard and people in Saskatchewan call it plain stupid. This is 
something that must be addressed in the debate. The debt and the 
deficit seem to be issues that people do not even consider in the 
comments they are making in regard to this matter.
<P>
	The Department of Human Resources Development issued a 
report in January 1994 which provided an even more damning 
indictment of the negative effect of the unemployment 
insurance program. I want to address most of my remarks to the 
unemployment insurance aspect.
<P>
	The report examined over a dozen existing studies which 
concluded that the changes made to the Unemployment 
Insurance Act in 1971-72 resulted in an increase in the 
unemployment rate in the range of 1 to 1.5 percentage points. 
That is how much unemployment was raised because of the 
change. The report also noted two unpublished papers that 
produced estimates showing that the UI rate was as much as 3.5 
percentage points higher than it should be. That is very serious.
<P>
	Using the range of estimates provided in the government's 
report, it means that instead of the current unemployment rate of 
9.7 per cent it should be somewhere between 9.2 per cent and 6.2 
per cent. That is a huge difference.
<P>
	The UI program is so poorly designed that somewhere 
between 64,000 and 448,000 workers are unemployed because 
of it. It has not helped that we have suffered through 30 years of 
incompetent government and a lack of leadership has brought us 
to where we are today: on the brink of bankruptcy. Now we have 
44 per cent of the people in Canada doubting whether they will 
ever receive old age pension and 42 per cent doubting whether 
they will receive their Canada pension even though they have 
paid into it with their own contributions.
<P>
	The government's incompetence in dealing once and for all 
with the annual deficit by balancing the books is directly 
responsible for the deteriorating lack of confidence in our social 
security system. Instead of adding to our personal security, the 
approach of the Liberals to social programs is adding to our 
insecurity. They think if they just tamper with them a bit-and 
my hon. colleague from the Bloc suggested that we should tinker 
with them-they can make them better.
<P>
	We have tinkered for 30 years and now we are on the brink of 
bankruptcy. Not only have the Liberal social engineering 
experiments failed us fiscally and economically but they have 
also failed us socially. The number of single mothers is 
increasing dramatically, not because teenagers are not smarter 
than they were when I was young but because many provincial 
welfare programs will pay welfare to teenagers who leave home 
just because they have had a disagreement with their parents. It 
is clear to everyone except politicians that social programs are 
also destroying families.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Today I want to look specifically at how the registered 
personal security plan system we are putting forth might be used 
to improve the current unemployment insurance program. The 
Reform Party's policy with respect to unemployment insurance 
has been developed and approved by Reform Party members at a 
number of assemblies since 1988. Reformers believe the 
program should be returned to its proper role as a true insurance 
program to cover periods of short term unemployment and that it 
should be administered by the employees and employers who 
pay the premiums, not by some big government in Ottawa.
<P>
	At our membership assembly held in Ottawa last October 
Reform delegates, the supreme governing body of our party, 
voted almost unanimously in favour of the following resolution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Resolved that the Reform Party investigate the feasibility of replacing the 
compulsory, government operated, privately funded, taxpayer subsidized 
Unemployment Insurance Program with a voluntary, personally financed, 
privately administered, government regulated Registered Unemployment 
Savings Plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what we are bringing forward today as a suggestion 
that should be explored by the government.
<P>
	Reformers are not alone in thinking that the RPSP concept 
might have applications beyond savings for our retirement. This 
is what the Canadian Institute of Actuaries had to say about the 
possibility of expanding the use of RPSPs to replace the existing 
UI program in its submission to the human resources 
development committee:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A well designed Unemployment Insurance Program would be one which would 
encourage and reward attachment to the workforce. A capital accumulation 
program would fulfil this role, as this type of plan could be set up to deposit 
employer and worker contributions into a registered unemployment savings trust 
account. This account would be tax sheltered and invested at the sole discretion of </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10677"> 10677 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>the worker, similar to a group RRSP  arrangement. This program would be 
compulsory for all workers and would replace the existing UI program. This could be 
co-ordinated with CPP/QPP to enhance retirement security.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	While the Canadian Institute of Actuaries is saying 
contributions would be compulsory, Reformers have still not 
made a decision on whether the program should be compulsory 
or voluntary. The Reform Party is still investigating this concept 
and it will be a number of months before we will be able to make 
a final recommendation to our members.
<P>
	The winning proposal selected in the Fraser Institute's 1992 
economy and government competition estimated that replacing 
the current unemployment insurance program with the RPSP 
type program could save governments over $5 billion a year. 
The proposal also estimated the greatest positive impact came 
from replacing the disincentives to become hooked on UI with 
real incentives to work.
<P>
	Another huge benefit described was the increased economic 
activity and job creation that resulted from having about $12 
billion a year left in the hands of workers and employers instead 
of being sent to government to be wasted by spendthrift 
ministers and bungling bureaucrats.
<P>
	Many other benefits were noted in the study including a $1 
billion saving in government administration costs, a reduction 
in paper burden and red tape for employers and employees, more 
money in private hands for training and upgrading, and ending 
the duplication of effort between UI and provincial welfare 
programs. Surely everyone would realize that and support our 
proposal on that basis alone.
<P>
	Based on our initial research and the positive reaction to the 
idea of RPSPs by economists, business leaders, the general 
public and even the media, Reformers believe the idea is one 
whose time has come. Reformers invite the government to 
support our motion Work with us to help complete our 
investigation of the feasibility and application of the RPSP 
concept. We want to work together with government members. 
They said they were going to co-operate. This is one aspect 
where we can.
<P>
	Reformers will initiate extensive research effort in the next 
few months. We will use this background information to launch 
a far reaching consultative process to get public input. The 
concept will become part of the Reform Party's policy 
development process and will lead to discussion and debate in 
hundreds of constituency associations across Canada, 
culminating in a vote and a decision at our next membership 
assembly. If approved by our members the concept will form 
part of the Reform Party's election platform for the next general 
election. Reform will campaign using the RPSP concept, and if 
elected Reform will have the mandate to implement the changes 
we propose.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal approach is the reason many Canadians become 
cynical with traditional parties and old line  politicians. They 
never say what they are really going to do and they never really 
do what they say. The Liberals are masters of old style politics 
more than anything else. Reformers came here to change the 
democratic system.
<P>
	Voters under a Reform government would have real power as 
a result of democratic reforms which would include citizen 
initiated legislation, free votes for MPs, referendums, MP recall 
and a triple-E senate.
<P>
	Reformers know the government started out to solve the 
problem but now government itself has become the problem. My 
goal as a Reform MP is to get the government off the backs of 
people and out of their pockets. The registered personal security 
plan is one that will help us achieve that goal.
<P>
	That completes my presentation as I am willing to split my 
time with my colleague.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the hon. member's comments. I want to ask him 
about an issue to which I alluded during my speech. What 
happens to those who make bad investments? What happens 
when interest rates get too low? What happens when banks go 
bankrupt? It may sound a bit ridiculous that a bank could go 
bankrupt, but it has happened in western Canada. It almost 
happened with the old Barings bank, in England, which 
experienced serious problems following some unfortunate 
investments by one of its managers. What happens if the 
tax-exempt money put in safe banking institutions does not 
grow? What happens if, after 10, 15 or 20 years, the personal 
security plan is ruined by some crisis?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
question could be put to people who put their savings away 
today. What happens to savings in a bank today if the bank goes 
broke? I think the hon. member realizes that banks have 
insurance, that those funds are insured. The system would 
virtually be no different.
<P>
	I would like to turn it around. What is ensuring Canadians 
today with all the deposits they have made to the Canada pension 
plan that they will get anything? It has been administered by a 
government that has run the fund virtually into the red. It is over 
$500 billion in the hole. The liabilities in the Canada pension 
plan are over $500 billion. That is of a far greater concern than 
possibly some bank that may go under.
<P>
	The government can regulate this kind of thing. We are 
putting the suggestion out there. It is something that can be 
explored by Reformers and the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10678"> 10678 </A></B>
<P>
	A much more serious problem is being overlooked, the fact 
that the government will not meet the commitment it made to 
senior citizens. Years down the road it will be unable to fulfil 
its commitment.
<P>
	Interest at the present time is eating into our social programs 
to the point where it will not be very long that we will be paying 
more interest-and it may be at that point already-than we will 
be getting back in social programs. This is how critical it has 
become. This is why we need to look at alternatives and this is 
one alternative that should be seriously considered.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the introduction of the current Canada pension plan 
was preceded by an intense discussion over the merit of fully 
funded rather than a pay as you go social security system
<P>
	Under the fully funded system Canadians would have paid 
taxes to the government which would have been forced to make 
private market investments with the money. The system could 
never have gone bankrupt and would have increased enormously 
the amount of savings in the economy and therefore the rate of 
investment in economic growth.
<P>
	However, such a funded system would have resulted in 
unpredictable retirement benefits since the earnings of the funds 
would have been uncertain. In addition it would have resulted in 
high costs of portfolio management and a serious concentration 
of financial powers in the hands of the managers of a very large 
amount of money.
<P>
	The Government of Canada decided to adopt a pay as you go 
system under which continuously a currently working 
generation is taxed to pay for the pensions of the retired 
generation. This approach fit well into the political climate of 
the time when private markets were distrusted deeply and 
governments could do no wrong. The system also had political 
advantages. The population was growing rapidly and was 
expected to continue to do so.
<P>
	As a result, the tax burden on the relatively large number of 
working age people was and always would be low to provide the 
pensions for the relatively small number of those retired. In 
addition, the government could set guaranteed pension benefits 
and cover any unexpectedly high costs by raising government 
taxation rates.
<P>
	Sophisticated economic and actuarial models showed that in a 
world of constant population income there would be perfect 
intergenerational equity as all working contributors to the 
scheme would receive in return exactly the same amount they 
contributed.
<P>
	The Canadian pay as you go system is now in some trouble 
because the predicted population growth did not take place. 
Using reasonable assumptions, the unfunded liabilities of the 
Canada and Quebec pension plans have a  present value of $750 
billion. In other words, the amount that is promised to be paid 
out is smaller than the amount to be taxed under current rates. If 
we sum all of those future deficiency of payments we will come 
to a discounted value of $750 billion, about the same as the value 
of our current debt that is so hotly disputed all the time.
<P>
	In the early part of our next century the working generation 
may have to pay as much as 15 per cent of its come to 
pensioners. Other disadvantages of the present system are that it 
has lowered the private rate of savings and investment in 
economic growth. Public opinion surveys show that Canadians 
have become skeptical about their ability to receive promised 
benefits when they are retired. The ideals of the system for a 
population free of worries about retirement finances clearly has 
not been realized.
<P>
	With this empirical information about the shortcomings of the 
present system available now, the Reform Party believes it is 
time to replace it with a fully funded, what we call private 
security system. Canadians will continue to make mandatory 
contributions to their retirement savings just like under the 
present system, with some money coming from their pay and 
matching funds from employers. These contributions are 
deducted from income before taxes are calculated. There would 
be reasonable maximum contributions to prevent use of the 
instrument for massive deferral by high income earners.
<P>
	The biggest difference from the current system is every 
Canadian would have the option to pay these funds to a private 
trust administered by approved financial institutions, much like 
they can now under the registered retirement savings plans.
<P>
	All income and capital gains earned in the private system 
investments are also sheltered from income taxes. As a result, 
the average Canadian worker who contributes to such a scheme 
during their full lifetime may be expected to have accumulated a 
surprisingly large sum. This is possible in spite of seemingly 
small annual contributions they are used to now. The power of 
compound interest working on a tax free income works wonders.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Rough calculations show that persons now 65 who started to 
work at age 20 and enjoyed average wages and returns on their 
investments would be the proud owners of a nest egg greater 
than $1 million today.
<P>
	The individual Canadian would own this money and all rights 
to it. Access to it would no longer be subject to the whims of 
Parliament and other generations. However, because the fund 
was built with deferred tax obligations provisions have to be 
made that taxes are paid at some point on the assets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10679"> 10679 </A></B>
<P>
	For this purpose the owners have the same three basic options 
that exist under the present RRSP system. The entire fund can 
be turned into an annuity at age 71, permitting the payment of 
taxes during the remaining years at the relatively low rates 
applicable to the annual annuity.
<P>
	Alternatively the funds can be freed from all restrictions on 
use by paying income taxes in the years it is done. The third 
option is that funds can be withdrawn at minimum rates that 
roughly assure the entire amount is depleted at age 94 or one 
progressively higher in the future as people live longer. Taxes 
are payable on the withdrawal of funds each year.
<P>
	The preceding represents my own tentative ideas on the 
operation of the proposed personal security system. Actuaries, 
accountants and economists are needed to work out the details 
and assure the viability of the system.
<P>
	Much work has to be done to assure the smooth and equitable 
transition from the present to the new system. I am confident the 
devil and the detail will not destroy the basic vision. The system 
can also be used for the tax free use of funds for mortgage down 
payments, higher education, medical expenses and possibly 
unemployment.
<P>
	Such a universally funded and privately administered system 
would take Canada into the modern age when governments have 
to accept that socialism and collective approaches have failed. It 
would increase freedom and economic growth. Get to it, 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during this debate members of the opposition have 
raised many issues arising from the budget, in particular about 
building an effective social security system for Canadians.
<P>
	The motion before the House today and pronouncements from 
the Reform Party indicate one perspective on social programs, a 
perspective I do not share, one which no one on this side of the 
House shares, a perspective not shared by most Canadians and 
certainly not by the constituents in Windsor-St. Clair.
<P>
	In the federal budget and in the vision sketched out by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development there is quite 
another vision. The difference is clear. While Reform rambles 
on, indiscriminately cutting here and hacking there, the 
government is taking a thoughtful approach to human resource 
issues.
<P>
	The government is turning the page from the strait jacket of 
rigidly centralized Tory programs. The government is leaving 
behind the Tories laissez faire approach of writing cheques and 
to the more Tories the better.
<P>
	It is an innovation, something Reform does not know much 
about. It should not be the Reform Party. It should be the 
regression party. It is innovative in terms of social programs far 
beyond the simplistic notions of the Reform Party.
<P>
	In essence the budget reinvents government for the 1990s. 
These social programs and the budget are built on our belief that 
Canadians want communities and individuals to have the tools 
to make their own decisions while ensuring basic principles are 
in place on a national basis.
<P>
	It is very important to listen carefully to what Reformers say 
so that one can compare what they say to the government's 
vision of social security, peace and good government for this 
nation.
<P>
	Here come the guns. This government's approach begins with 
a focus on three priorities. We want to keep our citizens alive. 
We do not want them shooting each other. We are concerned 
about employability. We want to find the best way to combat 
poverty.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Employability by helping people to find, keep and improve 
their jobs and skills and the elimination of poverty are our goals.
<P>
	We have learned there are many ways to achieve these goals. 
The employment needs of a single parent led family in a housing 
project in Toronto are substantially different from the 
employment needs of a family which formerly made its living in 
the Atlantic fishery. In a country as diverse as Canada, there is 
no one size fits all, quick fix answer like Reform would suggest.
<P>
	For that reason provinces and territories are joining us in 
finding these new answers. They know innovation is not 
reserved to one level of government in our Constitution. One 
place that will become clear is the new Canada social transfer. 
This will shift federal support for post-secondary education, 
health, social assistance and social services into one package 
starting in the fiscal year 1996-97.
<P>
	Currently transfers under the Canada assistance plan come 
with a lot of strings attached. Strings have become less and less 
relevant to today's world. We believe some of these strings are 
unnecessary. We believe they impede innovation, restrict 
flexibility and increase administrative costs. They also impede 
regional solutions to very real and very different regional 
problems.
<P>
	In short, this cost sharing approach hampers provinces that 
need the breathing room to design and deliver social programs in 
line with their local needs.
<P>
	We believe the provinces share our goals to improve the 
employability of Canadians and to reduce poverty. What they 
also want is the flexibility to deal with these problems in a way 
that responds effectively to people's needs.
<P>
	Under the Canada social transfer we will allow this to happen 
while remaining faithful to certain fundamental national prin-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10680"> 10680 </A></B>
<P>
ciples. First and foremost the conditions of the Canada Health 
Act will be maintained. In other words, universality, 
accessibility, portability, comprehensiveness and public 
administration will be respected.
<P>
	Canadians also do not want to see their mobility restricted 
because of minimum residency requirements. Beyond those 
principles but consistent with them always there will be 
flexibility and partnerships.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development will be 
inviting all provincial governments to work together to develop 
through mutual consent a set of shared objectives that will 
underlie the new Canada social transfer. By achieving a coherent 
framework with provinces and territories we will be able to 
tackle the core problems of employability and poverty.
<P>
	This government wants to work with the provinces and 
territories to increase access to good quality child care. This can 
help improve the employability of many Canadians with low 
income. It can offer children a great environment that helps 
them learn and grow.
<P>
	We would like to work out better means of helping persons 
with disabilities to get jobs and to achieve greater independence. 
We believe provinces and interested groups will welcome that 
commitment and will help us achieve it.
<P>
	In these two areas, as in our entire array of federal-provincial 
relationships, we want to build new partnerships that focus on 
results and that are grounded in common values.
<P>
	While that is the government's approach, what about Reform? 
The record is silent. Reform has nothing of substance to say 
about any of these issues. Employability? Who knows. 
Reducing poverty? I think we can guess what Reform's 
perspective is.
<P>
	Perhaps I should simply move on to some other subject on 
which Reform members actually do have a policy. 
Unemployment insurance is a very good example. Their 
position is that we should knock $3.4 billion loose from the 
unemployed by cutting out all special benefits and the interest 
differences tied to local unemployment rates.
<P>
	Who would pay? Women would pay. There would be no more 
Maternity benefits. That is the Reform's idea of a baby gift. 
Welcome to Newt Manning's Canada, little one. The sick would 
pay. The sickness benefits under unemployment insurance 
would be cut out. Under Reform's plan we would have to guess 
that we might break our leg in advance and save up for it. 
Welcome to Preston Gingrich's Canada, convalescent 
Canadians. People in less prosperous regions would pay. 
Reform wants to see UI entrance requirements that would be 
sharply higher than they are now to bring them up to the level of 
the wealthy regions. Welcome to the land of neo-Newtism, 
unemployed Canada.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Can the UI program be reformed? Absolutely, but this is not 
the way. The government has been quite clear that we need to 
move forward from the current unemployment insurance 
program. We believe it does not do enough to help people get 
back to work. We believe it can be a far more active policy. We 
have set a target for program savings of at least 10 per cent.
<P>
	As the Minister of Human Resources Development has 
already said in the House, unlike Reform we will not achieve 
these results at the expense of 165,000 new mothers a year. We 
will not achieve these results at the expense of 155,000 people 
who fall sick annually. We will not achieve these results at the 
expense of 30,000 fishers. These are precisely the people 
Reform is attacking when it claims saving for a rainy day equals 
an intelligent social policy.
<P>
	The same holds true for seniors and seniors benefits. The 
Reform Party claims there is $3 billion waiting to be plucked 
from the old age security program. I cannot wait to hear what the 
seniors I meet for coffee at McDonald's on Wyandotte Street in 
east Windsor have to say about that.
<P>
	Like so many Reform proposals, we know the price but it will 
not tell us what we would be buying. Precisely who would lose 
their benefits and how much would they lose? Would it be a 
clawback? At what rate? From what income level? There is no 
way anyone can squeeze $3 billion from OAS without taking it 
from the seniors, whom no one would call wealthy.
<P>
	It is clear from the budget response Canadians support the 
direction the government has taken very strongly. They see the 
complaints from the opposition and from some provincial 
capitals about this new direction for what they are: pure politics, 
old fashioned politics, politics as usual. Our citizens know, even 
if some partisan politicians do not, we must build real ways to 
work together productively. They have no time for transparently 
obvious grandstanding. They have no time for ideological shell 
games.
<P>
	The government is determined to build a better system of 
social security for Canadians, one which could be sustained 
financially, one which sets clear goals and one which enlists 
consistent support to achieve those goals. The government's 
budget is a blueprint for that system.
<P>
	At the end of the day we have to wonder which approach is 
better. Canadians clearly prefer the approach of the government 
and reject the simplistic, facile approach of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
seldom heard as much distortion of another party's policy at one 
time. The member has done an excellent job of that and I 
congratulate her if that is her goal. There has not been that much 
distortion from a single member in a long time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10681"> 10681 </A></B>
<P>
	The member referred to the Liberal budget and how there has 
been so much flexibility given to programs under the budget. 
I would like to ask the member how this budget gives flexibility 
when it will still mean adding $24 billion per year, by the 
finance minister's own figures, to the debt and when interest 
payments on the debt will increase to $51 billion per year by 
the end of the three-year period?
<P>
	How does that give flexibility to social programs where 
billions and billions more will have to be taken from social 
programs to make interest payments? How does that give 
flexibility if the Canadian economy collapses and we go hat in 
hand to the International Monetary Fund asking for a loan and it 
says that we have to get rid of a lot of our social programs, 
otherwise it will not lend us the money? How does that give 
flexibility?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Hello. Earth to Reform. Mr. Speaker, Canadians 
want the deficit handled. They want the deficit managed. We are 
doing that. We are taking a little longer than Reform would 
because we do not want babies to starve in the street, we do not 
want children to miss their education and we do not want old 
people to not have income support.
<P>
	Hello. Earth to Reform. This is the real world over here.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have never heard such rubbish.
<P>
	Is it really an honourable debate of issues when somebody 
gets up and says the superior Liberal Party doesn't want to kill 
people and doesn't want babies to starve on the streets? By 
implication it is suggesting the people on the other side would 
have policies which deliberately would kill people and make 
babies starve.
<P>
	We do not by that kind of debating style advance the cause. 
Let us understand that all of us wish to have the best for all 
Canadians. The issue is how do we best get there. Only by 
discussing the issue of how we get there is any progress being 
made.
<P>
	Let me take the issue of unemployment insurance. The hon. 
member has never read any of the royal commissions made by 
previous governments, including Liberal, on the examination of 
the unemployment insurance system. They have universally 
said that system was created to protect Canadians from the 
hazard of unemployment. There was never any conception this 
should be used to pay for people who choose to become pregnant 
or who are ill, as she noted.
<P>
	The point is we have different systems for taking care of these 
things. It is totally inefficient and inequitable to ask some 
people to pay for hazards for which they are not exposed.
<P>
	Her calculations on welfare payments are totally off. We are 
currently paying $20 billion in UI and government OAS benefits 
to retired people. We are paying $18 billion in CPP-QPP. That is 
$38 billion.
<P>
	If $3 billion is cut out of that from the top, the arithmetic 
shows it is not necessary to go to the lower level. That is the kind 
of discussion we need, not saying we want to save lives and the 
other people want to kill Canadians. That is totally inappropriate 
for the Chamber. It is an indignity.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would invite the hon. member for 
Windsor-St. Clair not to use that phrase, which she has used 
twice before. It does not contribute to the dignity of the House.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the admonition. 
Whatever the language, we just heard it. The Reform Party does 
not want to support women who choose to get pregnant.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> The Reform Party does not want to support sick 
people. That is what I just heard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Rubbish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is amazing what we are hearing here today.
<P>
	A prominent politician told me recently that politics-I know 
the Liberals may not agree with this-is the art of the possible. 
The member for Labrador told me that. I agree with that 
statement. Politics is the art of the possible.
<P>
	The Reform Party has given the House an idea. What we are 
hearing is the idea being stifled, not legitimate criticism or 
maybe a suggestion or two to add to the idea, but accusations and 
fearmongering from the other side of the House. It is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	This government has one answer to the problem of poverty 
and one answer to the problem of people being unemployed. 
That is massive amounts of government money being thrown at 
the problem when it is shown clearly that it has not worked.
<P>
	The government is like a baby. At one end it has a huge 
appetite and at the other end it has no sense of responsibility.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen: </B>Mr. Speaker, I am trying to figure out what part of 
the anatomy is at the other end from the brain where the sense of 
Reform responsibility comes from.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
begin by focusing on what we are talking about today. Maybe we 
could begin by agreeing on the things that we agree with.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10682"> 10682 </A></B>
<P>
	We agree that all Canadians living in the best country in the 
world would expect from their government good fiscal 
management, so that all of our resources, all of the people with 
all of their energy, with all of their integrity, would be able to 
manage their affairs. Those affairs that are managed for them 
by the government would be done in such a way that the benefits 
are sustainable.
<P>
	In my short life I have had a number of occasions where we 
have been beneficiaries of living in this country. The first one is 
the privilege of being able to come here.
<P>
	I am a first generation Canadian but I remember distinctly my 
grandparents. Long before they passed away, they use to speak 
of the privilege of being in Canada. They did not want handouts. 
My grandparents were rugged, self-sufficient individualists. 
When they immigrated to this country they declined government 
benefits. They said they will live poorly but they will make it. 
They did.
<P>
	I am happy to be in a family that has a rich record of helping 
other people. It is not true that you can only help people by 
having the government pluck the pockets of the taxpayers, spin 
it around in the whirlpool in Ottawa, use up a whole bunch of it 
for administrative purposes, have politicians and bureaucrats 
decide of the money that is left who is entitled to it. That is a 
false assumption, if you stop to think about it.
<P>
	They have not created any money. They have not created any 
wealth. All they have done is taken the wealth away from the 
people, thereby reducing their ability to help those around them 
in need.
<P>
	I know of what I speak. I am old enough to remember before 
all of these programs were in place. I remember as a youngster 
one of our neighbours was very sadly, suddenly and tragically 
killed in a farm accident. There was no government program at 
that time to help the widow harvest her crop.
<P>
	I remember my dad organizing the neighbours. I was probably 
only five or six. I still remember that our neighbours went and 
that lady had her crop harvested first. When that was done, each 
one of the neighbours went back and did their own. That is the 
essence of charity. That is the essence of looking after people.
<P>
	There was a young couple my wife and I were familiar with 
who did not have regular jobs. They had financial difficulties. 
They obviously needed a lot more help than just money thrown 
at them. I am very happy to say that one of the best experiences 
of my life was I, one of the leaders in the group, got a number of 
mutual friends together. This man who was in financial trouble, 
was living in subsidized housing and the rent was high. He said 
he could get into a housing program if only he could get a down 
payment. There was a house builder who had really good starter 
homes, but he did not have the down payment. His payments if 
he got into it would be less than his rent.
<P>
	The most fun I ever had was when this small group of us could 
get together. Some of us made a donation to this. Some of us 
gave interest free loans. We went to this couple and we said we 
have arranged for the $6,000 they need as a down payment, let us 
go and buy the house. That was fun. The couple picked up on that 
and said that they now had an obligation to pay it back. They 
became more accountable. It did not take them long to pay back 
the money some of us had given them as interest free loans.
<P>
	That really was a good experience. However, that was before 
the government was taxing us to death. Now we are getting more 
and more government intervention which prevents us from 
looking after ourselves.
<P>
	This plan the Reform Party is promoting today simply says: 
We reject the premise that the government can look after our 
long term savings, our long term benefits or our temporary need 
for assistance when we are out of a job. We reject the premise 
that the government can do it better than we can ourselves or 
with the help of someone close to us. It is too far away and too 
inefficient.
<P>

this matter have now expired.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before speaking on Bill C-224, I would like to take this 
opportunity to mark St. Patrick's Day and wish all our Irish 
friends a very happy St. Patrick's Day. I would also like to call 
your attention to Claude Bourguignon's excellent article 
published in <I>La Presse</I> today on this subject.
<P>
	Mr. Bourguignon is a resident of my riding of 
Argenteuil-Papineau. In his paper, he relates the history of the 
massive presence of thousands of Irish Canadians from coast to 
coast. Claude Bourguignon is also one of the founders of the 
Irish Quebecers interpretation centre, located in 
Saint-Colomban, in the riding of Argenteuil-Papineau.
<P>
	The principle of Bill C-224, the Charitable and Non-profit 
Organization Director Remuneration Disclosure Act, 
introduced by the hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth is to 
force non-profit organizations and charitable organizations that 
receives, directly or indirectly, any assistance from the public 
funds of Canada to disclose the remuneration and benefits paid 
to their directors and senior officers.
<P>
	This means that the remuneration and benefits received by the 
directors and senior officers of charitable organizations would 
be disclosed upon receipt of federal government or public funds. 
This way, Canadians would have the assurance that public funds 
do not go to the directors and senior officers.
<P>
	Because it is all too often perceived as a charitable activity 
carried out on an individual basis and in isolation, volunteer 
work is overlooked in our political debates on the Canadian 
economy. However, individual volunteers' efforts are far from 
negligible given their economic impact. There is an obvious 
need to promote volunteerism. This essential element of society 
is also a lifestyle and a social duty.
<P>
	Yet, in recessionary times, volunteer organizations will have 
to use other financing methods because government assistance 
is getting increasingly restricted. It must also be noted that the 
survival of those services and programs people rely on is not 
guaranteed.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The old stereotypes concerning volunteers, their activities 
and their motivation are no longer valid. Today, two thirds of 
volunteers in Canada belong to the paid labour force and most of 
them hold full time jobs.

	This bill contains a few flaws, however. First of all, clause 3, 
line 17, reads in part as follows:

	This very broad wording could refer to a great many 
non-profit organizations which do not feel they have anything to 
do with the federal government. It should simply read, ``and 
receives directly''.
<P>
	Second, the next line reads in part as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>from the public funds of Canada</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The expression ``public funds of Canada'' is very ambiguous 
because it does not specify if these funds are strictly federal or if 
they include provincial and municipal funds.
<P>
	The main purpose of this bill is to avoid any possibility of 
fraud by directors and senior officers of non-profit 
organizations.
<P>
	All Canadians and Quebecers alike recognize that 
volunteerism is a great blessing to society. According to 
Statistics Canada, in 1987, Canada benefited from the work of 
over 9 million unpaid volunteers. Their work represented over 
one billion hours, or an average of two hours per week per job 
from November 1986 to October 1987, or more than 500,000 
full-time jobs for a year.
<P>
	The three main sectors relying on volunteer work are religious 
organizations, sports and recreation, as well as education and 
youth development.
<P>
	Close to one quarter of male volunteer workers are involved 
in recreational endeavours, while another quarter participates in 
religious and educational activities. Women are more likely to 
do volunteer work with religious organizations, with one fifth of 
them in that sector.
<P>
	Overall, 38 per cent of the volunteer work is related to the 
collection of funds, 36 per cent to the provision of information, 
and 35 per cent to the organization, monitoring or co-ordination 
of activities.
<P>
	It is surprising to see that most volunteers are not older or 
retired people. Close to half of them are in the 25-44 age group; 
a little over a quarter are in the 45-64 category, while the others 
are 15 to 24 year olds. Volunteers in the 25-44 age group hold 
close to two thirds of the jobs in education and youth 
development, and three fifths of the jobs in sports and 
recreation.
<P>
	As the official opposition representative and critic for issues 
concerning seniors, I want to point out that volunteers aged 65 
and over hold close to one fifth of the jobs related to social 
services, including health care and support.
<P>
	Moreover, the majority of volunteers come from 
middle-income households. Over 40 per cent of all volunteers 
come from households whose income is in the $30,000 to 
$60,000 range, 14 per cent come from households with an 
income of over $60,000, while only 5 per cent come from 
households whose income is less than $10,000.
<P>
	Volunteers with a household income of over $60,000 are 
found mostly in organizations with an economic or international 
focus, the percentages being, respectively, 19 and 21 per cent. 
Those with a household income of less than $20,000 are usually 
in social services and represent nearly one-quarter of all 
volunteers, which reflects the high ratio of senior citizens in this 
area. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10684"> 10684 </A></B>
<P>
At  least 19 per cent of volunteers in social services are aged 65 
and over.
<P>
	In an article that appeared in <I>La Presse</I> on February 6, 1993, 
journalist Clause Masson discussed the use of funds collected 
during telethons, saying that if we consider the preparations for 
a telethon, the need to maintain a permanent staff and also the 
promotion campaign, the cost of producing this kind of show is 
enormous and that is where a substantial amount of money 
collected is spent.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	And that is where the organizations that conduct these 
telethons will have to make some changes. For instance, there is 
definitely something wrong when a total of $3 million is 
collected and only 10 or 20 per cent is donated to the actual 
cause. To make a telethon worthwhile, at least 50 per cent or 
$1.5 million should go to direct services.
<P>
	We must keep telethons from being a way for people and 
organizations to perpetuate the so-called charity business. Just 
because organizations are not for profit does not mean we should 
trust them implicitly.
<P>
	In 1991, Quebecers gave over $400 million to a myriad of 
organizations appealing to their generosity, that is charities, 
foundations, church parishes, recreational organizations, etc. 
Canadians on the whole, excluding business, gave roughly ten 
times more, that is, some $5 billion dollars, according to the 
Canadian Centre for Philanthropy. Thus, on the subject of 
transparency, it would be interesting if the organizations 
receiving federal government or public assistance were required 
to reveal the benefits and salaries of their officers.
<P>
	Canadians could then verify that public funds used to support 
charitable organizations do not simply go into the pockets of the 
people administering them. In conclusion, subject to the two 
points I raised earlier, we would be prepared to support the spirit 
of this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in support of Bill C-224, an 
act to require charitable and non-profit organizations that 
receive public funds to declare the remuneration of their 
directors and senior officers. My colleague from 
Hamilton-Wentworth has spent a great deal of time and 
research on this matter in the interests of deficit reduction and in 
the interests of the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Accountability has been the battle cry of the 1990s. We have 
heard this cry coming from all sides: from business, from 
special interest groups and most important, from the individual 
Canadian taxpayer. What this bill does is provide for 
accountability in the charitable and non-profit sector of the 
economy, and the very large segment of the economy that it is.
<P>
	This bill is about disclosure of the real value of non-profit and 
charitable organizations, not only in the human resource but in 
financial dollars to the Government of Canada. The people of 
Canada have a right to know. The reason I believe this is that we 
rationalize our growth as well as our debt against GDP. 
Therefore it is very important that we have accurate information 
on the real value of GDP. It should include the value to the 
Canadian economy of non-profit and charitable organizations.
<P>
	This bill is not intended to harm or embarrass anyone. 
However it is intended to provide transparency and 
accountability. While Canadians hold their government 
responsible for its actions, they also trust it to report on all 
public matters with accuracy, openness and truthful 
representation.
<P>
	These same keystones must exist for charities and non-profit 
organizations which receive public funds. After all, if 
government is to be fully accountable to the Canadian people 
and if we are to efficiently execute our mandate as the trustees of 
public funds, then it follows that we must have complete and 
accurate reports on where and how public money is spent.
<P>
	At the present time there is no process in place that will allow 
for complete scrutiny, at least not without applying to the courts. 
Even then, full disclosure may not be possible. This problem has 
been a longstanding one which arises from the Income Tax Act 
and the legal system.
<P>
	Neither department can absolutely or clearly define which 
category charities and non-profit organizations should come 
under because these groups cross several lines with regard to 
existence, function and purpose. They function like a business 
but unlike a business they do not make a profit.
<P>
	Quite often not for profit organizations make large 
investments which earn interest or capital gains yet they are not 
taxed on this money. They have no product or service to offer in 
the normal sense of the word. However, we have heard the 
complaint that a not for profit organization will operate a tavern 
and pay no taxes while a small business person across the street 
pays taxes on a similar operation. Is this fair competition? Is this 
a level playing field?
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	These not for profit groups have a social function to ease or 
remedy some problems which may exist in our communities or 
national settings. They receive funds in one form or another, a 
portion of which are the taxes paid by hard working Canadians. 
With these funds they run their programs, pay salaries and 
execute daily business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10685"> 10685 </A></B>
<P>
	As anyone can see, a clear definition as to where charities 
and non-profit organizations belong is no easy matter. Since 
the assent of the Income War Tax Act of 1927, the courts have 
tried but have not yet been successful in absolutely defining 
any organization which has as its focus the improvement of the 
human condition.
<P>
	This special category which charities and non-profit 
organizations are given exempts them from paying income tax. 
Yet there seems to be an inequality here. The amount of 
information these groups must provide to Revenue Canada, 
which exempts them from tax, and the accountability they have 
to funding ministries is minimal. Smaller still is the amount of 
information available to the very people who actually fund 
them, the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	For example, the public is made aware daily through the press 
of the salary of every hon. member of the House. They are aware 
of the tax free allowance and they are bombarded with 
information regarding the MPs' pensions, all of this rightly so. 
Would it not seem fair that the same public have access to the 
same information of high profile heads of non-profit 
organizations?
<P>
	One that comes to mind is David Somerville, the president of 
the National Citizen's Coalition, a non-profit organization. Mr. 
Somerville does great work on behalf of the public so should 
they not have a right to know his salary, his pension and his total 
benefit package?
<P>
	If Bill C-224 becomes law, within 30 days of fiscal year end 
there would be full disclosure of salaries and benefits paid to 
directors and senior officials of these charitable and non-profit 
organizations.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that charitable and non-profit 
organizations were a large sector of our economy. To 
demonstrate how significant these numbers are, we know there 
are more than 130,000 organizations in Canada classified as 
charities or non-profit organizations. Available estimates show 
that approximately $120 billion flow through these 
organizations annually and that $49 billion comes from the 
various levels of government.
<P>
	We know these organizations act in the public interest but we 
also know there is no measurement to gauge the effectiveness of 
the programs. By anybody's standards, that is a big bundle of 
money.
<P>
	Some months ago we read in the newspapers in every city in 
the country where the Chamber of Commerce in Quebec City 
gave a gift to the premier of Quebec. The gift was a mansion 
worth $650,000 and $150,000 worth of furnishings. This was a 
gift to a politician, to Jacques Parizeau. The moneys that paid 
for this political gift were moneys claimed as 100 per cent 
business deductions passed through this Quebec City Chamber 
of Commerce as donations to non-profit organizations and the 
Chamber of Commerce bought the house as a gift to a politician.
<P>
	Does the public not have the right to know how much money is 
going through non-profit organizations to buy mansions for 
politicians across the country? Does the public not have the right 
to know how many politicians at all levels may be receiving 
financial support or valuable gifts from non-profit 
organizations? I think most Canadians will agree with me that 
we have a right, especially since most Canadians are paying 
their fair share of taxes. In the final analysis, those who are 
paying are picking up the tab as well for those who are not.
<P>
	If we are to be the guardians of the public trust and if we are to 
be fair to all sectors of the economy then I believe we have a 
great opportunity to at least take a first step toward more 
fairness with the implementation of Bill C-224.
<P>
	I come from rural Canada, the Atlantic region, where people 
are generally very kind, very charitable with their friends and 
neighbours and very generous with what money they have. In 
most instances they would give you their last dollar if you really 
needed it. That is the Canadian spirit. I believe in my heart that 
with disclosure, the Canadian spirit of giving would be 
enhanced. The openness of information would generate greater 
trust and financial support to those organizations that we depend 
on in our communities and the thousands of volunteers who give 
so generously of their time and energy.
<P>
	At this very crucial financial period in our nation's history, 
when the government has taken unprecedented bold, courageous 
steps to cut programs, to cut jobs and to cut spending, surely we 
have that same bold courage to support this bill.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadians are generous in their donations and each of us 
places great value on the work our charities and non-profit 
organizations do in our communities. However, I am sure that 
each of us has wondered where exactly the money goes. How 
much is spent on very high paying salaries and how much really 
reaches the needs of the child or the researcher for which it is 
intended?
<P>
	Bill C-224 provides that information to the public. It provides 
disclosure. I believe that having full knowledge of where the 
money is spent, Canadians will be even more generous to the 
groups that are deemed worthy of financial support. I commend 
my seatmate, the hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth, for 
his foresight, for his diligent research as well as his integrity and 
determination to do what is right. I believe in times to come this 
bill may be considered the very most important piece of 
legislation that comes before this 35th Parliament.
<P>
	I believe Canadians are ready for this legislation and that the 
bill is very compatible and may even be considered a companion 
to the very recent budget bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10686"> 10686 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, it is my hope that all hon. members of the 
House will give serious consideration to this bill and offer their 
full support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise to speak on this private member's bill. I 
would like to congratulate my friend from 
Hamilton-Wentworth for putting it before the House.
<P>
	This is a bill which I do not think the Reform Party would have 
any problem supporting. It is about two things which we feel 
very strongly about, accountability and public disclosure.
<P>
	We all have made contributions to non-profit groups and to 
charities and I am sure that all of us at times have wondered just 
what percentage of our dollars actually goes to the cause, which 
was mentioned by the previous speaker. How much of it goes to 
the cause and how much of it goes to administration and 
bureaucracy? This bill will go a long way in allaying some of our 
fears. There is nothing like information to put one's mind at rest. 
Certainly speculation and fear of the unknown are things which 
lead to more and more speculation.
<P>
	While we are talking about accountability and public 
disclosure, I note that the previous speaker mentioned the 
pension plan. It was my understanding that there was great 
difficulty trying to get the record of who had received 
parliamentary pensions in the past, the amounts and also the 
amounts which were put in by the member and the amounts 
which were paid by the taxpayer. Perhaps a companion bill 
sometime down the road, along the lines of public disclosure 
and accountability for publicly paid pension plans, would be a 
great idea as well.
<P>
	I have to make apologies to my research assistant, who 
actually wrote two speeches for me today, but I am using neither 
of them. I send my apologies to him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> It sounds pretty good 
to me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> I hope it sounds good to my research assistant 
too, who should take some solace in that.
<P>
	I am sure that most people in the House realize and recognize 
that Reform MPs are making considerable donations in their 
constituencies, as a percentage of their income, to charities. We 
are all fairly well versed in the charities that are available in the 
community. As the previous member also said, this is intended 
in no way to call into question the good which these charities and 
non-profit organizations do.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	As a matter of fact, I could see this as being an augmentation 
to the good they do. If too much of their collected funds actually 
do go to administration and so forth, then I am sure the people 
who have volunteered many hours to ensure these organizations 
and charities are a success would be very disheartened to learn 
of exorbitant salaries and fees paid to board members and 
executives.
<P>
	I do not intend to take up my full time on this bill. A few words 
are as good as many words in a case of this type.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, until the member for Kent 
comes back into the Chamber I would like to stand and support 
my colleague for Hamilton-Wentworth.
<P>
	This bill is an example of how a member of Parliament can 
come into this Chamber and with proper research support, with a 
very specific idea and with a lot of hard work can put something 
on the national agenda which touches every community, every 
city, every part of our country very positively. I salute my 
colleague for Hamilton-Wentworth for this tremendous 
achievement in bringing the bill this far.
<P>
	In regard to a specific aspect of the bill, this type of 
accountability for Canada's not for profit sector is going to 
create internal efficiency within these organizations. We have 
all read stories from time to time where various organizations 
have been accused of being too heavy in administration with not 
enough going to the line after the administration expenses have 
been accounted for. It casts aspersions on the organization 
because it cannot put all of its books and records into the public. 
It also does not allow the not for profit organizations that are 
acting efficiently to make their performance record open to the 
public.
<P>
	This bill will achieve a renewed interest in the volunteer 
sector. We will be depending upon that sector more and more as 
we move into a very difficult period in terms of fiscal discipline. 
The organizations which are operating efficiently and which are 
meeting their constituents' needs are going to be rewarded by 
those in our society who appreciate that type of efficient 
volunteer service.
<P>
	I thank my colleague and give him my full support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I support the hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth's bill as well. Listening to the previous 
speakers, I heard the member for Cumberland-Colchester say 
that it could become the most important piece of legislation 
during this session. The member for Broadview-Greenwood 
said it was a magnificent achievement.
<P>
	I am looking for words to give it even more applause but 
unfortunately, I cannot reach that high in my praise for this bill. 
However, to compliment the hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth, I will say it is a good bill. It is a very 
necessary bill and certainly I and my colleagues of the Reform 
Party have no problem supporting it.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="10687"> 10687 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1400 ) </B>
<P>
	When Reformers came to Ottawa we said we would not be 
here on this side of the House simply to criticize the Liberal 
government. The way it has turned out in this 35th Parliament 
we have not had much choice but to criticize. The Canadian 
people who tune in to what is happening in Parliament will know 
that whenever we criticize we do at the same time offer 
constructive alternatives.
<P>
	This is one of the times when we really do not have to criticize 
this bill because quite frankly after all the exhaustive research 
we have done on it we really cannot find too much wrong with it 
bill. I want to the let the House know that while the member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth and his research assistants have done 
exhaustive research to define the bill clearly, we have done 
exhaustive research to determine whether this was a good bill or 
not and indeed it is.
<P>
	We basically want the non-profit organizations and the 
charity organizations to become more accountable in their 
bookkeeping primarily so we can find out what the leading 
members of the organization are getting paid for their services.
<P>
	We know the Government of Canada contributes a lot of 
money to non-profit organizations, special interest groups. Of 
late we have had examples where expenses have been seen to be 
exorbitant because of the lack of accountability in how these 
expenses are reported. We have seen many cases where these 
special interest groups and non-profit organizations will skip 
some of the lines on the income tax return and just put in a lump 
sum showing lump sum salaries paid to some of the top people in 
the organization. This will do away with all that. We are going to 
get more accountability.
<P>
	When I am talking about accountability I have to hold the 
member for Hamilton-Wentworth blameless in this because he 
seems to have a good understanding of what accountability 
means. I would encourage him to apply the same principles he 
did to this bill to his conversations with other members of the 
Liberal Party. What the Reform Party came here to do was to 
demand accountability from the government.
<P>
	The hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth appears to have 
a pretty good handle on accountability. In supporting this bill I 
want to encourage him to talk to as many of his colleagues as he 
can so that we may finally get some accountability from the 
government as we go forward in the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	We support this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
and an honour to speak in favour of the motion.
<P>
	A couple of things have come to mind in the last few minutes 
while I have been listening to the other speakers. I would be 
remiss if I did not add to the commendation of the hon. member 
who has proposed this bill. I have had the privilege of working 
with him in the Bill C-43  committee. It is a very healthy sign 
and gives me a little glimmer of hope that perhaps there are 
some Liberals who do believe in accountability. Sometimes we 
get the impression that is not there.
<P>
	The hon. member was instrumental in adding to the strength 
of Bill C-43 in a couple of areas, in particular disclosing. When 
lobbyists receive government funds they must now disclose it. I 
believe disclosure is the first step to elimination of receiving the 
funds.
<P>
	The best legislation in the House seems to come from private 
members. It is really the only time when we have this large 
envelope of unanimity. Perhaps we ought to consider changing 
the rules of the House and have government business the last 
time of the day on Friday and have private members' bills the 
rest of the time. Perhaps we would be able to change the system.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	I commend the member on this principle. It is close to my 
heart because I believe strongly in charities and the work they 
do. I also believe in accountability. If it were not for that I would 
not have come here as a member of Parliament. That was one of 
my prime motivations.
<P>
	I remember listening to my son whom I have mentioned 
before in the House. He is currently working as an administrator 
in an orphanage in Rwanda for a charitable organization. He and 
his wife are helping to look after some 400 children whose 
parents were killed in the unfortunate occurrence there. My son 
has been doing this type of work for five or six years, having 
been in Somalia, in the Sudan, in Bosnia and in other areas. He 
made a statement that I thought was very significant. He said 
that in the areas where he has worked the non-government 
organizations, the NGOs, are about twice or more as efficient as 
government organizations.
<P>
	He talked about salaries. When he goes there he basically gets 
an expense allowance and that is about it. Whereas other people 
who are supposed to be helping receive huge salaries. He said he 
could not believe it. I will not mention the organizations because 
that would be unkind since they are not here to defend 
themselves. After working over there for five or ten years some 
of the people he mentioned will come back to Canada with a pile 
of wealth in their accounts because they were not spending it 
over there.
<P>
	A charitable organization has potential for the greatest 
accountability. The whole idea of bringing the good we do to 
help people down to people and away from government needs to 
be strengthened. That will happen if we open the accountability 
and the desire of organizations to be open and honest with the 
people that support them.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10688"> 10688 </A></B>
<P>
	In my experiences I made it a policy many years ago of not 
supporting private charitable organizations that will not open 
their books. In some instances I have actually written and and 
said: ``Please send me your annual statement for last year. If 
it is not audited by an independent auditor I will probably not 
help you''. I believe in that principle and it ought to be applied 
right across the board.
<P>
	It is refreshing to see it being done in this area of tax 
expenditure. I say in the very best sense I can that I wish the hon. 
member for Hamilton-Wentworth would spread this virus of 
accountability throughout his caucus so we can infect every 
agency of government with total openness, total accountability 
and total declarations of how much money was received and how 
it was spent.
<P>
	I am pleased to have spoken in favour of the motion. I 
certainly will be supporting it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Under the circumstances the hon. 
member for Hamilton-Wentworth might wish to close the 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish from the bottom of my heart to thank my 
colleagues on all sides of the House who spoke in favour of the 
bill.
<P>
	All things aside I believe the bill is important and will have a 
profound effect on Canadian society in what it proposes to do. 
For me as a member of Parliament the experience of presenting 
the bill to the House and having the support of my colleagues on 
all sides fills me with great pride in this 35th Parliament.
