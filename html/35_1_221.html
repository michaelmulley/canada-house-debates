	The House resumed from June 13 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-295, an act to provide for the control of Canadian 
peacekeeping activities by Parliament and to amend the 
National Defence Act in consequence thereof, as amended, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am resuming remarks interrupted by other House 
business on another day and we now return to the motion of the 
hon. member for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	To recapitulate what I said earlier on this bill, one respects the 
intention and the purpose behind it. In the interim I have had the 
privilege of sitting as a substitute member on the all party 
committee on national defence. The experience reinforces the 
comment I made earlier. This is one of the very strong 
committees of the House. I was very impressed with the degree 
of knowledge of the members and the degree of co-operation 
across both sides of the table from all parties. In other words, 
there is a great deal of awareness in the committee of the gravity 
of the problem and the search for proper remedies.
<P>
	That brings me back to the main point that the failure in 
Bosnia is a failure in foreign policy and not in the military 
sphere of the operation. The failure goes back to a basic 
criticism many contemporary historians have made that this is 
one of the low periods in foreign policy in the world community.
<P>
	If we look at the confidence, the reaction to the events of the 
emerging cold war in the late forties and fifties, the very creative 
period in American foreign policy, in European foreign policy 
with Adenauer, Schuman and De Gasperi creating the European 
community, we are now in one of those periods in which foreign 
ministers simply seem unable to cope with the problems.
<P>
	Returning to Bosnia, the failure was in lacking a vision of 
what to do with Yugoslavia once it broke up, as inevitably it was 
to break up. Everyone predicted this when Tito should die and 
Tito's regime should pass into history. We find there are 
alternative plans. Greater Serbia has been spoken of but there is 
a greater Bulgaria concept, a greater Greece concept, conflicting 
ambitions of Balkan powers restrained by the facts of life of the 
cold war and bipolarity but broke out with the breakdown of the 
cold war system of world public order and the new pluralism 
which dangerously at times comes close to anarchy.
<P>
	In this area Canada has played a constructive and useful role. 
We were not in at the beginning on the decisions on Yugoslavia 
and post-communist Yugoslavia. We were not part of the 
contact group. To be frank, I see no point in our trying to join the 
contact group now. We would in effect be trying to correct errors 
made by European foreign ministers who should have known 
better.
<P>
	We have to search for solutions using other arenas like CSCE, 
NATO, forum available to make our point. In terms of military 
operations, the Canadian forces have behaved with intelligence, 
good judgment and restraint. We have recognized that United 
Nations peacekeeping as devised by Prime Minister Pearson 
absolutely prohibits a political role. What is now talked about in 
contemporary international relations activities as crossing the 
Mogadishu line is something Canadian military men above all 
have always observed with proper self-restraint. We have to 
face the reality that our peacekeeping forces have not been 
developed with a view to imposing political solutions by 
military means. There is nothing in the training of our staff 
colleges that lends itself to this.
<P>
	I have had the privilege of lecturing to our national defence 
college and the military college at various stages in my 
pre-parliamentary life. They are very well trained but they 
cannot cover the whole world. If we are to send them to Somalia 
to impose a political solution or to former Yugoslavia to impose 
a political solution the training is not there. We have behaved 
properly and correctly.
<P>
	Counting this we have had three debates in the House on the 
future of peacekeeping. What emerges on the future of 
peacekeeping is a large interparty consensus which crosses the 
House that we wish to maintain the classical conception of 
peacekeeping. That is something we developed and which we do 
very well. If it is a matter  of moving into peacemaking, 
imposing political 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14056"> 14056 </A></B>
<P>
solutions, we have to recognize the limits of our special 
competence.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	In countries that have connections with the former British 
empire, the Commonwealth and la francophonie there are 
special ties of culture and experience that give us perhaps the 
ability to make political judgments if that is what is called for. 
Elsewhere, it is entering unchartered seas. Therefore, the clear 
conclusion emerging from our debates is that we maintain 
peacekeeping as our function for the United Nations, that we do 
not get into peacemaking and that we do not cross the 
Mogadishu line.
<P>
	In relation to the bill presented by the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley East, I respect the intention here but I wonder about the 
attempt to legislate what sensibly can be left to executive 
administrative judgment. In article 5(2) the Canadian forces 
shall not participate in any action designed to force the governor 
of state to leave office or to install a government other than by 
facilitating a democratic process in accordance with the laws of 
the state or a resolution of the United Nations general assembly 
or the United Nations security council.
<P>
	We are bound by international law. Because it is one of the 
currently contested points before the International Court and 
elsewhere, it is arguable whether a United Nations general 
assembly or security council resolution can go beyond 
international law. Where it does go beyond that it is arguable it 
is unconstitutional in United Nations terms.
<P>
	I wonder why one should try to legislate this. We are bound by 
common sense. The one thing emerging from the debates in the 
House and which any foreign minister would take note of is that 
Canadians do not want us to get into political ventures in the 
Balkans or areas where we have no special historical ties and no 
background of historical experience to aid our judgment. In 
other words, we have done very well with General MacKenzie 
and the people we have had there. The all party consensus is 
there and the defence committee reflects this. There is no need 
to legislate this. Good sense prevails.
<P>
	This bill is taking us into an American style constitutional 
solution but it is unnecessary in our context. Even in the case of 
the United States, all the legislation in the world and the 
American constitution have not prevented the president of the 
United States making those errors of political judgment and 
getting involved in political military ventures overseas that go 
beyond the letter and, some would argue, the spirit of the 
constitution.
<P>
	These debates on peacekeeping have been an educational 
experience. In many respects there have been inspiring 
contributions by members. The consensus is very clear that no 
foreign minister will take us on a creeping course into foreign 
military involvement. All reports of the summit meeting 
suggested we have  exercised prudent self-restraint. Within the 
limits of our powers we have spoken to other foreign ministers, 
presidents and heads of states and have said as far as we are 
concerned we are peacekeepers, we cannot ourselves get 
involved in political-military ventures.
<P>
	That is the spirit of the House. I do not think it is necessary to 
legislate it. However, I commend the member for Fraser Valley 
East for giving us yet another occasion to reaffirm a striking 
consensus.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
several occasions already we have had a chance to speak in the 
House on subjects concerning the peace missions. As did the 
member from the Liberal Party and my colleague from Foreign 
Affairs, we thanked the member for Fraser Valley East for 
having given us, by means of this bill, an opportunity to discuss 
the peace missions.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	During the review of Canada's defence policy, the question of 
peacekeeping missions came up in the discussions of the 
national defence committee, of which I am a member.
<P>
	When you look at Bill C-295, as the previous speaker 
remarked, you realize that there is an all-party consensus on the 
principle of peacekeeping missions and the humanitarian way. I 
would like to add that the people of Quebec and of Canada 
accept the fact that Canada participates in peacekeeping 
missions.
<P>
	However, I am far from sure that this bill will remedy the 
shortcomings that have been noted during recent peacekeeping 
missions, whether in Rwanda or more recently still in the former 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
	In my opinion, the bill-and we support it in principle, as I 
said-contains certain restrictions that are not spelled out as the 
Bloc Quebecois has requested on a number of occasions. As 
well, in the report on the review of Canada's defence policy, the 
member for Shefford and I asked on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois that criteria for peacekeeping missions be defined. 
Nowhere, either in the bill or in a statement by the government, 
is there set out what Canada thinks should be the basis for a clear 
definition of criteria governing participation by our military 
personnel in other or possible future peacekeeping missions. 
And yet Canada is supposed to be a leader in peacekeeping 
missions.
<P>
	The government or some of its spokesmen have expressed 
reservations about the bill, saying that the fact that a 
peacekeeping mission agreement would have to be discussed in 
the House would slow down the effectiveness and speed of a 
decision and that this could be prejudicial to certain categories 
of mission.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14057"> 14057 </A></B>
<P>
	Looking at the current mission, I think that argument does not 
hold a great deal of water, because ever since the conflict in the 
former Yugoslavia started, the Canadian government has been 
havering and wavering and sometimes even flip-flopping. 
When the Minister of Foreign Affairs told the UN last summer 
that Canada would be encouraging the UN to set up a permanent 
contingent and that Canada would participate, the Department 
of National Defence retorted that Canadian military personnel 
could not serve under an operational command that was not 
Canadian, and the whole issue is still up in the air.
<P>
	In my opinion, with respect to peacekeeping in general and 
the current conflict in the former Yugoslavia in particular, the 
views of the citizens who pay for the humanitarian mission with 
their taxes are not given much attention.
<P>
	Almost 1,800 of the peacekeepers in Bosnia come from CFB 
Valcartier, which is in my riding, and I can tell you that the 
people there are extremely interested in any discussion in this 
House of peacekeeping missions and also in statements from the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Prime Minister, or the Minister 
of National Defence. Some of them would like to know how it 
happened that in April 1992 Canada recognized 
Bosnia-Hercegovina as a sovereign state and called attention to 
Serb aggression, when throughout the conflict there seems to 
have been a certain slackness on the UN's part, recognized on all 
sides.
<P>
	I have already reminded this House once that General Dallaire 
said that more than 200 UN resolutions had never been 
implemented and that with the amount of dithering going on it 
seemed possible the Serbs would end up laughing at the UN and 
the international organization.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Defence was also reported recently to have 
said he was beginning to believe that the Serbs were playing cat 
and mouse.
<P>
	I would like to add, because the bill does address the peace 
missions, that when soldiers return from missions, we hear some 
strange things. We also hear them from European 
parliamentarians who say that, since the UN has taken a great 
deal of time to act and change course-Indeed, several persons 
have requested either a change in the Security Council or a 
change in the way its resolutions are actually implemented; 
some persons are trying to say that at present the peace missions 
are no longer peace missions but no more than buffers between 
warring parties. They are even going so far as to say that UN 
peacekeepers, sometimes against their will, or because of the 
laxity of the UN, will practically be maintaining the conflict or 
making it drag on.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are not unaware-you have certainly 
heard-that when humanitarian convoys travel in the former 
Yugoslavia, Bosnia, or the self-proclaimed pseudo-Serb 
republic inside Bosnian territory, they are stopped at the 
checkpoints and, often enough, equipment, trucks and even food 
supplies are seized; Serbian soldiers or sometimes Bosnian 
soldiers then use the goods-ostensibly requisitioned for 
checkpoint purposes-to line their own pockets by selling them.
<P>
	I think that the bill on the peace missions is certainly of value, 
and we agree with it in principle. I would go farther in that 
direction and say that it is high time the government made a 
decision once and for all, some aspects of which would certainly 
be referred to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs or the 
Defence Committee. It is high time to specify some basic 
criteria, before sending off our peacekeepers as part of peace 
missions without previously defining how far they are to go, 
how long they are to endure being slapped on one cheek and 
turning the other, and how long they are to be given equipment; I 
say ``given'' ironically, because very often that equipment is 
seized. Unfortunately-or perhaps fortunately-those things 
are known.
<P>
	When soldiers return from missions, they mention the 
damning facts I have mentioned to you. At that point, the public, 
which, through its taxes, does send our peacekeepers on 
humanitarian missions, finds it hard to accept that Canada, the 
leader in peace missions, does not take the lead at the UN once 
and for all and make a really valid proposal for change that, I am 
sure, would be accepted by the parties in this House.
<P>
	There is far too much hesitation and procrastination. I believe 
we have reached a point where we must-without necessarily 
pounding the table and becoming belligerent, something Canada 
has never been-at least manage to define a clear policy. For 
some eight or 10 months, since the first debates in this House on 
the peace missions, the Bloc Quebecois has in fact requested 
that specific criteria be established regarding the role our 
peacekeepers are called upon to carry out and also regarding a 
definition of our participation-military or humanitarian-that 
can be targeted, not only within a budget, but also within the 
limits of what is acceptable.
<P>
	After all, we must not delude ourselves and begin to react 
energetically when we see hostages taken by the Serbs. People 
saw that on television screens all over the world. I think that 
chaining up a soldier as a human shield alone runs counter to 
every principle of the Geneva Convention governing countries 
at war. Unfortunately, both Canada and the other UN member 
countries took that incident lightly and hardly reacted to acts 
that can only be described as barbaric.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe that this bill is essentially a good idea, 
but it needs elaboration, and I would suggest to the government 
that it initiate a discussion process,  both at Foreign Affairs and 
in the defence committee, with very precise criteria.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Harry Verran (South West Nova, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the bill we are addressing today, Bill C-295, proposes to shift 
control of the Canadian peacekeeping activities from the crown 
to Parliament as a whole and to amend the National Defence Act 
to reflect this wider decision making responsibility. Rather than 
offering an improvement to the system now in place, such 
legislation may well substitute rigidity for flexibility and 
inaction for responsiveness.
<P>
	The bill before us was created out of concern for the Canadian 
forces' personnel serving on peacekeeping missions and the 
desire to ensure the government follows a sound decision 
making process; of that I am certain. However having examined 
the bill I am equally certain that it confuses more than it clarifies 
and that it will impede decision making rather than assist it.
<P>
	In short, the bill will worsen rather than improve the system 
now in place. It will add time to matters that demand urgent 
responses and it will dilute responsibility for decisions that 
demand clear, unequivocal leadership. For these reasons I must 
oppose Bill C-295.
<P>
	Bill C-295 would restrict the prerogative, speed and 
discretion of the crown to decide Canada's contribution to UN or 
regional peace operations. Peacekeeping like other military 
operations is carried out under the authority of the Minister of 
National Defence. Section 4 of the National Defence Act 
identifies the minister as the representative of the crown 
responsible for the management and direction of Canadian 
forces and for all matters relating to national defence.
<P>
	However, the proposed bill would remove the responsibility 
and direction not only of the minister but of all the government 
respecting military operations. As a result, the bill would slow 
down the government's response to UN requests for assistance 
in peace operations and compromise its ability to respond to 
changes in the peacekeeping mandate in a timely manner.
<P>
	It has been said that lost time is never found again. That 
certainly is the consensus of many former Canadian UN 
commanders who have identified as a major problem the length 
of time it takes for the international community to respond to a 
crisis.
<P>
	Major-General Roméo Dallaire has spoken publicly of the 
importance of speed in responding to emergencies. He has 
estimated that tens of thousands of lives would have been saved 
in Rwanda if his urgent request for troops had been met with 
action.
<P>
	I do not think Bill C-295 would improve the situation for a 
commander who found himself in a position similar to that of 
Major-General Dallaire. With another layer added to the 
decision making process it would require even longer for 
Canada to become involved and provide  help. If a situation is 
deemed an emergency it should be treated like one.
<P>
	Bill C-295 would also compromise a structure in place to 
manage international Canadian forces' operations. Every 
potential operation is evaluated against guidelines that include 
the broad political and foreign policy context, the overall 
mission requirements as well as our own military capability. 
These guidelines have been refined for more than 40 years of 
practical experience. They also reflect in a prudent but 
pragmatic manner the new thinking that has emerged since the 
end of the cold war. This new thinking was articulated in a 1994 
defence white paper which contains a list of key principles that 
underlie the design of all peace missions.
<P>
	I should like to remind the House the Minister of National 
Defence consulted widely before formulating this policy. The 
overriding principle determining each peacekeeping mission is 
that it addresses genuine threats to international peace and 
security, such as the worsening situation in the former 
Yugoslavia, where there are emerging human catastrophes such 
as we have seen in Somalia and Rwanda.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I have explained why and how Bill C-295 would slow down 
Canada's ability to respond and contribute to international 
peacekeeping. Now I would like to talk about how the bill 
confuses the issues that underlie our current system. The 
confusion represents many more impediments in what must be a 
rapid and flexible decision making process.
<P>
	First, Bill C-295 as it is currently written contains restrictions 
that would prevent the government from carrying out its 
obligations under the UN charter. Chapter VII of the charter 
provides for action by the security council with respect to 
threats to peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression. 
Under various articles of the charter UN member states are 
required to carry out the security council decisions aimed at 
maintaining international peace and security.
<P>
	Although as worded the bill appears to cover the UN chapter 
VII operations, most of its provisions contradict chapter VII 
requirments. I question whether Canada would have contributed 
to the gulf war if Bill C-295 were in effect a few years ago.
<P>
	What troubles me more however is the provision of Bill 
C-295 that gives up Canadian sovereign command of Canada 
forces elements. I believe strongly that this would lead to an 
unworkable command and control relationship. The intent of the 
bill seems to be taking us back in time to the first and second 
world wars when Canadian troops came under allied rather than 
national command. This indeed appears to be a regressive step 
and one that I doubt the bill's proponents meant it to take.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14059"> 14059 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadian forces personnel serving on peace operations today 
are always commanded by a Canadian. Canadian units and 
personnel can only be placed under the operational control and 
not the operational command of the UN or other multinational 
commanders for specific tasks. Under operational control, 
changes to the tasks assigned to Canadian peacekeepers or to 
their area of operations must receive Canadian national 
approval. Under operational command, Canadian troops could 
be reassigned and moved without such approval.
<P>
	Under current legislation a non-Canadian commander who 
only has operational control cannot separately assign 
components of a Canadian unit. A company of infantry soldiers, 
for example, cannot be removed from its battalion to serve with 
another unit unless the deployment is approved by Canada. Once 
again, under the non-Canadian operational command this could 
happen.
<P>
	Currently commanders of Canadian contingents are directly 
responsible to the Chief of the Defence Staff for the success of 
their operations. However under Bill C-295 Canadian 
commanding officers would be placed under UN or other 
international command. To my mind this would mean less 
national control, not more.
<P>
	To sum up, I cannot support a bill that appears to provide for 
greater control by the government over peacekeeping operations 
when in fact it reduces government control, compromises 
national authority over troops abroad and confuses several key 
components and concepts. Moreover, at a time when flexibility 
of response is critical to meeting the demands of rapid change, 
the bill proposes significant restrictions on the government's 
ability to manoeuvre.
<P>
	The government has demonstrated its commitment to 
consultation. We have listened to the views of parliamentarians 
and ordinary Canadians alike in formulating defence policy and 
we will continue to do so in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to speak in support of Bill C-295 
presented by my colleague from Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	The bill has several important features that commend it. The 
first is that it is a peacekeeping bill. I believe it is important that 
all Canadians, including their representatives in the House, 
understand the difference between peacekeeping and 
peacemaking. This is little understood.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	The situation in the former Yugoslavia gives us a good 
example. If I understand it properly, there is a real peacekeeping 
operation going on in Croatia. This is so because the warring 
factions there agreed that they wanted peace and agreed to the 
UN going in to keep it, which the United Nations did under 
chapter VI, the peacekeeping chapter of the UN charter.
<P>
	In Bosnia, on the other hand, we do not have a peacekeeping 
operation there because there was no prior agreement among the 
Serbs, the Muslims and the Croats to have peace. Therefore, as 
is very evident, there is no peace to keep. What is going on there 
is humanitarian assistance under chapter VI of the UN charter. 
What is needed in Bosnia-Hercegovina is an agreement between 
the warring factions that there be peace, or we need a declaration 
with follow up actions by the United Nations that peacemaking 
is required under chapter VII of the charter. We need one or the 
other to happen there and we have neither.
<P>
	Canada's help to Rwanda, if we take another example, was 
one of humanitarian aid: the provision of medical assistance, 
food, water and communications under chapter VI, which is the 
peacekeeping chapter.
<P>
	Let us look at our activity in Somalia. This came under both 
chapters VII and VI of the UN charter. From January to June of 
1993 members may remember seeing pictures of Somalian 
warlords roaring around the country in vehicles that had 
machine guns mounted on them. What was required there was a 
military operation to bring the bandits under control. Canada 
during that first six months was in Somalia as a peacemaker 
under chapter VII of the UN charter. Once the situation was 
under control and some agreement had been reached with the 
warlords, Canada moved into operating under chapter VI, which 
is the peacekeeping chapter of the UN charter.
<P>
	Aside from understanding the difference between 
peacekeeping and peacemaking, the important point to be made 
is that it has got to be clear in everyone's mind before we get 
involved in any military operation what kind of an operation it 
is. Is it clearly peacekeeping or is it not? This lack of clarity has 
led us to the situation we now have in Bosnia.
<P>
	It is also important to know what the terms of reference are or 
what the mandate is before we get involved. Canada has a good 
example and a bad example of each in our experience in 
Indochina, in Vietnam. Canada, as part of the International 
Commission for Supervision and Control, spent nearly 20 years 
in Indochina along with India and Poland. The problem was that 
we were ineffective there because the rules governing the ICSC 
did not allow Canada to tell the world what was going on. We 
could not unilaterally bring the world's attention to the 
violations of peace agreements.
<P>
	After nearly 20 frustrating years we finally learned our lesson 
in 1973. In that year we responded to the U.S. desire to extricate 
itself from Vietnam and get its prisoners of war out of North 
Vietnam. Canada agreed to be one of the four nations that 
formed the International Commission for Control and 
Supervision. There was a juxtaposition of the initials ICCS as 
opposed to the former ICSC.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14060"> 14060 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	We went into that commission with what we called an open 
mouth policy which allowed Canada to make public all 
violations to the peace, which were for the most part by the Viet 
Cong. I have described this operation before in this House and 
do so again because it illustrates a certain amount of savvy on 
Canada's part. We went into Vietnam, did our job, got the 
American prisoners of war out and then left the commission 
within six months without getting bogged down as we did in the 
previous ICSC or as we did in Cyprus for 29 years.
<P>
	What Bill C-295 does is bring Canadian peacekeeping 
missions before Parliament. It is important that we do this. The 
debate and review that would take place would diminish the 
chances of our going into a military operation with inadequate 
terms of reference and without knowing what we are getting into 
and for how long.
<P>
	Bill C-295 would not tie the hands of cabinet or the 
Department of National Defence in reacting swiftly where 
military intervention was required. It would simply ensure that 
things were properly considered and that the Canadian people 
were involved in the decision making process through their 
parliamentary representatives here assembled.
<P>
	Several weeks ago I was in Hungary and I discovered in that 
rather new democracy that they are very interested in civilian 
control over the military. What I found is that their Parliament 
has more control today over their troops than Canada has over its 
own. Even one Hungarian soldier may not cross the frontiers of 
that country without parliamentary approval. That is not so in 
good old democratic Canada.
<P>
	Canadians take pride in the fact that we have been leaders in 
the international community in peacekeeping operations and 
particularly in the United Nations sponsored ones. We take pride 
in the professionalism and compassion shown by our troops. 
This applies to Somalia as much as it does anywhere else. We 
have heard the negative stories out of Somalia and there is no 
excusing those transgressions but there has been precious little 
publicity given to the good works of the men of the airborne 
regiment in that unfortunate land.
<P>
	Our men in uniform are a cross section of the population of 
Canada. They act humanely and compassionately. We have 
heard far too little about the help our troops gave to the 
Somalians from restoring order to medical assistance, food, 
shelter, schooling and so on. I really do wish the news media 
would bring out this aspect of the airborne regiment's 
performance. Perhaps the Somalia commission of inquiry under 
Justice Létourneau, which continues hearings today, will be 
instrumental in telling the story about what went right as well as 
what went wrong.
<P>
	In any event, our experience over the years, good and bad, in 
peacekeeping and peacemaking in Croatia, Bosnia, Rwanda, 
Somalia, the gulf war, the Sinai, the Golan Heights, Suez, 
Kashmir, the Congo, Vietnam,  Korea and other operations 
should give us pause as Canadians to think about what we have 
done in the past and what we will do in the future.
<P>
	We should not take such pride in our past participation that we 
join in all such operations without due consideration. I suspect 
that there was an element of that in our entry into the former 
Yugoslavia. Bill C-295 would enhance our decision making 
process and I heartily commend it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
speak at third reading of Bill C-295, an act to provide for the 
control of Canadian peacekeeping activities by Parliament and 
to amend the National Defence Act in consequence thereof.
<P>
	Like other members on the government side of the House, I 
find Bill C-295 to be a flawed, contradictory piece of legislation 
that would do irreparable damage to Canada's reputation as a 
skilled peacekeeper. If this bill were to become law our ability to 
participate effectively in future peacekeeping missions would 
be put at serious risk. The very lives of our peacekeepers would 
be put in grave danger.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Before I look at some of the specific details of Bill C-295 I 
think it is important to understand the nature of Canada's current 
involvement in peacekeeping activities and the way in which we 
manage our participation in these operations. Only then will the 
shortcomings of this legislation be fully appreciated.
<P>
	Canada has a long and proud tradition of helping the global 
community to defend peace, freedom and democracy. We 
remain committed to creating an association with our friends 
and allies and a stable international environment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We realize that our security and our prosperity depend on a 
more stable world order. Because Canada is a responsible 
member of the international community and one of the world's 
major trading nations, we know that conflicts must be contained 
and their expansion prevented. We also want to help reduce or 
eliminate suffering in cases where outside assistance can make a 
contribution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada has long viewed peacekeeping as an extremely useful 
tool in international efforts to manage and resolve conflict. We 
have excelled at peacekeeping and we like to boast, with some 
authority I would say, that our experience and skills are 
unmatched. Our contribution to peacekeeping reflects our belief 
that a stable international order is essential to Canada's long 
term peace and security. It is for this reason that we provide well 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14061"> 14061 </A></B>
<P>
trained and suitably equipped military personnel for 
peacekeeping and related operations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, although Canada reviews attentively all requests 
for it to participate in peacekeeping missions, our participation 
is not automatic. Our participation is second to none, certainly, 
but it does not follow that we will be part of every mission. 
There have been UN peacekeeping missions in which Canada 
has not participated.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Nevertheless the international community turns to Canada 
almost as a matter of course whenever a new mission is getting 
off the ground. The world not only understands that 
peacekeeping is an integral part of our own foreign policy but it 
also knows that our flexible, multipurpose combat capable 
forces can do the job.
<P>
	We have a long tradition of peacekeeping expertise based on 
professionalism, training and the resources of our personnel. We 
have a wealth of experience in preparing, deploying, sustaining 
and repatriating great peacekeeping forces of various sizes. 
More recently we have been the vanguard of new concepts. Our 
corporate memory in peacekeeping makes us a natural choice 
for a wide variety of missions. It has taken years to build this 
marvellous reputation. We do not want to see it disappear now. 
This bill I fear would do just that.
<P>
	Let me look at some of the specific problems of Bill C-295. 
First, I do not believe the authors of Bill C-295 fully understand 
the nature of modern peacekeeping. For example the definition 
of peacekeeping offered is too imprecise and does not specify 
the types of operations covered. Peacekeeping as we know from 
our experience in the former Yugoslavia has become a generic 
term covering a broad range of activities, from traditional 
Pearsonian peacekeeping and preventive deployment to peace 
enforcement and peace building. These distinctions are glossed 
over in the legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Nor is it explained anywhere in the bill why this applies only 
to the Canadian forces. Civilians are often used in UN 
peacekeeping missions-elections personnel, for example, and 
police officers. But there is no mention of civilians anywhere.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-295 confuses other fundamental concepts. It would 
amend the National Defence Act so all members of the Canadian 
forces assigned to a peacekeeping mission would be on active 
service for all purposes. This proposal is unnecessary. Pursuant 
to Order in Council P.C. 1989-583 dated April 6, 1989, all 
regular force members anywhere beyond Canada and all reserve 
force members beyond Canada are currently on active service. 
Moreover, all members of the regular force have been on active 
service continually since 1950.
<P>
	In other words, there is no legal requirement for individual 
orders in council placing members on active service for specific 
peacekeeping missions. Our practice of issuing orders in council 
is simply a parliamentary convention, although I might add that 
it reflects the government's commitment to involve Parliament 
more frequently in defence matters.
<P>
	With respect to termination of Canadian contributions, let me 
move on to some of the provisions in the bill which deal 
specifically with peacekeeping operations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For example, clause 8 of the bill requires that when the 
objectives of a mission are reached, all Canadian forces shall be 
withdrawn. At first sight, this is a very sensible idea. But in 
reality it will be difficult to determine at what point objectives 
have been reached, or how much expenditure it will take to reach 
them. And yet those are the very conditions that the bill would 
like to see defined in advance.
<P>
	If a Canadian contingent were withdrawn from a mission too 
quickly, our participation could prove pointless, and worse still 
the whole mission could be compromised.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Moreover, the bill states that Canada should set its own 
peacekeeping objectives. However it is not clear how 
international and national aims might be reconciled. As it stands 
if we do not like an operation's objectives we do not contribute. 
However once we join we understand the operation is 
multilateral. We take pride in our role as a team player in 
international missions and we do not want to compromise it 
now.
<P>
	The muddled thinking that dominates much of Bill C-295 
carries over into the section dealing with rules of engagement. 
Let me first provide a little context. Rules of engagement are 
always issued to armed Canadian forces personnel participating 
in international operations. Our personnel often operate under 
UN rules of engagement, although these are frequently drafted 
in conjunction with the Canadian forces staff at national defence 
headquarters as well as the Canadian contingent commander.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is the 
end of the debate on this bill. I would just like to thank all

some concerns about Bill C-86. The main concern is that the 
Canadian Dairy Commission will be allowed to exercise powers 
which have traditionally belonged to the provinces. Concerns 
have been expressed by dairy farmers and others in several 
provinces about the movement into provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	While I have concerns about what is in Bill C-86, my larger 
concern is with the discussions which have taken place since its 
introduction. What I have heard in the discussions is that the bill 
will accommodate supply management. It will allow supply 
management to continue pretty much as it is with some changes. 
We have heard from the agriculture minister, the parliamentary 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14063"> 14063 </A></B>
<P>
secretary to the agriculture minister and dairy groups that 
because the legislation will accommodate supply management 
no changes are required. That concerns me. Certainly a lot of 
dairy farmers who I have spoken to  know that changes are 
coming in supply management. These changes will come not 
because of legislation passed in Canada but as a result of 
pressure, particularly from the United States, through the trade 
agreements NAFTA and GATT.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The discussion surrounding Bill C-86 is that it will fix the 
problem and allow supply management to continue. Supply 
management has been working well and this will allow it to 
continue to work well. As a result of that kind of discussion, 
many dairy farmers are not aware that change is inevitable. It is 
important for farmers to acknowledge that, to allow for a 
reasonable transition period and to move from the present 
supply management system which will be accommodated under 
this legislation to a system which will assist them to respond to 
more competition, particularly through more imports from the 
United States.
<P>
	In the discussions the parliamentary secretary to the minister, 
the minister and even the leaders of some farm groups have said 
this will help solve an immediate problem but the long term 
concern is still there because change will come. Many farmers 
did not get that message. It will mean that the dairy supply 
managed industry will not have the transition time needed to 
move from the present system to a system with more 
competition.
<P>
	That is my single largest concern surrounding the legislation. 
The amendment I propose is essential before the bill passes 
because it will prevent the federal government, once again 
through its agencies, from interfering in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	I have specific concerns with the bill. I will address those 
later. My main concern is for the dairy farmers. I am extremely 
concerned they will not be prepared for the coming changes.
<P>
	Over the past months I have made trips to different parts of 
Ontario and I made a point of talking to dairy farmers. This is an 
area where I feel Reform must do more work. Certainly I need 
more knowledge in the area. I make a point of talking to dairy 
farmers about what is going on in their industry. I find from 
discussing the industry with dairy farmers that different groups 
of dairy farmers look at the change in different ways.
<P>
	For example, dairy farmers who are quite close to retirement 
and maybe plan on farming for five or ten years are asking why 
the system cannot remain exactly as it is. They do not even want 
to talk about change. They want us to do everything we can to get 
the maximum price now and pretend that change is not going to 
happen. I understand their thinking. Change is intimidating to 
most people.
<P>
	These dairy farmers who will only be in business for maybe 
another five years would do well to keep the system exactly as it 
is. I understand their concern and acknowledge their view.
<P>
	Another group of dairy farmers have borrowed a large amount 
of money to finance quota. They are concerned as we move into 
a more competitive system. Many are willing to acknowledge it 
will happen, that change is coming. They do not know whether it 
will be in five years, ten years, two years or three years. These 
farmers are concerned because if their quota loses value, which 
it certainly will when there is more competition allowed into the 
system, in some cases they will become insolvent. They will not 
have the equity to back loans. In other cases their retirement, 
even though it is down the road, is being eroded. This is a 
concern to them.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Then there are the young farmers coming into the system. 
Many of them feel they would do well not having to pay for 
quota at all. That means the competition is not as big a threat to 
them.
<P>
	The amendment I have proposed will fix up one of the 
problems in the bill. It will allow provinces to keep jurisdiction 
which is rightfully theirs. It does not fix the problems with the 
change in the industry.
<P>
	Mammoth changes are coming to the industry. That must be 
acknowledged. Let us discuss them openly as we discuss this 
amendment and this bill as it passes through the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
take a few minutes to comment on the motion that is before the 
House.
<P>
	First, I am very disappointed in the lack of knowledge or 
understanding that the member who has just spoken has 
concerning the bill that is before us today. He needs a few more 
trips to some place in Canada where there is supply management 
and he needs to talk to more producers and more stakeholders in 
the industry to get a better understanding of it.
<P>
	I am also disappointed he does not seem to recognize and have 
faith in the dairy industry that which the rest of us have to adapt 
to the changes that the dairy industry does know are happening. 
It is addressing them.
<P>
	It is very clear that in all sectors of the dairy industry, 
including the primary producer and the processors, are prepared 
and are rolling with the punches as the industry evolves not only 
here in Canada but throughout the world.
<P>
	The bill before the House does absolutely nothing to change 
the role and the participation at the present time. Reaching 
consensus on any major Canadian industry initiative, whether it 
is in the dairy industry or wherever, is always difficult. Reach-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14064"> 14064 </A></B>
<P>
ing unanimity is even more difficult but that is what has 
happened with this bill.
<P>
	The representatives of 26,000 dairy farmers and some 300 
processors and marketers have clearly voiced their strong 
support for the bill. I remind the House that the value of this 
industry to Canada is $8 billion a year.
<P>
	The members of the national Canadian milk supply 
management committee, provincial governments and the milk 
marketing boards and agencies throughout Canada have agreed 
to all aspects of the bill. I find it very contradictory for the 
member to stand in this place, representing a party which 
continually says that the industry should be able to adapt the 
way the industry wants, and give a contradictory message. That 
is exactly what this bill does today. It is an industry decision.
<P>
	None of the parties involved, and this shows the distance of 
the member from the issue we are discussing, agrees with this 
motion. The parties have been to the standing committee. None 
of the parties involved in this have asked for this.
<P>
	The administration of pricing and the pooling of milk and of 
returns by the Canadian Dairy Commission on behalf of the 
producers requires legislation dovetailing certain provincial and 
federal powers. There is absolutely no infringement on 
provincial authority involved in this legislation.
<P>
	Most provinces currently have legislation allowing milk 
pricing and pooling within their boundaries. Bill C-86 has 
absolutely no effect on current provincial powers.
<P>
	To duplicate the equity which the current levy system 
provides to the new national pooling system, similar powers 
must be provided for milk sold across provincial borders and 
that is interprovincial movement of milk and for export.
<P>
	There are four points in the bill. The first is the bill provides 
the power to establish and operate a pool or pools. The second is 
the power to establish the price of the milk or cream to be 
included in the pool.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	The third is the power to collect the returns from the milk or 
cream to be pooled. The fourth is the power to establish and 
operate a special program that will enable processors and further 
processors to obtain milk or milk components at special prices.
<P>
	Only the last of the powers is subject to formal agreement 
between the Canadian Dairy Commission and the provincial 
milk marketing boards. While the other three powers will be 
delegated to the provincial authorities under the new pricing and 
pooling system they are and should remain strictly within 
federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	The legislative changes replicate the same federal-provincial 
power sharing now in effect through the levy system and the 
special assistance program for processors and further 
processors. The bill will allow maintenance of the dairy sector's 
current successful, effective and equitable framework for the 
orderly marketing of milk and dairy products in Canada.
<P>
	In closing I emphasize to the member and to other members in 
the House that the motion would not represent a change from 
what exists at the present time. It certainly would not be what the 
industry asked for. I remind the member to touch base closer 
with the industry so that he can assist us in doing exactly what he 
keeps asking us to do: provide the industry with what it wants.
<P>
	More formal agreements between the federal and provincial 
governments would only be further restrictions on the dairy 
industry which is not our wish. Our wish is to do what is wanted 
by the Canadian milk supply management committee which 
represents the total industry. That is what the bill does.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise this afternoon to discuss Bill C-86 and 
more specifically the amendment proposed by my colleague, the 
hon. member for Vegreville.
<P>
	First I would like to make a statement that contradicts my 
colleague's assertions about supply management. When you 
want to fill a glass with water, it's easy, you turn on the tap. If 
you want the glass to be filled right to the brim, you take care to 
turn off the tap just at the right moment for the glass to be filled 
up; if you only want half a glass, you turn off the tap when the 
water reaches halfway.
<P>
	In the early 1970s, farmers, provincial governments and 
processors got together and introduced what is now generally 
referred to as supply management. Regulated supply 
management in the dairy industry is profitable for all levels. 
First of all it is profitable for the farmers, who are the base of the 
dairy pyramid.
<P>
	Previously, our producers found it much more advantageous 
to produce milk in May, June and July, when their herds were at 
pasture. In those three months they could make a better profit on 
their milk while in the winter it was less profitable, more costly, 
to produce milk. The result was that consumers and processors 
ran short of the raw material, milk, that was needed for a full 
year, so that there were periods when there were no fresh dairy 
products the way we always have now.
<P>
	Today dairy producers are assured steady income throughout 
the year, and not just for one defined portion of the year. 
Consumers can get fresh butter and cheese every day, thanks to 
competent management of dairy production. And processors can 
run their plants all year round and not just for a few months.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14065"> 14065 </A></B>
<P>
	I have to say to my colleague from Vegreville, who has visited 
dairy producers in southern Ontario who want to keep the 
existing arrangement, that this is not in compliance with the 
agreements we have signed with our international partners.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	We are not in compliance with our GATT commitments and 
we have to modernize, we have to position ourselves by the start 
of August to respect the agreements signed by the Canadian 
government with the 140 other GATT members.
<P>
	The amendment moved by the hon. member for Vegreville 
does not, given the present system, constitute a change that 
gives more powers to provinces, as its wording might suggest at 
first glance. Given the system as we know it, this amendment 
would simply limit the effectiveness of the consultation process 
that exists at the present time through the Canadian Milk Supply 
Management Committee.
<P>
	Currently industrial milk is managed by the Canadian Milk 
Supply Management Committee. The committee is made up of 
the chairmen of all the provincial milk marketing boards. The 
Canadian Dairy Commission just chairs the committee. The 
committee operates on a consensus basis and in case of dispute 
on any point that requires unanimity, the budget for example, a 
preliminary management committee will be struck.
<P>
	If consensus is still not possible after three meetings of this 
committee, the majority decides. As in any good family-you 
know this, Mr. Speaker, you are the father of a family-there 
comes a time when someone has to wear the trousers and make 
the decisions. If after three meetings unanimity is not possible, 
the majority decides. In no case does the Canadian Dairy 
Commission have a right of veto.
<P>
	Moreover, it is important to point out that the Canadian Milk 
Supply Management Committee has never, in living memory, 
failed to reach agreement. That means that the Canadian Dairy 
Commission cannot impose its views on representatives of the 
provincial boards. So why include in the bill that their 
agreement is necessary?
<P>
	There are some other anomalies in the wording of this 
amendment. It refers to amending a clause affecting the 
Canadian Dairy Commission. That commission has jurisdiction 
over industrial milk only, while the provinces are responsible 
for fluid milk.
<P>
	The proposed amendment means that the Canadian Dairy 
Commission can exercise certain powers only with the 
agreement of the provinces in which the power is to be 
exercised, but the provinces have no say with regard to 
industrial milk. Most importantly, when the amendment refers 
to agreement by the province, it does not seem to take into 
account the fact that the provinces do not sit on the Canadian 
Milk Supply Management Committee.
<P>
	Provincial representation is provided through the provincial 
marketing boards. Thus paragraph (a) of the amendment adds 
nothing to Bill C-86, because it refers to a level of government 
that, under the present system, has no direct jurisdiction. Since 
the agreement needed under paragraph (a) of the amendment 
will be that of the marketing boards, we now question whether 
paragraph (b) of the amendment is relevant.
<P>
	In my opinion, there is even a problem of interpretation with 
the bill itself and with the principle underlying the amendment; 
since the Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee 
operates by consensus, why include in the bill that the 
commission can exercise the powers mentioned therein only 
with the agreement of the boards?
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Even if the provinces had jurisdiction in the area to which the 
amendment refers, the amendment's reference to either the 
provinces or the boards would not succeed in achieving a 
majority whereas, at present, as I was saying, the committee 
operates on consensus.
<P>
	For these reasons, we of the Bloc Quebecois would ask our 
colleagues to oppose this amendment proposed to us this 
morning by the hon. member from Vegreville, who represents 
the Reform Party on the agriculture committee.
<P>
	Overall, maintaining the system as it now operates beyond 
August 1 would be illegal. The government, in consultation with 
the provinces, reached agreements with the vast majority of 
them, with the result that today six provinces out of nine 
participate in milk marketing. Six provinces agreed to sign the 
memorandum of agreement. Those six provinces, including two 
important ones, Quebec and Ontario, produce 82 per cent of all 
the milk in Canada.
<P>
	At present three provinces have signed partial agreements, 
but on very specific points, still hesitating to jump in with the 
six other provinces. They are the three western provinces: 
Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, which together 
produce 18 per cent of Canada's milk, an average of 6 per cent 
each, if we do a very simple calculation.
<P>
	I am delighted that in 13 or 14 months at the outside, milk 
producers in all parts of Canada will be paid a single price for 
their milk. There will be no more discrimination between 
industrial milk and fluid milk.
<P>
	You know, Mr. Speaker, right now there is still a discrepancy 
of more than 10 per cent between prices for these two types of 
milk. The odd thing is that it is often the same cow that produces 
the milk. One day she produces fluid milk, the next day 
industrial milk; one day that cow is 10 per cent more profitable, 
the next day she is being milked at a 10 per cent loss. You have 
the same standards for cleanliness, the same care, the same 
cooler, or ball tank, of milk. You have the same cows, the same 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14066"> 14066 </A></B>
<P>
dairy producer, of course-and there is a 10 per cent difference. 
That is unaccceptable.
<P>
	If we go back 30 or 40 years, it was logical and even 
acceptable that there be a 10 per cent discrepancy because fluid 
milk producers had to be much more careful, they had to 
produce 12 months every year, and they were subject to supply 
management: if they produced too much milk, they could not 
sell it.
<P>
	In closing, then, I ask my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois to 
oppose the Reform Party's amendment. In fact, I have just 
learned that the party in power does not agreee to this 
amendment either.
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your careful attention to my 
remarks.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address Bill C-86, the act to amend 
the Dairy Commission Act.
<P>
	This bill is significant because it provides for the replacement 
of the existing system of levies with a system of pooling market 
returns from the different classes of milk. The government 
claims the move to a pooling system will maintain equity among 
producers and will be consistent with Canada's international 
trade agreements, NAFTA and GATT.
<P>
	Changes are needed to allow supply management to continue 
while meeting the requirement of our agreements. For this 
reason my colleagues and I can support the stated purpose of the 
legislation.
<P>
	We have talked to dairy farmers and others in the industry and 
they have said they feel the legislation is necessary to allow 
supply management to continue under GATT and NAFTA. For 
this reason we can at least support the intent of the legislation.
<P>
	We do have some major concern with clause 2, which affects 
clause 9 of the Dairy Commission Act. This bill extends the 
powers of the Canadian Dairy Commission and could possibly 
diminish the authority given to the provinces under the original 
act. Therefore to guard against this possible erosion, my 
colleague from Vegreville has proposed an amendment which 
will affect clause 9 of the Dairy Commission Act.
<P>
	There is a problem in supply management in maintaining the 
status quo. With respect to supply management, change is 
inevitable. We have already seen change and nothing stands still 
in the face of time and advancement. Dairy farmers will be 
forced to compete more and more with American farmers and 
the odds are change will come sooner than the Liberal 
government is prepared to admit.
<P>
	I am not saying this is what I want, but this is what reality tells 
us. The rules are changing and dairy farmers will need transition 
time in order to adapt to more open trade in the future. This bill 
will allow the supply managed system to continue for some time 
but there are nagging doubts as to the longevity of the current 
system if we do not consider changes.
<P>
	Members of the Canadian Dairy Commission claim this bill 
properly reflects the changes affecting dairy farmers, but what 
the bill actually does is maintain the status quo for now. Given 
that a change to supply management is inevitable, there will be a 
problem over the long run.
<P>
	The message the government has been presenting along with 
the legislation concerns us. I want to speak briefly about a 
concern with Bill C-86 from the discussions we have had with 
the minister of agriculture, the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister, some farm groups and some dairy farmers we have had 
the opportunity to meet with.
<P>
	The legislation will allow supply management in the dairy 
industry to continue in a form quite similar to the present 
system. This does not mean supply management will continue in 
this form forever. Several trade issues may lead to more direct 
competition from the U.S. by allowing more access to dairy 
products from the Americans.
<P>
	Before I begin discussing trade issues which could have a 
substantial impact on our present supply management system, I 
will make one thing very clear to the House. I am not talking 
about these issues because I want to see the demise of supply 
management or because Reform wants to see the demise of 
supply management. We are discussing these issues because 
they could have a dramatic impact on the dairy industry, and this 
discussion will provide an important service to the dairy farmers 
and others in the industry. Just because change will be difficult 
and is not wanted does not mean it should not be discussed.
<P>
	Reformers have had enough courage to talk about probable 
change while the minister and the parliamentary secretary and 
even leaders of the dairy organizations publicly pretend the 
present system will exist indefinitely. This sends a dangerous 
message to dairy farmers that they can be protected against 
further competition, particularly from the American dairy 
farmers. This was the message the previous Conservative 
government gave to dairy farmers. It said article XI of GATT 
will not be touched under the new arrangements it was 
negotiating, and several Liberals echoed that. The NDP said it 
would not let anybody stand in the way of article XI. None of 
them could carry out that promise because it was not feasible.
<P>
	I want to talk about why some change is inevitable and why it 
may be sooner than later. NAFTA began as an agreement 
between Canada and the United States. The deal is already being 
expanded now to include Chile and  other countries. The world 
is forming into international trade blocks and we cannot be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14067"> 14067 </A></B>
<P>
certain that our supply managed industries will be totally 
isolated from new arrangements being negotiated.
<P>
	What must the government do? It must acknowledge there is a 
high probability of more access for American dairy products, 
therefore a move to more competition. The government must 
help ease diary farmers' legitimate fears that Americans will not 
compete fairly unless they are forced to through tough action by 
the Canadian government
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	We need a government that stands up for our producers and 
will not be bowled over by the Americans. We need to make the 
commitment to our dairy farmers that our government will stand 
with them.
<P>
	We must start working toward levelling the playing field 
between Canada and the U.S. before more competition occurs. 
Now is the time to set the rules for the new economy. We should 
not go into this blindfolded and not prepared to deal with the 
inevitable consequences of relaxed trading agreements with our 
trading partners.
<P>
	We must recognize there are different concerns about change 
to the supply management system among different groups of 
dairy farmers. They are not homogeneous. Each group must be 
listened to and asked for recommendations on how to deal with 
problems which will result from the move to competition for 
more imported products.
<P>
	My colleague from Vegreville has put forward an amendment 
to the bill before us today in report stage. We have spoken to 
dairy producers and many in the west have expressed concern 
with certain aspects of the bill. Clause 2 of Bill C-86 extends the 
powers of the Canadian Dairy Commission which could 
possibly limit authority of the provinces. That is a concern. The 
proposed amendments appear to give the CDC very wide new 
powers. They appear to include much wider powers than would 
be needed to address the reduction of export subsidies and the 
provision for national pooling of milk returns. Though 
delegated administrative functions, the amendments do not 
necessarily reflect the stated objectives of the CDC to delegate 
all these powers to provincial boards by way of agreement.
<P>
	Therefore to prevent this from taking place the motion put 
forward would make the proposed new statutory powers of the 
CDC subject to agreement from the province or the board. I 
think that is very important. I hope hon. members can see the 
merits of this motion and that they will support it.
<P>
	My colleagues and I are supporting the legislation despite the 
fact we feel it is not always sending the right message to supply 
managed farmers. However, we cannot argue with what the 
industry and the majority of farmers want.
<P>
	When change does come we will have to take into account 
older dairy producers who are close to retirement who want to 
hold their quota and make sure things stay the same while they 
are still in the industry, and younger producers who may have 
borrowed money and bought quota at high prices. Their equity is 
tied up in their share of the quota. We need to consider 
consumers, those who consume the products dairy farmers so 
adequately supply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of 
order.
<P>
	We all know the importance of moving the bill through the 
House for the dairy industry and the unanimity out there. In the 
spirit of co-operation this side of the House showed a few 
minutes ago to get debate on the bill, I wonder if there would be 
unanimous consent to move right to third reading to move this 
along for the good of the Canadian dairy industry.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to move to 
third reading?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, if there is unanimous 
agreement to accept the amendment as put forward by the hon. 
member for Vegreville, we would be agreeable to proceeding to 
third reading immediately.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In any event, we have to deal with one 
thing at a time. We can have another point of order when we get 
there.
<P>
	The question is on Motion No. 1.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

	The House resumed from June 8 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-92, an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
take this time to talk about the Canadian Wheat Board and some 
of the changes proposed in Bill C-92.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to amend the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act for several reasons. The first is to change the pooling points 
on which initial payments are based from Thunder Bay and 
Vancouver to points in Canada designated by governor in 
council regulation, and then to establish a deduction from the 
initial payment which reflects the relative transportation cost 
advantage for each producer; in other words, to make the new 
pooling system work using the old system. We cannot see how 
anything old and new can be mixed. It reminds me of a Bible 
verse about putting new wine in old skins and vice versa.
<P>
	To put a new pooling system into place when we are still using 
the fundamentals of the old system simply will not work. The 
whole move was partly caused by Alberta's recent move to hold 
a plebiscite on dual marketing which will include asking 
farmers if they wish to open up the Canada-U.S. border for 
direct shipments to the U.S.
<P>
	The bill, which is supposed to come into effect August 1, will 
change how eastern grain transportation costs are paid. This 
means eastern prairie farmers who ship through the St. 
Lawrence seaway will have to pay the full cost of transportation. 
In the past all prairie farmers shared the cost through the 
Canadian Wheat Board pool accounts. The changes will result in 
higher relative grain prices for producers in eastern 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba once deductions for transportation 
are made.
<P>
	The immediate effect after August 1 will be higher initial 
prices of about $5 per tonne for wheat across the prairies and $6 
per tonne for feed barley. It is expected the increased costs will 
depress eastern prairie wheat prices by about $5.80 per tonne in 
the first year. For the transition assistance, partial compensation 
will be provided from the $300 million Western Grain 
Transportation Act adjustment fund to offset higher costs as a 
result of the pooling changes and to facilitate the transition to a 
deregulated system after August 1. Although these changes 
sound good, under a new system we have to ask why we are 
using the fundamentals of the old system to ensure that happens.
<P>
	One way to real, meaningful change to the Canadian Wheat 
Board is through a farmer elected board of directors to replace 
the present system of government appointed commissioners, 
basically another patronage trough and an advisory board with 
no real power.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	We have seen it happen over the years where people get 
government appointments to the Canadian Wheat Board. If the 
whole system is to be democratized and updated we need to pay 
attention to the requests of farmers, which are in fact becoming 
demands, to democratize the whole Canadian Wheat Board 
system and make sure that farmers elect their board of directors. 
I think of every situation across the country, every board of 
directors, every community group or whatever. Those people are 
elected yet somehow the Canadian Wheat Board is still in the 
old system of government appointed commissioners.
<P>
	Farmers should be given the authority to decide what type of 
wheat board they want. After all they pay the bills. It is the very 
same as it is here in the House of Commons. If people are 
demanding something from government they will make sure 
they vote in and elect people who will effect the changes for 
them.
<P>
	Farmers are paying the bills through the Canadian Wheat 
Board just as Canadian taxpayers are paying the bill for this 
place. We need to make sure that if we are to open up the 
Canadian Wheat Board, if we are to put new systems in place, it 
has to basically go all the way. We must make sure that we 
democratize it fully and that the wheat board directors are 
elected by the farmers who pay the bills for them.
<P>
	Farmers should be given the chance to democratically 
examine their organization and all jurisdictional options. This 
would allow grain farmers to carefully consider and vote on a 
variety of market opportunities, for example introducing greater 
domestic and international domestic competition, allowing the 
purchase of wheat and barley on either a cash basis or a pooled 
price basis and allowing the board to operate as a seller from 
export terminal positions only.
<P>
	If we are to see any changes in the Canadian Wheat Board 
these things will have to be updated regardless of who is in 
power and regardless of their views on the Canadian Wheat 
Board or on the dairy commission that we have just spoken 
about. We are getting close to the 21st century and we cannot 
continue with a system where government appointees who have 
been faithful political hacks are transferred to some of these 
boards.
<P>
	These and other issues must be decided directly by farmers 
through referenda. My party has proposed national binding 
referenda in the House since I have been here in 1989 and we 
will continue to push that.
<P>
	The Charlottetown accord was a perfect example of that 
through a national referendum in 1992. It was a really exciting 
day for everyone in Canada. Politics changed forever in the 
country as of that October evening when we had a choice of 
putting down yes or no. Of course the no side won. I was the only 
federal parliamentarian of a federal party in the House of 
Commons who was on the no side. It was not really a happy 
occasion for me in this place but fortunately the  lives of most of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14069"> 14069 </A></B>
<P>
us do not just take place in the Chamber. We found incredible 
support in the rest of the country outside these hallowed halls 
from people who said they did not want a government dictating 
to them what would happen in the country. That was really 
exciting and opened the way for referenda.
<P>
	As we move now toward democratizing the Canadian Wheat 
Board we need to continue to put pressure on the government as 
well as on various groups if we are to open up the system 
regarding the pools with which the bill deals. Maybe that is a 
good first step, but we need to open it totally after that and make 
sure people who are in the positions of power in the Canadian 
Wheat Board, in fact the directors, will be voted in and have 
some measure of confidence from the farmers who put them into 
place.
<P>
	Referenda are exciting. Because we had one in 1992 does not 
mean that we have to put it off nationwide for another 40 years 
or 50 years. It is something that could be worked quite well into 
the Canadian system.
<P>
	Reform believes that now is the time for a fundamental 
evaluation of the role of the Canadian Wheat Board and the grain 
handling transportation system in Canada. The Canadian Wheat 
Board will continue to be a contentious issue until the 
democratic rights of farmers are restored and they are given real 
choice.
<P>
	We see the battle around the country about pro-choice. 
Farmers need to be given real choice so that they could elect the 
people who will sit on their boards. After all it is their 
organization, as I mentioned earlier. They are paying the bills 
for it. If they are paying the bills they should be the ones who 
decide how it is run in the future.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Obviously the minister of agriculture has made some changes 
but I am wondering whether he has the political will to make all 
changes that are necessary to the Canadian Wheat Board. The 
changes will come anyway and the big question is: Will our 
producers be prepared for them? That is what we are concerned 
about more than anything else. It is not with what the 
government is saying, that it is putting legislation in place or it 
thinks this is best. Let us be sure the producers are the ones who 
will be freed up in this and thereby the consumers.
<P>
	In the earlier discussion on the dairy commission a Liberal 
member said that all dairy farmers felt that way because the 
dairy commission said thus and so. We have to be a little nervous 
about that. I am not sure any particular organization speaks for 
every one of its members.
<P>
	We have just lived through the contentious Bill C-68, the gun 
control bill, in the House last week in which various interest 
groups had a vested interest. For instance the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police not only obtained a government 
grant, which seems rather ironic, but it was supporting the 
legislation and basically saying  that every policeman in the 
country supported gun control.
<P>
	I invited you, Mr. Speaker, to Beaver River last week to talk 
about pensions. I invite you again to come to listen to any 
producer. Being from Alberta you know they say whatever the 
organizations are, whether the Canadian Wheat Board or the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, they do not speak on 
their behalf, just as I am able quite freely to say that although the 
National Action Committee on the Status of Women claims to 
represent me as a Canadian woman it simply does not.
<P>
	For us to take a blanket statement that my group speaks for me 
and we know what every producer thinks because some group 
said it means that we are making huge leaps in logic. We are 
pleased to see some changes in the pooling system. However, as 
I said about the old and the new, if we are to make changes and to 
make something new then let us make them completely new. Let 
us not just tinker with the system and try to keep the old in place 
and put patches of new cloth on the wineskin. It simply will not 
work. If we are to move in the direction of freeing it up for 
producers and ultimately consumers, let us go whole hog and 
make sure the Canadian Wheat Board is changed.
<P>
	Having spoken of hogs I will sit down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to follow my colleague from Beaver River. I would like 
to raise many of the same points but it is important that I have an 
opportunity to speak on Bill C-92, an act to amend the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act. The bill is very near and dear to my heart. It 
affects many of the people in my riding. The Peace River riding 
has a large and very dynamic agricultural community. We are 
watching with great interest what will happen today as the bill is 
amended.
<P>
	By way of background, the bill amends the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act to change the pooling points on which the initial 
payments are based from Thunder Bay and Vancouver to points 
in Canada designated by regulation of the governor in council. 
The bill also amends the Canadian Wheat Board Act to establish 
a deduction from the initial payment that supposedly reflects the 
relative transportation cost advantages of each producer.
<P>
	The way the system works now shipping charges are 
determined by the distance a farmer has to ship grain to its 
designated pooling point of Thunder Bay and Vancouver. In my 
riding of Peace River approximately 95 per cent of all the grain 
produced in that riding is shipped west to the Pacific coast 
although one of our designated pooling points has been Thunder 
Bay. This means farmers in Peace River and other farmers in the 
western prairies have subsidized part of the costs of farmers in 
the eastern prairies through the freight pooling system the 
Canadian Wheat Board has implemented.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14070"> 14070 </A></B>
<P>
	My understanding of what is being proposed is a system of 
four catchment areas. Each area will have a different deduction 
for transportation to a new designated pooling point. There are 
few specifics in the bill so I can only speak to the larger concept 
of what is being proposed.
<P>
	The changes will result in higher grain prices for farmers in 
Alberta and western Saskatchewan and lower relative grain 
prices for producers in eastern Saskatchewan and Manitoba 
once deductions for transportation are made.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	It is thought that the bill which becomes effective August 1 
will raise wheat prices in the west by an average of about $5 per 
tonne and feed barley prices by about $6 per tonne. Similarly 
prices in the eastern prairies will drop. This is part of what we 
call a rationalization that needs to take place in the total 
transportation industry and grain industry so that farmers can be 
effective, efficient and able to compete on the world market 
where they must compete. We must get transportation prices in 
line and this is a step in the right direction. It goes part way to 
addressing some of the distortions caused by the blanket pooling 
system and replaces it with a bunch of mini-pools.
<P>
	However I have a problem with the whole concept of straight 
pooling no matter how it is done. As a farmer I do not want 
anyone to subsidize my freight costs. I certainly do not want to 
subsidize anyone else's either. I propose that we pay the real cost 
of moving our grain from point <I>a</I>, in my case the Sexsmith area, 
to Vancouver or Prince Rupert and let the producer who lives 
somewhere else pay his or her real costs.
<P>
	I am opposed to any type of freight pooling system. My 
preference would be to move to an open user pay system where 
farmers can decide where they want to ship their grain and where 
the market decides how much it would cost.
<P>
	The changes proposed in the bill seem to maintain the control 
the Canadian Wheat Board has enjoyed in past decades. Just as a 
bit of history, the board was established first in 1917 for the war 
period and then again in 1935 to ensure the orderly sale of grain 
when western Canada faced economic and environmental 
disasters. In its original form the Canadian Wheat Board was a 
compromised tool for increasing returns and stabilizing 
incomes. Participation by farmers was voluntary. I stress very 
clearly that it was voluntary. It was not the way it is now where it 
is compulsory on all export grain.
<P>
	In 1943 when supplying food to Canada's allies once again 
became an important national goal, the participation of farmers 
in the Canadian Wheat Board became compulsory. 
Unfortunately that did not end when the war ended, although 
that is the time it should have ended.
<P>
	The board's chief mandate is to market wheat grown in 
western Canada in the best interest of western Canada's grain 
producers. Its designated areas include the three prairie 
provinces and a small part of British Columbia. The board is the 
sole marketing agency for export wheat and barley and the main 
supplier of the grains for human consumption in Canada.
<P>
	Canadian feed grains for domestic consumption could be 
marketed either through the board or directly through grain 
companies. The sales of the Canadian Wheat Board fall between 
$3 billion and $6 billion annually. The board is administered by 
a chief commissioner, an assistant chief commissioner and three 
other commissioners. All costs of the board's operation are paid 
for by western grain producers. It is a user pay system and will 
lead to the concept that we should have control over the board.
<P>
	An advisory committee was touted in the House last year 
elected from the producer group. It would advise the board on 
policy but would have no real power. It is just an advisory 
committee. However it has a very important function; it was 
democratically elected.
<P>
	I have run through a bit of the background because I want to 
point out that the Canadian Wheat Board did not always exist in 
its present form. There was a time when farmer participation 
was optional. I also want to lead into some other changes that are 
necessary to bring the Canadian Wheat Board into the times.
<P>
	The Reform Party has been saying for a long time that 
commissioners to the board should be democratically elected. 
Producers should have a real say on how the board operates and 
what kind of power it has. Only if commissioners have to run on 
certain platforms in certain designated areas can producers truly 
have a say in the board's operation.
<P>
	The government is willing to allow an elected advisory 
committee, which is what has taken place for the last several 
years. Why not extend the same democratic process to where it 
really counts, to the people who run the Canadian Wheat Board 
themselves, the commissioners? I would like to see a dual 
system of marketing so that it would be the same for export grain 
as we currently enjoy on domestic grain in Canada. That would 
mean there would be a Canadian wheat board type of system 
where farmers who wanted to pool would be allowed to do so 
and those who did not would be allowed to sell on the open 
market.
<P>
	I would like to give two examples of situations that are 
nonsensical but exist because the board is not accountable to the 
people it is supposed to be helping. These two examples are of 
farmers who have been trying to diversify. The very thing we 
want is for farmers to diversify however both of them have been 
frustrated by the rigid structure of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14071"> 14071 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	First there is the story of Bob Numweiller, a Saskatchewan 
miller who lives close to the U.S. border. He wants to mill his 
own wheat, let me emphasize his own wheat, into flour and sell 
it from his farm. The board says he cannot do that. First he must 
sell his wheat to the Canadian Wheat Board. Then he can apply 
to buy it back but he must also pay the board's price and its 
administration fee even though he does not go through the 
Canadian Wheat Board. Then he has to wait a year or more to 
find out how much money he got for his wheat, his wheat, which 
he so-called sold to the board. It sounds like something which 
could have happened in Russia 20 years ago.
<P>
	There is an absurd twist to the story. Now that the Canadian 
Wheat Board can no longer control imports because of the 
passage of Bill C-57 which brought us up to speed with the 
World Trade Organization, that farmer has discovered he can 
cross the United States border, buy American wheat and bring it 
back and mill it on his farm but he cannot mill his own wheat 
without going through this rigid structure. Something is 
obviously wrong.
<P>
	Then there is the story of a farmer in my riding who is a friend 
of mine. He has gone on to diversify and has started to grow 
organic wheat. However the wheat board does not sell 
organically grown wheat. As such it has to be pooled with 
conventional grain where of course it loses all of its advantages 
and its distinctiveness.
<P>
	The board deals in boat loads. There is not enough production 
at this time to fill a boat and it is too much hassle for the board to 
administer a container load, or so it seems. The question is: Is 
Mr. Schmidt allowed to do his own marketing? Only if he goes 
through the Canadian Wheat Board first. He has to do his own 
marketing but he has to apply to go through the board first.
<P>
	Here are the steps he must take: First he has to go to his own 
local elevator to sell his grain on contract. The elevator writes 
out the sales ticket. Mr. Schmidt writes out a buy-back cheque 
for $36.94 a tonne. He also has to pay the elevator a $5 per tonne 
administration fee even though he does not use it. Now he owns 
his own grain. I have to emphasize that at this point he now owns 
his own grain. How absurd. He can sell it as he pleases. However 
he has to wait a year to get his original $36.94 per tonne back or 
he may not see it at all depending on how the pool did that year.
<P>
	If he tries to bypass the Canadian Wheat Board he commits a 
criminal offence and must pay a penalty of $12,000 and spend 
two years in jail. What kind of a system do we have in this 
country? This gentleman has gone out and found his own market 
for a product which we are trying to encourage, organically 
grown grain, and the system which we use is inhibiting him and 
many other farmers who want to diversify.
<P>
	Those are just two examples of why the Canadian Wheat 
Board needs an overhaul. I would start by ensuring that the 
commissioners are democratically elected by producers. After 
that the board would change its ways and meet the needs of the 
farmers of the 21st century in a hurry. Otherwise they would not 
be re-elected.
<P>
	Today's new generation of commercial farmers want to 
substitute their management skills for the collective approaches 
which have dominated the system for the past few decades. They 
see new opportunities and hot new products such as organic 
grain. Using their own skills and their own comparative 
advantages they want to be free to grow new crops and market 
them themselves. That seems a reasonable approach to me and 
one which has to be worked out. Otherwise the Canadian Wheat 
Board will lose in the end.
<P>
	My experience in my riding is that the farmers who are 
questioning the Canadian Wheat Board's approach to a single 
desk marketing agency are those of a younger age. Unless the 
board adapts they will be gone. These new farmers are not 
knocking on the government's door asking for new subsidies. 
All they are asking is for government to get out of their way to 
let them do business. I hope the government is listening.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to take too 
much time on the bill because I spoke on it before it went to 
committee.
<P>
	This bill could probably set a model for future bills to be 
passed expeditiously. When the bill came to committee we 
asked the chemical producers and other witnesses to appear. 
Because the chemical producers and other interested parties 
monitored this problem during the convention they did not see 
any need to appear before the committee other than to endorse 
the legislation. Canada showed leadership in trying to convince 
other countries to accept this convention against the 
development, production, stockpiling and use of any chemical 
weapons or their precursors.
<P>
	All three parties were very co-operative. We all saw that we 
are making the planet safer for future generations. We are very 
fortunate to have a member on this side of the House who 
actually witnessed the signing of the convention. He will be one 
of our speakers in this debate.
<P>
	It is important to get the legislation through the House and the 
Senate before the summer because Canada would like to be one 
of the first 65 signatories to ratify this convention. With the kind 
of co-operation we have been getting from the official 
opposition, the Reform Party and independent members, I think 
we will have this legislation passed very quickly through this 
House and then hopefully passed just as quickly in the Senate.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The reason this convention was so successful is that 
companies which are producing chemicals were involved. 
Canadian manufacturers were even used as a test ground to see if 
this is the kind of convention that will work. It is a convention 
that is doable. Canadians can be proud that here again when it 
comes to the security and environmental cleanup of our planet, 
Canada always shows the lead.
<P>
	In closing I thank all parties and the private sector for helping 
us to get this legislation passed as quickly as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to again address Bill C-87 which, when 
proclaimed, will enable Canada to implement laws prohibiting 
the production and use of chemical weapons and providing for 
the regulation in Canada of certain chemicals which could 
readily be turned into chemical weapons.
<P>
	This new law will fulfil Canada's obligation under the United 
Nations chemical weapons convention signed by Canada and 
over 130 other states in Paris in January 1993. Almost a quarter 
century of negotiations have taken place at the conferences on 
disarmament in Geneva to bring this initiative to fruition.
<P>
	This is a major achievement and the first multilaterally 
negotiated treaty to abolish an entire category of what can only 
be called weapons of mass destruction. Not only will all 
chemical weapons and their production facilities be destroyed 
under international supervision, all government and industry 
activities falling under the convention's objectives will be liable 
to international monitoring and possibly inspection. This is a 
mammoth undertaking and the success of this important 
milestone in world affairs is dependent upon each participating 
state or country ratifying the convention and then abiding by 
their treaty obligations.
<P>
	Canadian negotiators have done a tremendous job and can 
take great pride in the instrumental role government in 
co-operation with the private sector has played in the successful 
negotiation of the convention. An important multilateral 
process has taken place. Its success can fuel even greater 
co-operation among nations so that even larger strides can be 
made to make our world a safer place in which to live.
<P>
	Because trade with nations which have not signed the 
agreement will be prohibited, our ratification of the treaty will 
ensure our chemical industry remains competitive. 
Additionally, speedy passage of this bill will make it possible 
for Canada to be among the first countries to ratify the treaty. It 
is fitting that Canada be among the first 65 nations to ratify the 
treaty. After all our nation has worked diligently to ensure its 
success.
<P>
	The treaty will come into force 180 days after it has the 
validation of 65 of the 160 signatories to the agreement. Should 
some member nations require more than the 180 day period to 
meet the criteria, there are provisions to extend this period but it 
may not be extended beyond two years.
<P>
	Because of the implications and complexity of this 
convention, every avenue has been sought to ensure that all 
obligations under the convention are fully met. It is important 
that we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14073"> 14073 </A></B>
<P>
recognize those who have dedicated their efforts to ensure that 
implementation will go smoothly for our industries.
<P>
	With the co-operation of the Canadian Chemical Producers 
Association, the Canadian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
Association, Merck Frosst and government officials conducted 
a trial inspection of the Merck Frosst facility in Quebec to test 
the verification provisions. These results were presented by 
both associations to the annual industry consultations with 
negotiators in Geneva. This ongoing private sector co-operation 
was instrumental and invaluable in ironing out the wrinkles 
during the negotiations and in drafting the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian Chemical Producers Association played an 
integral role by submitting one of the first papers on the issue of 
confidentiality to the conference on disarmament. This 
preliminary private sector involvement provided valuable 
constructive support and all participants are to be applauded for 
their contribution.
<P>
	Additionally, officials from the Department of Foreign 
Affairs deserve commendation for their extensive preparatory 
work initiated to ensure the legislation will be effective while at 
the same time minimizing any negative impact on or 
interference with the affected industries.
<P>
	By choice and representing the views of Canadians, Canada 
does not possess chemical weapons or chemical weapon 
production facilities. Therefore the overall impact will not be as 
difficult or significant for us as for those nations that do produce 
these instruments of war.
<P>
	The greatest impact within Canada will arise from the 
provisions dealing with industry activities. The underlying 
thrust of the legislation is, as dictated by the chemical weapons 
convention, to completely prohibit any activity relating to the 
production of chemical weapons.
<P>
	The most toxic, destructive and dangerous chemicals are 
listed in schedules 1 and 2. These chemicals will have the least 
impact on Canadian industry because production in Canada of 
chemicals on these lists is negligible. They have little or no 
commercial use. The more commonly used industrial chemicals 
noted in schedule III will have the greatest impact on our 
industry. Because of the commercial value of schedule 3 
chemicals, industry production will proceed without inspection 
up to a limit of 30 metric tonnes.
<P>
	As for Canadian industry, the initial and annual declarations 
will be mandatory for all plant sites that were in production the 
previous year and/or those plants expected to produce in the 
following year more than 30 metric tonnes of schedule 3 
chemicals.
<P>
	The initial declarations where necessary must be made within 
the 30-day period after the treaty comes into force. Chemical 
amounts exceeding 230 tonnes will be subject to verification 
and random onsite inspections to ensure compliance. They will 
require an initial declaration followed thereafter by mandatory 
annual declarations. Such declarations must include aggregate  
national data from the previous year on quantities produced, 
imported and exported of each schedule 3 chemical. Also each 
involved country must provide a quantitative itemization of 
each product exported and imported. This information will be 
declared no later than one month after the convention enters into 
force.
<P>
	Reporting will commence in the calendar year following 
ratification of the treaty. Canada will be required to submit 
annual declarations within 90 days after the end of each calendar 
year. Also annual declarations on past activities are to be 
presented no later than three months after the end of the previous 
year.
<P>
	Should production estimates exceed the projected threshold a 
new declaration must be submitted within a two month period. 
Should projected production be greater than the reported 
estimates such new activity must be reported at least five days 
before such production commences.
<P>
	To allow some flexibility for industry declarations may not be 
necessary for any schedule 3 chemicals that are mixed in low 
concentration with other substances. The guidelines dictate that 
if these chemicals could be easily recovered from the mixture or 
if the total weight represents a risk factor reporting could be 
required.
<P>
	Reports for production exceeding the 230 tonne threshold will 
include the purpose, the chemical name, common or trade name 
used, the structural formula and chemical abstracts service 
registry number if one has been assigned. The declaration of 
anticipated activity will be indicated in ranges starting for 
example between 20 and 200 metric tonnes and extending all the 
way to ranges above 100,000 tonnes.
<P>
	Production levels for previous years will be similar in nature 
to the outline just mentioned. Verification within Canada will be 
carried out by onsite inspections. Using mechanisms such as 
specially designed computer software, the technical secretariat 
will randomly select plant sites for inspection. Such selection 
will be based on factors such as the identified chemical 
designation, as provided for in the legislation, plant site 
characteristics and the nature of activities carried out at the 
plant.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Every effort will be made to ensure there is an equitable 
geographic distribution of inspection activities. As a note, 
provisions clearly stipulate that no more than two inspections 
per year will take place at any one plant although special 
provisions pursuant to article IX will permit more inspections.
<P>
	The combined number of inspections in any one country shall 
not exceed three plus 5 per cent of the total number of plant sites 
declared by a state or the maximum number of 20 inspections, 
whichever of these two figures is lower.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14074"> 14074 </A></B>
<P>
	The general aim will be to verify that activities are consistent 
with the information reported in the declarations and ensure that 
no chemicals indicated on other schedules are being produced or 
used. Inspection teams will be authorized to demand access to 
records, particularly in situations where it is determined this 
information is needed for verification.
<P>
	Sampling and on site analysis will be conducted to check for 
the presence of undeclared chemicals. If on site analysis is not 
possible, analysis may be required at a designated laboratory. 
Plant areas to be inspected will include storage sites, delivery 
sites, reaction vessels, feed lines to the reaction vessel valves, 
flow meters or other equipment associated with the production. 
There will be an external inspection of reaction vessels and 
ancillary equipment as well as any lines leading to long term or 
short term facilities for the chemicals, areas for waste, effluent 
handling and disposition of chemicals not meeting 
specifications.
<P>
	Inspections are not to take more than 24 hours but in some 
cases extensions may be sought and negotiated. At least 120 
hours' notice of an inspection must be given prior to the arrival 
of the inspection team. Industries producing chemicals such as 
phosphorous, sulphur and fluorine, which can be readily adapted 
to produce chemical weapons, will have to report their activities 
but at least at this stage will not be subject to random 
inspections.
<P>
	Inspection data will then be compiled and forwarded to the 
International Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical 
Weapons, OPCW. Our government must also control and report 
the import and export of these chemicals ensuring the 
confidentiality of the data collected.
<P>
	For the most part the necessary structures are already 
established in Canada. The national authority will be set up 
within the Department of Foreign Affairs. Our current export 
and import permits and laws will facilitate the monitoring of the 
products.
<P>
	Domestic enforcement is to be conducted under the Criminal 
Code. Industries must co-operate with inspectors or be subject 
to conviction if indicted and found deficient. The most serious 
infractions can make industry liable for up to five years in prison 
and a $500,000 fine. After five years an international conference 
will take place to evaluate the success or failure of measures 
implemented to monitor the agreement. If necessary new 
methods or requirements may be established at that time.
<P>
	In establishing mechanisms to bring this convention into 
effect, every effort must be made to ensure the paper burden and 
costs do not become so prohibitive that smaller industries will 
be adversely affected or even forced out of business. 
Government must also continue to be sensitive to the financial 
implications of administrative costs. Extreme care must be 
taken to ensure the decision making will be streamlined and  
effective avoiding the creation of an excessive bureaucratic 
machine to track these chemicals. Already business in Canada 
has far too much bureaucracy and red tape to contend with.
<P>
	The collection of data and conduct of inspection should be 
cost effective and any industry feedback must be heard and 
receive due consideration. Hopefully the co-operative 
relationship established between government and industry 
during the preliminary development stage will continue.
<P>
	Although some of our veterans were subjected to it most 
Canadians are fortunate to have been spared the horrors of the 
use of chemical weapons such as were experienced with the use 
of mustard gas or nerve gases in wartime. Chemical warfare in 
the Iran-Iraq conflict brought vivid pictures of the terrible 
lethality of these weapons. The indiscriminate and massive loss 
of human life convinced the international community that every 
effort has to be taken to outlaw these terrible weapons of human 
destruction.
<P>
	Our world has changed. The cold war is over but recent events 
in Japan bring home the necessity of continuing to work toward 
the elimination of these terrible weapons. That event proved it 
does not take a war to result in chemical weapons intruding into 
our lives.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	At the time when the nerve gas assault on Tokyo's subway 
system took place, leaving 12 dead and 5,000 sick, it was not 
illegal to make or possess sarin and other nerve gases. In the 
days and even weeks after the nerve gas attack, a series of 
frightening incidents affecting defenceless civilians continued. 
The cult's top scientist was fatally stabbed in front of reporters. 
Burning bags containing a form of cyanide were found in a 
public washroom in a huge train station. Mysterious noxious 
gases were released several times in train stations and other 
public places making hundreds of people ill.
<P>
	Police raids on cult sites yielded tonnes of chemicals and 
equipment necessary for the manufacture of sarin. There is even 
further evidence that research was taking place on biological 
weapons. Because of the cult attacks, Japan recently enacted 
laws to prohibit these chemicals.
<P>
	Moving to another region, there is now very conclusive 
evidence that chemical and biological weapons were present in 
the theatre of operations during the Persian Gulf war. In this 
instance the introduction of low levels of such chemicals may 
have resulted from bombings of either Iraqi chemical weapons 
facilities or caches of Iraqi weapons on the Saudi border.
<P>

<P>
	The Canadian Peacekeeping Veterans Association in Victoria 
has been approached by field engineers who were involved in 
operation axe. One of their duties was to destroy objects that 
could not be specifically identified and some are now suffering 
from what appears to be exposure to highly toxic substances. 
Their reported symptoms include severe headaches, bleeding 
gums, rashes, joint pain, memory loss, dizziness and breathing 
difficulties.
<P>
	Collectively these symptoms, first traced to their origins by 
the doctors examining American veterans, had become known 
as the gulf war syndrome. Not only is this of great concern to 
those directly affected, a molecular toxicologist at the 
University of Maryland, Dr. Ellen Silbergeld, told a 
congressional hearing last fall that scientists now know that 
those exposed to these toxic chemicals can pass the poison on to 
their children.
<P>
	Dr. Francis Waickan, an environmental pediatrician, has 
compared birth defect statistics between gulf war babies and 
other children. His findings reveal that abnormalities among 
children of gulf veterans is probably tenfold that of the normal 
population.
<P>
	There is additional evidence that some of these toxins are 
released from the body during night sweats experienced by these 
veterans thus transmitting the chemicals to their spouses. This 
explains why many veterans' spouses are reporting similar 
rashes, fatigue and other symptoms of this ailment.
<P>
	Clearly the effects and tragedies connected with chemical 
warfare do not end at the time of their use. The ramifications 
persist even being passed on to the future generations and 
causing untold harm to the human race.
<P>
	The passage of Bill C-87 is just the first step on the way to 
eliminating future tragedies such as these. The real test will 
come when we are able to measure the willingness of the major 
powers of this world, those having the greatest number of 
production facilities and the largest stockpiles, to indicate their 
commitment to accept and institute these measures.
<P>
	It is my fervent hope that the obstacles facing the 
international community can be overcome and that we can look 
forward to a day when both biological and chemical weapons 
will be no more.
<P>
	To reiterate, we now stand at a pivotal junction on the road to 
eliminating these cruel, indiscriminating and devastating 
weapons. Let every nation accept the challenge by agreeing to 
continue to further the implementation of co-operative 
approaches and multilateral efforts to promote world peace and 
security.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports Canadian agreement to and 
execution of Bill C-87.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will split my time with the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra.
<P>
	This bill provides for the ratification and implementation of 
the chemical weapons convention which I have supported for a 
very long time. In January 1993 I had the good fortune to be 
present at the signing of this treaty in Paris, where I chaired a 
parallel conference of parliamentarians. The purpose of the 
parallel conference was to mobilize parliamentary support for 
the ratification of this important treaty. As a result I am now part 
of an international task force working toward this goal.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately the ratification process has been very slow. Of 
the approximately 160 countries which signed the treaty since 
1993, more than two years ago, only 27 at last count have thus 
far ratified and deposited its ratification. This is a very small 
number if we consider the great number of about 160 that have 
signed the treaty. I should point out that the treaty can only come 
into force six months after the ratification by 65 countries. We 
still have a long way to go.
<P>
	The chemical weapons convention is the most comprehensive 
disarmament treaty ever developed. It is the end product of a 
quarter of a century of negotiations and culminates 100 years of 
international effort to eliminate chemical weapons from the 
world.
<P>
	Many Canadians will still remember the horrifying 
experience of the chemical poison gas attacks of World War I 
which caused 1.3 million casualties and 100,000 fatalities. 
Many Canadians were killed in the gas attacks at Ypres in 
Belgium. Following World War I, great effort was made to ban 
these weapons. There was agreement in the 1925 Geneva 
protocol but this treaty only banned the use of chemical weapons 
in war and did not provide for inspection and verification.
<P>
	This protocol, however, was never adequate. As members will 
know such weapons were used by Iraq 10 years ago and were 
threatened to be used during the gulf war. Fortunately they were 
not used. They have been described, because they can be 
delivered by missile, as the poor man's nuclear weapons. 
Without this treaty they would cause a serious threat to many 
countries in the world.
<P>
	In comparison to the 1925 Geneva protocol, the chemical 
weapons convention, which is before us, bans the use, 
development, manufacture, distribution, transfer and 
stockpiling of chemical weapons. It also provides for the 
monitoring, inspection and enforcement of the treaty and 
provides for penalties when the treaty is broken. One provision 
provides for the destruction of current stockpiles.
<P>
	Part of the enforcement machinery is the establishment of the 
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons known as 
the OPCW in The Hague as well as the establishment of national 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14076"> 14076 </A></B>
<P>
authorities in all  countries to monitor the internal enforcement 
as well as the import and export controls of these chemical 
weapons.
<P>
	There is also the provision of criminal penalties for those who 
violate the treaty as implemented by this law. Consequently 
some cost is involved, such as the cost of the national and 
international authorities to monitor and enforce. However we 
understand that this is essential if we are serious about banning 
these cruel and horrible weapons.
<P>
	There is also the cost of destroying existing stockpiles. This 
could be a considerable amount for those countries which have 
such weapons. In particular, I refer to the United States and 
Russia. Under the treaty, if these countries sign and ratify, they 
will have up to 15 years to destroy those stockpiles. 
Unfortunately neither the United States nor Russia have ratified 
although both have signed the treaty.
<P>
	In conclusion I want to congratulate the Canadian government 
for its work in developing the treaty and now for its ratification 
through this bill. It is hoped that with this ratification by Canada 
impetus will be given to other countries to ratify as well. As I 
said at the beginning, 65 countries have to ratify before the 
treaty can be put into force.
<P>
	I also want to congratulate those Canadian companies that 
manufacture chemicals and are co-operating with the 
government in the implementation of this treaty. This is the 
most advanced, complete disarmament treaty ever developed 
and I am extremely pleased to stand in the House and support it.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in support of my colleague, the 
distinguished member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, in support of 
this bill.
<P>
	It is a subject that has occupied the world community, as a 
general subject, since The Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907. 
In fact one of the most significant acts of international law 
making was the act referred to by my colleague, the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the Geneva protocol of 1925. The 
protocol prohibited the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or 
other gases and of bacteriological methods of warfare.
<P>
	The Geneva protocol reflected the spirit of its time. You dealt 
in general prohibitions. You established the legal norms. There 
was not the same attention that, by bitter experience, we have 
given in recent years to the machinery for concrete 
implementation of general principles. This is one of the 
significant features of Bill C-87. It is not merely the prohibition 
of chemical weapons, it is prohibition of the development, 
production and stockpiling as well as use and it includes 
measures for destruction.
<P>
	It follows on the experiences that we derived most recently 
from the INF treaty of 1987, the Reagan-Gorbachev treaty on 
the destruction of intermediate and shorter range nuclear 
weapons, that general principles without supporting 
implementing machinery and sanctions are like tinkling 
cymbals. They are noble but they do not bring us down to 
concrete reality. I welcome this measure.
<P>
	I also welcome it as another step in the process of 
development on a pragmatic, empirical, problem oriented, step 
by step basis of general universal disarmament. The Sermon on 
the Mount in the large, general treaties is too often ignored. It is 
the poetry of international law. It is not the material substance of 
it.
<P>
	If you follow through the period when the cold war was giving 
way to detente and eventually ended, it was by this step by step 
progression: the banning of nuclear tests above the ground and 
in the atmosphere in the Moscow test ban treaty on through the 
non-proliferation treaty, on through various treaties on banning 
of placement of weapons on the seabed, eventually culminating 
in the INF treaty of 1987. It is a process and this particular treaty 
is a very distinctive and very happy part of that whole process. 
Congratulations to all the officers who have been involved.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce 
referred to the issue of ratification. This is one of the problems 
with international treaties. There is an attrition rate. Perhaps 
100 countries sign a treaty but then when the officials go back 
home perhaps half of those only will proceed to ratify or ratify in 
a timely fashion. If the treaty is non-self-implementing, even 
fewer countries will introduce legislation to adopt it. We have 
signed, we have ratified and we are implementing. Thus attrition 
is avoided.
<P>
	In terms of the treaty becoming general international law, 
some would argue as to what sanctions, what controls should 
there be. If I may, I will cite the general opinion of doctrinal 
authorities, of legal text writers. It is part of general 
international law as it now stands that the use of chemical 
weapons is against international law. This is the view expressed, 
as based on the evolution of customary international law 
through a number of international acts.
<P>
	I have referred to The Hague conventions. I have referred also 
to the Geneva protocol. The view was advanced by the late 
President of the World Court, President Nagendra Singh and 
myself in a joint work on general disarmament we published in 
1989 that the use of chemical weapons in warfare is against 
international law. In the gap between the signing of the treaty 
and ratification in good faith and implementation by individual 
countries like Canada, and the treaty finally becoming general 
law because of the necessary minimum number of state 
ratifications, that principle of international law applies.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14077"> 14077 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Canada, in communicating its ratification of the treaty and 
implementation for other countries, might draw attention to the 
fact that it is not necessary to wait for the ratification by the 
minimum number of states joined by the treaty to have 
recognized the principle of the use of chemical weapons in 
warfare being banned.
<P>
	The treaty itself goes well beyond that. It follows in the spirit 
of the INF treaty. It is part of this step by step progression 
toward a system of general international law and humanizing 
warfare-the oxymoron that is there-temperamenta belli is 
what it is called, reducing the agonies of war if it has to be 
conducted but moving toward a general system of interdiction of 
armaments.
<P>
	The issue has been raised with this treaty, as with other 
treaties, of whether it is missing some of the major problems. 
One of the most serious problems today is the resumption of 
nuclear weapons tests. It may interest the House to know that in 
the same volume in which we suggested chemical warfare is 
already outlawed under international law, the same learned 
authors expressed the opinion that nuclear weapons tests, as 
such, are against international law today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
bills tabled in this House, whether they are government bills or 
private members' bill, do not always have the same impact. 
Some legislation is merely technical, without any reference to 
principles or values.
<P>
	From time to time, however, bills do affect us personally 
because they reflect our values and are for us an opportunity to 
contribute to the progress of human kind and strengthen our 
solidarity with the rest of the world.
<P>
	Consequently, I welcome this opportunity today to speak to 
Bill C-87, an Act to implement the Convention on the 
Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and 
Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction. The bill 
before the House today is a response to Canada's obligations to 
implement, at the national level, international commitments 
made by the Canadian government.
<P>
	This convention, signed in Paris in January 1993 by more than 
160 countries, was the result of 20 years of negotiations. In fact, 
I want to take this opportunity to note the leadership role played 
by Canada in the negotiations leading up to this convention.
<P>
	Unfortunately, by January 1995, only five countries had 
ratified the convention, and today, only 28 countries have 
proceeded with ratification. At least 65 signatures are needed 
for the convention to come into force. The Bloc Quebecois is 
therefore pleased to support the Canadian government on the 
passage of legislation to implement the convention so that it can 
come into force as soon as possible.
<P>
	To explain our position, I would like to provide a little 
background information on the use of chemical weapons in 
warfare throughout the ages and their capacity for massive 
destruction.
<P>
	First of all, we must realize that the use of chemical weapons 
is not exclusive to the twentieth century. In antiquity, certain 
forms of chemical and biological weapons were already in use, 
although on a very limited scale. I am thinking for instance, of 
the custom of poisoning the wells of cities under siege or 
throwing plague corpses into the enemy camp.
<P>
	However World War I marked the tragic advent of the science 
and technology of chemical warfare. On April 22, 1915, at Ypres 
in Belgium, the Germans used chlorine gas for the first time as a 
lethal weapon.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	The result was horrible: 15,000 soldiers out of commission, 
including 5,000 dead. Sadly notorious, this gas now bears the 
name of the town where the slaughter took place and is still 
widely used.
<P>
	Once this new weapon had been developed, there was a rush to 
improve it and make it even more deadly. At the time, since the 
wind, which was the main vector of the gas, could suddenly shift 
and turn against the user, science went on to develop projectiles 
that provided a better guarantee of hitting enemy targets. Bombs 
and mortar shells were used to accomplish this deadly task. 
Developments in aviation further increased the threat to civilian 
populations and the military. Meanwhile, science also tried to 
overcome the protection afforded by the gas masks in use since 
1915. From now on, toxic gases were to become an increasingly 
devastating weapon on a massive scale.
<P>
	During the Second World War, chemical and biological 
technology became even more sophisticated. Worse still, as 
increasingly toxic products were discovered, it also became 
possible to manufacture them on an industrial scale. The gas 
chambers and the thousands of Chinese gassed by the Japanese 
are examples of the horrifying consequences of this new deadly 
technology. After 1945, not only was the development of 
chemical weapons unprecedented, their low cost and ease of 
manufacturing also made them readily available.
<P>
	Effective and deadly, chemical weapons soon became the 
poor man's atom bomb. In recent years, the use of chemical 
weapons has been most widespread in developing countries. 
Industrialized countries had already decided that chemical 
weapons no longer had any use strategically or as a deterrent 
because they had the necessary detection and protection 
technology. In addition, the two most developed blocks struck a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14078"> 14078 </A></B>
<P>
balance of terror at the beginning of the 1950s with the 
stockpiling of nuclear weapons.
<P>
	The tragedy is that the have-not countries which use chemical 
weapons do not have access to the same kind of protection as 
industrialized countries. Since poor countries are unable to 
acquire the hydrogen bomb, they are using chemical weapons as 
a means to deter and to threaten. The balance of terror below the 
tropic of Cancer depends on mustard gas, which is dubbed the 
poor man's atom bomb.
<P>
	The most recent demonstration of this was the Gulf war, 
which was an immense laboratory to fine tune chemical 
weapons. People all over the world were able to see on television 
the innocent victims of chemical warfare. On March 16, 1988, 
within a few seconds, 5,000 people from the Kurdish town of 
Halabjah died after neurotoxins were dropped on it. 
Unfortunately, Saddam Hussein did not stop there. In June 1988, 
he bombed the Iranian Majnoun islands with mustard gas and 
phosgene, killing between 10,000 and 15,000 people. Some 
40,000 Iranians are still suffering from the after-effects of the 
many chemical attacks made by Iraq. In addition, according to a 
report issued by the Senate of the United States, tens of 
thousands of allied soldiers who fought in the Gulf war were 
exposed to Iraqi chemical weapons and now are showing 
pathological symptoms, referred to as the Gulf war syndrome.
<P>
	Do not forget that this terrifying arsenal was built with the 
help of industrialized countries who, up until yesterday, 
continued to export large amounts of products which can be used 
to create chemical weapons. One of the reasons for the spread of 
chemical weapons is the fact that industrialized countries 
produce some of the substances used, certain pesticides for 
example, for civilian uses.
<P>
	As I stressed earlier, western countries stopped using certain 
chemical substances for military purposes some time ago and 
continued producing them uniquely for civilian uses. I would 
like to remind you that Canada has already destroyed its 
chemical weapons factories.
<P>
	This tacit abetment and lack of care in exporting toxic 
substances on the part of western countries have helped certain 
third world countries to amass a huge arsenal.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Libya is one of the countries that traded with the West in order 
to build up a supply and then began exporting this deadly 
technology.
<P>
	This is how the government in Khartoum ended up using 
mustard gas against the people in southern Sudan, and how 
Somalia got hold of neurotoxins. Other countries where there is 
fighting, such as Afghanistan, Egypt, the former Yugoslavia, 
Laos and Cambodia are suspected of using these toxic gases, 
which quickly attack the nervous system causing convulsions, 
paralysis and suffocation. As states cannot be forced to submit 
to investigations, they cannot be condemned by any evidence, 
and international sanctions cannot be used against them.
<P>
	Many of these countries have yet to sign the Chemical 
Weapons Convention. Iraq is one of them. For the moment, 
however, its chemical industry is not functioning, having been 
destroyed by a commission of the United Nations. Its arsenal of 
bacteriological weapons, the size of which we now know, did 
not, unfortunately, suffer the same fate.
<P>
	In response to the horrors and destruction of chemical 
warfare, a number of countries in the international community 
decided to take measures to prevent the manufacture and use of 
chemical weapons. These countries had already tried to limit the 
use of biological weapons as early as the middle of the 1970s 
with a convention on biological weapons. However, as the 
convention did not establish a verification regime, it was not 
particularly restrictive and therefore of little use for 
disarmament purposes.
<P>
	In 1925, with the Geneva convention, the international 
community prohibited the use of gas in wartime, but did not 
prohibit its possession or manufacture. Great thinking, Mr. 
Speaker.	Prior to the 1993 convention, there was nothing in international law to prevent the acquisition and manufacture of chemical weapons.
<P>
	I would first point out that the 1993 convention will benefit 
everyone and is in the interest of all developed and third world 
countries, even though it is in the latter that chemical weapons 
are most often used, as I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	Canada, unlike other countries, does not have equipment for 
its armed forces capable of rapid detection of the dangers caused 
by chemical or biological weapons. However, Canadian 
peacekeepers are serving in countries which have or are 
supposed to have these deadly weapons. It might be more 
relevant to equip our peacekeeping troops with detection 
equipment rather than buying four submarines, as the defence 
minister is planning to do.
<P>
	The convention is very far-reaching since it sets up a 
stringent inspection system aimed at discouraging states which 
might overwise be tempted not to abide by the terms of this 
international agreement.
<P>
	In fact, certain provisions allow for the control and 
monitoring of the destruction of the weapons and civilian 
chemical industry of the signing parties, anywhere, anytime. 
Inspections and verifications will be carried out by teams of 
international inspectors reporting to the Organization for the 
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, created under the 
convention.
<P>
	In this sense the signatories to this multilateral agreement are 
going beyond wishful thinking. They are equiping themselves 
with the means to ensure that the terms of the convention are 
abided by and to facilitate the implementation of the 
convention.
<P>
	In brief, the convention prohibits the production, acquisition, 
stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons. This ban 
covers not only chemical products manufactured for military 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14079"> 14079 </A></B>
<P>
purposes, but also vectors and equipment used in connection 
with such weapons.
<P>
	A planning commission has already been set up in The Hague 
to oversee the creation of the Organization for the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons. Several panel of experts have been 
reviewing different instruments and means to implement the 
convention. This commission is to ensure the transition to the 
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
<P>
	With Bill C-87, Canada is giving itself the means to meet its 
obligations under the convention, namely to gather information 
for the benefit of the organization, by setting up a national 
authority. Under its terms of reference, that national authority 
will also have to maintain a direct link with the organization and 
facilitate international inspections on Canadian territory.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Some information leaflets have already been printed on the 
subject and distributed to Canadian chemical companies to 
inform them of their new responsibilities and obligations under 
the terms of the convention. This shows how important the 
Canadian government considers the national implementation of 
the multilateral agreement on chemical armaments.
<P>
	This commitment also does credit to the mostly pacifist 
attitude of Canadians in general. Let me explain to the House 
how much Quebecers are interested in world peace and security. 
Quebec sovereignists have already included specific 
commitments to that effect in the Parti Quebecois platform.
<P>
	In the chapter on international relations, the Parti Quebecois 
promises to declare Quebec a nuclear weapon free zone and, 
consequently, not to permit any research, production, testing, 
stockpiling or deployment of nuclear, chemical or 
bacteriological weapons, or of any of their vectors, on Quebec 
territory.
<P>
	This commitment is totally in line with the intent of the 
convention on chemical armaments. Also, there is no doubt 
possible about the intentions of Quebecers who definitely want 
their country to be party to that convention once Quebec is 
sovereign. Quebec supports this collective action on the part of 
the international community, which aims at the complete 
eradication of weapons of mass destruction.
<P>
	Therefore, let me reiterate my support, and that of my Party, 
for Bill C-87 which will allow Canada to ratify the convention 
on chemical weapons as soon as possible. After all, we must not 
forget this is the first multilateral disarmament agreement 
which comes with an effective control plan.

	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to add my voice to those imploring the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage to restore funding for lacrosse, a 
uniquely Canadian sport.
<P>
	I would remind my colleagues that lacrosse is central to one of 
the most famous stories in Canadian history, the capture of Fort 
Michilimackinac during the Indian uprising of 1763 led by the 
great Indian chief Pontiac. Members will recall that the 
Ojibway, allies of the French at the time, played lacrosse just 
outside the fort, much to the amusement of the British garrison. 
When the ball was deliberately flung over the palisade, the 
British made the fatal mistake of opening the gates to allow the 
Indians to retrieve it.
<P>
	Thus the balance of power, despite the fall of Quebec, shifted 
away from the British and toward the French. So it has happened 
in Canada from time to time ever since.
<P>
	It would be a great disservice to Canada's founding peoples, 
aboriginals, francophones and anglophones, to allow lacrosse to 
perish. It is a vital part of our shared history and culture as 
Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we were 
relieved to learn yesterday about the release of the last 26 UN 
peacekeepers and observers, including 12 Canadians, detained 
by Bosnian Serbs.
<P>
	This further hostage-taking incident, which shows incredible 
defiance, followed three years of ethnic cleansing, mass 
destruction and carnage by Bosnian Serbs that have claimed 
more than 200,000 victims.
<P>
	Although today we salute the release of the Canadian 
peacekeepers and observers, we must still vigorously condemn 
the Bosnian Serbs' ruthless behaviour.
<P>
	We also remain deeply concerned about the fate of some 700 
other Canadian peacekeepers deployed in Visoko and Kiseljak, 
as the Bosnian government forces are mounting a vast offensive 
against the Bosnian Serbs to break the siege of Sarajevo.

Mr. Speaker, Special Olympics organizations all across Canada 
provide opportunities for the mentally handicapped to develop 
their physical, social and psychological abilities.
<P>
	I have been involved with Special Olympics for a number of 
years now and can attest to the benefits that result from these 
Special Olympics programs.
<P>
	On July 16, I will be hosting a fundraising golf tournament in 
my riding in support of the B.C. chapter of Prince George 
Special Olympics. I invite all members to come out and support 
this tournament but if they cannot come out I will be happy to 
take a donation back to the tournament on their behalf.

British Columbia, who died last Friday, was one of Canada's 
most distinguished jurists, senior adviser to several federal 
justice ministers and author of our law governing the legality of

<P>
	As judge he had extensive and varied experience in the Yukon

legal doctrines to meet new societal conditions and needs.

our country and to our capital city.
<P>
	I take this opportunity on behalf of 200,000 Cypriots who to 
this day find themselves refugees in their own country and on 
behalf of 1,619 persons who to this day are still missing and 
unaccounted for to denounce the July 1974 brutal invasion of 
Cyprus by Turkish forces.
<P>
	Twenty-one years later and despite various resolutions from 
the United Nations, the Commonwealth heads of governments 
and the European community condemning this brutal invasion, 
the Turkish regime refuses to come to the table and negotiate a 
peaceful and just solution for the island of Cyprus. Why? 
Because no solution is the solution for the Turkish regime.
<P>

as civilized human beings. Cyprus wants what all progressive 
institutions are advocating, justice.

Mr. Speaker, on June 10 I had the distinct pleasure to attend the 
outstanding day of celebration for our home made poet, 
Elizabeth Bishop.
<P>
	We celebrated the life and work of Pulitzer prize winning poet 
Bishop in Great Village, Nova Scotia. Bishop was born in New 
England in 1911 and spent her early childhood in Great Village 
with her grandparents. Her experiences as a child in rural Nova 
Scotia influenced, in fact dominated, her prose and poetry with 
the theme that all people are home made.
<P>
	Elizabeth Bishop died in 1979. However, her literary works 
grow and are ever more popular. She is classified in the top five 
modern poets and is taught in virtually every department of 
modern literature in universities throughout the world.
<P>
	The Elizabeth Bishop Society is a rapidly growing 
international association with memorabilia in Nova Scotia and 
at Vassar College, Bishop's alma mater.
<P>
	Today in the Parliament of Canada I salute the Elizabeth 
Bishop Society of Nova Scotia and the organizers in Great 
Village for recognizing her literary works.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last Friday we learned that Quebec City lost its bid to host the 
2002 Winter Olympics. We all agree Canada lost a tremendous 
opportunity to showcase its talents to the world when it lost that 
bid.
<P>
	However, Canada can still showcase its talents to the world by 
hosting Expo 2005. Calgary has a volunteer corps that will 
guarantee Expo is a tremendous success. It has the financial 
backing of the city and the province and would be a great 
Canadian showcase for a world's fair.
<P>
	Let me remind everyone the heritage minister promised to 
follow the recommendation of the Reid committee, which 
recommends Calgary as the best choice to host Expo 2005.
<P>
	Over three months ago the heritage minister promised to 
make a speedy announcement. The minister's dithering has 
tainted the selection process and is jeopardizing Canada's 
chances of winning on the international scene.
<P>
	I strongly urge the heritage minister to finally keep a promise, 
to announce Canada will sponsor an Expo bid and to choose 
Calgary as the city that all of Canada supports to host Expo 
2005.

June 1 the finance minister officially opened the Industrial 
Research and Development Institute in Midland, Ontario, in my 
riding of Simcoe North.
<P>
	The IRDI epitomizes the approach to research and 
development needed in the new economy and reflects the 
strategy called for in the red book.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The IRDI is a partnership between the federal, provincial and 
municipal governments, industry and universities. From the 
work done at IRDI Canada will derive major benefits that will 
help make our manufacturers more competitive on the 
international market.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I congratulate Mr. Robbert Hartog and Mr. Reinhart Weber, 
two industrialists in Midland whose vision was the genesis of 
the IRDI concept and whose hard work made it a reality.

	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadian businesses understand that to remain competitive in a 
global economy and grow stronger at home they will have to use 
all of our human resources as productively as possible. 
Employment equity programs are tools designed to help 
Canadian businesses to do so, not hinder them.
<P>
	It is heartening to hear many businesses and institutions have 
realized equitable participation by women, visible minorities, 
persons with disabilities and aboriginal people enhances the 
profitability of business.
<P>
	Employment equity laws provide a minimum standard for 
employers. They do not constrain innovative leading edge 
employers who want to tap into existing and emerging markets. 
The Conference Board of Canada made it quite clear in its recent 
report that diversity is a bottom line business issue.
<P>
	Employment equity is not a mystery. It is not a threat and it is 
not a drag on the economy. Just ask business leaders in Canada 
who understand Canadian customer demographics.

<P>
	Halifax has just delivered one of the best summits in recent

Mulroney may be gone but his legacy of damn the voters lives on

appearance of corruption were all hallmarks of Mulroney's 
regime and the same can be said for the members opposite.
<P>
	I thought I would never see it but the government's refusal to 
have the heritage minister resign surpasses even the Mulroney 
Tories in shoddy ethical standards.
<P>
	Of most concern to me is the government's suppression of 
public opinion. The Liberals came to power on a mandate for 
change but nothing has. Ontario called out for change two weeks 
ago but the federal Liberals responded with threats to the 
dissenters. Unbelievably the heritage minister is defended while 
those who stand on principle are scorned.

the government never confirmed that it would respect the

	Without even a debate on the use of biotechnology in food 
production, the government is presenting consumers with a fait

authorized the marketing of experimental milk produced with 
somatotropin imported from the U.S.
<P>
	It is not the interests of consumers that the government is 
looking after, but the economic interests of pharmaceutical 
companies such as Monsanto, which is lobbying Health Canada

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, while everyone is celebrating the release of the 
hostages in Bosnia, the Muslim and Croat offensive against 
Bosnian Serb positions continues, in an attempt to lift the siege 
of Sarajevo. The fighting goes on, despite a warning from the 
G-7 countries Thursday evening, and a solemn appeal for a 
ceasefire from the UN special envoy.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. As 
we speak, some 700 Canadian soldiers are still confined to their 
camp in Visoko. Would the minister agree that in Halifax, the 
G-7 countries failed to reach agreement on a specific solution to 
put an end to the conflict in Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, clearly, the Bosnian crisis which has been going on 
for several years could not be settled in a matter of hours at the 
Halifax summit. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition realizes 
that.
<P>
	However, summit participants have reiterated their 
confidence in the diplomatic process as opposed to a military 
solution. They renewed their unconditional support for the 
peace plan proposed by the contact group and, more specifically, 
gave a very clear mandate to Mr. Bildt and Mr. Stoltenberg to 
continue their efforts to bring all parties towards a lasting peace 
in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the minister whether the Canadian 
government and its allies intend to take up the offer of the 
Bosnian president, who says he is prepared to interrupt the 
current offensive, provided all heavy artillery is pulled back 20 
kilometres away from Sarajevo and access roads are again 
opened to humanitarian convoys.
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, this proposal is of course a positive sign. 
Unfortunately, to be effective, all parties involved in the conflict 
must agree, not just the Bosnian government  but also the 
Bosnian Serbs. In this connection, summit participants asked 
Mr. Yeltsin to use all his influence to intervene with the Serb 
authorities so that an agreement can be reached that will involve 
all parties involved in the conflict.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we know that the Americans have refused to 
contribute financially to the rapid reaction force. That being the 
case, does the minister believe it might be necessary to drop the 
idea altogether?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear on this. The Americans have not 
indicated that they were in a position to be a rapid reaction force. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14084"> 14084 </A></B>
<P>
The financial implications of it will have to be discussed at a

United Nations and in order to ensure that the resolution would 
be passed it was decided to postpone the financial implications 
to a later date.

would be participating, have not ruled out the possibility of 
financing part of it as they have done in the past.

<P>
	We have learned that the Canadian government's 
Communications Security Establishment might offer its 
services to private business to help pay the bills in the face of 
federal budget cuts. When questioned about this, the defence 
minister declined to answer.
<P>
	Considering how important this information is, can the 
minister tell this House whether the CSE is really considering 
making its spying expertise available to the private sector?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we 
are talking about here is not signals intelligence, we are talking 
about the information security program, or INFOSEC. It is 
within the mandate of the CSE to give security advice on 
government telecommunications. It is an expertise that is 
probably the best in Canada and the CSE has been approached by 
other levels of government, other agencies and indeed people in 
the private sector to give advice.
<P>
	It did occur to some officials that there should be some cost 
recovery associated with giving the advice. That was simply a 
working document with no government or cabinet approval.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, based on the information at hand, what is being 
contemplated is much more extensive than what the minister 
just described.
<P>
	Given that Parliament has no control whatsoever over this 
agency, which is not accountable to anybody, how can the 
minister approve or even consider approving the provision of 
spying services to the private sector by a government agency?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps 
the hon. member did not hear my first answer.
<P>
	We are not talking about espionage. We are not talking about 
signals intelligence. We are talking about the security of 
telecommunications. Every company, every agency, every 
government in the country has a concern that its data banks and 
its telecommunications are kept as secret as possible to preserve 
their integrity. That is what we are talking about. We are not 
talking about foreign espionage.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the government came to power it promised to 
make integrity a number one priority. The Prime Minister said 
there was an unprecedented level of public cynicism toward 
government and unless trust could be restored the political 
system would not work. Twenty months later the government is 
practising exactly the same ethics as its predecessor with 
conflicts of interest, patronage and old style pork barrel politics. 
What makes matters worse is that the Prime Minister has 
stubbornly refused to fire or even discipline ministers who 
violated codes of ethical conduct.
<P>
	Since the government is unwilling to do the right thing 
overall, will it at least introduce clearer guidelines for 
ministerial fundraisers to prevent future conflicts of interest 
such as those embroiling the heritage minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the leader of the 
Reform Party talks about integrity. In 1990 the leader of the 
Reform Party appeared before the royal commission on 
electoral reform and party financing where he stated: ``The 
Reform Party of Canada believes that no tax credits or 
deductions from income should be permitted in respect of 
donations of money to political parties or candidates. Parties 
and candidates should finance themselves''-
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> ``Parties and candidates should finance 
themselves with the money of their supporters and not with 
taxpayers' dollars''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> More, more.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> ``We recommend that the political contribution 
tax credit be eliminated''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14085"> 14085 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> However, that did not prevent every single 
member of the Reform Party from taking the government rebate 
that was offered to them at the end of the election campaign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pretending to not see an ethical issue is ignoring it or 
covering it up. We cannot go on with that vein of reply.
<P>
	What has also become clear over the last two weeks is that the 
government's mechanisms and procedures for dealing with 
breaches in its code of ethics are simply not working. The 
heritage minister was caught in an obvious conflict of interest, 
yet the ethics counsellor was powerless to act. The Prime 
Minister only consulted the ethics counsellor as an afterthought 
and his report remains a deep, dark secret.
<P>
	If this government is serious about restoring integrity to 
government and is unwilling to act itself, will it at least free the 
hands of the ethics counsellor and make him directly 
accountable to this Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the leader of the 
Reform Party says he sees no conflict in taking a public position 
that his party should not accept political tax credits nor should 
they accept money from the taxpayers, but when it is coming 
they are very happy to take it.
<P>
	While the leader of the Reform Party was up very righteously 
in the House last week attacking the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage for having a private dinner, he himself was attending 
another private dinner at the posh Windsor Club where initiation 
fees are $1,000 and annual dues are $600.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> However the press was not allowed because 
according to the press secretary of the leader of the Reform 
Party it was only a ``get to know you'' session.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, surely the minister can see the difference between a 
regular political fundraising event and one where a minister is 
soliciting clients of his own department. If the minister cannot 
see the difference there, we really have an ethics problem.
<P>
	No ethics code can be enforced as long as the government 
practices double standards when it comes to dealing with its own 
members. Liberal backbenchers who occasionally vote against 
the government at the direction  of their constituents are 
punished. ``I will not sign your nomination papers'', says the 
Prime Minister. However cabinet ministers found flouting the 
federal code of ethics are defended and even applauded for their 
actions.
<P>
	As a discipline for violating the conflict of interest guidelines 
has the Prime Minister told the heritage minister that he will not 
be signing his nomination papers at the next election?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, speaking of double 
standards, it seems to me that the leader of the Reform Party 
should explain to the House of Commons why he asked for his 
justice critic to be removed when he did not like some of the 
positions he took.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs

</B>Mr. Speaker, the Council for Canadian Unity is an independent 
organization. This registered private organization has no 
official link with us. The government finances the council 
because that organization seeks to promote Canadian unity, 
which is a perfectly valid goal.
<P>
	When the opposition or its big brother finances the council on 
Quebec sovereignty with my taxes and with the taxes paid to the 
Quebec government, it is clear that the opposition's big brother 
uses taxpayers' money to sell its option.
<P>

	Now that they are free, the government is also free to address 
our continued presence in Bosnia in a more objective way. 
Approximately 700 Canadians remain on their base at Visoko, 
stuck between hostile armies in the midst of an escalating 
conflict. They are pinned down by land mines and threatened if 
they try to leave their compound.

is pointless, dangerous and irresponsible and that Canada should 
urge withdrawal as soon as possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in terms 
of the 700 members of the Royal Vandoos Regiment in Visoko, it 
is rather regrettable and certainly unacceptable from Canada's 
point that these people are confined to their base.
<P>
	We will be making the strongest protest to the Bosnian 
government. The local commander has been trying to negotiate 
the passage of goods, food and personnel to the base. There is no 
reason to fear for their safety, but that  is a matter we will be 
concerned about and we will be negotiating with the local 
commanders.
<P>
	With respect to the general policy, the Prime Minister has 
made the government's commitment to the United Nations force 
absolutely clear. We believe the force can continue to do its job 
with the goodwill of the parties to start negotiating again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government continues to waffle about whether 
Canada will join the UN's rapid reaction force. It stalls for time, 
refusing to make the tough decisions about the mission in 
Bosnia. The government owes it to Canadians to stop dithering 
and decide its course.

<P>
	How can the minister claim that the Privy Council will only 
spend $2.5 million on the referendum, when his deputy minister, 
who appears better informed than he is, states that 17 per cent of

is here to insist on greater federal participation in settling native 
disputes in B.C. A native spokesman has said since last week 
that Adams Lake residents will have their access blocked today 
at 5 p.m. unless the federal minister involves himself in the 
dispute. There is urgency.
<P>
	How is it the federal department can promote and participate 
in all land claim and self-government negotiations in B.C., but 
when the public is held to ransom the minister asserts that he has 
no legal, moral or statutory obligation to get involved?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. The minister of aboriginal affairs is here from B.C. 
Even though we are not of the same party, I want to commend 
him for his excellent work in a very tenuous situation.
<P>
	I will go back to the basis of the complaint. This is an off 
reserve problem. As the member knows there have been 
archaeological finds there. As a matter of fact if he reads the 
Kamloops news it is fairly correct. Kyle Boxrud plans to build a 
60-unit recreational vehicle park but has been ordered to have 
an archaeological study conducted to determine the heritage 
value of the land. He has been  told that by the province. He has 
been told to discontinue his work. He has refused to do the study 
and he has also refused to discontinue his work.
<P>
	That is the issue. It is an off reserve issue. We are prepared to 
work with the province. I want to make clear that this 
government and this minister do not negotiate over barricades. 
We are a country of law and order and no barricade will get the 
promise of a solution. We have had a person there at two of the 
meetings. We are prepared to help facilitate a settlement with 
the clear understanding that barricades in Canada gain nothing 
from my department.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I understand a lot of private property owners not 
involved in the archaeological dispute are suffering as a result of 
this dispute.
<P>
	The minister has raised expectation levels in B.C. beyond 
what governments can deliver. A Penticton band spokesman is 
now saying that the B.C. treaty process is falling apart as he 
earlier predicted.
<P>
	Other than to blame Reform, as the minister did Friday, what 
is the minister doing to reduce expectations and create a sensible 
and publicly acceptable set of negotiations in which the rule of 
law is rewarded and protests and blockades are not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is referring 
to the broader issue of the B.C. negotiations. All Canada knows 
that it was not this government that really started the 
negotiations. We are doing modern treaty in British Columbia, 
contemporary treaty addressing the spirit of intent.
<P>
	I would advise the hon. member that there was a four-hour 
meeting with the First Nations from B.C. this morning with the 
minister and deputy minister. I thought the meeting was 
positive. If he blames us for enhancing expectations, if we as a 
government can collectively raise the spirits of aboriginal 
people, if we can restore values and that is raising expectations, 
that is what we are here for in the House of Commons.

documentation. In fact, this government has been proactive on 
interdiction. In 1990 there were some 8,000 illegally 
documented individuals coming into Canada. Through that 
active program, last year we reduced it to some 3,000 
individuals.

want to underline that quota is not mentioned in the bill. It is not 
designed for that purpose. It is designed to set up a system 
whereby we can work with employers in both the public and 
private sectors to ensure that barriers which apply to all workers 
can be reduced. In that way everyone can be given the full 
opportunity to advance to their level of talent and ability. It will 
ensure that nobody is discriminated against as they have been in 
the past.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
everyone wants to ensure equal opportunity but the trouble is 
that this type of policy and this bill will enact quotas in Canada. 
Let me give the exact figures to the minister for his 
consideration. This fall 112 new recruits will be visible 
minorities, 112 must be aboriginal and 95 recruits must be 
women. It could me more. Maybe it should be more, maybe less.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	The point is this: Why does the minister continue to say that 
there are no quotas when there are numbers like this that must be 
filled and prove that his bill and his policy means quotas for 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I say with deference that 
the hon. member's second question shows how ignorant he is of 
what is in the bill.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would urge you please to 
consider your language and maybe just tone it down a bit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me rephrase it. Obviously the hon. member is a stranger to the 
information contained in the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14090"> 14090 </A></B>
<P>
	I would point out to him that in the legislation itself we get 
away from providing any quantifiable requirements as was the 
case previously under certain human rights decisions. We are 
saying that by working with private employers we can ensure 
that we really aim at developing human resource plans in a wide 
variety of workplace situations so that we do not get to the point 
where one group of working people is being compared to the 
numbers in the workforce itself.
<P>
	The bill is designed to exactly moderate and mitigate those 
impacts. I suggest that the next time the hon. member asks a 
question it might be wise for him to first read the legislation.

	<B>Mr. Ron Fewchuk (Selkirk-Red River, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is directed to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	On June 14, 1995 the government responded to the report by 
the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans concerning the 
mandate and operations of the Freshwater Fish Marketing 
Corporation.
<P>
	Can the minister assure this House that the government will 
maintain and uphold the proposals that were announced last 
week?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government's response takes into account a number of 
recommendations made by the standing committee, the main 
thrust of which was to allow and give an opportunity to northern 
remote communities to develop their fisheries.
<P>
	Our response does exactly that. It provides for unconditional 
licensing of rough fish such as carp and mullet. It will also allow 
the community of Island Lake to buy and sell fish for a 
three-year trial period outside the FFMC. I can assure the 
member that the minister is committed to that.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	It has now been more than 18 months since the Baird 
commission tabled its report before this House. Despite the 
health minister's promises and the justice minister's good 
intentions, the government has yet to show that it does take 
seriously the recommendations made in this report.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm that, as she told the health 
committee in May, she will be tabling in this House before the 
summer adjournment measures to prevent the sale of human 
embryos and ova and to ban genetic manipulation for 
commercial purposes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. member knows, this is a very complex 
issue, which demands a great deal of co-operation between the 
various levels of government. It should be easy for Bloc 
members to understand how difficult this is since we have to 
deal with their big brother. Let me tell you that I am just as eager 
as you are to have something ready soon because I have been

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the premise of the hon.

<P>
	To give an example, he referred to New Brunswick's 
government being against the registry. That is not so at all. 
Frank McKenna was speaking for himself when he expressed a 
difference of view about one aspect of it but many senior 
members of that government are strongly in support of the 
registration of firearms.
<P>
	This government has every confidence first of all that the 
registration system, responding to what police have been asking 
for in this country for many years, will help make this a safer 
place. Surely my friends want to stand with the police.

<P>
	There was a series of measures undertaken under the general 
heading of the U.S.-Canada border accord but also in addition 
and outside that to make the border a more secure element of our 
national life.
<P>
	We are attempting to streamline processes to make sure that 
for the honest traveller people have less hassle, indeed no 
hassle, and for those who would break the law the border 
becomes a brick wall.

	Among the various examples of what we are doing was the 
announcement I made in Hamilton last Friday of a new pilot 
project for private aircraft that will allow free clearance of small 
planes coming into Canada using selective small airports. Those 
in this pilot project are Brantford, Buttonville, Gooderich,

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am now ready to rule on the question of privilege raised by 
the hon. member for Madawaska-Victoria on June 8, 1995.
<P>
	During Private Members' Business on that day, the hon. 
member and the hon. member for Beaver River engaged in a 
heated conversation.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	According to the hon. member for Madawaska-Victoria, as 
she turned to go back to her seat in order to end the discussion, 
the hon. member for Beaver River grabbed her by the arm. The 
hon. member brought this to the immediate attention of the 
Chair and, the Acting Speaker heard the question of privilege.
<P>
	Citing <I>Erskine May's</I>, 21st edition, at page 126, the member 
noted that it is a contempt to molest a member. She then claimed 
that she had been physically assaulted and was prepared to move 
the appropriate motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Beaver River then rose to confirm that 
the member for Madawaska-Victoria was correct in her 
description of the events. The member for Beaver River 
apologized to the member for Madawaska-Victoria and told 
the House she had intended no harm, threat or assault.
<P>
	The Reform Party whip, the hon. member for Calgary Centre, 
and the hon. member for Mississauga South, both witnesses to 
the incident, assisted the Chair by describing what they had 
seen. The chief government whip also spoke to the matter, 
drawing to the attention of the Chair a number of precedents. I 
thank all three members for their contributions.
<P>
	In my view the matter raised by the hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria is a very serious one for this House. The 
events that occurred were unfortunate, to say the least.
<P>
	The hon. member for Beaver River has admitted she was at 
fault but has explained she meant no harm and has in fact 
apologized for her actions. I refer to her own words in the 
debates of June 8 at pages 13507 and 13508:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I do apologize for that. I certainly did not mean any harm or assault. I do 
apologize if she thought there was any intention of an assault. I absolutely 
meant no harm or any threat.</BLOCKQUOTE>

the hon. member for York South-Weston and the late Mr. Dan 
McKenzie, to which the chief government whip referred, once 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14092"> 14092 </A></B>
<P>
the error has been admitted and the member has apologized, 
procedurally the matter should go no further.
<P>
	The incident ought not to have happened and it ought not 
happen again. I refer hon. members to the debate of October 16, 
1987, at page 10090. I concur with the decision reached by my 
predecessor on that occasion and with regard to the present case 
I find the matter is closed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is a troubling aspect to this incident which, if left 
unchallenged, could have serious consequences for us all, as 
members of this House. It is my hope that my remarks will clear 
the air and ensure that we stay on course in our dealings with 
each other in this House, particularly during the long hours of 
these final days before the adjournment.
<P>
	As Speaker, I am the arbiter of House proceedings, charged 
with preserving order and decorum. However, I cannot do this 
job alone. I rely on the co-operation of you all, my colleagues, 
to ensure that this Chamber remains the focal point for 
thoughtful reasoned debate on the matters crucial to the well 
being of our nation.

<P>
	While I take consolation from the fact that our House is more 
orderly and decorous than the one faced by my 19th century 
predecessors, I am constantly reminded that this is a place of 
strong opinions and strong emotions and that when tempers flare 
hon. members can get carried away. I strongly urge all hon. 
members, you my colleagues, to respect the conventions and 
traditions of this place and to conduct ourselves-myself also, 
because I am part of it with you-with the civility becoming 
representatives of the Canadian people.
<P>
	There is absolutely no place for violent language or actions in

	<B>The Speaker:</B> We will now proceed to tributes for one of our 
colleagues who died recently. I call upon the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke to make the first intervention.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to one of the longest serving members of 
Parliament, Mr. Bob Wenman, who passed away peacefully at 
his home on June 13.
<P>
	Robert Lloyd Wenman was born in Maidstone, Saskatchewan, 
on June 19, 1940 and would have been exactly 55 years old 
today. He had a distinguished academic career, attending the 
University of Saskatchewan as well as several prominent 
American schools. He trained as a teacher at Saskatoon Teachers 
College.
<P>
	He first entered politics in 1966 at the age of 25 years. He was 
elected at that time to the British Columbia legislature. He was 
re-elected in 1969 and after a short time was also an alderman in 
Surrey, British Columbia.
<P>
	He was elected for the first time to the House of Commons in 
1974 and re-elected at every election afterward until he decided 
to retire from politics in August 1993.
<P>
	During his time as a member of Parliament he held several 
posts, including parliamentary secretary to the minister of 
defence, and chaired the Standing Committee on Labour, 
Employment and Immigration.
<P>
	Outside the House of Commons he gave generously of his 
time to many causes, the most significant of which was 
undoubtedly the United Nations.
<P>
	Mr. Wenman was a member of this place who very early on 
became interested in environment issues, issues that related to 
the global population. He was interested in these issues at a time 
when it was not fashionable. I remember in the 1984 Parliament 
he was among a few members at the time who pursued some key 
issues related to the environment, one of them being, as I 
subsequently discovered in reading some notes following his 
passing away, South Moresby in British Columbia. That was an 
issue he pursued with the previous government, that of Mr. 
Clark.
<P>
	He was also very interested in issues that affected global 
parliamentarians and chaired that group for some time.
<P>
	He left his mark in a conference held in British Columbia 
called Globe '92. He chaired the UN global parliamentarians on 
habitat group. A consequence of the 1992 conference was the 
creation of the International Centre for Sustainable Cities, now 
located in the city of Vancouver.
<P>
	He was also very interested, in his constituents and in the 
issues of his own area, among them Fort Langley, which I know 
something of because of previous responsibilities. I can assure 
the House that he certainly pursued the interests of Fort Langley 
with a great deal of vigour.
<P>
	As friends and colleagues reflect upon his great contribution, 
which spanned 30 years of public life in Canada, and as we think 
back to the significance of that contribution, may I refer to 
someone you have just  referred to, Mr. Speaker, your predeces-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14093"> 14093 </A></B>
<P>
sor, Speaker John Fraser. Upon learning of his passing away, 
Speaker Fraser said this: ``Bob Wenman took his own direction, 
clearly from his own star''.
<P>
	As we look back on his life may we encourage many other 
Canadians to follow the star of Bob Wenman.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I want to extend our very deep regrets to his wife of 
32 years, Donna, and his four children, Jill, Kiven, Ken and 
Kraig.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with a deep sense of loss that I rise to 
recall the life and the untimely death of Bob Wenman, a man 
dedicated to the country, to his province of British Columbia and 
to public service.
<P>
	My friend, Bob Wenman, died last week in British Columbia 
at the age of 54 after a political career spanning almost 30 years, 
including 19 years in the House of Commons, representing the 
constituents of Fraser Valley West.
<P>
	It is Bob's principled and distinguished life rather than his 
passing which will remain fixed in the minds of those of us who 
knew him.
<P>
	Bob began his political career at the age of 25 in 1966 as a 
Social Credit MLA in the provincial legislature of the province 
of British Columbia. From that early start until last week he led 
a life marked by an unwavering commitment to stand by his 
beliefs and ideals. Whether or not his views were popular, Bob 
was resolute in upholding and promoting those things that he 
believed to be right.
<P>
	During his final years in public office, Bob's commitment to 
family values, the environment and Canada's relationship with 
countries in the Pacific rim was very evident.
<P>
	He is survived by his wife Donna and four children, Ken, Jill, 
Kiven and Kraig, and our thoughts are with them at this very 
difficult time. I hope his family and his many friends are able to 
take solace in the knowledge that his contribution to his 
province and to the country will long be remembered.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the Bloc Quebecois and on my own behalf, I also want 
to pay tribute to Robert. You all remember that in 1981 only one 
Conservative member was elected in Quebec. However, in 1984, 
57 Conservative members arrived here to represent Quebec, 56 
of them being new faces. That turnaround was the result of the 
efforts made by Robert, who taught some skills at the sessions 
for Conservative candidates.
<P>
	As the leader of the Conservative Party mentioned earlier, all 
Quebec Conservative or former Conservative members, 
including those who were defeated during the last election and 
those who did not seek a new mandate, remember Robert as an 
exceptional facilitator and motivator at these sessions for 
Conservative candidates. Robert was extremely friendly and he 
taught us many points which proved useful during the election 
campaign. In fact, several Quebec MPs elected in 1984 are very 
indebted to him for his good advice. Even though he had to 
conduct his own election campaign, Robert was generous 
enough to come and spend two days with us at the sessions for 
candidates, held in a hotel which is now a Travel Lodge, where 
he welcomed us. The whole session was organized by him.
<P>
	He was an extremely generous person strongly devoted to the 
party line, but with some very progressive ideas. For example, 
he was always the one, in the Conservative Party who would 
trigger the debates on the environment. I had the opportunity to 
sit with him on various commissions and committees. I was 
always impressed by the avant-gardism of his ideas, as well as 
by the pragmatism which characterized every one of his 
statements. To be sure, he was a philosopher but he was always 
very practical.
<P>
	We had a lot in common. Like me he was a former teacher and 
in business. Consequently we would often have discussions 
together. Robert also talked a lot about agriculture since he 
represented a part urban and part rural riding. Again, since our 
ridings were more or less similar, we had long discussions 
together. I have very fond memories of Robert. He was very 
close to his constituents and always ready to give to others. He 
was courteous, friendly, competent, meticulous, hard working, 
and showed respect for his colleagues. Robert also loved sports 
and we had to discuss racquetball with him every time we talked 
to him.
<P>
	I thank him for his great contribution to democracy in this 
country. To his family, his wife and four children, I offer my 
most sincere condolences. I leave them with a quote from 
French author Alexandre Dumas who said: ``Those whom we 
loved are no longer where they were, but they are always with 
us, wherever we are''.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sad to say that last week former Conservative MP Robert

proudly serving the Fraser Valley West communities of Langley, 
Fort Langley, Aldergrove and Abbotsford.

<B><A NAME="14094"> 14094 </A></B>
<P>
	Bob was a longstanding politician who started his public 
service at the age of 25 in 1966 as an MLA in British Columbia. 
He joined federal politics in 1974. In the House of Commons he 
focused on personal projects and issues such as the 
environment, a bill permitting passive euthanasia, the 
enhancement of Canada's international ties and the promotion 
of B.C. business opportunities with the federal government. He 
also was strongly anti-abortion and supported family values.
<P>
	Bob and I met after the election and in the sincere and open 
approach for which he was known, he was kind enough to help 
me in those early days. For that I shall be ever thankful. He was a 
popular individual and active in our community. He was 
respected by all people and shall be missed.
<P>
	Bob's contribution has made Canada a better country in which 
to live. I join with my Reform colleagues and all members of the 
House to express sincere sympathy to Mr. Wenman's family and 
friends. We thank Bob for his unselfish contribution.

	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the honour to present, in both official languages, 
the fourth report of the Standing Committee on Government 
Operations on Bill C-82, an act to amend the Royal Canadian 
Mint Act, without amendment.
<P>
	I would like to add a few more words on behalf of the 
committee. In the deliberations on Bill C-82, an act to amend 
the Royal Canadian Mint Act, the Standing Committee on 
Government Operations heard two separate messages from both 
government and industry on the introduction of the new $2 coin.
<P>
	First, the Government of Canada is introducing the new $2 
coin because of the savings it will generate for the taxpayers. 
Within 20 years more than $254 million will be saved for 
Canadians with the introduction of the coin. Further, the 
government is expected to accrue an additional $449 million in 
seigniorage to the consolidated revenue fund within 18 months 
of the issue. The savings for taxpayers are significant indeed.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	We also heard a second message loud and clear from industry, 
small and medium sized businesses in particular. Although 
industry supports in principle the introduction of the new coin 
because of the associated savings, business has expressed 
serious concern over the timing of the move. The affected 
businesses and associations clearly stated that the 12-month 
notice is not adequate time to prepare for this adjustment.
<P>
	Given the fact that a delay in the introduction of the coin 
would cost the Government of Canada an estimated $109 
million in the fiscal year 1995-96, the committee recognizes the 
need for the Government of Canada to balance both the 
requirements of industry with those of fiscal responsibility and 
budgetary prudence.
<P>

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 31, the form and the 
content of the attached petition have been certified.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to present a petition from 
approximately 850 Canadians from the Montreal area. The long 
and turbulent history of humanity has, at times, concealed far 
reaching events of tragic proportions.
<P>
	Eighty years ago the Armenian genocide, perpetrated by the 
Turkish government of the Ottoman Empire, claimed the lives 
of 1.5 million innocent Armenian victims.
<P>
	Resolutions of the United Nations subcommission, the 
European Parliament, South American countries and in Canada, 
the legislatures of Quebec and Ontario have condemned this 
monumental crime.
<P>
	Hence, the petitioners request that Parliament change its 
policy of indifference toward the Armenian genocide and 
actively initiate and promote international efforts to persuade 
Turkey to recognize its crime against humanity.

guardianship, as they see it, would include the same legal and 
moral obligations as adoption.
<P>
	The petitioners point out that guardianship, as they would 
want it, is in accord with their religious beliefs. They would like

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CHEMICALWEAPONSCONVENTIONIMPLEMENTATIONACT">CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION 
IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-87, an act to implement the convention on the prohibition of 
the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical 
weapons and on their destruction, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, from the killing fields of Passchendaele to the bloated 
corpses of Kurdish people in Iraq, to the people we have seen 
dead and dying in the streets of Japan, chemical weapons have 
come to each and every one of us in our lives.
<P>
	Bill C-87 is something we as Canadians should be very proud 
of as it enable us to implement our convention on the banning of 
these weapons of mass destruction. It also shows a unique 
amount of leadership that Canada and Canadians have 
demonstrated, a degree of leadership I might add that shows 
what we as Canadians can do in foreign policy if we put our 
minds to it.
<P>
	I thank those members in the Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade who have worked extraordinarily hard 
to implement this very important piece of legislation, not only 
for Canada and Canadians but also for people across the world. 
As I hearken back to my original example, all of us in the House 
today and all Canadians hope that such tragedies will not occur 
in the future.
<P>
	This is a landmark deal. I also thank a couple of members of 
the riding of Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Mr. Bob McCrossen and 
Mr. Ken Conrad, who have given me invaluable information on 
these and other policy matters.
<P>
	This convention had a number of sectors and dealt with 
schedules 1, 2 and 3 dealing with various chemicals. Schedule 1 
deals with chemicals that are known to be chemical weapons 
such as tabun and sarin. Schedules 2 and 3 deal with precursors. 
There are varying degrees of compliance among them but it 
enables our country and other countries to monitor each other in 
a co-operative fashion to ensure that no country within the 
international community is building up chemicals or precursors 
to chemical weapons that can be used for aggressive and 
belligerent purposes.
<P>
	One of the most remarkable aspects of the bill is the degree of 
co-operation. If we look at just one aspect of it, it enables 
countries to look at other countries and demand spot checks on 
the countries if they are suspected of developing, producing or 
stockpiling chemical weapons for aggressive and military 
purposes. It enables the international community to go in there,  
investigate and demand the chemicals be apprehended and 
destroyed as is.
<P>
	The consequences of not doing so are significant for the 
country that chooses not to obey. In this instance when the 
implications of using chemical weapons are so severe it is 
important to see that the international community finally has its 
act together and is able to penalize countries that engage in these 
activities.
<P>
	The industries that produce chemicals have appeared before 
the committee on foreign affairs, on which I sit, to give their 
wholehearted support for the bill. That is important to know. We 
in the House do not want to impede or compromise in any way, 
shape or form the ability of the chemical producers of Canada to 
engage in the peaceful production of chemicals for industrial 
purposes, a very important aspect of the industry.
<P>
	There was a level of co-operation shown in the production of 
this convention that has not been seen since the end of the 
second world war. My hope is that we can learn something from 
this in the application to other aspects of threats to the 
international security that are occurring in the world now.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	I have two examples on the aspect of the international stage 
that are a major threat to the international security not only for 
countries half a world away but also, believe it or not, for our 
country.
<P>
	One example is the trafficking of small arms. The trafficking 
of small arms in this world of ours moving from one area of 
conflict to another has fanned the flames of ethnic discontent. It 
has given the fuel to enable people to fight ethnic conflicts 
where 90 per cent of the time it is the civilians who bear the 
brunt of these wars. They serve very little purpose.
<P>
	Although people might say they have a right to buy and sell 
weapons, it is not the same as buying and selling wheat. These 
seemingly innocuous trades have an enormous impact not only 
on the conflicts in question but also on countries such as ours 
which are not directly involved in it. Why is that so? Because it 
causes the migration of individuals away from conflicts to areas 
that do not have conflict. It means that people are going to move 
to our country. I am sure if we put ourselves in those people's 
shoes we would see that they want to live in their homeland. 
They do not want to move to an area half a world away. These 
people in moving to our country will then cause an economic 
stress on our social programs.
<P>
	The second thing is that conflicts half a world away put a 
stress on our military and on our foreign aid dollar. No matter 
what we do, if we go into a country and spend decades building 
up its infrastructure and a civil conflict occurs in that country, 
all of what we and other countries have done to build a peaceful 
and productive society will be dashed on the rocks for 
generations to come. We can see that now in the former 
Yugoslavia, in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14099"> 14099 </A></B>
<P>
Angola and in  Mozambique. The list goes on and on. In fact the 
list is getting longer all the time.
<P>
	There were over 40 ethnic conflicts in the world last year. The 
numbers are not getting lower they are getting higher. In part, 
small arms are what fuel the flames of that. I ask if Canada can 
take a leadership role, the same leadership role we demonstrated 
in producing the convention on banning chemical weapons, in 
developing some restrictions or framework in the trafficking of 
small arms for our benefit and for the benefit of countries the 
world over.
<P>
	A disturbing thing came across my desk late last week. It 
shows that in Rwanda the French in collusion with the 
Government of Zaire have been selling arms to the former Hutu 
government living in the camps in Zaire. This means that the 
French are selling arms to the rebels and the rebels, over 50,000 
strong, are getting ready to go into Rwanda to continue the 
killing.
<P>
	I say that because it is very important. They are not only 
destabilizing Rwanda but they are destabilizing the eastern part 
of Zaire and are fuelling the flames of ethnic discontent in 
Burundi also. What we have seen for the last two years in central 
Africa is going to repeat itself unless we ask the international 
community through the United Nations and the Organization of 
African Unity to get involved and defuse the situation before it 
gets out of hand.
<P>
	The other aspect in which I would like us to take a leadership 
role is the banning of land mines and anti-personnel devices. 
These devices have no significant role in fighting a war. They 
are primarily meant to destabilize the civilian population and 
are not meant to kill but to maim. Usually they are meant to 
maim civilians who work in the fields and children. Many of 
these anti-personnel devices are in fact designed to look like 
toys. When the children pick them up they get their arms or legs 
blown off. That is what they are used for.
<P>
	I would ask that we take a leadership role in asking for the 
land mines and the anti-personnel devices to be put in the 
convention for conventional weapons and put in a similar 
category to chemical weapons. If we did that we would do a 
great service by saving hundreds of thousands of lives and 
preventing injuries. We would also be able to prevent the 
situation we see now which is that after a conflict finishes large 
areas of many countries are left completely uninhabitable. I will 
give a couple of recent examples.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	In Chechnya there are literally millions of mines seeded 
around the country and absolutely nobody knows where they 
are. Therefore large tracts of land in Chechnya are going to be 
completely uninhabitable.
<P>
	In Mozambique thousands and thousands of square 
kilometres of land are completely uninhabitable. People cannot 
go into the fields to grow crops to get their economic house in 
order because of the land mines. That  completely diminishes 
the ability of a country to get on its economic feet after a civil 
conflict is over.
<P>
	In Croatia the Croatians say that over a quarter of a million 
hectares are completely uninhabitable because they are seeded 
indiscriminately with land mines and anti-personnel devices.
<P>
	The justification is as I have described before. Let us get 
together and work with the United Nations to look at those two 
areas. This is not only in our interests but in the interests of the 
international community as well.
<P>
	As I said before, the model we can use is this convention, the 
convention on banning the stockpiling, use and production of 
chemical weapons and the degree of international co-operation 
we have seen here. It is a truly remarkable degree of 
co-operation. If we as a country can work with our Nordic 
compatriots to influence other multinational organizations, such 
as the United Nations, and the regional groups, such as the OAU, 
the OAS and the OSCE, and show them it is in their 
self-interests to put restrictions on the purchase, sale and 
production of small arms and look toward banning 
anti-personnel devices and mines, then we might be able to 
make some headway in this area.
<P>
	I would also like to address the aspect of preventive 
diplomacy. I have spoken to the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
about this on a number of occasions. The minister said that yes, 
we will get involved by sending some of our diplomats across 
and that we will try to influence other countries and in 
co-operation with them send rapid deployment forces into areas 
where fighting has started. I would say that is too late. We 
usually find that the antecedents to conflict are on the boards at 
least two years before a conflict blows up.
<P>
	There are things we can do to prevent these conflicts from 
occurring. Let us use the UN crisis centre more effectively. We 
need to build up a network all across the world of groups, 
individuals and NGOs that can funnel information into the UN 
crisis centre. The UN crisis centre could then produce briefs 
which would be made public every month as to what is occurring 
in the hot spots. The United Nations, which again would require 
a new level of co-operation, could then act on these situations to 
try to get a diplomatic solution rather than having them solved at 
the end of an assault rifle.
<P>
	There are some things which we have not looked at 
aggressively. One of the things is to use the IFIs as an economic 
lever to bring belligerents to the table before they start fighting 
it out. These are things which have not been looked at before.
<P>
	The other aspect is to withhold non-humanitarian aid from 
countries. By doing that we can force them to engage in 
behaviours consistent with common international norms. Again 
we try to offset the conflict by engaging in a diplomatic solution. 
If we allow a conflict to occur the seeds of ethnic hatred are 
sown for generations to come. It does not end at the end of the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14100"> 14100 </A></B>
<P>
conflict; rather, it continues for generations to come. We will all 
collectively pay for it in the future.
<P>
	We cannot keep getting involved in conflict after conflict. We 
do not have the power, we do not have the will, and rightly so, 
and we do not have the money or the resources to do it. Perhaps 
through the leadership which we have demonstrated by 
implementing the convention on chemical weapons we can use 
the lessons we have learned here and bring Australia, New 
Zealand, Sweden and Norway together to influence the 
multinational organizations. If multinational organizations are 
going to continue to function in the way they have been since the 
end of the second world war, we will get the same results we 
have been getting since that time which are totally unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	We need a paradigm shift in the way we deal with the new 
threats we are going to have in the international community in 
foreign policy. As one of the few countries in the world that can 
take a leadership role in this, I ask that we engage in this not only 
for the benefit of the international community but also for the 
benefit of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a 
minute of the question and comment period to compliment the 
hon. member on his vision of a safe, secure planet for all. I heard 
this in committee and in the House. I compliment the hon. 
member for that vision and I hope he never loses it.
<P>
	As he mentioned in his speech the most successful thing about 
this bill is the co-operation experienced in developing the 
convention and when the bill was being worked on to put it 
through the House before the summer recess.
<P>
	I want to take the opportunity to thank the Reform Party and 
the official opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak on third reading of Bill C-87 on the 
prohibition of chemical weapons. It is a particular pleasure 
considering that Bill C-87 seems to be one of the few 
government bills that has not been slapped with time allocation 
by the government.
<P>
	It is a sad indicator of the state of our democracy that our 
government feels there should not be free and open debate on all 
the bills of substance that come before the House. When the 
Liberals were in opposition they went insane every time the 
Mulroney government imposed closure, especially on 
controversial bills like C-68, C-41 and C-85. Unfortunately, 
now that they have formed the government their tune has 
changed. As the Liberals and BQ were voting for closure and 
silencing democratic debate, they were laughing and joking as if 
they were having a grand old time. This behaviour is 
reprehensible and I would not have believed it if I had not seen it 
with my own eyes.
<P>
	The use of closure on these highly controversial bills was 
particularly ironic considering that the government was willing 
to spend as many days as necessary for debate on things like the 
$2 coin. If there really was a time problem in Parliament, then 
why would the government not limit debate on that sort of bill? 
If there was a time problem, then why did it not resume debate 
on the controversial bills months ago, rather than ramming them 
through in the last two weeks before the summer break? The 
answer is simple: Time is not the problem. The problem is that 
the government is putting forward flawed legislation and a free 
and open debate would expose this to everyone.
<P>
	Does the government really think the people of Canada do not 
see what it is doing? Do the Liberals think that if they stifle 
debate Canadians will not notice they are lining their own 
pockets with the outrageous MP pensions? Does the government 
think citizens do not realize it is giving special status under the 
law to sexual orientation? Will gun owners not notice their 
legitimate rights are being trampled on? No, on all counts.
<P>
	Even though there is a temptation to play the government's 
ridiculous game, the Reform Party does support the chemical 
weapons convention which Canada signed in 1993. We will 
support the bill which allows Canada to be among the first group 
of countries to implement the convention's terms of agreement.
<P>
	As all members of the House know, the Canadian commitment 
to peace is second to none in the world. This country invented 
the concept of peacekeeping and we have given strong support to 
the UN for many decades. Because of our history, Canada has 
also strongly supported international agreements and regimes to 
limit the dangers of war. The bill we are dealing with today falls 
into this category.
<P>
	The chemical weapons convention deals with a category of 
weapons that are a blight on the world. Since the use of these 
weapons is considered illegitimate by almost everyone, the 
chemical weapons convention is dealing with a virtually 
universal norm. When I say universal, we must remember that 
there are notable exceptions which serve to remind us exactly 
why Canada must support the chemical weapons convention.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Everyone here in this House will remember with horror the 
terrible scenes of Kurdish villagers gassed by Iraqi dictator 
Saddam Hussein in the late 1980s. A reoccurrence of this truly 
evil act must be prevented in the future. By ratifying Bill C-87 
Canada will be doing its part toward that end.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14101"> 14101 </A></B>
<P>
	More recent events in Japan again reminded Canadians about 
the threats posed by lethal chemicals. In Japan we had the tragic 
circumstance where a fanatical cult was able to manufacture the 
deadly nerve gas sarin and then use it to poison hundreds of 
people in the subway system.
<P>
	Once the signatories to the chemical weapons convention pass 
their own enabling legislation and the convention comes into 
force, hopefully this kind of tragedy will become preventable. 
With stricter controls of chemical warfare agents and their 
precursors, it seems unlikely that a group would be able to 
stockpile the kinds of chemicals hoarded by the Japanese cult 
leaders. Hopefully this would be detected and the appropriate 
officials could respond to head off trouble before it got out of 
hand.
<P>
	Bill C-87 prohibits the production and use of chemical 
weapons and provides for the regulation of certain chemicals 
that can easily be turned into chemical weapons. Over the 
summer and early fall similar pieces of legislation will be 
prepared throughout the world and hopefully by late this fall the 
chemical weapons convention will officially come into force.
<P>
	Currently the vast majority of countries have signed this 
convention and the Reform Party is quite hopeful that this 
worldwide effort will be a long term success.
<P>
	With few countries outside the convention there will be 
significant pressure on signatories to adhere strictly to the 
convention's goals and provisions. Unfortunately the Middle 
East is one part of the world where several countries are refusing 
to join the convention. These Arab states argue that because 
Israel is unwilling to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, 
NPT, they cannot sign on to this convention. I do not agree. 
While I share the hope of these countries that the Government of 
Israel will consider joining the non-proliferation treaty, I also 
believe that this chemical weapons convention is serving the 
best interests of peace everywhere and it is a separate matter.
<P>
	Both the chemical weapons convention and the 
non-proliferation treaty are agreements in the best interests of 
all the people and governments of the world. Therefore neither 
should be used as a bargaining chip by governments.
<P>
	Too many times in this world countries abuse international 
instruments of peace and selfishly use them to their own 
advantage. The most ready example of this is the current 
situation in Bosnia with which we are all familiar. Let me review 
what has occurred in Bosnia to illustrate my point.
<P>
	Canadian troops first went to Bosnia over two years ago, 
hoping they could provide assistance and humanitarian relief to 
the people there. They also tried to keep combatants apart and 
facilitate a negotiated peace for the region. Unfortunately these 
laudable goals were not backed up by a UN mandate that could 
get the job done. With no leadership from Ottawa, our 
peacekeepers have been left twisting in the wind.
<P>
	The warring parties in Bosnia have manipulated and abused 
the peacekeepers who were sent there to help them. For 
example, we all know about the ridiculous hostage takings by 
the Bosnian Serbs. This has not happened once or twice but time 
and time again. It is an insult and an outrage to all Canadians.
<P>
	However the problems go deeper than the abuses by the 
Bosnian Serbs. Let me quote from an article in the Toronto <I>Star</I> 
on June 9. It states: ``Canadian peacekeepers were dealt a double 
blow of life threatening harassment yesterday, not from the 
Bosnian Serbs but at the hands of the mainly Muslim Bosnian 
army. In one incident, in a trigger finger stand-off, the Bosnians 
pointed rocket propelled grenades, machine guns and pistols to 
prevent Canadians from reaching and retrieving a bulldozer 
stuck on a remote mountain road.''
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	A second article states that on May 22 Bosnian military police 
supported by Bosnian soldiers ambushed two Canadian UN 
armoured vehicles near Vares. The police demanded that the 
vehicles be opened, a right they do not have. Canadians refused. 
Suddenly a truck moved from behind a building and 15 heavily 
armed men hit the ground. The Bosnian bandits took radios, 
walkmans, personal items, smoke grenades and a number of 
fragmentation grenades.
<P>
	These articles show clearly the kind of abuse I am talking 
about. The Canadian government and the international 
community must work hard to ensure that this kind of ridiculous 
and flagrant abuse will not occur in the future and will not occur 
with the enforcement of the chemical weapons convention.
<P>
	Moving on to the substance of Bill C-87, the Reform Party 
supports this bill although we have a few concerns for which we 
would like assurances. First and foremost, Reform is concerned 
about the cost to the taxpayers and to Canadian industry. While 
we acknowledge that this bill has legitimate costs, according to 
our information the government does not yet know the price tag 
on Bill C-87.
<P>
	We would like the government's assurances that it will spend 
the taxpayers' money with the utmost discretion and that it will 
present the actual costs associated with Bill C-87 to the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs once these become 
available.
<P>
	Reform wants to ensure that the implementation of Bill C-87 
will be as cost effective as possible. For example, the 
government must avoid the creation of a huge new bureaucracy 
to monitor and regulate the Canadian chemical industry.
<P>
	Officials at Foreign Affairs have notified Reform that a full 
time staff of five as a ``national authority'' plus one additional 
staffer at foreign affairs might be needed. The Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs should be mandated to ensure 
that it does not go beyond this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14102"> 14102 </A></B>
<P>
	Since Reform has agreed to move this bill speedily through 
committee we would also like assurances that the government 
will use the inspection powers in Bill C-87 most judiciously and 
cautiously. Reform does not want to see a recurrence of the 
scope of inspection powers granted in Bill C-68. Provided we 
receive this assurance and the government ensures that 
inspectors will treat legitimate Canadian industry with all the 
respect it deserves, then we will be satisfied.
<P>
	Most important, when it comes to the inspection of industry 
the government must take all reasonable steps to ensure their 
privacy. Industries subject to inspection must fully comply with 
the inspectors or be subject to either summary conviction or 
conviction on indictment.
<P>
	Under the more serious category of an indictable offence 
persons would be subject to up to five years in prison and a 
$500,000 fine. In the face of these rather serious Criminal Code 
penalties business people will be compelled to comply with 
inspection requests even if they feel their legitimate rights to 
privacy are being violated.
<P>
	Under paragraphs 14(1)(b) and (c), the inspectors can 
examine:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>. . .any thing in the place being inspected; . . .make copies of any information 
contained in the records, files, papers or electronic information systems kept or 
used in relation to the place being inspected and to remove the copies from the 
place;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Although I know the intent of the legislation merely aims to 
fulfil the obligations of the convention, this wording could be 
interpreted more widely and Reform does not want to see this 
happen. Investigations could be used as fishing expeditions by 
the government to examine companies under a microscope. This 
would be totally unacceptable. The government must guarantee 
that all inspections are required to directly investigate whether 
companies are breaching the chemical weapons convention. 
Fishing expeditions should be specifically prohibited.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Under subclause 15(3) the bill states that search warrants 
would not be required, even if an inspector were refused entry to 
the premises, if there are ``exigent circumstances''. I would like 
to assume this clause is merely precautionary and is not intended 
for regular use. Under all circumstances except an extreme 
emergency, the government should obtain a search warrant 
where entry is refused. As we all know there are not many 
industries in Canada that currently make or use chemical 
weapons, so it seems very unlikely there will be any 
circumstances so pressing that a warrant cannot first be obtained 
before an inspection is conducted.
<P>
	Moving to clause 20 of the bill we find the penalties for 
breaking the convention. I would like to hear from the 
government what exactly this clause means. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every person who contravenes any provision of this act is guilty of an offence 
and liable</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on about either an indictable or a summary conviction. 
I would like to know who would be subject to punishment in a 
large company where there was an offence committed. If a clerk 
made a reporting error through negligence would that employee 
be convicted? Would the owner? Would the board of directors? 
Would the clerk's supervisor? This must be cleared up. I would 
appreciate the government's comments on this.
<P>
	Other than the aforementioned cautions and the suggestions 
for government, I have no doubt Canadians will support the 
intent of Bill C-87. Canada has always been a strong supporter 
of multilateral efforts to promote peace and restrict arms 
proliferation. This is especially true with respect to the 
prohibition of the use of chemical weapons. By asserting 
leadership in this area Canada is standing up for the extension of 
a rules based, multilateral system to defend our interests and 
promote common norms and values with like-minded countries.
<P>
	In conclusion, Reform would like to give its strong support 
for this bill. I am glad the Liberals in this House are not 
imposing closure on C-87 as they seem to be doing with every 
other important bill that goes through this House.
<P>
	Once Bill C-87 is passed we hope the government will make 
its implementation as pain free as possible for industry while 
still upholding Canada's commitment under the chemical 
weapons convention. If it does this I am sure all Canadians will 
for once be proud of something we have accomplished in this 
House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will take 
only a few minutes to speak again to a bill I consider very 
important and which I also had a chance to discuss at the second 
reading stage.
<P>
	I think the importance of this bill cannot be overestimated. Its 
purpose is to implement a convention that was signed by several 
countries. The fact that we are now about to pass this bill bodes 
well for the future, because I am against all kinds of weapons. 
But I am also realistic. I think weapons of all kinds will be 
around for a long time. However, chemical weapons above all 
should be absolutely prohibited because they are cruel and 
inhumane.
<P>
	I hope such weapons will never be used again, but we cannot 
ignore the fact that these weapons are used and have been used in 
the past and that they kill adults and children who are innocent 
of any involvement in wars or conflicts.
<P>
	These weapons could also be used against groups who are 
against a given religion, for instance.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14103"> 14103 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	A whole congregation of Christians, Jews or Muslims can be 
destroyed with these weapons. They are not just used to wage 
war but also to defend all kinds of ideologies and, in the process 
to attack innocent people. That is why today I again want to take 
a few moments to condemn these horrifying weapons.
<P>
	These weapons can make people chronically ill. People are 
attacked physically, and their health may suffer for the rest of 
their lives. They are very dangerous in that respect as well. 
These weapons can also contaminate soil and water, damage the 
health of animals and destroy plants. They have a disastrous 
impact on the environment and human beings.
<P>
	These weapons can also breed further hostility, as the memory 
of the suffering and ill health they caused will linger, possibly 
generating further conflicts in the near future. I think that is why 
it is so important to destroy these chemical weapons as quickly 
as possible and thus prevent recurring conflicts between peoples 
and nations.
<P>
	Bill C-87 says we must prohibit the stockpiling, sale and 
production of these chemical weapons, and I certainly agree 
with this bill. I hope that the agency responsible for enforcing 
the provisions of this convention will take all necessary steps to 
do so using diplomacy and also bringing trade pressures to bear 
on countries that do not comply with the convention or refuse to 
sign the convention. They should be punished by means of trade 
sanctions, and the agency should use diplomacy to ensure they 
ratify or comply with the convention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise on behalf of the 
people of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to speak on Bill 
C-87, the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act.
<P>
	The chemical weapons convention is an extremely important 
treaty for the international community and has special 
significance for Canadians. It was just over 80 years ago in April 
1915 that Canadians were one of the first victims to experience 
the gas of the Ypres salient. It was only three years ago that 
allied soldiers in the Persian Gulf had to face the threat of Iraq 
using chemical weapons in defiance of the international 
community.
<P>
	Ever since chemical weapons were used on that fateful day in 
1915 the international community has tried to come up with an 
effective treaty to contain and eliminate the use and stockpiling 
of these weapons of mass destruction.
<P>
	The first attempt to control chemical weapons was the Geneva 
protocol of 1925. Sadly the Geneva protocol was as fatally 
flawed as the many nuclear weapons treaties of the 1970s and 
1980s.
<P>
	It was an agreement to ban the first use of chemical weapons 
only. It failed to limit or control the manufacturing of these 
weapons and many nations felt obliged to manufacture and 
stockpile chemical weapons for retaliatory purposes if attacked 
first.
<P>
	The quest to ban chemical weapons outright continued and I 
am proud to say that Canada played a major role in the 
negotiations that resulted in the chemical weapons convention, 
the first multilateral weapons treaty to ban a whole category of 
weapons of mass destruction.
<P>
	This treaty could not have come at a better time. As I 
mentioned earlier, at least one state has used or threatened to use 
chemical weapons on its neighbours and on its own people. In 
Japan a religious cult is currently under investigation for its role 
in placing deadly chemical agents in the Tokyo subway system 
killing scores of innocent civilians. This treaty I believe is a 
significant step forward in reducing such threats to the 
international community.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Since the chemical weapons convention was open for 
signature in Paris in 1993 it has been signed by almost 160 
countries and will be ratified after 65 nations enact it. Canada 
will be one of the first.
<P>
	This is significant in itself. However what really makes the 
chemical weapons convention a major success is the substance 
in the treaty. The convention obliges all states parties that 
manufacture and stockpile chemical weapons to destroy all 
stocks and manufacturing facilities within a set timeframe. This 
is accomplished under the close scrutiny of international 
inspections, effectively banning the future development and 
stockpiling of these weapons. The system of verification and 
inspection is the most rigorous to ever be imposed in a 
multilateral agreement.
<P>
	Of major significance is the safeguard this convention has 
against the clandestine manufacturing and stockpiling of 
chemical weapons through international monitoring and 
inspection of all such facilities that could be used for that 
purpose.
<P>
	The convention does not stop there. It also extends 
international monitoring into the global civilian chemical 
industry. To facilitate the international monitoring of civilian 
chemical industries, three schedules of toxic chemicals which 
have been used as chemical weapons or are known as chemical 
weapons precursors have been drawn up.
<P>
	Schedule 1 chemicals are known as chemical weapons. These 
include chemicals such as sarin, which was used by terrorists in 
Japan, and mustard gas which Canadians faced in the trenches in 
World War I. These are not widely available in Canada aside 
from applications in some research facilities. Under Bill C-87 
these research facilities will be required to obtain a licence and 
undergo two annual inspections.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14104"> 14104 </A></B>
<P>
	Schedule 2 chemicals are more widely available in Canada. 
Many chemicals in this schedule have numerous commercial 
applications but can be directly used to produce chemical 
weapons. Manufacturers of Schedule 2 items will have to 
undergo two annual inspections if their production exceeds a 
listed threshold.
<P>
	Chemicals listed on these two schedules will be banned for 
export to nations not party to this convention.
<P>
	Finally schedule 3 chemicals are widely manufactured and 
used in Canada. These chemicals could be used as chemical 
weapons if present in large enough quantities. Companies 
manufacturing these chemicals will be eligible for occasional 
inspections.
<P>
	Industries that work with the chemicals outlined in the three 
schedules will have to report on their own activities to their 
governments which will in turn disclose this information to the 
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. A group 
of international inspectors will have the authority to inspect any 
facility it deems necessary. In addition to the scheduled 
chemicals, the convention also provides for an overview of 
facilities which produce discrete organic chemicals that could 
be adapted to produce chemical weapons.
<P>
	These producers of pesticides, fertilizers, paints, textiles and 
lubricants will be subject to report on their production activities 
and will be required to allow random inspections of their 
facilities.
<P>
	This convention will also ensure that all states parties will 
abide by the convention.
<P>
	A provision in the convention allows any states party to have 
the right to demand a challenge inspection or no right of refusal 
inspections of the facility it believes is not acting in accordance 
with the convention. In addition, states not signing the 
convention will find themselves affected. States parties will 
have restrictions on the export and import of scheduled 
chemicals with states not party to the convention.
<P>
	While the substance of this convention is important and I hope 
it will assist in making the international community a safer 
place, I have two concerns I would like to raise for members' 
consideration.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	First the convention is going to be expensive to implement. It 
can cost up to 10 times as much to destroy chemical weapons 
and their manufacturing facilities as it did to initially 
manufacture them.
<P>
	While the cost in this regard to Canada will be minimal due to 
the fact that we do not stockpile or have manufacturing facilities 
for schedule 1 chemicals, less developed nations are going to 
have difficulty destroying their arsenals. Take Russia, for 
example. Russia has 40,000 to 60,000 tonnes of chemical 
weapons to destroy. This will cost billions of dollars that Russia 
does not have. International inspectors will have to be diligent 
to ensure that states like Russia are not taking shortcuts to 
dispose of their arsenals.
<P>
	At the same time, Canada must take care not to be dragged 
into paying other nations' destruction expenses given our own 
financial circumstances.
<P>
	Second the international community, Canada included, must 
not be under any illusion that this convention will result in the 
absolute elimination of the threat of chemical warfare. While 
important, this convention is only one step in that process. Its 
true success is to reduce the threat only. It must be remembered 
that a number of states will not sign nor adhere to the 
convention. These states, which will remain unnamed, can still 
stockpile, produce or obtain, through the black market, weapons 
of mass destruction, including chemical weapons. In addition, 
terrorists will still pursue chemical weapons as a means to fulfil 
their goals.
<P>
	While the convention may assist the international community 
in preventing these states or terrorists groups from acquiring 
these weapons, it does not guarantee that they will succeed. It 
must also be remembered that states that will destroy their 
stockpiles also have the knowledge to produce these deadly 
agents again if that international community changes.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by stating that this convention, while 
a contribution to international security, does not mean that we 
should lower our defences. Canada must remain vigilant in 
maintaining a strong and well armed military capability of 
engaging in combat in a variety of theatres, including the 
chemical weapons theatre.
<P>
	We must recognize that rogue states and terrorists will try to 
obtain or produce these chemical weapons. We must keep a 
watchful eye on those intent on this destruction.
<P>
	The Reform Party therefore supports the intent and the spirit 
of Bill C-67.

was good of you to tell me that my private member's bill 
tomorrow night will be at a rather late hour. I am sure the 
audience will be enraptured.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-87, an 
act to implement the convention on the prohibition of the 
development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical 
weapons and on their destruction. It is the enabling legislation 
for the chemical weapons convention which Canada signed in 
1993.
<P>
	This convention prohibits the production and use of chemical 
weapons and provides for the regulation of certain chemicals 
which can readily be turned into chemical weapons. The 
convention is the result of over 20 years of negotiations.
<P>
	The international community has been trying to outlaw 
chemical weapons and their use for over 100 years. This is the 
first time the whole category of weapons of mass destruction is 
to be eliminated.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Under international supervision all stockpiles of chemical 
weapons will be destroyed along with the facilities that produce 
them. This convention also enables a system of international 
supervision and inspection which will work to ensure such 
weapons will not be developed again. Under the terms of this 
convention, state parties are obliged to pass legislation that not 
only encompasses activities on their own territory but also 
prohibits their citizens from undertaking prohibited activities 
outside their area. States that own chemical weapons will have 
10 years to destroy the weapons and production facilities.
<P>
	Twenty-eight countries have ratified the convention to date 
and 65 countries will need to ratify the convention before it 
comes into effect. Canada will be among the first 65 countries 
out of approximately 132. The chemical weapons convention 
will take effect 180 days after the 65th state ratifies the 
agreement and tables it.
<P>
	It is unfortunate to note however that the United States and 
Russia, the two countries that have the largest stockpiles of 
chemical weapons, have yet to sign on. Also, several middle 
eastern countries such as Iraq and Libya as well as North Korea 
have refused to participate because Israel will not join the 
nuclear non-proliferation treaty. This is of great concern given 
the recent use of chemical weapons in the gulf war by Iraq and 
more recently the use of chemical weapons to commit genocide 
within Iraq against the Kurds.
<P>
	Chemical weapons continue to be a threat to world security. 
The need for international agreements to remove these weapons 
of massive destruction is very critical indeed. Chemical 
weapons are not only a threat to troops in times of war but also to 
civilians at all times. Only a few weeks ago we witnessed with 
horror how chemical weapons were tragically unleashed on 
unsuspecting Tokyo commuters. Shortly afterward,  stockpiles 
of sarin, one of the chemicals scheduled in this bill, were found 
in Japan.
<P>
	This convention may not prevent individual incidents of 
chemical weapons attacks. However, the implementation of the 
act will make it more difficult for such weapons to be created. In 
this way it may deter future incidents.
<P>
	Eighty years ago, on August 15, 1915, Canadian soldiers were 
the first to be subjected to a systematic gas attack in the trenches 
in Belgium. On that day Canadian soldiers choked and fell to the 
ground writhing from chlorine and mustard gas released by the 
Germans. Many Canadians died that day and many would suffer 
lifelong ailments as a result of being gassed. My grandfather 
was among those to be gassed during the great war and he 
carried the scars for the rest of his life.
<P>
	Mustard gas was one of the most effective gases used during 
the first world war. When the vapour touched the skin it 
immediately caused huge blisters, then blindness and when 
inhaled, the gas blistered the lungs resulting in death. Only 
recently the Kurds suffered this same fate from mustard gas.
<P>
	Canadians are fortunate to live in a country that does not 
possess chemical weapons or have chemical weapons 
production facilities. Provisions in the treaty related to chemical 
weapons or chemical weapon production facilities therefore do 
not apply to Canada except in the area of trade. The main impact 
of this convention on Canada comes from provisions relating to 
industrial activity contained in the three schedules of this bill.
<P>
	I was going to briefly outline these schedules but I will bypass 
this section. My colleague outlined the schedules in his speech 
which will be recorded in <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports this bill. Canada has always been a 
strong supporter of multilateral efforts to promote peace and 
restrict arms proliferation, especially with the prohibition of the 
use of chemical weapons. Canada's participation in this treaty 
will encourage other non-participating countries to hopefully 
follow suit.
<P>
	A few issues need to be addressed by government before the 
legislation is implemented. For example, although the 
government has been consulting with industry for years on this 
topic, the government still cannot provide any figures regarding 
the cost of implementing this bill. It is difficult to determine 
exactly what the government is proposing to do without seeing 
these figures.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The government has also not been able to provide any specific 
details regarding the exact size of the new bureaucracy which 
will be associated with the implementation of the legislation. 
Canadians need to know the size of the bureaucracy and exactly 
what is being proposed. It would be useful if the government 
would supply these items before tabling bills rather than 
expecting Canadians to simply sign a blank cheque.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14106"> 14106 </A></B>
<P>
	Members opposite mentioned on second reading that the 
legislation represents the most balanced and cost effective 
means of implementing the convention. However, those 
statements are meaningless because we simply cannot assess the 
legislation without first looking at the figures. It is important 
that we not create another huge level of bureaucracy. Officials at 
foreign affairs said that it may take as few as five or six staff, and 
this sounds reasonable.
<P>
	There are also problems with section 15(3) which need to be 
worked out. This section states that exigent circumstances 
would make it unnecessary to obtain a search warrant when an 
inspector is refused entry. We need to clarify what is meant by 
exigent circumstances in the bill. As it stands, this could be open 
to very broad interpretation and may infringe on the rights and 
liberties of individuals if a definition is not clearly provided.
<P>
	There are also problems with section 20 which states that 
every person who contravenes any provision of the act is guilty 
of an offence. That sounds like a presumption of guilt and given 
this presumption the implications in section 23 are far too broad.
<P>
	It also states that where a person has been convicted of an 
offence under the act, anything seized by means of which, or in 
respect of which the offence was committed, is forfeited to Her 
Majesty in right of Canada and shall be disposed of as the 
minister sees fit. The provisions for confiscation are 
particularly open ended and it is unclear what is meant by them. 
Is the minister taking liberties to confiscate possessions, 
property, illegal chemicals or is he merely gathering evidence 
needed for a trial? I am concerned about these areas and we need 
some clarification.
<P>
	We must ensure that individual rights and liberties are 
protected when we set out powers of inspection. Sections 13(c), 
14(b) and 14(c) warrant close examination and careful 
clarification before they are set into law. Protection to ensure 
that authority for inspection is not abused must be included in 
the bill.
<P>
	There are also questions about who will pay for the costs of 
the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. This 
large worldwide organization will have up to 1,000 staff and will 
operate with an annual budget of $150 million to $180 million. 
Members will also have to contribute to international inspection 
expenses and costs of elimination of chemical weapons and 
facilities.
<P>
	It is unclear where these overall costs will come from and how 
much Canada will have to commit to. It is important that given 
our current fiscal situation Canada not be too generous in its 
contributions. We must be frugal because we just do not have the 
money.
<P>
	There are several areas of concern in the bill which must be 
addressed before it becomes law. However, Canada's 
participation in the convention should and will be absolute. 
Despite the need for clarification in the bill, I am pleased to say 
that I agree with its spirit and intent and I am pleased to support 
the bill before the House today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to make a 
personal note with respect to the remark made regarding private 
member's Motion No. M-425 tomorrow evening being from 
11.30 p.m. to 12.30 a.m. Of course that would be prime time in 
Comox-Alberni.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to this much needed bill. I am also pleased to 
hear about the treaty and the signing of it. The legislation is a 
real motherhood and maple syrup issue. No one can disagree 
that chemical weapons are a danger to our planet Earth and must 
be controlled.
<P>
	Once again the government has shown its failure to 
understand the situation. The government is not proposing 
banning chemical weapons because it is the right thing to do, it 
is proposing to rush the legislation through for political reasons. 
Canadians should not confuse the government's intentions in the 
process the bill is receiving. This government wants passage of 
this bill because if Canada is one of the first 65 governments to 
ratify the convention the government will receive political 
favours.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Just as this government has told Canadians that the firearm 
control bill was for public safety and the sentencing bill was a 
deterrence on crime, this government will tell Canadians this 
bill makes the world a safer place. Just as Bill C-68 was not 
about public safety and Bill C-41 was not about a deterrence for 
criminals, this bill is not about world safety in the eyes of 
government. This bill is about giving this government bragging 
rights.
<P>
	Recent events have shown that chemical weapons are 
becoming the weapons of choice among terrorists. The sarin 
attack in Japan has shown that terrorists can do the maximum 
physical and psychological damage at low cost. The attacks on 
Kurds in Iraq have shown that civilian populations are at the 
mercy of those who control chemical weapons.
<P>
	We on this side totally agree that measures must be put into 
place to monitor and detect those who could easily obtain 
chemicals to spread terror. Canadians must understand this bill 
will not guarantee that terrorists cannot obtain, combine and 
release certain chemicals upon an unsuspecting public. This bill 
only approves monitoring of certain chemicals that could be 
dangerous, just as Bill C-68 only monitors law-abiding 
firearms owners.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14107"> 14107 </A></B>
<P>
	Just as Bill C-68 cannot prevent criminals from using 
illegally obtained firearms to wreak havoc upon Canadians, this 
bill will not prevent determined terrorists from illegally 
obtaining the chemicals they need. The justice minister 
continually told Canadians that the gun legislation was 
necessary for public safety but later admitted no legislation 
could prevent those criminals truly wishing to use an illegal 
firearm from using one in the commission of a crime. Let us not 
hear any talk from those opposite that this bill will make public 
safety certain. This bill will not do that.
<P>
	What could have prevented those wishing to use chemicals as 
a weapon is tougher sentencing. Unfortunately the justice 
minister did not do that in this bill or in Bill C-41. Instead of 
sending a message to terrorists and would-be criminals that 
Canada will take a tough stand to stop the use of chemical 
weapons by imposing severe sentences on dangerous criminals 
who consider this, the government offered alternative measures 
in Bill C-41 and no measures in this bill.
<P>
	We on this side of the House readily admit and know one 
important fact that the government either cannot or will not 
admit. We know there are criminals who cannot be treated or 
rehabilitated. These criminals are the kind who would use 
chemical weapons. Those are the individuals who require severe 
sentences up to and including life in prison. Life in prison for 
those opposite means life: no review, no conditional release, no 
end of sentence release. Life means incarceration until the 
criminal is no longer able to threaten Canadians. It means the 
criminal never returns to society.
<P>
	The government had the opportunity in Bill C-41 to enhance 
this legislation by including severe sentencing. The government 
instead rushed this bill through the House to enhance its 
reputation rather than to send a message to criminals in this bill 
or in Bill C-41.
<P>
	Instead we get legislation that makes it a severe crime to 
discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation but no increased 
sentencing for those who use chemical weapons upon helpless 
victims. This government always puts legislation together that 
promises more than it delivers. Just as the government would 
tell Canadians this bill is to enhance public safety, the real 
reason for this bill is so some of those opposite can bask in the 
limelight of world opinion.
<P>
	If this government wanted to deter the use of chemical 
weapons, it could have and should have included sections in this 
bill to change the Criminal Code, to put in punishing long 
sentences for anyone dealing with or using chemical weapons. 
This government states it is bound by international obligations 
to include punitive criminal sentences in Bill C-7, an act 
respecting the control of certain drugs introduced by the 
Minister of Health.
<P>
	This government states international obligations obligate it to 
pass this legislation. I do not see any punitive sentencing 
measures in this bill. As I said, the bill is the right thing to do but 
the reason the government is doing it may not be so.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Instead of introducing legislation for public safety and the 
public good, the government is introducing the legislation for its 
individual praise from the world community.
<P>
	If the government wanted to send the message that the use of 
chemical weapons will not be tolerated instead of simply 
pushing an inspection bill through the House to gain personal 
glory, it should have included measures that will deter criminals 
from even thinking about using chemical weapons.
<P>
	If the government can increase sentences for users of soft 
drugs it can increase sentences for users of dangerous chemicals 
weapons, but it has not. I will support this inspection bill even 
though it has no measures that deter criminals. The government 
has failed in that respect.
<P>
	The government joins the United States in the failed attempt 
of its war on drugs by removing civil liberties by allowing 
inspectors to read medical files of Canadians. It increased jail 
sentences for casual soft drug users because the United States 
told it so. The government will not legislate increased sentences 
for the use of chemical weapons.
<P>
	Half measures and dreams of glory on the international stage 
fuel the government's desire to rush the bill. Perhaps now that 
the voters of Ontario have chosen Reform principles of justice 
the government may change its bleeding heart ways not because 
it is the right thing to do, not because it may lose votes if it does 
not; it will do it because it is the right thing to do. It is too bad the 
government once again chose the wrong reasons.
<P>
	We fully support the bill as an initial step in deterring the 
crime of the use of chemical weapons of any nature.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak this afternoon if 
for no other reason than the temperature in the Chamber is 
bearable.
<P>
	It is an honour to speak on third reading of Bill C-87, an act to 
implement the prohibition of the production and use of chemical 
weapons. I join most members of the world community in 
abhorring the use of chemical weapons.
<P>
	This proposed legislation takes into account many concerns 
and tries to establish a compromising balance between these 
concerns. It acknowledges the devastation caused by the 
horrendous use of chemical weaponry as well as the ongoing 
studies and testing of these substances for future development.
<P>
	The convention modernizes the 1925 Geneva protocol which 
was an international attempt to limit the use of chemical 
weapons after the first world war. This protocol was brought to 
present day standards by having observed past experiences and 
having learned from them. We now realize that putting a ban 
solely on the use of chemical  weapons left many areas open and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14108"> 14108 </A></B>
<P>
allowed the stockpiling of such weapons but closed the doors for 
use and further study.
<P>
	Bill C-87 is the act to implement the more recent convention 
of 1993 and realizes there are many uses of chemicals and 
outlines both the positive and negative aspects. The 1993 
convention ensured states would not stockpile chemical 
weaponry for retaliation against future attacks or to instigate 
war. If they did they would face the condemnation of the world 
and sanctions as well.
<P>
	Canada has always been among the first to initiate peace. In 
1983 Canada made large contributions to the committee that 
developed and outlined a treaty on disarmament leading to the 
conclusion of discussions in 1992 when Canada was urging a 
ban on all warfare to be accepted internationally. There is now 
such a ban on the use of chemical weapons which caused such 
brutality. It is this ban we are discussing in the House today.
<P>
	The convention involves not only those who engage in war but 
also those industries using chemical substances in their 
production and testing. This is where Canada assumes its role in 
the convention.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada will primarily be enforcing the legislation when it 
comes to the importing and exporting of chemicals listed in the 
three schedules. Canada does not own chemical weapons nor do 
we contain any manufacturing facilities that do so. Therefore 
our role in implementing the convention is fortunately not very 
complex.
<P>
	In 1915 Canadian soldiers were victims of the first gas attack 
during World War I. The 1925 Geneva protocol had a certain 
amount of control on the use of these weapons but was not able 
to completely rid their usage.
<P>
	Recently we have seen chemical weapons used in the 
Iran-Iraq war, in Japan and by Iraq against its own civilian 
Kurdish peoples, among others. This convention, which will be 
headed by the organization for the prohibition of conventional 
weapons, will enforce legislation in all the signatory countries 
prohibiting chemical weapon usage and will hopefully have the 
international support and pressure to impose greater sanctions 
against those contravening these policies.
<P>
	Areas of legislation included in today's convention include 
verification policies, creation of an organization to implement 
them, specific guidelines with regard to levels of chemical 
ability as well as processes for destroying weapons and their 
plants.
<P>
	The verification regime, which is global, is to ensure these 
weapons of mass destruction will never be developed again. The 
international monitoring system will safeguard against weapon 
production by inspecting all facilities which are or were used for 
these purposes. This system does not affect Canada as there are 
no facilities here. This verification process will also be extended 
into other chemical industries.
<P>
	Three schedules are to be used in ensuring no chemical 
weapons are or can be manufactured. Industries using such 
chemicals will be required to report annually and each 
government of the signatory countries will be required to report 
to the international organization, the OPCW.
<P>
	In Canada the Minister of Foreign Affairs will designate 
officials who will act as Canada's national authorities. Canadian 
officials will collect information from Canadian industries and 
transmit it to the OPCW for inspecting purposes. However 
international inspection teams have the right to conduct 
inspections without warrant in accordance with the provisions 
of this convention. It contains appropriate provisions for 
inspection and keeps them in accordance with the need to 
protect privacy.
<P>
	As will be a requirement of other countries, Canada will enact 
legislation in the Criminal Code providing penalties, fines and 
imprisonment for warlike use or production of chemicals. 
Legislation will protect but keep a close eye on usage of these 
chemicals for medicinal purposes as well as for pesticides, 
fertilizers, paints, textiles and lubricants.
<P>
	The convention will also require state organizations to 
enforce restrictions on the export and import of schedule 
chemicals with states that have not signed the convention. All 
chemicals on the list will therefore be subject to the Import and 
Export Permits Act. Although there are restrictions which will 
be imposed on exports to suspect states, the legislation has 
balanced these restrictions with the desire to liberalize trade for 
industries and medicinal purposes.
<P>
	The schedules which will be used in identifying chemical 
legality are in three groups. The first contains chemicals such as 
mustard gas. Some other chemicals in this same group are used 
in pharmaceuticals and in cancer research. Schedule 2 consists 
of chemicals which are precursors to schedule 1, chemical 
weapons. Schedule 3 contains the least powerful of the three 
groups, often used in industry but can also be used as weapons 
when in large quantities.
<P>
	Each group will be under scrutiny, whether it be checks and 
balances, limited amounts permissible or whether they must 
obtain a licence and pay a fee to use them.
<P>
	Under international supervision all stockpiles and producing 
facilities of chemical weapons will be destroyed within a given 
time frame. Given this, the legislation will have to consider 
economic implications. There will be a 10-year limit for states 
to destroy their stockpiles and facilities. However a 10-year 
extension is also allowed which has stricter controls. I have a 
problem with this 10-year extension because if we continue to 
allow extensions on the destruction of these facilities we are 
allowing them to remain for greater use.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14109"> 14109 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform Party supports Bill C-87 and would like to see it 
implemented immediately. Canada has always been a strong 
supporter of multilateral efforts to promote peace and restrict 
arms proliferation.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	By accepting the convention on the prohibition of the 
development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical 
weapons and eventually on their destruction Canada is 
promoting common norms and values with like minded 
countries.
<P>
	Reform acknowledges the government has consulted for 
many years on this topic but still does not know how much it will 
cost to implement nor the exact size of the bureaucracy to be 
created. Foreign affairs has speculated a full time staff of five as 
a national authority plus one staffer at foreign affairs might be 
needed. We would like to make sure the bureaucracy does not 
expand beyond this.
<P>
	Section 15(3) states exigent circumstances would make it 
unnecessary to obtain a search warrant when an inspector is 
refused entry. This should be clarified. The wording in section 
20 also seems too broad. Section 23 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where a person has been convicted of an offence under this act, any thing 
seized by means of which or in respect of which the offence was committed is 
forfeited to Her Majesty in right of Canada and shall be disposed of as the 
minister directs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Exactly what could be confiscated under this provision is 
unclear. The powers of inspection should not be allowed to get 
out of control. Reform does support this legislation and hopes 
there will be some accountability in its enforcement to see it is 
not used unnecessarily.

IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from May 29 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-88, an act to implement the agreement on internal 
trade, be read the second time and referred to a committee; and 
of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to debate Bill C-88, a bill to implement the 
internal trade agreement signed last July by the various 
participants.
<P>
	Last July the Prime Minister and the premiers came together 
in Ottawa to announce an agreement had been reached to break 
down the barriers of internal trade between provinces.
<P>
	Canadians were hopeful that at last barriers would come down 
and they would have free access to goods and services, jobs and 
the competitive marketplace because the trade barriers between 
provinces would be broken down.
<P>
	The agreement reached was said to be an important part of the 
Liberal promise to build an innovative economy within which 
all Canadians would benefit. It was touted as a vision for the 
future and it reflected well on the premiers and the Prime 
Minister. Canadians were happy.
<P>
	Today, almost a year later, the euphoria has died and 
Canadians are questioning the vision they saw one year ago. 
Last July the premiers and the Prime Minister held up the 
internal trade agreement as a reflection of unity but Quebecers 
did not see it that way. They responded by electing a PQ 
government in their province. The premiers and the Prime 
Minister held up the agreement saying: ``This is what we can do 
for one another''. The then premier of Quebec was defeated in 
the subsequent election.
<P>
	They said the agreement was a reflection of growth, but the 
inadequacy inherent in maintaining the status quo saw little job 
creation. Within the last five months job creation has dwindled 
to practically nothing.
<P>
	Last July the premiers and the Prime Minister held up the 
internal trade agreement as a reflection of stability, but months 
later Moody's bond rating service put Canada on the alert then 
downgraded our credit rating because our debtload remained too 
high.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	Today this House is being asked to ignore those undercurrents 
and put that internal trade agreement into practice by passing 
Bill C-88. The Reform Party of Canada cannot do this. We 
cannot support an agreement that so blatantly ignores the 
necessity to pull this country away from the edge of permanent 
economic instability. We came to Ottawa to prevent that. We 
came to champion the right of Canadians to a balanced budget, 
to deficit reduction, to more effective government, to a 
productive and stable economy and to national unity.
<P>
	Despite the rhetoric that flies across this room every day, we 
have made every effort to keep that promise. By challenging this 
bill we remain true to that mandate given to us by our 
constituents who have asked again and again for freedom from 
internal trade barriers.
<P>
	By not supporting this bill we know we run the risk of being 
accused of not supporting free trade in Canada. I ask Canadians 
to recognize that kind of accusation is a political move and not 
the truth.
<P>
	Let us make it absolutely clear this afternoon that the Reform 
Party of Canada is committed to the removal of interprovincial 
barriers to trade through agreements among the provinces but 
we will not support any so-called agreement under the guise of 
freer internal trade when that agreement does not achieve this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14110"> 14110 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform Party cannot support any internal trade 
agreement that does not once and for all recognize that the 
barriers to internal trade in this country are killing our 
marketplace. Higher taxes, a higher cost of living and an 
uncompetitive marketplace create a heavy and unnecessary 
burden on Canadians and guarantee the deterioration of our 
economy.
<P>
	Bill C-88 I subdmit is a disguise for a non-agreement which 
purports to improve internal trade in Canada and improve our 
economic stability but does neither.
<P>
	The Liberal government won an election on a promise to build 
a better Canada, to get Canadians employed and to ensure a 
stabilized economy. If this government truly seeks 
revitalization then it must admit that this agreement fails to keep 
that promise because it fails to eliminate internal trade barriers 
in this country.
<P>
	I would like to believe that the government is committed to 
the future of this country but I cannot as long as politically 
motivated agreements like this one are held up as agreements. 
Canadians are looking for strong leadership, not the kind of 
leadership that is acted out every night on television, but real 
leadership, the kind that works hard behind the scenes at 
achieving what is best for our country. For months we were led 
to believe that this was happening and last July we had hoped to 
see the effects, but it did not materialize. What we witnessed 
was a photo opportunity and nothing more.
<P>
	Canadians did not see progress. The government did not 
realize our goals. It did not put our economy on a better footing 
and Canadians continue to pay the price.
<P>
	Some may think it is easy for me to stand or to sit on this side 
of the House and criticize the government for failing to produce 
an effective agreement. I am well aware of the difficulties 
involved in negotiating with many different parties. I know it is 
important to ensure fairness and the democratic process and that 
these be observed and to avoid dictating what is best. However 
when the stakes are high, when the best interests of the nation lie 
at the mercy of the government leaders, then I know that the time 
has come and the place has been arranged for strong and 
courageous leadership.
<P>
	If I have one criticism this afternoon it is that the Liberal 
government failed to provide the necessary leadership. In an 
effort to avoid creating enemies it opened up a nothing lost, 
nothing gained, be happy approach. What we got was nothing 
gained and almost everything lost.
<P>
	This country is threatening to break apart. Canadians no 
longer have that sense of unity they should have. Now more than 
ever we need leadership that will bring us together at every 
possible opportunity. Failure to bring about a good internal trade 
agreement only serves to enforce our differences, create more 
barriers and reveal a lack of confidence in ourselves.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	The internal trade agreement was a failure. The blame must 
lie squarely and we must lay it squarely on the federal 
government. I believe the government failed in its mandate to 
first and foremost preserve the country. The government not 
only had an obligation to the future of the country to see that this 
happened, it had a vision to carry out, a vision that was created 
many years ago when the nation was first born.
<P>
	In 1867 Canadian leaders saw fit to entrench within the 
Constitution these wise words: ``All articles of the growth, 
produce or manufacture of any one of the provinces shall, from 
and after the union, be admitted free into each of the other 
provinces''. That is section 121 of the Constitution Act. In that 
section there was an agreement that was a true reflection of unity 
and a commitment to growth and stability.
<P>
	Perhaps in those days it was easier to recognize the danger. In 
those days, in our bid to resist American pressures and maintain 
a distinct culture, we could see that strengthening our internal 
economic ties would be the foundation of our identity and our 
unity. In the Constitution was laid the reflection of courage and 
co-operation, of government doing what was right and fair for 
the Canadian people and an example of strong leadership.
<P>
	Today we face a greater danger. It is a danger because we 
failed to recognize it ourselves. We are spurred on by 
protectionist attitudes that really serve no one. We have reached 
a critical point and it is time for strong leadership to prevail.
<P>
	We are a big country, a beautiful country. We have a small 
population. We are a wealthy country. However we are not an 
economic power in the world. We are a vast land of people with 
different orientations. That is our identity. However we have 
lost sight of the common ground: our economic alliance, one 
with another.
<P>
	In 1867 the leaders of the day recognized the need for 
leadership and an economic alliance. They added section 91, 
which declared that the exclusive legislative authority of the 
Parliament of Canada extends to the regulation of trade and 
commerce, the very essence of what we are talking about in Bill 
C-88 and the internal trade agreement.
<P>
	The Constitution recognizes that government leadership must 
begin by assuring economic stability to ensure the survival and 
unity of our country. That is why the Reform Party of Canada has 
made it the foundation of its mandate and why every day in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14111"> 14111 </A></B>
<P>
House we fight for economic stability. It is why we debate the 
bill and  why we cannot support it, because the government has 
failed to see the urgency in removing internal trade barriers for 
the good of the economy and has failed to reaffirm the objectives 
of section 121 of the Constitution, the free flow of articles of 
growth, produce and manufacture.
<P>
	By ignoring the precedent of section 121 of the Constitution 
the successive governments of the country have assured an 
atmosphere of protectionism, disunity and almost certainly 
economic vulnerability. That is why this agreement and this bill 
fall short.
<P>
	My colleagues have stood during this debate and pointed out a 
number of deficiencies inherent in the agreement and in the bill. 
One emotion that has prevailed throughout is frustration. Their 
frustration comes from not being able to say Canada is a nation 
of free trade. Many are embarrassed to acknowledge that there is 
freer trade north and south between Canada and the United 
States than there is east and west among the provinces and 
territories of Canada. They are frustrated, as are all Canadians, 
because they can see the way toward economic rejuvenation 
being thwarted. They can see the opportunities that exist for 
them in their ridings and in their home industries if those 
barriers are removed, as local industries are given a fair and 
competitive chance to become national industries. They are 
frustrated because they must answer the difficult questions of 
constituents who want to know why their industries are not 
doing better and why those industries are laying off people in 
times when the government purports that jobs are being created.
<P>
	If this nation would commit to breaking down internal trade 
barriers Canadian industries would flourish. Entrepreneurs 
would find a reason to create innovation. Investors would find a 
reason to support the innovation and innovation would build the 
economy.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Once we have created an innovative economy internally we 
will be poised to enter into the global marketplace and we will 
succeed there. In the process, we will have obtained many 
things: a strong economy and more importantly pride in 
ourselves and confidence in our abilities.
<P>
	Canada has the potential to be more than just a collection of 
small protected markets, but governments must implement the 
means that will change what currently exists. I believe 
Canadians deserve that chance. Canadians deserve the rewards 
of an open market, job mobility and economic stability, not the 
provincial protectionism that creates high taxes, low 
productivity and unemployment. This agreement will not 
provide those rewards and this bill will not implement an 
agreement that will provide them.
<P>
	It is time to stop hiding behind regional development 
schemes, equalization payments and cost sharing agreements. It 
is time the inefficient government policies were thrown away 
rather than contributing to the  financial burden on Canadian 
taxpayers. It is time the provinces stopped working on the false 
premise that exclusivity will protect their own markets. It is 
time the inherently weak marketplace created by protectionist 
policies gave way to vital marketplaces, strong, self-sufficient 
industries and real job creation.
<P>
	The bond markets have made it clear that we can no longer 
continue the premise of borrowing more and more and creating a 
perpetual debt. The demise of our economy will not come some 
day, it will come soon because we have failed to act as a nation 
and correct the wrongs that pull us down. It is time to revive our 
nationality so we can say we have our wealth in common not our 
debt.
<P>
	It is time for strong leadership to set in motion the process of 
eliminating internal trade barriers. The strong leadership we 
want will pull together the commitment of governments at all 
levels, business, labour and taxpayers, all the contributors. 
Together we can build a common market, establish compatible 
standards of licensing, certification, education and create the 
mobility and open markets that will become the fertile ground 
for new industries and generate innovation.
<P>
	It is time to shut out the protectionists, the naysayers and 
weak leadership, the businesses built on protectionism provided 
by internal trade barriers and the governments with poor, 
ineffective policies which cost the taxpayers. Those things 
should be stopped.
<P>
	The plan has been laid out for us. In 1992 the committee of 
ministers for internal trade adopted these guiding principles, 
which we should note carefully: one, that governments treat 
people, goods, services and capital equally irrespective of where 
they originate in Canada; two, that governments reconcile 
standards and regulations to provide for the free movement of 
people, goods, services and capital within Canada; three, that 
governments ensure that their administrative policies operate to 
provide for the free movement of people, goods, services and 
capital within Canada.
<P>
	Those are strong, good, solid principles. These were the 
guiding principles necessary to ensure a successful agreement 
but they were not implemented. It is time for this government to 
show leadership that is necessary to enact these principles.
<P>
	I say to the Liberal government, tear up Bill C-88, go back to 
the bargaining table, apply the principles of the CMIT and the 
spirit of the Constitution and build something meaningful, 
something we can support. Fashion an agreement that will build 
trust among the provinces and give them the courage to break 
down the barriers. Let us do what is right for Canadians and 
rebuild trust in our democratic process. Let us acknowledge 
Canadians' right to economic unity and their desire to declare 
their sovereignty.
<P>
	Canadians will not be served well should this bill pass. It does 
not reflect the government's commitment to building an 
innovative economy, except for one  exception which is the 
deletion of part III of the vehicle and transportation act. This 
particular section within the proposed bill is the only section 
that was not part of the internal agreement negotiated a year ago. 
It is also the only provision in this act that does in fact put into 
practice the provisions of sections 121 and 91 of the 
Constitution Act. Other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14112"> 14112 </A></B>
<P>
than that this bill does not reflect the process which begins on 
the right footing.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	It does not reflect a country built on the principles of freedom, 
democracy and unity. In fact it goes beyond that. There is a 
provision within the bill which allows the governor in council 
under certain conditions to amend and to suspend application of 
any provision legal or otherwise of another province or 
department.
<P>
	It is unpardonable to think that Parliament should be able to 
tell another government: ``The particular law that you passed, 
you cannot have it any more because we are going to suspend its 
operation''. It does not inspire a sharing of ideas, products, 
technologies and people. There is no structure for innovation in 
it and nowhere for the talents and skills of the people of the 
country to grow and provide stability.
<P>
	We must try to do it now and not later. Canadians deserve the 
chance to develop into a nation of free traders before their 
industries are exposed to the larger global market. If we do that 
Canada will be ready to take advantage when the moment 
comes, and that moment is coming quickly.
<P>
	I urge the government to go back to the bargaining table. I 
urge the government to show a strong leadership and not just 
political rhetoric. I urge the government to provide Canadians 
with a free interprovincial trade agreement and begin the 
process of economic rejuvenation.
<P>
	It will symbolize to Canadians and everyone in the world, but 
more important to us and our young people in particular, that we 
are a confident people, strong and self-assured. We are an 
economically stable, united nation with the ability and skills 
required to face the challenge of a modern world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with a great deal of interest to the hon. member. I have 
to say I am not exactly sure what the hon. member really wishes 
to do to try to get free trade within the country.
<P>
	On a number of occasions the hon. member was urging the 
federal government to abandon the consultative process which 
resulted in the bill before us today. One year ago July 13 senior 
governments in Canada-the 10 provinces, the federal 
government and the two territorial governments-arrived at a 
consensus.
<P>
	A little later in his speech he talked about the government 
using its heavy hand because there was a section in the 
legislation that may allow it, given certain  circumstances under 
the Constitution by the way to disallow provincial legislation.
<P>
	He cannot have it both ways. What does the hon. member find 
so offensive about a process that has finally arrived at a 
framework under which all governments in the country, federal, 
provincial and territorial, have agreed to reduce internal barriers 
to trade? What process would he want to put in its place? This 
process has been under way since 1987. The agreements that 
were reached in July of last year were agreements that were 
reached after seven years of negotiations.
<P>
	Would he have the federal government use the heavy hand, the 
constitutional powers he says we have, to completely abandon a 
moral requirement for consultation in these areas? Would he 
have us roll over the rights of provincial governments? Would 
he have us abandon the consultative process? Would he have us 
abandon the basics of the agreement on internal trade, 
specifically the section that deals with the affirmation of 
constitutional rights and responsibilities since he spoke a lot 
about them, the general rules section which sets out the 
obligations for activities governed by the act, a special rules 
section which sets out the particular ways in which the rules 
apply in the 10 sectors covered by the agreement, and the section 
that sets out administrative provisions and the dispute 
resolution mechanism?
<P>
	Surely the hon. member opposite knows that when we are 
dealing in the area of trade it is not as easy as walking in and 
saying: ``Here is what I want; therefore that is what I get''. This 
is a process of negotiation similar to what was done with the free 
trade agreement with the United States. It was probably a little 
easier in the free trade agreement with the United States because 
we were only dealing with two governments. Indeed when we 
were dealing with the NAFTA we were dealing with three 
governments. In Canada, because of our constitutional 
structure, we were dealing with 13 governments.
<P>
	Should we abandon the consultative process which he seems 
to have condemned in his remarks and use the available tool 
albeit blunt in our Constitution, or does he say that we should 
abandon the process and start again? Which does he want? Does 
he want consultation or does he want heavy handed federal 
action in this area?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is probably one of the most 
thought provoking questions I have heard in the House for a long 
time. I appreciate the question. It is a good one.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	In no way do I wish to suggest that the consultative process is 
not a good one. It is a good process and one that should be 
observed, absolutely. However there comes a time when the 
consultative process breaks down and does not result in an 
agreement. Then senior government has to come in and make 
some essential changes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14113"> 14113 </A></B>
<P>
	Another point I recognize is that the primary criticism is not 
in the process. There is no criticism of the process. The criticism 
is in bringing to the House a bill which says we have an 
agreement. It is not an agreement. There are major parts of the 
economy of Canada that are totally exempted from the 
agreement.
<P>
	Let me mention one area. The whole energy sector is 
exempted from the agreement. It is not a complete agreement. 
Yet it was presented as if it were.
<P>
	I say again that consultation is essential, but leadership is also 
essential in a country when the consultative process breaks 
down. The three principles in my speech are the ones we ought to 
take forward. The responsibility lies with the Parliament of 
Canada to say that we have to solve the question. We can go this 
far and then we have to say that we have consulted so long but 
there is an end to the process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would ask my hon. colleague for Okanagan Centre, whom I have 
the pleasure of meeting regularly on the Standing Committee on 
Industry, how he can question not only the bill before us, C-88, 
and clause 9, which the Reform Party condemns with us, but also 
the agreement reached by the provinces, the territories and the 
federal government after seven or eight years of negotiations?
<P>
	Is is not rather presumptuous of the Reform Party to question 
something that all these elected officials and all these 
governments agreed on, with such difficulty, I might add? Is this 
not the extent to which Canadian leaders had agreed to agree in a 
certain number of areas? Is it relevant to tear up the agreement, 
as my colleague puts it?
<P>
	It stands to reason he would condemn the bill. However, it is 
another matter to tear up the agreement and reject the efforts of 
the premiers or ministers of trade who worked on this 
agreement. Is it not going too far to call the entire process into 
question?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that was a very thoughtful 
question.
<P>
	No, I am not calling into question the fact that the premiers 
got together to work on things. That is commendable. However 
to suggest that what they agreed to was meaningful and actually 
resolved some of the trade barriers is false because the trade 
barriers were not eliminated in many instances.
<P>
	We are supposedly being presented with a breakdown of 
internal trade barriers in Canada, but I submit to the House that 
is not the case. We are being led to believe something which is 
not complete. We should not be led to believe that it is complete. 
It is not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
gave away a little of my firepower in questions to the hon. 
member opposite. I indicated to the hon. member that it was 
very clear when I read the documents relating to the bill that 
nobody on this side of the House believes this is the be all and 
end all.
<P>
	The Prime Minister in his remarks last year when this was all 
done clearly indicated that he thought it was a step, albeit a 
small but very necessary step, toward the full removal of 
internal trade barriers in Canada.
<P>
	I understand what the hon. member was speaking about. I also 
understand that sometimes we have to crawl before we walk and 
walk before we run. There is no question the bill is long overdue. 
There is no question that the internal trade barriers perpetuated 
by various provincial governments, with the blessing of the 
federal government because perhaps in the past the federal 
government has not shown the necessary leadership, have 
caused a real mishmash of provincial trade barriers not just in 
the movement of goods and services but also of people. It is fair 
to say to individuals watching that the bill is a step in the right 
direction.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member opposite mentioned that it did not apply to 
the energy sector. That is exactly right. By the time the 
agreement was signed last year there was no agreement among 
the 13 players on how we should treat the energy sector. If my 
reading of the memorandums of last year is correct, it was 
agreed that there would be some framework to deal with the 
energy sector by the end of this month.
<P>
	The hon. member raised some good points. If he waits 10 
days-and perhaps we could wait 10 days-he will see the 
process concluded and there will be some guidelines, rules and 
framework for the energy sector.
<P>
	It is clear the bill is long overdue. It does not impose anything 
on the provinces. It simply reaffirms the requirement in 
legislation of the federal government to fulfil the commitments 
made last year when the agreement was made. The bill provides 
a federal legislative framework. It does not impose anything on 
anyone. It encourages the type of debate that has taken place in 
the past and the consensus building that has arrived at the 
framework of today.
<P>
	I mentioned that perhaps it was easier to conclude the free 
trade deal with the United States because there were only two 
partners, or the NAFTA because there were only three partners, 
than it was to deal with the Canadian provinces and territories.
<P>
	Everybody knows there is a problem within Canada. 
Everybody knows there are certain things that must be done to 
make us more competitive. One only has to look at some of the 
areas that are covered. The agreement covers 10 very specific 
areas: procurement of goods, services and construction; 
investment; labour mobility; consumer related measures; 
agricultural and food goods; alcoholic beverages; natural 
resource processing;  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14114"> 14114 </A></B>
<P>
communications and transportation; and environmental 
protection. It is a step in the right direction.
<P>
	I want to focus my speech a little away from the bill per se and 
at a microcosm of some of the problems in Canada. I want to 
specifically focus on Atlantic Canada. There are four Atlantic 
provinces including the three maritime provinces of P.E.I., New 
Brunswick and Nova Scotia. It is very clear to me as a student of 
history and a student of Murray Beck, a political scientist who 
has written some very good and thought provoking accounts of 
the political history of Nova Scotia, that Nova Scotia has always 
felt it was at a disadvantage in Confederation.
<P>
	Prior to Confederation we were free traders. All one has to do 
is look at our location. We are stuck out on the northeastern 
coast of North America. We have the closest deep water, ice free 
port in Halifax to the great circle route. We were great world 
traders. When we got into Confederation it started to change 
because the trading patterns were forced by regulation and by 
legislation to be east-west when we normally should have been 
trading across the ocean and north-south.
<P>
	My friends from the Bloc Quebecois might be interested to 
know that the first secessionist movement in Canada did not 
happen in the province of Quebec but in the province of Nova 
Scotia. There was great debate shortly after Confederation on 
whether or not the province should stay. We chose the right 
course and we chose to stay even though there were some 
restrictions to our growth. We decided the way to deal with it 
was to stay in a larger unit and to try to address the problems.
<P>
	Since the 1970s the Council of the Maritime Premiers realized 
that three small provinces, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island 
and New Brunswick, had less than two million people and had 
far too many barriers to internal trade in that small region. Each 
of those provinces had its own professional accreditation 
boards. A pipe fitter in New Brunswick may not have been able 
to work on a job in P.E.I., or a barber in P.E.I. may not have been 
able to cut hair in Nova Scotia. Those were the barriers to trade 
set up during that many decade period of protectionism in an 
effort to create jobs and keep them in each area.
<P>
	We have had much talk in Atlantic Canada about how we must 
become more competitive and less reliant on government. If we 
go back to 1989 there was a gentleman by the name of Dr. 
Charles McMillan who wrote a very good document called 
``Standing Up to the Future'' in which he talked about the need 
for maritime Canada to take up the challenge of integrating our 
economies. He said very clearly that governments must pursue a 
strategic program and that economic integration is a key to 
economic prosperity. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The strategy must be based on eliminating trade barriers, encouraging new 
investment and being outward oriented.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	Back in 1989, after almost 19 or 20 years of having the 
Council of Maritime Premiers, it was clear we recognized the 
requirement of reducing internal barriers to trade.
<P>
	In 1991, after Dr. McMillan's paper had been around for about 
a year and a half, the Council of Maritime Premiers responded 
very forcefully and effectively. It came up with the Maritime 
Procurement Act which stated that for goods tendered for 
$25,000 or more, for services of $50,000 or more and for 
construction contracts of over $100,000 there would be no more 
discrimination based on where the company that bid for those 
contracts came from in Maritime Canada. Clearly the movement 
had begun to reduce those barriers to trade.
<P>
	In 1992 the council came up with the Maritime Economic 
Co-operation Act. It has been working on a number of major 
projects since then. The Council of Maritime Premiers has a 
number of boards, organizations and bureaucrats working for 
the continued removal of barriers to the mobility of 
apprenticeship trades people. The primary goal of this whole 
focus in maritime Canada is to become more competitive.
<P>
	Everybody in maritime Canada knows one of the stumbling 
blocks to removing internal trade barriers has been the free 
movement of beer in Canada. Although this may not seem like a 
big deal to some people it is a big deal in Atlantic Canada for two 
reasons. We had come out of a period when individual provinces 
had restrictions on the movement of beer between provinces. 
They did that to protect brewing industry jobs in their areas.
<P>
	With some of the agreements in the past, we found products 
were flooding into Nova Scotia but perhaps Nova Scotia or New 
Brunswick products did not have equal access to the most 
lucrative market which is in Ontario.
<P>
	My point in all of this is the maritime provinces, the 
traditional have nots, the ones which seem to be left out of the 
economic cycle when it is on the up swing but always first 
included when it is on the down slide, have long since 
recognized the key to competitiveness is to remove internal 
barriers to trade.
<P>
	I have always been a free trader. People in my area and all 
over Canada will only prosper and be able to recognize their 
potential and our potential as a nation if we work aggressively to 
remove those barriers to trade.
<P>
	This is not a perfect bill, but it is closer to perfection than 
anything I have seen in the six years I have been here. I urge 
members of the Reform Party opposite who seek a perfect bill to 
support the direction of the bill and to work with us on this side 
and with members of the Bloc Quebecois to ensure the people 
we represent have access to markets unfettered by regulatory 
and non-regulatory barriers to free trade.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
find it odd that the hon. member made no mention of clause 9 of 
Bill C-88, which is the heart of the bill, the key, and which was 
totally unexpected.
<P>
	The opposition informed the Government of Quebec of clause 
9 and Bill C-88, and, in turn, the Government of Quebec 
contacted the Government of Ontario to see if it was aware of 
this provision. Apparently, nobody in Canada was aware of this 
bill, even though close to a month earlier, on April 10, 1995, the 
trade ministers met in Calgary and there was never any question 
of the federal government's intention to go ahead with the bill.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member what he thinks of clause 
9. How can he justify that the federal government has 
unilaterally declared itself the referee, when nobody was 
consulted, when nobody mandated the federal government to 
take on this role, and on top of this and perhaps most 
importantly, when the bill goes against the spirit of the 
agreement which provided for conflict resolution mechanisms 
based on the good will of each party, and not on judicial 
mechanisms?
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Now, the federal government is bringing in a judicial 
mechanism, announcing to everybody that, in the future, its 
actions will be based on the spirit and the letter of clause 9 of 
Bill C-88. It will issue orders and ultimately will take all of the 
measures in paragraph 9<I>d</I>), do everything it deems appropriate 
to bring any province it feels is reluctant in line.
<P>
	Can our colleague explain to us how the position that the 
federal government has taken on this issue in clause 9 of Bill 
C-88 is justified?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada 
within its own area of responsibility clearly feels if there is a 
dispute settling mechanism and the dispute is settled but a 
province is stubborn and decides after one year of going through 
the two bodies, the joint co-operative committee and the 
processes outlined and agreed to by all 13 parties, that it will not 
to be party to the dispute settlement mechanism finding, to the 
resolution, and still refuses to act in compliance with the 
agreement, the government will take some actions.
<P>
	Those actions are extremely limited by the very section of the 
bill. It does not say the Government of Canada can take straight 
retaliatory action. It outlines clearly the actions that can be 
taken and the actions that cannot be taken.
<P>
	I understand the member opposite would be worried that the 
federal government can use its heavy hand to impose a 
settlement. Clearly after 10 provinces, two territories and the 
federal government agree on a dispute settling mechanism and a 
province or territory refused to adhere to the rules of the game, 
the government believes  it is justified to use within its 
jurisdiction certain economic means.
<P>
	I do not think it is unjustified. It is like telling my children 
over and over again there are rules but if they violate the rules 
there will not be any penalty. If my children violate the rules 
there is a penalty. It is a penalty of last resort after consultation, 
after communication and after dispute settling in my house.
<P>
	At the end of the day if they continue to violate the 
agreements in our house-it would be the same in the federal 
House-I reserve the right, as would the federal government, to 
take reasonable means in response to that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this 
debate on the agreement on internal trade which will come into 
effect on July 1.
<P>
	The agreement may not be perfect, in response to the Reform 
Party's comments, but it represents an improvement from where 
we were before that agreement. Bill C-88 is intended to make it 
possible for the federal government to comply fully with its 
obligations under the agreement.
<P>
	It is important the House proceed expeditiously in its 
consideration of Bill C-88. For years businesses and private 
sector groups have complained to both the federal and 
provincial governments about domestic trade barriers and 
impediments to a free and open internal market.
<P>
	We have had numerous studies going back as far as the 1937 
Rowell-Sirois commission which recognized the issue and 
documented the broad scope of the problem.
<P>
	The Canadian Manufacturers' Association in 1991 estimated 
the cost associated with barriers and economic inefficiencies to 
be approximately $6.5 billion annually. The most recent 
statistics indicate interprovincial exports of goods and services 
in 1990 were worth $141 billion annually and responsible, 
directly or indirectly, for 1.7 million jobs.
<P>
	A recent study by the chamber of commerce underlined that 
the Canadian internal market is the most interdependent of any 
area in the world today.
<P>
	In agreeing to negotiate the agreement, Canadian 
governments recognize how well our domestic economy works. 
It is key to how we will prosper as a nation and how we will 
compete in the international economy.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	An open domestic market and economy will allow Canadians 
and Canadian companies to strengthen their internal 
competitiveness and develop new opportunities for growth and 
prosperity. The alternative offers only and ultimately 
self-destructive protectionism which benefits only special 
interests at the cost of the country as a whole.

	When they agreed to negotiate the agreement on internal trade 
the federal, provincial and territorial governments all 
recognised and accepted the importance of working together in 
the national interest. In concluding the agreement Canadian 
governments have demonstrated they are prepared to work 
together both now and in the future.
<P>
	As my colleague, the Minister of Industry, has said in the 
House, the agreement is a consensual agreement. Some 
members opposite have criticized the agreement as inadequate 
and insufficient. As I said before, the agreement may not be 
perfect but it is an improvement over where we were. It reflects 
a consensus on the principle of an open and efficient national 
economy. It establishes a detailed rules framework for internal 
trade. It provides a consistent and defined process for 
preventing and resolving disputes which may arise over specific 
issues or measures.
<P>
	All the parties have accepted, to a greater or lesser degree, 
disciplines which in the sectors covered will improve how the 
national economy functions in the future. It will be possible and 
it is the government's intention to work to improve the 
agreement in the future and to expand its scope and coverage.
<P>
	I call on all colleagues in the House to work together with us 
as we proceed into the future to expand the scope and coverage 
of the agreement. For the moment this is a start, a point from 
which to work. We can and should build on that.
<P>
	Some members have also criticized the government for not 
exercising its constitutional authority over interprovincial trade 
to open the internal market more forcibly. The national economy 
has become considerably more complex than it was when the 
constitutional powers of the different levels of government were 
agreed on in 1867. In the context of today's economy and 
modern Canadian federalism the views of those critics, frankly 
speaking, are simplistic.
<P>
	If anything is clear it is that the country operates most 
successfully when all levels of government work co-operatively 
in the national interest, not unilaterally and certainly not by fiat. 
Governments were not negotiating constitutional changes in the 
agreement on internal trade; rather, they were developing the 
basis for working together with their respective powers and 
responsibilities to make the national economy operate more 
efficiently and effectively.
<P>
	Unilateral action may be a theoretically possible method to 
achieve the same ends. Some of us may consider it to be a 
desirable way of proceeding. However it is simply not an 
effective or acceptable way to make Canada's federal system 
work.
<P>
	Some members opposite have suggested the government has a 
hidden agenda in Bill C-88, that it conceals a power grab and 
that it is intended to provide a means to force provinces over to 
the will of the federal government. That is purely and simply 
wrong. My colleague, the Minister of Industry, has responded at 
length and in detail to those allegations.
<P>
	Bill C-88 does not deal with the responsibilities of provinces 
or provincial measures, only federal responsibilities and 
measures. It is intended to make it possible for the federal 
government to comply fully with its own obligations under the 
agreement and to play its part in making the agreement work.
<P>
	Bill C-88 gives the government specific authority to make 
changes to certain parts of legislation to enable it to act in 
accordance with its obligations. It also changes some existing 
legislation to make it easier for provinces to comply with some 
of their specific obligations under the agreements.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	We should be clear in our understanding that Bill C-88 does 
not by itself legislate or give life to the agreement on internal 
trade. The agreement has been signed by all its parties: the 
federal, provincial and territorial governments. When it comes 
into effect, as agreed on July 1, all those governments will be 
bound by the obligations of the agreement. Each government is 
responsible for complying with its obligations and for living up 
to its responsibilities under the agreement.
<P>
	Two provinces, Alberta and Newfoundland, have already 
passed their implemented legislation. As I said earlier, it is 
important that we proceed expeditiously in our consideration of 
this legislation. The federal government has played a leading 
role in getting all governments to work together in the interests 
of all Canadians on internal trade issues.
<P>
	Bill C-88 does what is necessary to ensure the federal level of 
government will be able to continue to play its role in the 
co-operative intergovernmental process.
<P>
	We should not delay this further. I call on all colleagues to 
join with us in ensuring that Bill C-88 gets swift passage 
through this House.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore, a bit as 
I did with my colleague earlier, how she can justify the 
government's action in this regard. She knows very well indeed 
that the federal government cannot legitimately take this action, 
since it has neither the mandate nor an invitation to take it and it 
consulted no one in its action. It is giving itself powers of 
arbitration so it can act as a disciplinarian, without anyone 
having asked it to intervene. It has led, and here the seriousness 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14117"> 14117 </A></B>
<P>
of the situation and the all the scheming behind the bill become 
apparent, the Premier of Quebec,  Mr. Parizeau, to denounce the 
bill as a trade war measure.
<P>
	I would like further explanation. Oddly, and this is in keeping 
with the way the government works, nobody is referring to 
clause 9, the keystone, the source of friction, the heart of the 
bill. To us, this is indicative of the government's desire to 
meddle in a number of areas of jurisdiction in the operations of 
the future Canada where the Government of Canada will be the 
sole government. Canada will be a unitary country, a centralized 
country. Bit by bit, in this House, the government is giving itself 
what it needs to ensure that, increasingly, governments that 
claimed to be, were seen to be and considered themselves 
provincial will become regional, because bills like this one are 
being adopted.
<P>
	I would ask my hon. colleague to talk more about clause 9 of 
this bill, which is exceedingly pernicious.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is presuming 
quite a lot in his interpretation of section 9. Perhaps he has 
misread the section. In that section there is a principle 
underlying the concept of retaliation. My colleague spoke quite 
clearly to this by giving some real life examples within his own 
family situation.
<P>
	It has to be understood that subsections 9(a) to (d) do not give 
the government greater freedom of action. To suggest that it 
does ignores the headnote of the section. I would ask the hon. 
member to go back to the headnote which limits the degree of 
possible action pursuant to article 1710 of the agreement. 
Article 1710 would limit retaliatory action only to cases where a 
province has been found to have an impartial panel which 
violated the agreement and has refused to comply within the 
period of a year or more.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	It spells out quite clearly that the government would have to 
discuss whatever it proposes to do with the committee on 
internal trade which is composed of representatives of all the 
parties to the agreement. Any action to be taken has to be 
equivalent to the economic impact which led to the original 
violation.
<P>
	There is much within the section which must be read with 
article 17(10) in mind.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to participate in this debate as the official 
opposition critic on regional development. I want to show very 
clearly that, with this interprovincial trade agreement, the 
Canadian government is indeed giving itself powers which 
largely exceed what is provided in the agreement reached by the 
parties.
<P>
	We just heard the hon. member explain clause 9, in reference 
to articles 1705 and 1710. I intend to show unequivocally that, in 
this agreement, the federal government is giving itself extensive 
third party powers, without informing those involved.
<P>
	What is the purpose of this bill? It is simply to implement the 
provisions of the Agreement on Internal Trade, which was 
signed by the provinces last summer. To that end, the federal 
government must pass the required legislative provisions before 
July 1, 1995, when the agreement will take effect. This is 
basically the purpose of the legislation.
<P>
	First, I want to show that, with Bill C-88, the Liberal 
government is assuming powers which were never mentioned 
when the agreement was negotiated or signed, thus showing a 
very centralizing attitude which is also noticeable in relation to 
several other bills, and which is part of an overall centralizing 
legislative strategy.
<P>
	I also want to show some elements of the current international 
trade dynamics which point to the need for the political 
autonomy of the regions, as well as the establishment of 
economic unions, rather than large federations with a rigid and 
centralizing constitution, such as the Canadian federation.
<P>
	The clauses of the agreement to which Bill C-88 refers 
essentially deal with the dispute resolution process, as if the 
federal government could do anything but regulate. I want to 
point out to this House the context in which the interprovincial 
agreement will operate, by going over a few provisions of the 
Agreement on Internal Trade.
<P>
	Articles 1601 to 1604 deal with the establishment of an 
internal trade committee and its secretariat. That committee will 
supervise the implementation of the agreement and facilitate the 
resolution of disputes. Article 1705 deals with the setting up of a 
panel, following a request by the parties involved in a dispute. 
The panel is composed of five members who will decide on the 
validity of the request and on the retaliatory action which may 
be taken by the aggrieved party. We are talking here about a 
dispute involving two parties.
<P>
	Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of article 1710 provide that, if the 
matter has not been resolved within one year of issuance of the 
panel report, the complaining party may request a meeting of the 
committee. The committee shall convene within 30 days to 
discuss with the complaining party the option of taking 
retaliatory action in respect of the party complained against.
<P>
	So, the complaining party may, until such time as a mutually 
satisfactory resolution of the dispute is achieved, impose 
retaliatory measures of equivalent effect against the party 
complained against. This is important: the retaliatory measures 
must be of equivalent effect.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14118"> 14118 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	We must understand that the panel's decisions are not 
binding, which implies that the committee governing the 
interprovincial trade agreement has no power. If the party 
complained against does not comply with the panel's 
recommendations, article 1710 applies. As we saw, article 1710 
deals with retaliatory action that the complaining party may take 
in respect of the party that did not comply with the agreement.
<P>
	The main purpose of this bill, as we said earlier, is to 
implement the agreement on internal trade. The Bloc Quebecois 
has always been in favour of freer trade, which is the context in 
which states do business today. We support the principle of the 
agreement.
<P>
	However, what we understand is that, if the federal 
government is the aggrieved party under a trade agreement 
referred to in the agreement, it can impose retaliatory measures 
that are unprecedented.
<P>
	However, that is not what is said in Bill C-88. In fact, clause 9 
goes well beyond the spirit of the agreement reached by the 
provinces last summer. Clause 9 reads as follows: ``For the 
purpose of suspending benefits or imposing retaliatory 
measures of equivalent effect against a province pursuant to 
Article 1710 of the Agreement, the Governor in Council may, by 
order-'' By order, no less.
<P>
	This is a method commonly used by a totalitarian 
government. This bill clearly shows that the Liberal government 
wants to govern by order. Are we again facing Liberal 
totalitarianism? In fact, clause 9 means that if a party is at fault 
pursuant to article 1710 of the agreement, then the federal 
government, whether or not it is party to the dispute, assumes 
the right to impose retaliatory measures against all the 
provinces without distinction.
<P>
	The parties were agreed that it was a matter between two 
parties: the injured party and the party at fault. The government 
however, assumes the rights of all parties so it can interfere in 
the dispute. Bill C-88 clearly indicates that the federal 
government intends to interfere in interprovincial trade and be 
both judge and judged, to provide through this agreement the 
power to act by order, a power it alone can exercise, and to 
extend the application of any federal law to the provinces, as 
mentioned in clause 9<I>(c)</I>.
<P>
	Governing by order in council, setting oneself up as the 
arbiter of interprovincial trade, are measures that go way 
beyond the spirit of the agreement signed with the provinces last 
summer and are an indication of the clearcut centralist strategy 
of the federal Liberals.
<P>
	Nowhere in the 13 paragraphs of article 1710 of the agreement 
is there mentioned any right of the federal government to 
intervene in a trade dispute when it is not itself one of the parties 
to the dispute, contrary to the retaliatory measures described in 
clause 9 of Bill C-88, which it may impose, by order, on any of 
the parties concerned.
<P>
	The range of retaliatory measures that the federal government 
has given itself in this clause is too broad. The attitude reflected 
in recent federal bills concerned with regional economic 
development, such as C-46, to establish the Department of 
Industry; C-88 on interprovincial trade; C-91, to redefine the 
Federal Business Development Bank; C-76 on certain 
provisions concerning transfers to the provinces is a clear 
indication of the ultra-centralist strategy of the present Liberal 
government.
<P>
	As the official opposition critic for regional development, I 
want to warn provincial governments against interference by the 
present federal government in matters concerning regional 
economic development. I urge them to be extremely vigilant. 
They must not downplay their autonomy and jurisdictions or 
give up certain responsibilities, just because of an impending 
referendum.
<P>
	I say to Canada's provincial governments that supporting 
Quebec's demands means supporting the development of the 
regions.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Among other things, the 1982 Constitution, the famous 
Canada Bill, instituted provincial egalitarianism, an 
egalitarianism which denied the Canadian duality and the 
existence of the Quebecois people. The current face of Canadian 
nationalism was formed on the basis of this egalitarianism. Do 
not forget that, at the end of the 1960s, Pierre Elliott Trudeau 
came to power with a vision for the nation in which he persisted 
despite the sharp criticism it drew. He set out to build a more 
closely integrated Canadian economy by rationalizing the 
government's activities and by centralizing power.
<P>
	In June 1978, during the unilateral patriation of the 
constitution, the federal government published a detailed 
statement by Pierre Trudeau, called ``Time for Action''. It was 
in fact an elaborate constitutional reform proposal. Under that 
proposal, even though Canada is a patchwork of different 
sociological and historical influences, for example aboriginal 
peoples whose legitimate rights we must respect, the two main 
linguistic communities, the many different multicultural 
communities, the federal Liberals' approach to the constitution 
has always been based on the primacy of the citizen and of the 
rights of the individual. I would like to quote a passage from the 
publication: ``The unity of Canada must transcend the 
identification Canadians have with provinces, regions and 
linguistic or other differences-Each must feel that Canada, and 
the federal Parliament and government acting on his or her 
behalf, are the best guarantors of the security-''
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14119"> 14119 </A></B>
<P>
	Such was Pierre Elliott Trudeau's grand statement on 
centralization. This is the federal Liberals' grand statement on 
centralization.
<P>
	As a Bloc member, I say to my fellow Quebecers that such a 
statement of intentions significantly threatens the existence of a 
Quebec state, a Quebec nation and the means it needs to develop 
economically. Ottawa is counting on the marginalization of the 
provinces. This same objective is reflected in the federal 
position in all other matters of importance to do with shared 
jurisdiction. This unitary state spirit of centralizing federalism, 
which opposes provincial peculiarities, is an obstacle to the 
development of the people of Quebec and is also the spirit of Bill 
C-46.
<P>
	We must remember that this enabling legislation of the 
Department of Industry increases duplication and overlap in 
Quebec and denies its government the complete control over 
regional development it has so long sought.
<P>
	In the same centralizing vein, under clause 8 of this bill, the 
Minister of Industry is responsible for regional development in 
Ontario and Quebec. This bill simply confirms regional 
development overlaps, because it confirms federal government 
and Department of Industry intervention in an area of 
jurisdiction Quebec has long sought as its own.
<P>
	Quebecers have a very different view of regional development 
requirements. Decentralization of funds and powers advocated 
by the Parti Quebecois are what the regions have long waited for 
in order to take charge. This is a democratic vision of regional 
development that has nothing to do with the centralist vision of 
the Liberal government in Ottawa.
<P>
	In Quebec City, we do not want the development of the 
province's 16 administrative regions to be driven by the purely 
sectoral vision of the federal Minister of Industry. Regional 
development is the cornerstone of a vision of society that 
requires the intimate understanding of all the needs of the 
various environments that only regional stakeholders have.
<P>
	I say to my fellow Quebecers that when, in the referendum, 
they are asked to decide on the political autonomy of Quebec, a 
no to the Quebec government's proposal will signify acceptance 
of Canadian federalism as defined by Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and 
the death of Quebec. Bill C-91 is another example of the denial 
of the State of Quebec. In this bill, the government's stated 
objective is to streamline and modernize the Federal Business 
Development Bank. The vocabulary is undoubtedly meant to 
reflect the reality of late twentieth century markets, but nobody 
is in any doubt about the federal government's real objective, 
which is to meddle further in the regional development of 
Quebec and increase its presence in the most important 
mechanisms of Quebec's economic development.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	The state of Quebec exists. It is trying to develop its own tools 
of economic development in spite of the federal government's 
intrusive presence in regional development. And the Federal 
Business Development Bank remains a parallel structure, an 
unacceptable administrative duplication.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to remind this House, by way of 
illustration, of some of the extremely centralizing and 
anti-Quebec provisions of Bill C-76. This bill, which concerns 
the implementation of provisions of the 1995-96 budget, sets its 
sights much further than that fiscal year. In fact, clause 48, 
which requires no prior negotiation with the provinces, would 
result in a shortfall of $2.5 billion, $650 million of it in Quebec 
alone. Furthermore, implementation of the Canada social 
transfer for health care and social programs will result in a 
shortfall of $4.5 billion for the provinces in 1997-98. The Bloc 
Quebecois also condemns this bill because it introduces a 
mechanism that the federal government, which according to the 
constitution has no jurisdiction over social programs, will use to 
intervene to a greater extent in this area and impose national 
standards on Quebec.
<P>
	Bill C-76 maintains national standards for health care and 
provides for adding new national standards for social assistance 
and post-secondary education. If the provinces fail to abide by 
these standards, funding will be cut accordingly under C-76. 
This arrogant federalism bears not the slightest resemblance to 
decentralization. These national standards will limit the 
provinces' autonomy within their own jurisdictions. 
Furthermore, distinct as they are, the people of Quebec will not 
see their demands reflected in the new national standards 
applied from coast to coast in an area that is crucial to its 
cultural identity: education.
<P>
	As for Bill C-88, it is eminently centralist. It reflects a 
retrograde view of trade relations between the regions of one 
and the same continent. Today, the trend is towards 
globalization, removing tariff and non-tariff barriers and free 
trade, not using orders in council to regulate a continental 
market led by a unitary state like Canada.
<P>
	The decisive levels at which we can be competitive are 
increasingly located at the local, regional and provincial levels, 
all of which does not fit Ottawa's centralist mould. The new 
international model for regional economic development reflects 
the globalization of our economies which, in turn, means that 
regional economic spaces are gradually becoming absorbed into 
a single global economic space.
<P>
	Fernand Martin, of the Faculty of Economic Science at the 
University of Montreal, is very emphatic about this 
international regional reality, and I quote: ``Local businesses 
now realize that they are not only competing with domestic 
competitors but all the others as well, without the benefit of the 
protection afforded by national borders''. This new reality of 
international 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14120"> 14120 </A></B>
<P>
markets gives rise to a second economic phenomenon: economic  
concentration by businesses to remain competitive. As a result, 
regional economies are becoming an important part of the 
overall strategy.
<P>
	In this context, intervention through a national government 
structure is no longer required. The State of Quebec, by giving 
the regions unprecedented powers in its blueprint for society, 
has shown it has a very sure grasp of the new problems it faces as 
a result of international trade, unlike the Canadian federal 
government. NAFTA would help to further diminish the federal 
government's power to intervene in economic matters. Where 
international trade is concerned, agreements like GATT already 
prevent Canada from imposing tariffs and subsidizing 
exporters. These international agreements tend to accelerate the 
globalization of our economy and, like the dynamics of regional 
economics, to diminish the federal government's control over 
the national economy.
<P>
	In the nineteenth century, globalization of trade was sparked 
first of all by the new multinationals. It was the multinationals 
which initially caused countries to shift towards a new economic 
space like NAFTA. Today, their ability to restructure an 
economic space has been illustrated many times over. In fact, 
they confer international status on the cities or regions where 
they are located.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, we are not opposed to this bill because we do 
not care about the globalization of markets and international 
trade. We oppose this bill simply because, to the detriment of all 
other parties, the federal government granted itself the ultimate 
power, the power to govern by order without making any 
agreement with any of the parties beforehand.
<P>
	I say to my fellow Quebecers that a vote for a sovereign 
Quebec is a vote for the elimination of the federal government's 
interference in Quebec's areas of jurisdiction and for the 
elimination of many overlaps and duplications, which will 
result in real savings. A yes vote for a sovereign Quebec would 
permit Quebec to put job creation, labour force training, 
education, health and social assistance policies in place which 
meet its needs and are geared to its priorities.
<P>
	In addition, a yes vote would help protect Quebec from being 
the victim of federal manoeuvres like the 1982 constitutional 
patriation and would help put an end to the federal government's 
unilateral cuts to transfer payments.
<P>
	To sum it up, it would be a yes to adulthood, to confidence, 
and to the open-mindedness and pride of the people we already 
are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate my colleague for Richmond-Wolfe 
right off for his excellent and edifying speech, which rattled the 
Minister of Transport so much he was forced to leave the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. We must 
remember that we never draw attention to the presence, and, 
more particularly, the absence of anyone in the House. We are all 
familiar enough with the requirements of our work on the Hill or 
in committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to point out that 
this was the Minister of Transport's way of standing out.
<P>
	All those who have carefully examined Bill C-88, and in 
particular clause 9, can see that the legitimacy of the 
government's action is seriously in doubt. There was no 
consultation, and the government was given no mandate to act 
this way. The legitimacy of its action is questionable.
<P>
	We must also ask what was the intent-and this question is for 
my colleague-of the federal government in striking such a 
blow against all the provinces, particularly Quebec, which has 
reacted strongly. All the provinces, however, are reacting 
similarly. What is going on in people's heads in Ottawa? What is 
going on in people's heads in the Langevin building? What is 
this Canada of tomorrow to be? I will let my colleague for 
Richmond-Wolfe elaborate on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his question. First, I want to put clause 9 in 
perspective as regards Articles 1705 and 1710 of the agreement, 
so as to show how the federal government, with this legislation 
and other bills, is giving itself very centralizing tools. It is 
giving itself instruments which, since Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 
have been part of the Canadian political philosophy, whereby 
the Canadian constitution is a document which the federal uses 
to make its partners toe the line, instead of using it to promote 
co-operation and sharing.
<P>
	Originally, an agreement was reached between various parties 
to open up interprovincial trade as much as possible. All the 
parties involved approved and signed the agreement, which 
provides that, if there is a trade dispute, a panel with 
non-binding authority will be set up to hear the aggrieved party.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	That party will submit the issue to the five-member panel. 
These five people hear the aggrieved party and decide that, if 
there is no redress of the injury, the aggrieved party can take 
retaliatory measures. Everybody agrees on that. One party takes 
retaliatory action against another.
<P>
	Everybody agrees and the agreement is signed. Then the 
federal government arrives on the scene. It drafts a bill to give 
concrete form to the agreement but, surprise, it decides, in the 
legislation, that it is not subject to the rules agreed to. As far as 
the federal government is concerned, these rules simply do not 
exist. The federal government feels it is the central power, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14121"> 14121 </A></B>
<P>
leader, the ``Canadian''. It must look after the interests of all the 
smaller entities in Canada and, if some of them are too  strong 
compared to the others, it must hit them on the head.
<P>
	This is why, through this legislation, the federal government 
is giving itself a power, not just any power but a power by order, 
to take retaliatory measures against any party. With this bill, and 
even though it is not a party to the dispute, even though it is not 
an aggrieved party, the federal government is giving itself the 
right to hit on the head those it identifies as the culprits.
<P>
	When the government member referred to her government, 
she chose her words carefully but, at the same time, she 
described this centralizing reality by saying that the government 
of Canada must fulfill its obligations. The federal government 
must be the one running the show, the one taking action to make 
this country go in the right direction, that is toward the 
development of national standards. In order to do so, that 
government must give itself extraordinary tools.
<P>
	The hon. member even referred to a specific authority. She 
alluded to a specific authority to even make changes to the 
legislation. In order to meet its responsibilities and fulfill its 
obligations, the federal government must, at the expense of its 
partners, be the one which calls the others to order, even though 
all its partners negotiated in good faith, agreed that everyone 
would be on an equal footing, and approved the process 
provided in article 1710, whereby a five-member panel with 
non-binding authority would hear the complaints of the two 
parties involved and allow one of them, after 12 months, to take 
retaliatory measures.
<P>
	The parties were never advised. This is a very significant 
demonstration of what the federal government is all about and 
an indication of the federal Liberals' ultimate goal in playing 
the part of a centralized government: to make laws without 
telling anybody and to adopt laws one after the other giving 
themselves exceptional centralized powers.
<P>
	Where does this all lead? I wanted to talk about the issue you 
raised regarding this mechanism because this same mechanism 
comes up in other bills. For example, in the act to amend the 
Department of Industry, the minister unilaterally gives himself 
the power to directly intervene in all of the provinces.
<P>
	He can enter into agreements with anybody whatsoever in 
each province: individuals, organizations, municipalities, etc. 
My colleague for Trois-Rivières was right. This position is 
strictly constitutional because it has to do with recognized 
jurisdictions. But in this case, this government, which is an 
extension of the Trudeau government, is furtively, law by law, 
arming itself with small, very centralized mechanisms in 
preparation for the post-referendum period-because they think 
that Quebec will vote no in the referendum even though we know 
that Quebec will vote yes-in preparation for a time when they 
think that they will be able to impose on Canada a vision similar 
to the one prevailing in 1982, but more centralized, more 
dictatorial, more controlling.
<P>
	That, dear colleague, is where this government is going with 
the bills that we have been careful to describe in the minutest 
detail. You will note that the government members who rose to 
speak about this bill never went into detail regarding clause 9 or 
the mechanism in the provisions we identified, articles 1705 and 
1710.

<B>(1820) </B>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to debate Bill C-88, an act to implement the 
agreement on internal trade.
<P>
	The issue of internal trade should be a priority for this 
government. However it has taken almost one year to introduce 
this legislation after the deal was struck between the federal 
government and the provinces. We as a country trade almost as 
much between provinces as we do with foreign countries. To put 
it another way, this agreement should mean as much as if not 
more than GATT and NAFTA. However we hardly hear it 
discussed.
<P>
	As we have already heard from our colleague opposite, 
interprovincial trade barriers cost Canadians $6.5 billion 
annually. Because of these internal barriers it is easier to trade 
with Mexico and the United States than within our own 
boundaries. The elimination of these barriers will only 
strengthen our economy, which would enable us to get the 
unemployed employed. It would provide greater freedom for 
Canadians to work where they choose. It would also create a 
single economic market in Canada, giving us economies of 
scale. It would also help counter our nation's current regional 
drift.
<P>
	With that said, the internal trade agreement, which C-88 
would implement, does little else for free trade. The signing of 
the document almost went unnoticed. Perhaps that is because it 
is an agreement that can best be described as a political facade. 
This agreement among provinces did a little to break down a few 
barriers but it has left much undone. The federal government 
and the provinces had a chance to solve what is perhaps one of 
Canada's most solvable economic problems and for the most 
part unfortunately failed.
<P>
	Internal restrictions on trade are not imposed on us by foreign 
governments; they are self-imposed. In a nutshell, we are 
shooting ourselves in the foot. Since these restrictions are 
self-imposed, they should be relatively easy to remove. That is 
not always the case, as this agreement clearly illustrates. Instead 
of removing the barriers and stopping the economic war that has 
developed between the provinces, they agreed in essence to 
reinforce the status quo.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14122"> 14122 </A></B>
<P>
	The removal of interprovincial trade barriers can be 
accomplished without any monetary expense. It simply requires 
those involved to have the political will to remove them. It is 
obvious that we lack this will. Canadian politicians have to stop 
protecting interest groups such as big business which will suffer 
from free trade between provinces. They must start looking out 
for the interests of ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	A survey of businesses done by the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce states that only 5 per cent of businesses benefit from 
these barriers while 95 per cent do not. Need I say more? 
Apparently I do because it is clear this government has not 
gotten the message.
<P>
	I would now like to speak briefly to a few of the specifics of 
the internal trade agreement. I will start with the positives, and 
there are positives. This agreement prohibits provinces from 
using subsidies to entice businesses to set up local shops. It 
forbids preferential government procurement and improves the 
mobility of labour, particularly in the trucking sector.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	However the essence of the agreement seems to have 
forgotten agriculture, energy or the financial sector. In other 
words consumers will still have to pay too much for electricity, 
eggs, milk and many other products. It also has loopholes the 
size of our national debt that would allow any determined 
government to drive through them.
<P>
	As mentioned earlier, these 500 or so internal trade barriers 
cost Canadians nearly $6.5 billion each year, which can be 
broken down into approximately $3,500 a year for the average 
Canadian family, according to the Fraser Institute. I cannot 
speak for everyone, but I can say that I would love to have an 
additional $3,500 in my pocket each year.
<P>
	According to a recent Fraser Institute article, and I quote: 
``The public debate has ignored that when a market grows 
several things happen. Costs fall and producers become more 
competitive. Japan is a fierce international competitor because 
it has a large internal market. This market is like a school where 
students learn from each other. Efficient producers pass into the 
world market while bad producers fall into mediocrity or even 
bankruptcy.'' I could not agree with this statement more.
<P>
	If we look at Canada's world competitiveness, we ranked 
third in 1987, sixth in 1991 and eleventh in 1992 out of the 22 
OECD countries. These numbers are not surprising when we 
look at the amount of trade that is done between provinces rather 
than out of the country. Over half of all provinces' 
interprovincial trade is more than their international trade. 
Perhaps more to the point, over one-third of Canadian 
businesses encountered barriers when attempting to do business 
in another province. This is according to a Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce study.
<P>
	According to the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, eight 
out of ten construction companies encounter interprovincial 
barriers. Some provincial  governments are willing to pay local 
firms as much as 10 per cent more than non-local firms for 
procurement contracts. This must stop. Hopefully the bill will 
allow us to move in that direction.
<P>
	This agreement reached among the provinces does nothing to 
put an end to the protectionist policies of the past. In relation to 
C-88, clause 9 of the agreement is a cause of particular concern, 
as was mentioned by my Bloc colleagues. It simply states that 
for the purpose of spending benefits or imposing regulatory 
measures, cabinet may take any measure that the governor in 
council considers necessary. Not Parliament-cabinet.
<P>
	Where is the openness? Where is the transparency this 
government claims to be adhering to? Specifically, clause 9 
confers on the cabinet a blank cheque for retaliatory measures 
taken against a province, including the modification or 
suspension of the application of any federal law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> You mean any law?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> That is what it says.
<P>
	Cabinet should be accountable to Parliament in relation to any 
decision concerning a change in federal law. While this 
agreement does contain a code of conduct that restricts the tax 
breaks and grants a province can use to attract business from 
another province, it also provides a number of exceptions to the 
code for the provinces and the federal government. The most 
significant of these are the provisions that establish barriers 
based on ``legitimate objectives''.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	Most people agree that a determined province will find a way 
around the intent of the agreement based on the so-called 
legitimate objective. Other exemptions from the agreement 
include agriculture, alcohol, energy, natural resources, culture, 
regional development and, of course, crown corporation 
procurement.
<P>
	It is for this reason that the Reform Party believes that the 
overall intent of the agreement does nothing more than reinforce 
the status quo. In other words, the agreement is like a toothless 
tiger, lots of noise and no bite.
<P>
	A perfect example is how the premier of New Brunswick 
recently lured UPS to his province from Newfoundland through 
tax relief exemption plans. However there was an outcry from 
the other provinces that claimed New Brunswick was breaking 
the deal, even though the deal was not in effect as New 
Brunswick so rightly pointed out, and was in fact poaching jobs 
from other sectors of the country. These cries, of course, fell on 
deaf ears.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14123"> 14123 </A></B>
<P>
	Reformers want to see the elimination of all interprovincial 
trade barriers. We want to see economies of scale. We have 
confidence that our country can compete with the best for the 
benefit of all Canadians, especially in the global economy. We 
feel this can be achieved by two methods: first, through 
provincial agreement and, second, by constitutional challenges.
<P>
	The agreement in Bill C-88 does not eliminate barriers. It 
only reinforces barriers which already exist. The federal 
government has the power under section 121 of the BNA Act to 
eliminate these trade barriers. Section 121 states clearly that 
``all articles of growth, produce, manufacture of any one of the 
provinces shall, from and after the union, be admitted free into 
each of the other provinces''. This power can and should be used 
unilaterally if necessary.
<P>
	The federal government could enforce section 121 by striking 
down any provincial laws which impede interprovincial trade. 
Our colleague from Dartmouth mentioned that Nova Scotia, 
when it came into Confederation, was an economically strong 
province. It has been waiting 125 years for changes in the trade 
barriers. This will not be what it wants. It must go farther. It 
must go back to the original of section 121.
<P>
	To enforce this the federal government could simply withhold 
all transfer payments to those unco-operative provinces until 
they have removed all barriers to interprovincial trade. The 
process is there. We have it.
<P>
	Bill C-88 is moving in a direction but not nearly far enough. I 
hope that provinces such as Nova Scotia do not have to wait 
another 125 years before it gets any movement.
<P>
	The central question from the Reform Party point of view is 
the speed at which the movement is occurring. I understand the 
Bloc's position. It is a philosophically different position, but 
ours is in terms of speed and process.
<P>
	In conclusion, I think a quote from the book titled <I>Common 
Ground for the Canadian Common Market</I> is quite relevant as it 
states that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If one province plays the restrictive game, it can do better than free trade, but 
if they all play it, they do worse.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is like one individual who stands up at a football game to see 
better. When everybody does it nobody sees better.
<P>
	This power can be used unilaterally and should be used if 
necessary. The federal government could enforce section 121 by 
striking down any provincial law which impedes interprovincial 
trade or by simply withholding all transfer payments to those 
unco-operative provinces until they have removed all barriers 
to interprovincial trade. Therefore let us work to ensure an 
agreement which will remove these trade barriers rather than 
settle on one which simply reinforces the status quo.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	It is for these reasons that the Reform Party will not be 
supporting Bill C-88.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am really amazed that the Reform member, in 
speaking to Bill C-68, said he would not be supporting the bill. 
At the beginning of his speech he indicated that this issue should 
have been a priority for the government and lamented that it had 
taken one year. Immediately thereafter he said it was a political 
facade.
<P>
	I do not believe the member who just spoke really knows 
where he stands on the issue.
<P>
	The government has fulfilled its constitutional 
responsibilities very carefully. It has shown that the best way to 
govern Canada is through consensus building, by bringing all 
the parties together. It is an approach that ensures acceptance 
and implementation of the agreement to its fullest degree.
<P>
	It was only during the last 128 years of Confederation that 
these barriers to interprovincial trade had emerged. Therefore, 
we cannot expect by one stroke of a pen we can undo overnight 
what happened over the last 128 years of Confederation.
<P>
	The Reform Party has to recognize that the government has 
demonstrated the triumph of practical statecraft that it is able to 
achieve agreement not through constitutional confrontation but 
through consensus building which truly will be more lasting in 
its effect.
<P>
	In conclusion and by way of comment, I would really like the 
Reform Party to reconsider its position and support Bill C-88 
which allows the freer movement of goods, services, capital and 
people. We have to recognize that Canada is a history of 
successive steps and this is an important one. We must build one 
at a time on a solid basis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Winnipeg for his comment. It is a fair question. I do not really 
see this as a political question to make points.
<P>
	What we are arguing is the speed of the process. The member 
has mentioned, as have I, the length of time Nova Scotia has 
been trying to get agreement and the effect it has had on them. 
That is also true of the other Atlantic provinces. As well, other 
provinces at various times have been affected.
<P>
	However, it cannot be done overnight. One of the previous 
speakers stated that the government plans to expand the scope 
and improve more. The question Canadians want to ask, when it 
is costing us jobs and money, is when and what is the 
government's overall plan. This is what we would like to see. If 
we had something in that regard then you might find that there is 
more co-operation from this side.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14124"> 14124 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I can appreciate that 
under these circumstances at this time, the disagreement is on a 
rather cordial note. However, we well know that sometimes 
there are more heated discussions and that is why we ask for all 
interventions to be made through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have completed my point. I do 
apologize for not directing it through you.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first 
like to thank the Reform Party for refusing to support Bill C-88.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	I myself worked hard for free trade with the United States. I 
can tell you that the Free Trade Agreement with the United 
States is much more open than the agreement we are trying to 
establish at the moment. As far as the rules are concerned, the 
tribunal established to resolve disputes is composed of the same 
number of representatives from the United States and 
Canada-the two countries are equally matched.
<P>
	In this case, however, the federal government will unilaterally 
decide on and dictate the resolution of disputes. It alone will 
establish the rules. This is completely unacceptable, 
particularly for Quebec.
<P>
	In the past, the federal government has decided on its own to 
promote one region over another. We have just seen this. Two, 
maybe three years ago, huge sums of money were spent to 
promote oil production in the great Hibernia project. As we 
know, the experts say Hibernia will always be a money loser. For 
Hibernia to make money, they say, oil would have to sell at $30 a 
barrel; it currently sells for $20. As you can imagine, the federal 
government will have to make up the difference between losses 
and revenues.
<P>
	Once again, with regard to this bill the federal government is 
giving itself all the power, namely the power to decide. It is not 
giving the provinces any power to negotiate or to resolve 
differences. This is totally unacceptable. We have seen similar 
examples in the past and we will see others in the future. For 
example, the federal government has provided considerable 
assistance in the development of uranium, by doing research 
with the CANDU systems on atomic energy. We all know that 
uranium is powerful and worth a fortune, however, it is located 
in Ontario. Not a penny was spent in Quebec to help develop 
hydro-electricity.
<P>
	And now the federal government is going to decide on its own, 
unilaterally, how certain areas of activity, how certain energy 
sectors in the country are going to be promoted.
<P>
	I agree completely with the Reform Party in saying that the 
provinces and the regions must have a say in the resolution of 
trade disputes in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and I will 
try to avoid the use of the word, you.
<P>
	I understand where my colleague is coming from. I 
understand where the Reform Party is coming from and I realize 
that it is a philosophical difference.
<P>
	The free trade agreement was between two nations. This is an 
agreement between 13 individual groups and that can be very 
complex. The one area we agree on is section 9. Decisions 
regarding trade should be debated in Parliament at least. They 
should not be finalized in an order in council. They should not be 
finalized by cabinet. I am sure my colleagues from the Bloc 
would agree with that.
<P>
	Where we disagree is that they look at a separate Quebec and a 
separate English speaking Canada. We see it as 10 equal 
provinces. That is not something we are going to decide in this 
debate. That is something that will be decided, I understand, 
according to the Bloc's agenda, by the end of this year. We have 
to wait until that decision is made and then perhaps we can 
discuss this question further.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, overtaxed, hampered by political red tape, our private 
sector is much beleaguered, especially nowadays in the era of 
economic uncertainty. Wherever they turn, the private sector 
finds very little recourse and no succour whatsoever.
<P>
	With options limited, they have to cut jobs, decrease 
expenditures and infrastructure. Ultimately they find 
themselves pushed to the wall with very few options, one of 
which is to fold completely and go bankrupt. The other is to 
move to the United States. One only needs to look at Ottawa and 
Toronto, eastern Canada, and to a lesser extent western Canada 
to see the number of businesses which have been run by families 
for generations that are now closed and boarded up. It is very sad 
for me when I go home to Toronto and see businesses which have 
been operating for generations closing up.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Trade barriers hamper small businesses and the ability of the 
private sector to be competitive. They function to relocate 
scarce resources away from the efficient areas to inefficient 
areas of the economy. They cost business, they cost the 
consumer in increased prices and they cost the entire country. 
They impede the free movement of goods, services, people and 
capital all over this great country of ours.
<P>
	Who are they supported by? They are supported by a small 
number of businesses, perhaps 5 per cent to 10 per cent, yet they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14125"> 14125 </A></B>
<P>
are paid for by the majority of the people in Canada. That is the 
cost of having internal trade barriers.
<P>
	Section 121 of the Constitution states that all articles of the 
growth, produce or manufacture of any one of the provinces 
shall, from and after the union, be admitted free into each and 
every other province. That means that internal trade barriers are 
illegal. They are contrary to our Constitution. I find it amazing 
that we have not had a constitutional challenge, a judicial 
challenge in our Supreme Court to the internal trade barriers 
which exist in Canada. Clearly, if we try to abide by the 
Constitution we will find that the trade barriers transgress it. It 
is only a matter of time before that challenge is brought before 
the Supreme Court.
<P>
	The cost of trade barriers is extreme. My colleague from the 
Reform Party mentioned that they cost $6.5 billion. The 
Treasury Board has mentioned it is costing us at least $50 billion 
a year to have these trade barriers, barriers which are benefiting 
a very small number of groups in our country, which are in 
existence only because successive governments have not been 
willing to go against the wrath of a very small number of 
companies. They have not been prepared to do that for the 
benefit of the majority because they do not want to create 
conflict. I would challenge the government to remove the trade 
barriers. If it does, clearly it will get the support of the majority 
of Canadians.
<P>
	I find it passing strange that we have successfully managed to 
be a leader in removing the barriers to international trade. We 
have been a leader in bringing together the countries of the 
world in the World Trade Organization. It is truly a magnificent 
agreement and one which will clearly benefit our country, a 
country which relies so heavily on exports for its well-being. 
We did it with the WTO, with the FTA, with the NAFTA, and we 
are continually pursuing an aggressive export market and 
rightly so. Wherever we can we are trying to remove the barriers 
to external trade.
<P>
	We are doing that on the one hand yet on the other hand we are 
not removing the internal barriers to trade. I find it absolutely 
ludicrous. While we are decreasing the barriers to external trade 
and supporting the persistence of internal barriers to trade, we 
are hamstringing the industrial complex within our country. I 
would submit that the government should take up the challenge 
and aggressively try to decrease the barriers which exist 
between the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	In the eastern bloc with the iron curtain coming down we saw 
with our own eyes what barriers to trade do to countries. We saw 
what this did to Russia, Romania, Albania. We have seen that 
when trade barriers are put up it only seeks to restrict, hamstring 
and compromise the very economy they were intended to help. 
This type of behaviour, the persistent pursuit of barriers to trade, 
can only harm an economy regardless of whether we are 
speaking about Canada, Russia, the United States or Chile.
<P>
	This government bill, so-called to remove internal barriers to 
trade, to decrease interprovincial trade barriers, has been a flop 
to put it mildly. It is just window dressing. It does not touch any 
of the major sections, such as alcohol, agriculture and many of 
the other innumerable barriers to trade which exist within our 
country.
<P>
	The government should have taken the bull by the horns to 
capture the moment to make the substantive and substantial 
changes that are required to give our economy, our producers, 
our exporters and our manufacturers the leg up they require. 
Instead of doing this and significantly decreasing these internal 
barriers to trade, the government has only sought to nibble 
pathetically around the edges. Once again as we have seen in 
other bills, it is an opportunity lost.
<P>
	The Reform Party advocates a much stronger position to 
decreasing the trade barriers in order to benefit this country and 
in order to maximize the economies of scale that we can have 
within Canada. By doing so we would decrease marketing costs, 
increase efficiency, decrease management costs, improve the 
speed and efficiency of the movement of goods, increase 
employment opportunities for all Canadians and decrease public 
procurement costs. In effect we would have a well needed 
benefit to our economy from coast to coast. I suggest therefore 
that post haste this government take it upon itself to rapidly 
eliminate all interprovincial trade barriers. The Reform Party 
would be glad to help the government if it needs any advice in 
this area.
<P>
	We also need to create common standards across the 
provinces in licensing, certification and education. We need to 
focus on some very important factors in competitiveness that 
our country has failed to do, from provincial governments to the 
federal government. In order for us to increase our 
competitiveness there are a few things we must take hold of and 
address right away. One of those is education.
<P>
	We need to vastly improve our educational system and we 
need to do it now. We need to turn out a student who is 
self-sufficient, educated, competent, self-assured and well 
versed in those skills that are going to be needed in the 21st 
century. In many areas our public school systems fail to do this. 
They are not all bad but certainly many of them are. That is 
evidenced by the huge exodus we are seeing of people desirous 
of putting their children into private schools. Why? Because 
they are not finding that their children are getting the education 
they deserve in this great country of ours.
<P>
	A greater emphasis must be put on the basic sciences, reading, 
arithmetic, the basic skills that are required. We need to build on 
those the more technical skills that are going to be of value in the 
coming century.
<P>
	Against this backdrop is a world that is becoming increasingly 
competitive. The mindset now in the schools is often to shield 
and to insulate the student from competitiveness. 
Competitiveness has a dirty name now.  The reality in this 
globalized world is that competitiveness is the name of the 
game. It does our students a great disservice. It prevents them 
from actually coming to terms with how to cope and deal with 
competitiveness 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14126"> 14126 </A></B>
<P>
themselves and how to develop the coping mechanisms that are 
going to be required in an ever increasing, ever more 
competitive world.
<P>
	That is also evidenced in some very interesting and sad 
statistics that have come out of the OECD. Back in 1987 we were 
the third most competitive country of the 22 nations in the 
OECD. Sadly in 1992 we dropped to 11th. That is a telling 
statistic and one we are not proud of. It is one we need to address 
now if we are to give the students the opportunity they need to 
provide for themselves, their children and their grandchildren 
and to continue to build this great country. It is imperative that 
we continue to invest in education. It is the single most 
important determining factor for employability in the 21st 
century.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	The government in its haste to try to balance its budget, which 
we certainly agree on and will try to help it do, unfortunately has 
decreased expenditures for education to the provinces. It can be 
done if it is prepared to give the provinces tax credits which 
would enable them to raise the money necessary to invest in 
education. Unfortunately that did not occur. I would implore the 
government, if it is going to take money away from the 
provinces to give them the opportunity to raise the money 
themselves to build the strong educational infrastructure needed 
to train students to build a strong provincial economy.
<P>
	In my riding of Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Royal Roads 
Military College was cut in the last budget. That is fine if we can 
make a better college and the opportunity is there. It has 
enormous potential in terms of faculty, staff and the 
infrastructure to train students in highly technical skills in 
which Canada is a leader. Unfortunately it was given over to the 
province and the province made it a dumping ground for 
Camosun College and the University of Victoria.
<P>
	Furthermore, the federal government has removed the 
physical infrastructures. For example, the oceanographic 
training vessel that belonged to the university was removed. 
This basically guts and pillages the ability of the institution to 
train students in the oceanographic skills in which Canada is a 
known leader and which other countries desperately require. 
That is but one example of the shortsightedness.
<P>
	I also implore the government to aggressively pursue 
international free trade agreements but again give our 
manufacturers the ability to be competitive in the future. 
Germany is an example of a country that has a very intriguing 
relationship with the private and public sectors and the banks.
<P>
	I am neither a banker nor an economist but I know there are 
very bright people in this country who are well  versed in this 
and who could advise us on how to learn from some of the 
interesting experiments in Germany. In particular, we could 
learn how to get seed capital from the banks and provide it to 
small and medium sized businesses that could aggressively 
capitalize on trade options in international markets.
<P>
	There are great opportunities within our manufacturing and 
services sectors to capitalize on external trade opportunities. 
However they are not getting the intelligence and information 
necessary for them to capitalize on this. I put this idea forward to 
the government to work with the internal trade ministry to look 
at it as an area where we need improvement to give our exporters 
a leg up.
<P>
	In closing I would like to continue to support the government 
in decreasing external trade barriers. However, I would implore 
it to decrease and rapidly eliminate the internal trade barriers 
that only seek to benefit a minority of businesses within the 
country and seek to hamper and penalize the majority of 
Canadians.
<P>
	The government should take courage that by doing so it may 
have to succumb to the wrath of a small number of vocal 
businesses but I know it will have our support in doing this. The 
government will have the support of the majority of Canadians 
in pursuing this laudable goal. In doing so it will give exporters 
and manufacturers within our country the necessary 
wherewithal to pursue an aggressive economic and 
manufacturing policy that will benefit Canadians from coast to 
coast.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	I would also lastly ask this government to please get our 
economic house in order and learn from our zero and three 
program. By doing so we will be able to provide the tax relief 
necessary for our companies in this country to again be 
competitive.
<P>
	One of the things that hamstring companies in this country 
greatly is the overbearing tax burden that exists on their 
shoulders. They find it almost impossible to be competitive on 
the international stage with the tax burdens we have today.
<P>
	I would again implore the government to get our economic 
house in order, decrease the tax burden on companies and 
Canadians and decrease the GST. Then we would not be 11th in 
the world in competitiveness, but we would improve our 
competitiveness in the world order to again regain the powerful 
position we can in the first world nations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
made a number of comments and I would like to respond to some 
of them.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	He clearly stated we have to invest more in education. When 
he stated that I hope he did not mean we have to put more money 
into education because that is not what is needed. The reality is 
that Canada invests more than any other country in the world in 
the area of education. We spend close to $50 billion annually in 
the area of education. What we have to do is spend wisely when 
it comes to the resources we are putting into education. We have 
to look at the educational system as a whole and bring all three 
levels of government together so they can better manage the 
resources they have at their disposal.
<P>
	I quite agree with the hon. member that we have deficiencies 
in terms of the number of people who are going into the area of 
science and technology. We need to see more people going into 
the area of science and technology. We have to involve the 
industry more, that is true. We have to do all of that. We have to 
embark on co-operative programs. We have to get the parents 
involved. This is exactly what the minister responsible for 
human resources is doing in terms of his initiative. In the area of 
literacy, for example, this government has reintroduced the 
literacy program. It has put back into the program the $20 
million that was supposedly going to be taken out of the 
program.
<P>
	I also wanted to say for the record that this government has 
not only addressed the issue of interprovincial barriers but it has 
moved many steps forward in that area. On the external front, 
the government is on record as being on the leading edge when it 
comes to opening trade barriers and signing trade agreements 
with other countries.
<P>
	In fairness to this government and to the Minister for 
International Trade, perhaps we have a Minister for 
International Trade who has travelled the world more than any 
other minister for international trade anywhere in the world. I 
would say it has paid dividends. If we were to look at the results, 
it has put Canada on the map internationally. The figures speak 
for themselves. Canada in 1993-94 has been on the leading 
edge. It has more economic growth than any industrialized 
country.
<P>
	Would my colleague not want to correct the record and clearly 
state that this government has put Canada back on track in terms 
of its economic growth? Would he not want to give this 
government credit for making sure Canada is the leading 
country in the industrialized world since we took office in 1993?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his intervention. He certainly made 
some good points, but I would like to correct him.
<P>
	Why do we now have an economy where our interest rates 
have essentially doubled since this government came into 
power? Why is that? Why has Moody's downgraded our bonds? 
The reason is that our economy right now is in the worst state of 
affairs it has ever been in. In point of fact, we are on a steep, 
slippery slope to economic dislocation and economic disaster.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	Three years from now, if we pursue the economic principles 
of this government, we will have $100 billion more on our debt, 
our interest payments will climb from $40 billion to $50 billion 
and our expenditures for government programs will decline 
from $120 billion to $102 billion, an $18 billion shortfall.
<P>
	What are we going to say to the Canadian public? What are we 
going to say to people who are sick and who need their health 
care? What are we going to say to the elderly who need their old 
age security and cannot take care of themselves? What are we 
going to say to needy people who through no fault of their own 
need welfare? What are we going to say to them in the future 
when that money is not there? That is the reality of the economic 
plan this government has put forth.
<P>
	I correct the hon. member that our situation economically is a 
lot worse. However, the hon. member did put some good points 
forth on education. I agree with him that we do not need more 
money in education. The Reform Party has never supported that. 
If the government is going to decrease money to the provinces, 
which is what we said, then do it. However, it has to give the 
provinces the ability to raise funds themselves by giving them 
the tax points to do it.
<P>
	This government has said: ``We are taking money away from 
you, but we are not going to give you the ability to raise money 
without penalizing you''. That is fundamentally and morally 
wrong.
<P>
	The hon. member did make a couple of good points on the 
co-operative activities of education and how we should indeed 
bring forth and use our education dollar to more efficient 
standards to increase the standards within our schools today. We 
do not need to spend more. In fact we can spend less because 
there is a lot of money that is wasted within education.
<P>
	He brought forth some interesting points about bringing 
parents into the educational circle, something I have spoken 
about on a number of occasions within this House. I would be 
very interested at some time in the future in listening to what the 
hon. member says this government is doing in this regard. It is 
very important and I would be more than happy to help them 
with this.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party are very much in support of improving 
the standards of education within this country without spending 
more, making sure that our students in this country have the 
skills that are necessary in the future to become competitive in 
the 21st century. Many of our schools are failing to do this. The 
tragedy for the students in this country is when they get out in 
the working world and find out that when they are competing 
against students from the Pacific Rim countries they are up 
against some very hardnosed, highly competitive individuals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14128"> 14128 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope we will be able to change our system somewhat and 
give our students the information and skills necessary to be 
competitive for them to be employed in the future and for them 
to build the strong economy we need in this country.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
had the occasion earlier this afternoon to compliment the 
member on a well thought out and logical speech, but I have to 
rise at this time and challenge him on what I thought was in 
many ways a rather incoherent speech.
<P>
	He kept talking about the need to do more to remove internal 
barriers to trade within Canada. We on this side of the House 
agree entirely with that. That is what the bill before the House is 
currently about.
<P>
	He went on to talk about the education system. I wondered if 
he thought he was in a legislature at the same time as sitting in 
the House of Parliament. He talked about the huge exodus to 
private schools. That is a little bit of an exaggeration and not 
worthy of the member. Clearly the vast majority of youngsters in 
this country still attend a very high quality but still needing 
improvement public system. I really would encourage him to 
avoid that kind of hyperbole in the future.
<P>
	I would like to talk so that people who have been listening to 
the debate will know what this bill is about. We concede that it is 
only a beginning, but we are trying to undo over a century and a 
quarter of barriers that have been built up between the provinces 
of this Confederation.
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	This agreement and this bill before us is only part of the 
success to date because it only reflects the federal government's 
obligations under the agreement, not the obligations other 
governments provincially have undertaken to implement. It 
does deal with the procurement of goods, services, construction, 
labour mobility, consumer related measures, agriculture and 
food goods, alcoholic beverages, natural resources processing 
and so on.
<P>
	We want to see faster progress as well but let me just ask the 
member a question. This is a Confederation that was formed by 
agreement, by consensus. It has always progressed by consensus 
and agreement. This agreement has been achieved by consensus 
among the parties. Is the member now in fact suggesting that the 
federal government should dictate to the provinces the removal 
of those internal barriers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member brought up some very good points.
<P>
	What we are saying in this party is that the government cannot 
keep taking tentative little baby steps forward with respect to 
internal trade barriers while the penalty is being paid for by 90 
per cent of Canadians.
<P>
	Furthermore, while we pursue the aggressive elimination of 
external barriers to trade while continuing to keep our internal 
barriers to trade, we are in effect significantly hamstringing our 
manufacturing, industrial and service sector within our country.
<P>
	So, yes, what we are saying is that you must be much more 
aggressive in eliminating these internal barriers to trade. There 
are many more that need to be addressed. In point of fact, Bill 
C-88, which the hon. member is quite correct in saying is 
intended to decrease and eliminate the barriers to internal trade, 
when one looks at the bill one finds it is full of intent and very 
short on substance.
<P>
	I hope that when this bill goes to committee stage the 
government, in co-operation with the official opposition and 
our party, will in fact pursue a more aggressive role in 
eliminating these internal barriers to trade, while speaking to 
the provinces in doing so. She is right that these must come in 
collusion with the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to say a few words on this bill.
<P>
	Trade is an important issue when it comes to agriculture. The 
time has come that we have to get freer trade because we see it 
happening with other countries. I think it is important that this 
bill get some serious consideration and maybe move on.
<P>
	I think exactly like my colleagues in the Reform Party. This 
thing is going too slow, but then we are used to having this 
House not proceed too fast. We would not want to set too many 
records for speed. It could be dangerous.
<P>
	It is only fair to say the position of our party is very clear: we 
want to do away with trade barriers. We want to make freer 
trade. We do not just want to trade between provinces. We want 
to also trade more with foreign countries.
<P>
	When I look at the cost of these trade barriers of $6.5 billion 
to the economy of Canada, I wonder what we could do with $6.5 
billion. One thing for sure is we in Manitoba could definitely 
afford the Winnipeg Jets. It would really buy some Liberal 
votes. However that does not seem to be happening too fast with 
this bill.
<P>
	When I look at $6.5 billion it also tells me that is about the 
same price the infrastructure program costs and we would not 
have to finance one cent of that. Six and a half billion dollars 
less of interest a year would make quite a dint in the dollars we 
do spend.
<P>
	Canada's domestic market is seriously fragmented by these 
provincial barriers. We support the removal of these interpro-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14129"> 14129 </A></B>
<P>
vincial barriers through a negotiated process. I do not think it 
can be done just by unilateral action. I think the provinces have 
to have some input into  it. If there is co-operation among all the 
players this could be speeded up tremendously.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	An interprovincial trade agreement should include a domestic 
trade dispute settlement mechanism to resolve future domestic 
trade disputes. Dispute settlement mechanisms work in 
international trade. Certainly it should also work in 
interprovincial trade.
<P>
	The dispute settlement mechanism provided in the bill is very 
toothless. It reminds me a bit of a very soft hairbrush. One does 
not want to stir up the fuzz too much but wants to brush it aside a 
bit. That is one of the problems with the settlement mechanism 
in the bill.
<P>
	If the provinces fail to co-operate in the removal of 
interprovincial trade barriers, the legitimacy of the obstacles 
should be challenged under the Constitution wherever possible. 
It could be quite a situation, enacting some of the constitutional 
powers, but if that is the only way to do away with trade barriers 
it would probably be worth its weight in gold.
<P>
	Unfortunately we have seen over the last 100 years trade 
barriers being set up between provinces because they wanted 
little territories. Provincial premiers probably had a little more 
power than they should have had and eventually after three or 
four years could say to their electorate that they were going to 
protect their territory by throwing up another trade barrier. They 
could say: ``Vote for us and things are going to improve''.
<P>
	So many trade barriers have been set up that we hardly know 
we are a country any more. We try to resolve our disputes. We try 
to more or less console each other by saying that one of these 
days we will do away with barriers but that does not take place.
<P>
	The former Tory government claimed to support the removal 
of interprovincial trade barriers but it never used its power to 
remove the barriers where possible. When the Conservatives 
came into power in 1984 they had a lot of promises like the ones 
we see in the government's red book. They were to clean up the 
corruption and change the country.
<P>
	We can see what has happened. Not only have more trade 
barriers probably been thrown up, but we also had an almost 
unbelievable debt put on us of another $400 billion or very close 
to it while the Conservatives were in power.
<P>
	We hope the Liberals will have learned from the mistakes of 
the former government and will eliminate these problems. We 
hope they will throw away trade barriers and start making use of 
the $6.5 billion we could save.
<P>
	It is important not to throw up trade barriers between 
members on one side of the House and the other. Sometimes we 
have some good advice for our friends across the way. Some day 
they will acknowledge that maybe we were right on occasion 
and that they could have learned from us as well as we could 
learn from them. The trade barrier problem is one that we should 
work on together to eliminate barriers as quickly as possible.
<P>
	What did the Liberals say in the last Parliament? They made 
big promises that they were to do away with trade barriers. As 
we have seen the red book has quite a few promises that are very 
slow in coming. I hope they do not forget it. In the next election 
we might use that red book as flags to the provinces to prevent 
the Liberals from entering into power. Manitoba has almost 
eliminated all of them. It is important they take some notice and 
know what is going on. They better start honouring some of the 
promises.
<P>
	It amazes me with the new opportunities in the global 
community how we can improve trade capabilities. The 
possibilities are there and we fail to realize them in our own 
country.
<P>
	We can look at a $6.5 billion bill that could be cut very easily. 
We could make use of the interest on it to help us rejuvenate our 
industry and our economy.
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	We have to realize that we are human and things take some 
time. As I said the other day, when I look at the pace the Liberal 
government is going maybe we should go back to the horse and 
buggy. That is about the pace it has been doing things.
<P>
	I sometimes feel a little frustrated on the committees and in 
the House that things do not get done the way we do it on the 
farm. We have three weeks to put in the crop and if we do not we 
are in big trouble. We have three weeks to take off the crop and if 
we do not we are in trouble. There are a time limits and that is 
exactly how I feel the bill should proceed. There should be a 
time limit to get the bill passed. There should be time to make 
amendments so that the bill is at least of some value.
<P>
	The agreement does not represent a new vision for Canada 
that is required in this area. We have to do away with barriers 
faster. It is merely a rehashing of the status quo. If members 
want an example of how far into the future the document 
attempts to bring Canada's internal trade environment, they can 
compare it with section 121 of the British North American Act 
which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All articles of growth, produce or manufacture of any one of the provinces 
shall be admitted free into each of the other provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I was just reminded of this when I was at home during the last 
break. I was walking across the fields looking at the mud and the 
puddles. I was very close to the border and I saw ducks going 
back and forth from the United States to Canada free as birds, 
with no problems; feathers were in the same order when they 
came back. I said to  myself: ``If birds can access boundaries 
with no problem, why shouldn't we as humans be able to do the 
same?'' We always feel we are much superior when it comes to 
brain power, imagination and getting things done.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14130"> 14130 </A></B>
<P>
	Article 101 of the interprovincial trade agreement states that 
the objective of the agreement is to reduce and eliminate to the 
extent possible barriers to the free movement of goods and 
services. I do not think the article has been fulfilled. We can still 
improve a lot on it and maybe speed it up. Here we have an 
agreement that is actually more restrictive and backward than 
the BNA Act from the time of Confederation.
<P>
	When I look at the problem of the Liberals in Parliament 
climbing uphill on the debt problem, it reminds me a lot of a 
slippery hill that I drive through most winters. I spin my wheels 
a lot but I seem to go backward sometimes. If I do not get a push 
from somebody I do not make it to the top. That is what we in the 
Reform Party are trying to do. We are trying to nudge the 
government along to act a little faster and maybe to make a few 
decisions that will benefit the country.
<P>
	Why do we continue to more or less reprimand, admonish or 
encourage the Liberals? We want a federal government that is 
working toward a clear and concise agreement. So far the bill is 
kind of muddy. As I said in a speech the other day in my 
constituency, we have to pay some attention to the Liberal 
government. Its vision is very cloudy in some of these bills. If it 
could get a clearer perspective things might work a little faster.
<P>
	I am getting to the age where I have to use my spectacles at 
times. I hate them. I wish my vision was more clear without 
them, but as age creeps up I find that this is reality. That is what I 
would like to say to the government. As it gets older and if it 
does not start acting very quickly its vision will get more 
blurred. By the time the next election rolls around it probably 
will not even know what are the issues. I encourage the 
government to pay heed to some of the Reform Party advice 
because it has a clear vision and will keep reminding the House 
what it is all about.
<P>
	The agreement fails to meet all the goals we hoped it would 
meet. We think it is ambiguous and it leaves areas untouched. 
When a flour mill in Manitoba cannot export its flour into a 
different province it makes me very sad. It is unbelievable that I 
can process my wheat but I cannot ship it to another province as 
flour. The wheat board can take my wheat and export it to 
foreign countries without a problem. However as a farmer I 
cannot process or value add and distribute it to another province. 
If that is not hindrance, I do not know what it is.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	We have come of age in the country. We should start realizing 
that if we are to have free trade with foreign countries it has to 
happen here, or we will defeat the purpose, the time and the effort 
spent negotiating free trade agreements with other provinces.
<P>
	The failure to obtain a ban on interprovincial barriers to 
agricultural products ensures that all costs associated with the 
barriers will continue. When I look at the cost of $6.5 billion, a 
lot of which is in agriculture, I am sad to see that farmers are 
going bankrupt. Their incomes are such that they can use every 
cent available. If we had freer trade it would make quite a 
difference. It would encourage younger farmers to be more 
aggressive and probably more entrepreneurial and to help 
further develop the country.
<P>
	Agriculture has always driven the economy, especially in the 
western provinces. Any hindrance to agriculture is a hindrance 
to the whole country. If we can speed up the process and break 
down the trade barriers, we will be complimented for years and 
years to come.
<P>
	There are many powerful forces currently affecting Canadian 
agriculture. Recent budgets have slashed the departments of 
agriculture and transport. The western farmer has to bear the 
cost of approximately $30 an acre in extra transportation costs. 
Any savings created by doing away with trade barriers would be 
very beneficial.
<P>
	I talked to a farmer the other day who told me: ``You know, 
Jake, it is amazing. I can own three sections of land anywhere 
between the provinces, but if I want to farm half a section on one 
side of the border and another half section on the other I run into 
problems with delivery to elevators, with permit books and with 
contracts. It is confusing''.
<P>
	This is a why we need free trade. We need to more or less 
dissolve the borders between provinces and make it a country, 
not a nation of 10 little countries such as we have right now. It is 
very important for future generations that we accomplish it very 
shortly and do not let it pass on to the next Parliament.
<P>
	I was encouraged to hear my colleagues in the Bloc agree with 
us that trade barriers should be done away with. By doing away 
with the trade barriers between provinces it might even 
encourage people in Quebec and the Bloc to change their 
attitude about being a part of Canada. A freer country, a country 
destined to work and destined to remove inefficiencies, will 
make things happen that will be beneficial not just for us in our 
lifetime but for future generations.
<P>
	We have to be encouraged that some progress has been made 
in the House. We want to continue on that route. The bill could 
be made valuable if it were given the benefit of some good 
amendments. There are some being proposed. I would support 
anything that would make the bill better, do away with the trade 
barriers faster and give us a chance in the future to operate as 
one nation, not as a nation with 10 little nations inside of it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14131"> 14131 </A></B>
<P>
	Every day on the news we hear what is happening in the 
former Yugoslavia. It does not work when a country is broken up 
and there are more rights for individual groups. When barriers 
are thrown up between people we run into problems. We create 
hard feelings and we will eventually wind up with some 
disastrous results.
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	Agriculture is one of the occupations with the most trade 
barriers. It is of the utmost importance that they be removed. I 
encourage every member of the House to work toward that end, 
to work together to make the country run, to do away with trade 
barriers and to use every dollar wasted to build up the economy 
so we can again have a healthy and prosperous country. When I 
think of paying $1 billion of interest every week by 1997 it 
scares me. That is why it is so tremendously important that we 
save every dime we can. It is so simple to remove the barriers, to 
increase production and to make things flow more easily.
<P>
	I listened to my hon. colleagues speak about the oil issue. That 
is a product every province needs. It flows freely in a pipeline. 
There are no trade barriers. We do not always agree on the price 
but we know it is beneficial to the country.
<P>
	I urge Parliament to improve Bill C-88 with amendments, to 
do away with trade barriers faster and to make the country work 
again and make this a nation in which our children and our 
grandchildren will be proud to live.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a real pleasure for me to stand in the House of Commons today to 
address Bill C-88. I cannot say I am opposed to Bill C-88. That 
would be like saying I am opposed to good intentions. Bill C-88 
embodies the good intentions of governments, even if it does not 
really address the major problems facing the country with 
respect to interprovincial trade.
<P>
	It would be very instructive to take a moment to review the red 
book promise with respect to free trade within the country. It is 
found on page 22:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Interprovincial trade within Canada is hampered by as many as 500 trade 
barriers, according to the Canadian Manufacturers' Association. These range 
from preferential procurement to non-harmonization of environmental 
regulations. The CMA has estimated that savings from the elimination of these 
barriers could be as high as $6 billion, just under 1 per cent of GDP. A Liberal 
government will be committed to the elimination of interprovincial trade 
barriers within Canada and will address the issue urgently.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To compare what I have just read from the red book with Bill 
C-88 we will find there is a bit of a discrepancy. Bill C-88 
represents the good intentions of the government on this issue 
and the good intentions of some of the provinces but it does not 
meet the red book promise. I mark this as one more broken 
promise of the government.
<P>
	The government made a fundamental mistake when it laid out 
this red book promise. I do not believe right from the outset it 
was completely sincere when it put those words into the red 
book. Although everyone would like to have interprovincial 
trade barriers eliminated, the government was simply not 
prepared in the end to do the things it should have done and 
needed to do to bring about a more meaningful resolution to this 
very important problem.
<P>
	Like my hon. friend from Lisgar-Marquette, I am distressed 
when I hear farmers cannot move their value added product 
across borders.
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	We have talked many times about the need to diversify on the 
prairies to allow people to go beyond being producers of 
primary products and shipping them around the world in that 
form. We need to move them about as value added products 
within Canada. To me that is fairly obvious and it is very 
important we start to move toward that by eliminating 
interprovincial barriers.
<P>
	Tradesmen also have similar problems not being able to cross 
over boundaries and have their qualifications apply. 
Professionals are another example, lawyers and doctors and 
accountants who have to write exams in each province in many 
cases if they want to practise in a certain province.
<P>
	I will talk for a moment about some of the specific problems 
with Bill C-88 and where we see some of the huge loopholes or 
some of the ways provinces can escape from being bound by Bill 
C-88.
<P>
	When we look at the agreement fairly closely it really does 
not represent any kind of a new vision for Canada. The 
agreement is mostly a written text of the status quo. Compared 
with the Constitution and section 121 of the BNA Act, it is quite 
a bit weaker than what is already in the Constitution. Section 
121 of the BNA Act states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All articles of growth, produce or manufacture of any one of the provinces 
shall be admitted free into each of the other provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the Constitution. Let me compare it to article 101 of 
the provincial trade agreement which the government 
negotiated last summer. The objective of the agreement is to 
reduce and eliminate to the extent possible barriers to the free 
movement of goods and services.
<P>
	Let us compare that with what the minister set out in his press 
release of March 31, 1994: ``The federal government is 
committed to working toward an agreement which is clear and 
concise; has a set of rules that will eliminate protective 
measures; includes an effective and enforceable dispute 
settlement mechanism''.
<P>
	This agreement really fails in all of those criteria. If people 
look at it they will agree it is ambiguous. It leaves entire areas 
untouched-agriculture, certain government procurement and 
regional government, to name some. It does not undertake really 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14132"> 14132 </A></B>
<P>
to eliminate trade barriers, only  to the extent possible. There are 
all kinds of loopholes and I will touch on those in a moment. The 
dispute settlement mechanism is not enforceable and therefore 
not effective.
<P>
	Let me talk specifically about some of our major concerns 
with the loopholes in the agreement. From part III, chapter 4, 
general rules, the agreement allows for a party to exempt itself 
from most of the constraints of articles 401, 402, 403 on the 
grounds of legitimate objectives. Articles 401 through 403 
really are the essence of that agreement.
<P>
	It is very important that those articles have some teeth. Here is 
what we find out. Under the agreement, legitimate objective is 
defined on pages 6 and 7 as the following objectives: public 
security and safety; public order; protection of human, animal or 
plant life or health; protection of the environment; consumer 
protection; protection of the health, safety and well-being of 
workers; affirmative action programs for disadvantaged groups 
considering, among other things, where appropriate 
fundamental climatic or other geographical factors, 
technological or infrastructure factors, or scientific 
justification.
<P>
	We have listed almost every possible excuse under the sun for 
allowing people to opt out of this agreement. That is the huge 
fundamental flaw of the bill. I understand the government's 
good intentions but it simply did not come anywhere near 
meeting its red book promise of addressing this problem with 
urgency, implying it would bring about an agreement as quickly 
as possible. This comes nowhere near that.
<P>
<B>(1940 ) </B>
<P>
	Our party does not want to be completely negative. We would 
like to offer some constructive alternatives. One of the things 
the government can do, which it has not done and for which there 
is a growing body of evidence that it should, is bring about a 
court challenge and use its standing in the Constitution to 
actually be more in charge of interprovincial trade barriers.
<P>
	Section 121 gives the federal government control over 
barriers within provinces. There is no reason that could not 
happen. I heard some hon. members from across the way talking 
about whether it might be preferable to get consensus, et cetera. 
Of course it is. We want to work with the provinces. That is very 
important in this day and age when our friends from Quebec, the 
Bloc Quebecois, are saying they want to break up the country 
and that kind of thing.
<P>
	At the end of the day are we here to please certain special 
interests in different provinces which make a tremendous 
amount of noise and get the government's attention in those 
provinces or are we here for everybody, for the common good? I 
say we are here for the common good, to do the things we need to 
do of the most benefit to every man and woman in the country, 
not just to few who make a big noise when it looks like their  
little area will be jeopardized and they will no longer enjoy 
protection from the government.
<P>
	The free market has to decide these things. If we let the free 
market decide we end up in a situation in which we have the 
cheapest possible services and goods being provided to 
consumers and levels of government which means more money 
in the pockets of consumers so they can spend on other things, 
which means there is money for productivity, for the economy to 
expand, et cetera. It is absolutely the best way to go.
<P>
	That the federal government has finally come on board on the 
whole idea of free trade underlines it is understanding that. It 
fought against free trade in 1988 during the election but has now 
come around and we are happy to have it on our side. The 
government did not show the same change of heart in this bill or 
at least it did not show a real will to bring about the demise of 
interprovincial trade barriers. Unfortunately Bill C-88 has been 
dramatically watered down from where it should be.
<P>
	Some people may ask if this is something we really want to do 
in the courts. I remind people listening, the government has 
shown no hesitation to go to court on things like enforcing the 
gag law legislation. It has shown no hesitation in taking 
extraordinary measures to cancel deals like the Pearson airport 
deal. I think it should show the same will when it comes to Bill 
C-88.
<P>
	Bill C-88 is for the benefit of all Canadians; if it would only 
pound down interprovincial trade barriers. It has good 
intentions, absolutely, but we have to ask ``where's the beef?'' It 
is simply not in there.
<P>
	I want to talk about how important an issue this really is. It is a 
huge issue that is extremely important to the country. A good 
article came out in the August edition of <I>Fraser Forum</I> by Filip 
Palda. He talks about a study done in British Columbia about 
interprovincial trade barriers:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The B.C. study is right, however, in pointing out that the CMA's estimate of 
the benefits of free internal trade only focuses on three areas of the economy: 
agriculture; alcohol and government procurement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Somehow the $6.5 billion gain from liberating a few sectors of the Canadian 
economy has become entrenched in the media as an upper boundary on the 
benefits of free trade in all sectors. The public debate has ignored that when a 
market grows several things happen: costs fall and producers become more 
competitive. Japan is a fierce international competitor because it has a large 
internal market. This market is like a school where students learn from each 
other. Efficient producers pass into the world market while bad producers fall 
into mediocrity or bankruptcy. The benefit of these intangibles is hard to put a 
number on but the number is probably larger than the commonly cited $6.5 
billion. Studies of the entire economy suggest that the annual gains could be 
between 6 per cent and 9.5 per cent of GNP. This translates into gains in the 
range of $44 billion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14133"> 14133 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	Many hon. members have spoken about the $6.5 billion that 
came out in the CMA study. I was amazed when I first heard it. I 
could not believe how much money that was. I did not realize at 
that time, and maybe other members did not either, that it was 
only the CMA looking at the effects that dropping 
interprovincial trade barriers would have on those three sectors.
<P>
	If we extend it to the full economy, $44 billion is what this 
gentleman is suggesting could be the benefit to Canadians. That 
is a tremendous amount of money. When it is realized how big 
that amount is and what it could do for the economy it gives us 
an idea of how important this issue should be to the government.
<P>
	I feel the government has failed us in Bill C-88. It has not 
shown any urgency. It did not get the Prime Minister involved to 
make this happen. It did not use its ability to push this through 
the courts. Therefore the agreement is very much watered down. 
Canada is no further ahead than it was before except that the 
government can say it has dealt with the issue. However when I 
look at this I have to say where is the beef.
<P>
	I want to talk about the larger scope of competitiveness and 
why it is important to have interprovincial trade barriers dealt 
with. It affects our competitiveness in the world. The economist 
I have just quoted, Filip Palda, pointed to that when he talked 
about Japan and how its internal market is so large that it really 
prepares people for selling around the world. That is only one 
thing that comes out of knocking down trade barriers.
<P>
	My hon. friend from Lisgar-Marquette mentioned this a few 
minutes ago. The economy has problems. He talked a bit about 
grain producers and people who would like to add some value to 
the product they produce. If value added products cannot be 
moved between provinces there is no way that producers will be 
ready for the world. It is critical to be able to trade between 
provinces freely so that a competitive edge can be developed.
<P>
	This is only one in a long legacy of areas where the 
government has failed to help provide that competitive edge to 
Canadians. The most obvious one and the one that will follow 
the government to its grave is the fact that it has never really 
dealt with the debt and the deficit. That is what is taking the 
competitive edge off for a lot of businesses that want to sell 
around the world.
<P>
	The debt at $553 billion and a deficit of around $32 billion, if 
the projections do not go all out of whack because of a possible 
coming recession, have led to all kinds of problems that make it 
extremely difficult for businesses to get out into the world and 
compete. With that debt and deficit come high taxes. High taxes 
mean that costs go up. It also means that employees are the ones 
who are bearing a lot of those taxes. Will they demand higher 
wages? All of a sudden we have that  burden to contend with. It 
makes it extremely difficult to deal with other countries when 
we have those burdens.
<P>
	Another thing that happens with a big debt and deficit is all 
that competition for money. Canada is in a situation where it has 
to offer higher interest rates relative to the rest of the world. It is 
a problem with our main trading partner, the United States. It 
causes costs to go up for producers and businesses cannot be 
nearly as competitive as they would like to be.
<P>
	The government has failed people who want to export their 
products, whether it is within Canada or without, on a couple of 
fronts. First it has failed to knock down trade barriers. By not 
dealing with the debt and deficit it has also caused us to be in a 
situation where costs are such that it is hard to compete in the 
world.
<P>
	Another point I want to touch on briefly is the idea of training. 
The government and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development have gone to great lengths to talk about and hold 
studies into training and what can be done to make us more 
competitive in the world. The minister has created plans such as 
the Atlantic groundfish strategy. We all know where that has 
gone. There are whole towns in Newfoundland where the entire 
population is training to be hairdressers. That is not going to 
work.
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	The problem is that there are no jobs there. The reason there 
are no jobs is that the economy is so burdened with 
interprovincial trade barriers, so burdened with debt and taxes 
and interest rates that are higher than those in the U.S. for 
instance, relative to some of our trading partners, that we do not 
have jobs. Instead of worrying so much about government 
programs to train people, let us start providing jobs by scaling 
back the debt and deficit and scaling back the interest rates and 
taxes.
<P>
	Industry and small business will create the jobs. Do not worry 
about the government creating them. Small business can do that 
better than anybody.
<P>
	Let me conclude by saying that I think the government had 
good intentions when it brought in Bill C-88. It wanted to 
eliminate interprovincial trade barriers. However that is all it is, 
an ode to a good intention. It is something like teaching children 
about ethics and morals by telling them: ``Never make a promise 
you cannot keep''. The government made a promise in the red 
book and I do not think it kept it.
<P>
	I ask hon. members to improve the bill. I ask the government 
to make another effort in the very near future to bring about a 
meaningful interprovincial trade agreement.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="14134"> 14134 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the member 
talking in circles.
<P>
	If he were to make suggestions on how the bill could be 
amended and not just by going around what he thinks is in the 
bill, what specific recommendation would he make to ensure 
that we would have some internal agreements between the 
provinces and territories in order to facilitate trade?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry the hon. member 
missed what I said in my speech. The key thing that has to be 
done is the federal government has to use its constitutional 
authority and demand at some time if a consensus cannot be 
reached for the greater good of all Canadians, as opposed to the 
special interest groups who like being protected by some of the 
interprovincial trade barriers, that section 121 of the 
Constitution be used. It has the authority. It is time to go to court 
to determine that is the case.
<P>
	While it is good to try and reach a consensus because it is 
absolutely the route to go, in the end instead of thinking about 
provincial politicians and special interests, we have to think 
about Canadians. Let us do what is right for them. If it means 
that commerce needs to reside in the federal area let us do that. 
Our party has always championed decentralization. We have 
always been in the forefront on that because in general it works 
best.
<P>
	However on some issues, and I would say commerce is one of 
them, the authority more properly rests at the federal level. That 
is why section 121 of the Constitution needs to reign supreme.
<P>
	I believe there is growing support that this should be 
challenged in the courts the next time the provinces try and 
assert their authority in this area. I know I personally would 
speak very strongly in favour of pushing the issue in the courts if 
it comes to it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to clarify if the hon. member said that provincial politicians 
were special interests. That is the first point on which I would 
like him to elaborate.
<P>
	Second, did I hear him correctly when he suggested that the 
federal government should impose a solution on the provinces 
with respect to interprovincial trade rather than negotiate a 
solution?
<P>
<B>(1955 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, unless I made a mistake when 
speaking, I really did not mean to say that provinces were 
special interest groups. I am saying that people in those 
provinces very often do constitute special interests and they do 
want to protect their own areas.
<P>
	I guess it is whether we allow the special interest groups to 
impose their conditions on the rest of Canadians by making 
them pay a higher price for goods and services or whether the 
federal government uses the authority granted it under the 
Constitution simply to bring everybody into line and play by the 
rules that were laid out when the Constitution was set.
<P>
	Therefore I do not think we are really imposing anything on 
the provinces. We are simply asking them to play by the rules 
that were agreed to when the Constitution was established.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask my hon. colleague whether he might 
want to make a comment about the difference between 
governing and leading. Is it the role of the government to make 
sure that the laws of the land are obeyed and enforced or is there 
a need to provide some leadership, to create a vision so that the 
country can grow and develop and the economy can become 
more innovative?
<P>
	Would the hon. member make a comment about those two 
aspects?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. 
friend for the question.
<P>
	He has hit the nail on the head. We need to have some 
leadership in the country. First of all the Prime Minister has to 
enunciate his vision of the country. Maybe he can talk about 
competitiveness, interprovincial trade barriers and that kind of 
thing.
<P>
	He has to say that at the end of the day whatever we do has to 
be for the greater good. It has to be something that benefits the 
average taxpayer, the average consumer, not something that 
protects a group that happens to be noisy.
<P>
	We have to be consistent when we follow that plan. It should 
be a theme that flows through all the things the government 
addresses, all the legislation so we do not give into noisy 
interests, complainers and whiners. At the end of the day, we 
say: ``Let's do what is right for the greater good''.
<P>
	My friend has really hit the nail on the head. We did cave in 
this time to noisy special interests in many instances in Bill 
C-88.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is good to speak in the House over the supper 
hour. I see that we have more Liberals out than usual, therefore I 
appreciate the opportunity to be able to actually speak to 
members in the House on the other side.
<P>
	I would like to speak to the motion and the amendment that we 
have presented which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``that'' 
and substituting the following therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This House declines to give second reading to Bill C-88, an act to implement 
the agreement on internal trade because it fails to eliminate all interprovincial 
trade barriers.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14135"> 14135 </A></B>
<P>
	Approximately one year ago, the Canadian people witnessed 
the signing of a so-called and I use that term very loosely, 
historical agreement on internal trade. The signing of the 
agreement between the Prime Minister and the premiers of the 
10 provinces and the leaders of the two territories was to 
``reduce and eliminate to the extent possible barriers to free 
movement of persons, goods, services and investments within 
Canada and to establish an open, efficient and stable domestic 
market''.
<P>
	The Prime Minister called the signing significant, suggesting 
that the provincial, territorial and federal governments have 
taken a large step toward reducing internal trade barriers. A 
large step is the same as a small step if one is on a treadmill. That 
person is still in the same place. Likewise, we are not any closer 
to freer trade within Canada with this agreement than we were 
before.
<P>
	Canada has signed the NAFTA trade agreement and the World 
Trade Agreement. NAFTA will possibly be including Chile. 
However we have failed to bring down the barriers within 
Canada.
<P>
	A study done by John McCallum, chief economist of the 
Royal Bank and John Helliwell of the University of British 
Columbia suggests that the value of the interprovincial trade 
exceeds the value of trade with the United States, Mexico and 
Chile combined. That is astounding. The trade within Canada 
exceeds the trade we have in the North American continent and 
Chile. According to McCallum and Helliwell, ``as a generator of 
trade, the Canadian economic union is orders of magnitude more 
powerful than either NAFTA or the European Union''. Canada 
has entered into agreements with these countries to provide 
greater access to their markets, while we are promoting 
protectionism in the provinces and territories.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade does nothing to break down 
the walls of protectionism and allow the freeing up of 
interprovincial markets for companies right across the country. 
A study by the GATT published last year criticized the federal 
government and the provinces for not moving far enough in 
bringing down the interprovincial trade barriers. These trade 
barriers are inhibiting economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	The bottom line is, Canadian companies are losing their 
competitive edge. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the Canadian 
Manufacturers' Association and other business organizations 
are telling the government to get rid of these barriers. We may be 
able to hide under the shroud of protectionism in the short term, 
but the long term prospects are dim for this type of trade policy.
<P>
	Reformers are calling out clearly to Liberals saying it is time 
to wake up and smell the coffee. Now is the time to bring down 
domestic trade barriers. It should have happened yesterday 
because as we know, tomorrow never comes. It is like preaching 
democracy abroad and practising dictatorship at home.
<P>
	I say to the House that we are no closer to free trade with Bill 
C-88 than we are to having freer votes in the House of 
Commons. The word freedom and the Liberals do not seem to 
get along. The Liberals promised free votes but they reneged on 
that promise. Now they are trying to imply that we are moving 
toward freer trade in the country. However, when we look at the 
bill it is not really there. It is an illusion. It is not true.
<P>
	As already stated, the Reform Party does not like the trade 
agreement, nor does the business community like this trade 
agreement. It is a bad agreement which will continue to hurt 
consumers' pocketbooks.
<P>
	Let us talk about some examples. Within the supply managed 
sector of agriculture we have seen arrangements which do not 
make sense. For example, the province of British Columbia has 
approximately 13 per cent of the population but it is restricted to 
producing only 4.4 per cent of the industrial milk in the country. 
It must rely on Ontario and Quebec to supply processed milk 
products to consumers. Consumers of course must bear the extra 
cost of transporting these products to British Columbia. I am 
sure that dairy farmers in British Columbia would be quite open 
to producing larger quantities of industrial milk. This is not a 
level playing field and agreements such as the provisions 
contained in Bill C-88 do not fix the problem.
<P>
	The government is further deluding farmers by suggesting 
that they will be able to maintain protectionist enclaves. Can the 
government be open and honest with farmers? Under chapter 
nine of the internal trade agreement the ministers have agreed to 
``undertake a comprehensive review of the framework 
governing supply managed commodities and implement an 
action plan toward the development of sustainable orderly 
marketing systems in the Canadian dairy, poultry and egg 
industry''.
<P>
	Do we need another comprehensive review of supply 
managed commodities? The answer is an unequivocal no. 
Reviews do little to prepare farmers for what they will be facing 
in the next few years. The time is now to move and prepare 
farmers for an open and more competitive market economy. 
Farmers may reap the benefits of this myopic thinking in the 
short term, but they will have to pay the price down the road if 
we do not correct the situation soon.
<P>
	Removing the restrictions on the movement of agricultural 
products may be painful initially, but it will prepare farmers for 
the increased competition from south of the border. It will also 
make our domestic agricultural industry stronger rather than 
weaker.
<P>
	I would also like to talk about a couple of other consumer 
products that are exempt from this trade agreement namely, 
alcoholic beverages and electricity. I am not much of a beer 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14136"> 14136 </A></B>
<P>
drinker but beer drinkers will continue to be stifled when it 
comes to buying beer from other provinces. What if a 
Saskatchewan ex-patriot living in Ottawa would like a case of 
beer from a microbrewery in Saskatchewan? Chances are he 
would not be able to purchase the beer because of the trade 
barriers that are in place.
<P>
	This brings to mind a rather interesting incident that occurred 
to a brewery located in my home province a couple of years ago. 
The brewery wanted to market its beer in Alberta. However, 
Alberta had placed restrictions on beers from outside the 
province. Even Ralph Klein's Alberta wanted to implement 
some trade barriers which I do not think was very good of Mr. 
Klein. I think he ought to review these types of policies. It does 
not speak well for his administration.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	The brewery in Saskatchewan was forced to sell its beer at a 
higher price than that of the Alberta beer. To get around this, the 
Saskatchewan brewery placed a $2 bill inside each case of beer 
to offset the higher price it had to charge. Needless to say, the 
company was told to stop placing the money in the cases. It was 
a rather creative effort to market a product that was nipped in the 
bud and not allowed to be competitive.
<P>
	Our trade arrangements are preventing companies from 
developing a competitive advantage by continuing this 
absolutely disgraceful form of protectionism.
<P>
	I also want to briefly touch on electricity. It was also a product 
that was exempt from the agreement between the federal 
government and the provinces, the agreement that is embodied 
here in Bill C-88. The provinces and the federal government 
were unable to make headway on this one as well. As a result 
what happens? Consumers in Ontario will still be unable to use 
the cheaper electricity from Quebec or Manitoba which in many 
cases is available to them. In addition, higher rates for 
electricity for manufacturers are passed down by the 
manufacturers to the consumers in the products they produce.
<P>
	Why should consumers and manufacturers be held hostage to 
utility companies when less expensive sources are available? 
Maybe such shortsightedness on the part of the Ontario 
government concerning interprovincial trade barriers is part of 
the reason that Bob Rae got dumped the other day and the people 
of Ontario chose another government. People are not dumb. 
They realize they are paying for these foolish trading practices 
within Canada out of their own pockets. It is not the 
manufacturers that pay in the long run. It is not the governments 
that reap the benefits of these trade barriers. It is the consumers 
across Canada in every province who end up being hit right in 
the wallet, right where it counts the most.
<P>
	I want to talk about my own province. The government in the 
province of Saskatchewan has entered this agreement with the 
largest number of exemptions. I am ashamed at the number of 
exempt agencies in this agreement. The following government 
entities will be exempt from the internal trade agreement. 
Fasten your seat belt, Madam Speaker, because the list is long.
<P>
	Treasury Board crowns include: the Agricultural Credit 
Corporation, Agricultural Development Fund Corporation, the 
Energy Conservation and Development Authority, Municipal 
Financing Corporation, New Careers Corporation, Prairie 
Agricultural Machinery Institute, Saskatchewan Crop Insurance 
Corporation, Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority, 
Saskatchewan Grain Car Corporation, Saskatchewan 
Government Printing Company, Saskatchewan Housing 
Corporation, Saskatchewan Municipal Board, Saskatchewan 
Research Council and Saskatchewan Wetland Conservation 
Corporation.
<P>
	We then go on to the government enterprises, the crown 
investment corporations themselves. We have the encompassing 
CIC, the Crown Investment Corporation which is exempt from 
the internal trade agreement. The Saskatchewan Government 
Growth Fund Management Corporation is also exempt. 
Saskatchewan Economic Development Corporation; 
SaskEnergy Incorporated, which provides us with our natural 
gas; Saskatchewan Forest Products Corporation; Saskatchewan 
Gaming Corporation; Saskatchewan Government Insurance, 
which provides us with insurance for our cars and homes; 
Saskatchewan Opportunities Corporation; Saskatchewan Power 
Corporation; Saskatchewan Telecommunications; 
Saskatchewan Transportation Company; and the Saskatchewan 
Water Corporation are all exempt. This is a long list.
<P>
	There are other boards, agencies and commissions which 
include: the Board of Internal Economy, the Electoral Office, 
the Liquor Board Superannuation Commission, the Liquor and 
Gaming Licensing Commission, the Saskatchewan Arts Board, 
the Saskatchewan Pension Plan, the Saskatchewan Power 
Corporation Superannuation Board, the Western Development 
Museum Board, the Workers' Compensation Board of 
Saskatchewan and the Workers' Compensation Superannuation 
Board. These are all exempt from Bill C-88 which is supposed 
to restrict interprovincial trade barriers.
<P>
	The Saskatchewan government will continue to be able to 
procure products from local producers. The provincial 
government argues that preferential procurement helps local 
producers and lowers unemployment in the provinces. 
Essentially the provincial governments are taking away money 
from the taxpayers and returning it to local producers. Most of 
the time the government ends up paying the local producers 
more money than it would pay for the product from 
neighbouring provinces.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14137"> 14137 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2010) </B>
<P>
	Companies outside of Saskatchewan will not have access to 
all the government agencies listed as exempt from the internal 
trade agreement. We ask the question. Will those companies 
lobby their provincial governments to use retaliatory measures 
against Saskatchewan companies competing for government 
contracts? This type of policy precipitates the building of trade 
barriers, not free trade.
<P>
	I want to give another example. Just a few months before the 
last election I was at a trade fair in my province of 
Saskatchewan. I was talking to people about the Reform Party's 
policies and of course they were quite excited about that. They 
were buying memberships and were enthusiastic about Reform. 
They were saying that they certainly would not vote Liberal 
when they compared Liberals with Reformers.
<P>
	I was talking to one gentleman who told me he designed 
security systems. He said he had been able to design a security 
system for a customer in the province of Alberta. I thought that 
was wonderful. It was good to see some entrepreneurial spirit in 
my province of Saskatchewan. It was good to see that this person 
had been able to do some work for a neighbouring province. He 
said that his customer had been able to buy his expertise. He also 
sells the equipment but he was not allowed to even put a tender 
in on the contract for the security system. There is a trade barrier 
between Alberta and Saskatchewan and his products cannot 
even cross the border into Alberta.
<P>
	I thought, my goodness what is wrong with our province? 
Saskatchewan is putting up barriers not to let competitors from 
outside Saskatchewan deal in the province. Other provinces for 
example, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, British 
Columbia are doing likewise and we are getting into a spitting 
war. Who is being hurt? Of course it is you and I, Madam 
Speaker. The Canadian citizens who have to pay the bills and 
pay for the product are getting the short end of the stick.
<P>
	Most individuals in my province agree that discriminatory 
trade practices and protectionism are harmful to the province in 
the long run. We may win the odd little battle in this trade war 
but in the long run we all lose.
<P>
	The current provincial government is of the opinion that it 
must cushion the shock of external competition by continuing 
the practice of preferential procurement. This will not help the 
people of Saskatchewan in the future when the pressures of the 
global community end the enclaves of protectionism. The 
Saskatchewan government and this Liberal government must 
realize that short term trends quickly become permanent 
policies. The time is now to prepare companies and the 
workforce for new opportunities.
<P>
	What is the solution to the problems I have outlined? I have 
been very critical. I think my criticism is fair and just. It is also 
incumbent upon us on the opposition side to suggest some 
solutions. We are saying that we should eliminate all 
interprovincial trade barriers. It is absolutely ridiculous that it is 
easier to trade internationally than it is within the borders of this 
country.
<P>
	It is insane that our trade barriers from province to province 
are costing consumers $6 billion to $8 billion every year. They 
are increasing our costs of surviving in this country. We are 
making more progress with Chile, the United States and our 
European trading partners than we are between our own 
provinces.
<P>
	Closed systems such as the one we have in Canada fly in the 
face of recently signed international trade agreements. Modest 
estimates as I said place the cost of these trade barriers around 
$6 billion to $8 billion. One figure I ran across came to $6.5 
billion per year.
<P>
	Freeing up that amount of capital will result in market growth 
which will in turn result in lower prices for consumers and 
greater competition for producers. As I already mentioned, 
greater competition will prepare Canadian companies for the 
onslaught of freer international trade.
<P>
	Reformers believe that a trade agreement can, and I want to 
emphasize can, be brought to fruition preferably through an 
agreement between the federal government and the provinces 
but failing that through constitutional challenges. The federal 
government has the power under the current Constitution to 
eliminate the trade barriers. I want to read section 12 of the BNA 
Act which states: ``All articles of growth, produce or 
manufacture of any one of the provinces shall be admitted free 
into each of the other provinces''. That is in our BNA Act. When 
will this government be prepared to take the big step off of the 
treadmill that is taking us nowhere and move toward freer trade 
in this country?
<P>
	I want to close with a challenge. I challenge this government 
to not continue giving us nonsense like Bill C-88 which is just 
window dressing and no substance. I am going to ask 
government members to get off their hands. They have been 
sitting on their hands on a lot of issues.
<P>
<B>(2015 ) </B>
<P>
	They are sitting on their hands on this interprovincial barrier 
situation. I challenge the government members. They should get 
off their hands, and do something about the problem, really get 
down to brass tacks with the provincial governments. Should 
they refuse to bring down these trade barriers that are hurting us 
all, they are costing families in this country thousands of dollars 
in increased costs. Get down to business. And if they cannot 
come to an agreement with the provinces, then use some of the 
constitutional clout they have in the BNA Act to get the job 
<P>
<HR>

weak-kneed legislation like Bill C-88 before the House of

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (for the Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of the Environment)</B> moved that Bill C-94, an act to 
regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation for 
commercial purposes of certain manganese-based substances, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very happy to start off this debate on a bill concerning a fuel 
additive called manganese.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In English it is referred to in technical terms as MMT, 
nevertheless implying that we are dealing here with a substance 
called according to a technical name, MMT. It contains a 
chemical substance called manganese. It is well known in 
chemistry as well as in geology and in the mineral disciplines as 
being one that can be dangerous to human health.
<P>
<B>(2020) </B>
<P>
	This bill aims very simply at bringing about a decision in 
Canada that was launched and concluded successfully south of 
the border well over 16 years ago, more precisely in 1978. At the 
time the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington 
concluded as a result of studies conducted there that it was 
essential in the public interest to do away with manganese as an 
additive to gasoline.
<P>
	This bill attempts today to bring to the attention of members 
and the public the importance to do the same now in Canada, not 
just for environmental reasons but also for technical reasons, 
not just for public health reasons but also because the 
automotive industry has by virtue of technological change 
reached a level where it actually depends on the elimination of 
manganese from gasoline.
<P>
	It must be said for the record that Canada is probably the only 
country in the world that is still using manganese. As a result of 
that, for the reasons I have just outlined, the situation has 
reached a point where it is absolutely essential that we move on 
this issue and deal with it.
<P>
	The engineers in the automotive industry are telling us that 
manganese impairs the performance of pollution control 
equipment in cars and trucks. The automakers in Canada and in 
the United States are now producing cars with systems that can 
tell the driver how well and whether the pollution control 
equipment is working.
<P>
	Manganese in gasoline does not permit automakers to give the 
driver of the vehicle the benefit of using the pollution control 
equipment because manganese is incompatible with this kind of 
equipment. I am told that automakers will have to disconnect 
this kind of equipment in Canada if gasoline continues to 
contain manganese.
<P>
	The consequences for consumers are manifold. First the 
warranty of the engine will be affected. It will not be extended as 
far as it could be extended with this kind of equipment to the 
benefit of the consumer. Second the performance of the engine 
could be affected because of the inability of the driver to know 
whether certain parts of the equipment are functioning. The 
third consequence is complementary to the second point: the 
driver will not know whether the catalytic converter is working 
or not, whether the anti-pollution devices in the car are properly 
functioning and therefore the driver will not know whether the 
equipment installed in the car is working in the manner it is 
supposed to in terms of pollution controls.
<P>
	The scientists in our community are also informing us that 
manganese in gasoline means risking greater pollution in the 
form of smog, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.
<P>
	Automakers in Canada have told the government they want 
the elimination of manganese in gasoline. They are 
technologically ready for it. Actually they are well  beyond this 
point. They all say that manganese adversely affects the onboard 
diagnostic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14139"> 14139 </A></B>
<P>
systems, which is a fancy word for indicating the types of 
devices that inform the driver whether the anti-pollution 
equipment is working or not. In other words, the driver will not 
have the ability to tell whether or not the pollution control 
equipment installed in the car is working or not.
<P>
<B>(2025) </B>
<P>
	Members will quickly realize therefore the importance in the 
public interest of this measure proposed by the Minister of the 
Environment, who has been working on this initiative for some 
time already and who has been behind the scenes pushing the 
interested industries, petroleum on the one hand and the 
automakers on the other-and the latter is being quite keen and 
cooperative-to bring this matter to a solution without 
legislation.
<P>
	It is only fair to say that the federal government has waited for 
the automotive and the petroleum industries to resolve this 
problem without legislation. Unfortunately, the problem has not 
been resolved.
<P>
	The automakers at the very moment as we have this debate are 
now manufacturing the diagnostic system for the 1996 models. 
We are now debating this matter at the eleventh hour, and the 
government finds it necessary to present and pass this 
legislation in the speediest manner possible.
<P>
	The government is doing this with three purposes in mind: 
number one, as I mentioned earlier, to protect human health; 
number two, to protect the warranty of the car to the benefit of 
the consumer; and number three, to take advantage of 
technological change and reap the benefits offered by these 
diagnostic systems, which are higher efficiency for the engine, 
lower consumption, and of course, quite important, pollution 
prevention.
<P>
	The question might arise as to who is opposed to this bill. 
Obviously the only opposition at this stage can be identified 
among those who are the suppliers of manganese, some 
multinational companies, which do not really have at heart the 
public interest.
<P>
	Remember that MMT, the substance that contains manganese, 
was banned already in 1978 and for very precise health reasons. 
This issue has been on the agenda of publicly concerned 
legislators for some time.
<P>
	Members remember leaded gasoline. Lead is one of the most 
poisonous substances which poses a danger to human health, 
particularly to children. It has been removed therefore from 
gasoline, from toys, from paints. Who was opposed at the time 
when lead was to be removed from these products? It was the 
very same people who now oppose the removal of manganese 
from gasoline.
<P>
	It can be said in conclusion that in Canada there are 18 
automobile companies that view this bill as needed and 
desirable. They see it of course from their perspective as being 
involved in the motor vehicle production centre.  As a 
Parliament we have to take a view also to include health 
considerations and consumer protection considerations. It is 
therefore for these three reasons put together that we think this 
is a bill that commands the attention and positive reception on 
the part of colleagues and members of this House in the hope 
that they will consider it in a favourable manner tonight and give 
it speedy consideration so it can be passed and put at work for 
the benefit of Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
<B>(2030) </B>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today we start second reading of Bill C-94, an act to regulate the 
provincial trade in and the importation for commercial purposes 
of certain manganese-based substances. More specifically, Bill 
C-94 is aimed at banning the addition of a substance called 
MMT to unleaded gasoline in Canada. This bill would allow the 
Minister of the Environment to rid Canada of MMT, a substance 
which, I would like to remind you, has been added to our 
gasoline since 1977.
<P>
	The minister is tabling this bill as the session is drawing to a 
close, and she appears eager to have it passed as quickly as 
possible. The minister's approach denotes a certain uneasiness 
in this matter, an uneasiness that may be due to pressure from 
automotive manufacturers who, coincidentally, are 
concentrated in her region. Far be it from me to think that the 
minister has decided to ban MMT in Canada for the sole purpose 
of addressing the automotive industry's concerns. I am 
convinced that she is acting in the public interest and that her 
first concern in making decisions is for the environment. At 
least, that is what we should expect from the minister.
<P>
	However, in the case of MMT, the minister's intentions are 
not clear and she appears unwilling to disclose the real 
motivation behind this decision. Her arguments seem lame and 
questionable. The minister also acts in similar fashion in several 
other matters. What she is saying in this and other cases and the 
information she spreads are not likely to reassure the public, let 
alone environmental groups.
<P>
	Her knowledge of the issues appears deficient and inadequate, 
robbing her of the credibility that is needed if not essential in 
such a position. This, incidentally, reminds me of the raising of 
the <I>Irving Whale</I>, the barge belonging to the Irving company, 
which has been lying at the bottom of the Gulf of St. Lawrence 
since 1970 with 3,100 tonnes of bunker C fuel oil on board. In 
this matter, the minister has said all kinds of things on how the 
barge will be removed. Recently, the minister and her press 
secretary even came up with their own raising technique, which 
is not mentioned anywhere in the bidding documents.
<P>
	I listened to a recording of an interview with the minister on 
this subject on CBGA, a CBC radio station in the Magdalen 
Islands. What I heard was utterly  ludicrous. Informed people 
must have shuddered when they heard the minister talk about 
using something like a rubber dinghy, a sort of enormous 
condom to enclose the barge 200 feet under water. That is totally 
ridiculous. Who will tell the minister to stop saying the first 
thing that comes to mind? Who will tell the minister to familiar-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14140"> 14140 </A></B>
<P>
ize herself with the issues, to look at them before spewing out 
incorrect information? Who from the cabinet or her department 
will ask the minister to be more careful in her rhetorical 
outbursts which are so nefarious for the environment?
<P>
	I will now close my comments on the Irving Whale with my 
sincere wishes that its salvaging, which will take place this 
summer, will not turn into an ecological catastrophe. The 
devastating effects would be felt for years to come and, by and 
large, the minister would be held personally responsible. There 
are similarities between the Irving Whale, the MMT issue and 
many others. The links between all of these cases and decisions 
are haste and a lackadaisical approach.
<P>
	Add to that a rather murky transparency and a lack of will to 
provide pertinent information, and we find ourselves in very 
worrisome situations and we find that the Minister of the 
Environment is increasingly challenged by specialists in the 
field.
<P>
<B>(2035) </B>
<P>
	Judging from the minister's actions, one would almost 
conclude that she is in a leadership race and that she is feeling 
ignored by the media. One would almost believe that she is 
suddenly suffering from a lack of visibility and that it was 
absolutely necessary for her to present us with something: 
statements from the minister, bills and new policies 
unexpectedly introduced in the House with no rhyme or reason. 
They are presented to us piecemeal with no real indication of 
any will on the part of the minister to draw up a game plan or to 
create a cohesive environmental policy.
<P>
	Why is the minister acting this way? Why does she always 
want to introduce initiatives as if she were pulling a rabbit out of 
a hat? The answer is simple: the environment is not on the 
Liberals' list of priorities. The evidence is clear. Since the Grits 
came to power, important environmental issues have not been 
dealt with. The promises in the red bible have been thrown out in 
the garbage, hardly appropriate in this case.
<P>
	In fact, this comes as no surprise, since the whole red bible 
has been shelved. The abdication of responsibility is deplorable. 
The Liberals, starting with the Deputy Prime Minister, have not 
done much to improve, preserve and protect our environment.
<P>
	However, some hon. members opposite are very concerned 
about the environment. We know them well. The hon. member 
for Davenport, himself a former minister of the environment; 
the hon. member for York-Simcoe; and the Quebec member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, former minister of PCBs in 
Quebec, are all great environmentalists. Like us, they  must be 
aware of their government's abdication of its responsibilities. 
But what can they do if their hands are tied and they do not have 
the ear of the minister and the cabinet?
<P>
	Yes, the minister did shout right and left, and she did spout 
some high sounding ideas here and there. The minister even 
went so far as to believe and to say out loud that Canada was a 
world leader on environmental issues. Now that was rather 
unfortunate, because when we consider the Liberals' record in 
this area, it is clear all this is just window dressing. The minister 
creates a diversion to camouflage the government's lack of 
commitment.
<P>
	For instance, the Sierra Club published its environmental 
report card at the beginning of this month. The result: The 
minister got a B+, the threesome consisting of the ministers of 
Foreign Affairs, Finance and Industry got an F, for failing, and 
finally, the Prime Minister got a D with a reprimand that he had 
failed to instruct his cabinet to achieve the red book's objective 
to reduce greenhouse gases 20 per cent by the year 2005.
<P>
	All this confirms what we in the Bloc have maintained since 
the very beginning, which is that the Liberals are all talk but no 
action. The cabinet's strategy consists merely in putting the 
minister on stage to make a lot of high sounding promises. The 
cabinet has no compunction in sacrificing the minister and, what 
is worse, the environment as well.
<P>
	The minister should feel somewhat embarrassed about 
playing this role at the behest of cabinet. In playing this role, 
which suits her very well given her verbal facility-she might be 
called a motor mouth-, the minister is losing a certain 
credibility, however.
<P>
	In addition, however, given the rather mixed results in 
environmental matters, it is clear the minister is no cabinet 
heavy weight. The ministers who got an ``F'' from the Sierra 
Club are the uncontested leaders establishing the environmental 
agenda. The environmental cause is certainly not advanced by 
those with the lowest mark.
<P>
	This inaction and lack of environmental will leads in the end 
to trivialities, essentially no results. It started off well enough 
with actions being chosen that required the government itself to 
carry out internal measures, if I can put it that way, but we have 
seen no external measures, which would have greater benefit.
<P>
	Our government therefore shows little interest in the 
environment and lacks an overall vision and policy. We have a 
government and a minister that can act only within the system 
and, on a few occasions, outside it, as in the case of the bill 
before us today.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14141"> 14141 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals are favouring a piecemeal environment policy, 
which is a definite step backwards and a shameful reduction on 
their part. The best example of their throwing in the towel is 
undoubtedly their dropping the green plan. This plan, which was 
introduced in 1990, was an overall action plan. It was 
spearheaded by the Department of the Environment, which was 
responsible for various aspects of its implementation, and 
inspired by an environmental philosophy. The dropping of this 
plan represents an unprecedented withdrawal. We are going 
back many years because of the lack of sensitivity and will on 
the part of decision makers who deal with the environment as if 
it were a fashionable issue. Polls reveal that the environment is 
no longer a hot topic. Decision makers react stupidly, putting 
this issue on the back burner and withdrawing from initiatives 
already under way.
<P>
	By dropping the Green Plan, they are definitely saying no to a 
co-ordinated approach. The minister is replacing a coherent 
plan, which was spearheaded by a department with a specific 
budget, by a system which leaves every department free to do 
what it wants. It is as if someone had decided to scatter pieces 
from a puzzle all over the place. There would no longer be any 
relationship between them, and the final objective would 
become unattainable. This is what the government is doing now, 
it is dividing up the environment, much to its detriment.
<P>
	I will remind you that the Green Plan, for which the initial 
budget was supposed to be around $3.5 billion over five years, 
never amounted to more than $800 million. This is far short of 
the initial goal. Those responsible for backing away from this 
ecological commitment are the people on the other side and the 
Conservatives who preceded them. The ministers, whether blue 
or red, did not have the will to pursue this innovative plan, to 
modify it and to perfect it, to make it responsive to the needs of 
the environment. Therefore, the budget melted like new snow in 
May, without anybody paying any attention. What a pity. What 
irresponsibility and lack of respect towards our environment. 
Sincerely, I do not believe that this is the way to proceed if we 
want to leave our children a sound and natural environment 
capable of answering their needs. The nice sounding principles 
of sustainable development, biodiversity, and ecosystemic 
approach people use when they talk about environment, are far 
from reaching the decision makers and therefore very far from 
having a chance of being implemented.
<P>
	The bill we are considering today deals with something that 
will take place outside of government. With this bill, the 
government will be able to prohibit the importation and 
interprovincial trade of certain substances containing 
manganese. The first targeted product is MMT, a chemical 
added to unleaded gasoline to increase its octane rating. For a 
start, the bill raises a number of questions as to its 
appropriateness and timing.
<P>
	Let us remember that on April 5 of this year, the Minister of 
the Environment announced in a press release her intention of 
introducing this bill as soon as possible. Indeed, it received first 
reading on May 19 of this year. In her press release, the minister 
said and I quote: ``This initiative will allow Canadians to 
continue to enjoy the benefits of technical advances in the area 
of car emission control, and to receive a protection equal to the 
one received by citizens in the United States''.
<P>
	With this bill, it is obvious that the minister is specifically 
responding to auto makers who claim that MMT additive clogs 
up the pollution control equipment. And to bring more pressure 
to bear, auto makers said that if MMT was not banned, it could 
cost $3,000 more to buy a car, warranties could be reduced and 
the pollution control system could even be disconnected. We 
might see in this some sort of blackmailing by the industry but, 
according to the minister, it seems to be serious.
<P>
<B>(2045) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment then decides to take this 
prohibiting measure, not because of the polluting or toxic 
effects of MMT, but because of its effects on an anti-pollution 
system that will be incorporated into cars in 1996.
<P>
	The proof that MMT in itself is not recognized as a toxic or 
dangerous product is that the minister cannot regulate this 
product under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, the 
CEPA, which applies specifically to toxic products. So, she has 
no other alternative than to pass separate legislation.
<P>
	In her press release of April 5, the minister indicated that this 
decision was taken after almost two years of discussions with 
the petroleum and automobile industries. We could question the 
relevance and value of these discussions, since the minister told 
the parties at the outset that failure to reach an agreement would 
result in legislation to ban MMT.
<P>
	By disclosing this intention, did the minister not introduce a 
significant bias in the discussions? Had she not just told the 
automotive industry: It is not necessary to discuss everything at 
length, since I already support you and intend to introduce a bill. 
The minister showed her clear bias in favour of the automotive 
industry, which wants to get rid of MMT and all other additives. 
In that regard, I wonder what will happen to ethanol, a star 
additive for which the government has just launched a $70 
million investment program.
<P>
	If the automotive industry does not want any additives, why 
does the government want to develop this product? Is there not a 
flagrant inconsistency in the decision to ban an additive and the 
intention of developing a different one, when the automotive 
industry does not want any additives? Who can assure us that the 
automotive industry will not soon ask the government to ban 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14142"> 14142 </A></B>
<P>
ethanol because of its negative effects on car parts and  
equipment? I think that prudence is called for in the 
development of ethanol.
<P>
	Ethyl, the maker of this additive, has responded to the 
automotive industry's arguments on MMT with its own 
arguments, which seem quite valid. Let us have a look at them.
<P>
	Removing MMT from gasoline would aggravate the urban 
smog problem by increasing nitrogen dioxide emissions by 20 
per cent. According to Health Canada studies, MMT presents no 
notable danger to human health. Independent lab tests show that, 
contrary to statements made by auto industry officials, the MMT 
used in Canada is perfectly compatible with the new 
anti-pollution devices, including the OBD-II diagnostic 
system.
<P>
	Again, according to Ethyl, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency is about to reintroduce MMT in that country, following 
a decision made on April 14, 1995, by the U.S. Court of Appeal 
for the district of Columbia, which instructed the American 
agency to lift the MMT ban and allow its use in lead-free 
gasoline. The use of MMT at the refining stage results in fewer 
emissions of some pollutants. Replacing MMT will cost 
refineries about $100 million in capital costs, as well as tens of 
millions in operating costs.
<P>
	These are the arguments put forth by the producer of MMT 
and the oil industry. Given all this, it is not easy to make a 
decision in favour of one party or the other. The arguments used 
by both sides seem valid. However, they are also hard to 
evaluate and verify.
<P>
	These arguments give rise to a series of questions, and the 
answers to these questions are not obvious. This is why Bill 
C-94 generates so much ambivalence and reservations.
<P>
	The first question we must ask ourselves, and this is very 
important, is whether or not the automobile industry will indeed 
go ahead and increase the cost of cars, reduce the guarantees 
provided, and disconnect the monitoring system and other 
anti-pollution devices as early as August 1996, if MMT is not 
removed from lead-free gas.
<P>
<B>(2050) </B>
<P>
	You can imagine the harmful effects of such a decision on 
Canadian consumers. That possibility is based on the position of 
auto manufacturers, who feel that the MMT clogs their systems 
and makes them less efficient. This malfunctioning of the 
anti-pollution systems is said to result in more pollutants being 
released, thus affecting air quality.
<P>
	This is certainly not what we hope for, after making 
encouraging progress regarding exhaust emissions. According 
to a recent study sponsored by the Canadian Automobile 
Association, the new emission standards helped to significantly 
improve air quality. This study also showed that, over a distance 
of 1 kilometre, a 1970 car caused more pollution than twenty 
1995 cars.
<P>
	The credit for part of the progress made must go to the 
automotive industry. Through R and D, it has improved its 
pollution control devices. The industry knows everything there 
is to know about the devices installed on their products. So, if it 
tells us that MMT is bad for its systems, then, we must certainly 
agree with them or at least give them the benefit of the doubt.
<P>
	But there is a snag. Ethyl Corporation indicates that some 
independent tests performed on cars have shown that MMT is 
not harmful to pollution control devices, despite what the 
automotive industry has said.
<P>
	In fact, the Environmental Protection Agency in the United 
States has recognized that the automobile industry's concerns 
over the fouling of the devices were groundless. So, what should 
we make of the allegations made by the motor vehicle 
manufacturers? To the question, does MMT make the pollution 
control devices defective, the answer, Madam Speaker, is not 
that obvious.
<P>
	We should also ask ourselves the following question. Is MMT 
a pollutant in itself and will its elimination from gasoline sold in 
Canada increase smog in urban areas, as the Ethyl Corporation 
would have us believe? First of all, according to a Health Canada 
study, dated December 6, 1994, MMT does not have any adverse 
health effect. Second, experts say that there is no evidence that 
the elimination of MMT from gasoline would increase urban 
smog. It seems that, in Canada, conditions contributing to urban 
smog, including sunshine and temperature, are not combined 
often enough for the elimination of MMT to cause an increase in 
this phenomenon.
<P>
	According to Ethyl, MMT reduces by 20 per cent nitrous 
oxide emissions that contribute to the formation of smog. But 
here, in Canada, it is not clear that increased nitrous oxide 
emissions meet the necessary conditions to contribute to the 
formation of urban smog.
<P>
	If MMT is so effective in reducing smog, why is it banned in 
large American cities where smog is much more of a problem 
than in Canadian cities? I think we should ask ourselves this 
question. Why would the United States ban a product that would 
be beneficial?
<P>
	On the issue of increased nitrous oxide emissions, it seems 
that, thanks to a more sophisticated system, 1996 car models 
will help further reduce exhaust gas emissions, which, 
according to some people, would compensate largely for the 
increased 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14143"> 14143 </A></B>
<P>
nitrous oxide emissions caused by the elimination of MMT, but 
this has yet to be proven.
<P>
	It must be noted that all these arguments are put forward by 
the concerned parties. Therefore, it is not easy to make a fair 
evaluation of them since it is in the best interest of the parties to 
present them to us in a favourable light.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that urban smog is not a problem in 
Canadian cities, but the temperatures we have had these past few 
days certainly prove me wrong. Because of the heat wave, there 
has been a smog advisory in effect in Toronto for the last two 
days. The Montreal area has also been suffering from an 
increase in air pollution. The present situation in these two large 
cities is certainly food for thought.
<P>
	If it were true that MMT reduces nitrous oxide emissions by 
20 per cent, what would be the air pollution level in these large 
cities if this additive was not present in gasoline?
<P>
<B>(2055) </B>
<P>
	If Ethyl's argument turns out to be right, can we knowingly 
and legally allow the quality of the air we breathe to be 
adversely affected? Another important question is whether the 
Environmental Protection Agency is going to reintroduce MMT 
into gasoline in the United States in the very near future, as 
Ethyl claims? Preliminary indications are that the EPA may 
indeed allow MMT back on the market. In fact, the United States 
court of appeal for the District of Columbia has issued a 
mandate ordering the EPA to grant a waiver permitting the use of 
MMT.
<P>
	However, certain sources tell us that concrete action is still far 
off and that, for a number of years now, Ethyl has been returning 
regularly to the charge with the EPA. Until now, Ethyl's 
demands were always turned down. This time, however, it seems 
that the chances are much better. Ethyl conducted a battery of 
tests on a significant number of automobiles and met the EPA 
requirements. According to Ethyl, the tests carried out prove 
that MMT does not clog the spark plugs, catalytic converters, or 
exhaust gas oxygen probes, nor is it dangerous to public health. 
It will be interesting to see where our neighbours to the south go 
with this issue.
<P>
	The impact on the petroleum industry raises another 
important question. According to this industry, removing MMT 
from their unleaded gas will result in relatively high conversion 
costs. Furthermore, the industry claims that MMT is a good 
additive which is easily mixed with gas and is making no bones 
about its support for the additive.
<P>
	Therefore, if we do away with MMT, what kind of additive 
will take its place? This is another interesting avenue of inquiry 
to consider. If we drop MMT, a very good additive according to 
the oil industry, we will have to replace it with something else. 
Currently, it appears that the Liberal government favours 
ethanol as the replacement. We know, in fact, that a big plant is 
being built in Chatham, in southern Ontario. This plant, which 
will be built in two phases at a cost of $270 million,  would have 
a production capacity of 300 million litres of ethanol from corn 
annually.
<P>
	It would appear that this construction project is just waiting 
for the go ahead from Treasury Board. An article which 
appeared in the <I>London Free Press</I> on June 14 clearly said the 
following: ``The paperwork sealing the federal government's 
ethanol policy, essential for the construction of a massive 
ethanol plant here, is expected to be signed imminently''.
<P>
	There you have it. The ethanol plant in Chatham is waiting for 
federal assistance. But is this plant which will produce ethanol, 
an additive, connected in any way to the bill prohibiting MMT, 
another additive? Is the government favouring ethanol produced 
from corn grown in Ontario, the very red Liberal province in this 
Parliament? Please note that producing ethanol from corn is 
financially and ecologically costly. The government is cutting 
taxes associated with ethanol and is considerably reducing the 
production capacity of our land, all the while increasing 
pollution, given the fertilizers and pesticides used to grow corn. 
It is therefore most desirable that the Liberals make the right 
choice when opting for ethanol.
<P>
	After thoroughly analyzing all of the arguments regarding 
MMT and all of the related issues, it is clear that we have to shed 
more light on the whole issue. I firmly believe that all hon. 
members who are evaluating this bill need more information, 
more details from all of the parties concerned and also from all 
concerned parties who have no stake in the issue. We would then 
be in a better position to weigh the pros and the cons. At this 
stage in the debate, despite everything, we look favourably upon 
this bill. However, we have many serious reservations which 
will have to be laid to rest when the bill is studied in committee.
<P>
<B>(2100) </B>
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to add, after having spoken to the 
hon. member for Davenport, that it is imperative that the 
chairman of the committee, assisted by his clerk make every 
effort to hear as many witnesses as possible, whether they are for 
or against the bill, and to give us enough time with them so that 
we can really find out what the best solution is from the 
environmental point of view.
<P>
	Should we use MMT? Should we ban MMT? Should we use 
ethanol? Should we concentrate on another product? We need 
clarification. I ask that we be given enough time to meet all the 
witnesses concerned.
<P>
	From what I have heard, it seems we will proceed with third 
reading very soon. I do not think we will be ready to start third 
reading unless we have shed some light on these issues and until 
we are really convinced that banning MMT in Canada-the 
United States may do so six months from now-is the right 
decision and that we are not merely putting the oil companies or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14144"> 14144 </A></B>
<P>
other businesses to additional expense just to pass a bill that 
looks good to the public.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order to 
inquire whether you are permitting questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The first three speakers 
will have a maximum of 40 minutes with no questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, balance is needed and I hope this is what I can 
represent as I respond to the government on Bill C-94.
<P>
	It is amazing how quickly the bill got to this stage. I take it the 
environment minister feels this bill is more important than Bill 
C-83, an act to amend the Auditor General Act, which was a red 
book promise. I suppose large companies like General Motors, 
Ford and Chrysler are not pushing to pass a bill that would create 
a commissioner to the auditor general's office like Bill C-83 
would do.
<P>
	Every Canadian knows of the power of the big three auto 
manufacturers. What they want they seem to get from the 
minister. In this case they wanted the help of the minister to ban 
the octane enhancer MMT from Canadian gasoline, and help is 
exactly what they got.
<P>
	When the minister held her press conference on May 19 she 
said that the data the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association 
presented to her clearly convinced her that MMT was bad for 
automobiles and for Canadians. She did not comment on the 
evidence presented to her by Ethyl Corporation. When the 
minister was asked to comment on that she simply stated that 
she did not need to see Ethyl's data because what the MVMA 
presented was correct and there was no refuting it. Essentially 
what the minister was saying was that Ethyl's data was wrong 
and the data from the MVMA was correct, but she would not 
fully admit it.
<P>
	The minister knows very well what the best solution would be 
to this entire debate. She knows that a series of independent 
third party tests are needed but she will not initiate it or facilitate 
it happening.
<P>
	As members of the House and more important as 
representatives of all Canadians, it is important that we weigh 
and pursue every available option to come up with an accurate 
conclusion before we create any legislation. The Liberal 
government calls itself responsible but I ask what is really 
meant by the term responsible in view of Bill C-94. In these 
technical matters it certainly does not hurt to demonstrate and 
then legislate.
<P>
	Some important questions should be asked on the banning of 
this substance. First, was the evidence brought forward based on 
accurate data and was it performed by independent testers? 
Second, who paid for the evaluators and who are they 
accountable to? Third, what will be the cost implications to 
consumers both in financial and in environmental terms? I think 
it is who pays is at the  bottom of the government's capitulation 
to the MVMA lobby.
<P>
	I want to deal with how the minister came to the decision to 
ban MMT. Apparently on September 12 last year representatives 
from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler met with the minister 
to discuss the banning of MMT.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	They told her that if MMT was still in gasoline in August 
1995, a time when all new model cars were released, they would 
do one of maybe three things. First they would raise the price of 
each automobile by about $3,000. Second they would void 
sections of their cars warranties and/or close down some high 
tech Canadian manufacturing facilities.
<P>
	The minister got spooked in a big way. This was the big three 
as well as a few other importer tag-alongs telling her what to do. 
They threatened to close up automotive plants and most of the 
plants are located not too far from her constituency of Hamilton 
East and certainly in southwestern Ontario.
<P>
	The political decision apparently was not too difficult: ban 
MMT. About a month following the meeting the minister told a 
reporter that unless the fuel industry moved MMT from its 
products voluntarily the government was going to impose a ban.
<P>
	The MVMA could not have been happier: no more dealing 
with Ethyl and let the federal government work the whole thing 
out for itself. There was no need for a third party to come in to do 
testing. Negotiations and industry collaboration went out the 
window. This is where the minister failed.
<P>
	There are two sides to the issue and she picked the one that 
seemed politically friendly. The decision was not based on 
science. It was based on short term political interest and money, 
certainly not because there would be any gains for the 
environment.
<P>
	Both the MVMA and Ethyl have conducted tests. Both had 
apparent credible statistics and yet they were contrary to each 
other. Both sides were adamant that the tests they had brought 
forward were accurate. I am not a scientist and the environment 
minister has admitted the same in her background. I have seen 
the detailed test data and the chemical charts and tables. I am not 
going to stand here today to convince with a technical argument. 
All I am trying to do is to provide a reasonable solution like any 
responsible environment minister would do.
<P>
	The solution should have been, and for that matter still can be, an 
independent third party series of tests to determine if MMT 
actually causes a problem to onboard diagnostic systems in cars. 
Certainly MMT is not hazardous to our environment as it greatly 
reduces knocks. Both sides were close to coming to a decision. 
Both sides were about to approve a third party evaluation. Ford 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14145"> 14145 </A></B>
<P>
Motor Company recently did a test with  MMT flavoured 
gasoline to see how it would affect its onboard diagnostic 
systems.
<P>
	The minister has been touting the MVMA to be the expert and 
most accurate in its data collection. Ford conducted an in house 
fleet test composed of twenty 1994 Thunderbirds. Ten went to 
Toronto and were driven for about 50,000 miles of city driving. 
Five went to Florida and five to Nevada. Similar to the testing in 
Toronto, the ten U.S. cars were also driven about 50,000 miles 
each and were also kept to city driving. In the interim report 
Ford asserted that catalyst monitoring ratios generated by the 
OBD-II system in the vehicles were different in Canada and the 
U.S. mainly because of MMT.
<P>
	Ford claims that this was the only difference between 
Canadian and U.S. vehicles. The U.S. EPA, on the other hand, 
concluded ``it is difficult to distinguish small losses in catalyst 
activity'' using existing OBT technology. The smallest change 
in emissions which is technologically feasible to detect for 
current production vehicles equipped with the OBD-II system is 
a hydrocarbon emission increase or decrease of about .4 grams 
per mile. Ford tests show an HE emission of only .02 grams per 
mile. Apparently Ford has not released any data that would 
verify if the OBD-II systems actually have the ability to 
measure such small changes in emission performance.
<P>
	The testing that Ford did was in three very distinct areas: 
Toronto, Florida and Nevada. We are all aware that the 
composition of fuel will vary from region to region. With data 
provided by the National Institute for Petroleum and Energy 
Research, the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute and 
Environment Canada, basic differences in the gasoline between 
the three test sites were rather considerable.
<P>
	Let us use for example summer gasoline in Toronto. The 
amount of sulphur in parts per million is about 400 and the 
percentage of ether is about zero per cent. On the other hand in 
U.S. gasoline sulphur content is about 248 parts per million in 
Florida and about 80 parts per million in the west southwest. As 
for ether, in Florida it is 1.8 per cent and in the west southwest it 
is 1.6 per cent.
<P>
	The reason for my explanation of these data is to show that 
test parameters can vary significantly from city to city.
<P>
<B>(2110 ) </B>
<P>
	Why did Ford use these two U.S. cities to conduct its testing 
when it knew full well of the differences in the composition of 
gasoline? As politicians we are all very familiar with polls and 
the use of polls. One poll says this and another poll says 
something else. If one wants a polling company to get a 
favourable answer it is possible to do so by the way one words 
the questions.
<P>
	I would assume the same was also true for the way testing was 
done on MMT. On one side Ethyl wanted to see tests which 
showed that MMT was not responsible for malfunctions with the 
onboard diagnostic systems in cars. On the other side the 
MVMA wanted to prove how MMT was hurting or interfering 
with its systems. Essentially each party got the results it wanted. 
How accurate are the tests and what are the implications for 
public policy?
<P>
	The bill bans MMT in Canada. The way I read it there is no 
reference to Nevada or Florida in the bill, if the minister wants 
to believe the data provided to her of tests that were not even 
performed in this country on comparable fuels.
<P>
	Some proponents of the bill will ask me for a better way of 
doing the tests. I can only think of one logical way. The ban is in 
Canada. Take cars and pair them up. Choose independent 
locations across the country. Use two cars in each location. In 
one car use gasoline added with MMT and in the other car use 
the same type of gasoline without the addition of MMT. Drive 
each car for the same distance and over the same terrain and in 
the same climate. For instance, if one of the two cars is driven in 
the city, the same should apply to the other. A wide variety of car 
models should be used in varied Canadian climates and 
conditions. This would seem to be the only available solution.
<P>
	When people are charged with crimes and they know in their 
hearts they are innocent, they agree to any test, any independent 
investigation, lie detectors, DNA and so on. They are confident 
and therefore they have nothing to be afraid of, nothing to hide.
<P>
	Since the beginning the Ethyl Corporation has wanted to 
settle the entire dispute using a comprehensive series of industry 
wide, third party tests. It was confident in the outcome. The 
same was not true for the MVMA. As soon as there was a hint 
that the minister would back it up all future talks were cancelled. 
Now it balks at the idea of independent testing. I guess its 
lobbying paid off.
<P>
	Early last week the United States Court of Appeals issued a 
mandate ordering the EPA to grant a waiver to permit the use of 
MMT in unleaded gasoline in the U.S. The court found that 
MMT does not cause or contribute to the failure of any emission 
control device or system. It evaluated the evidence placed 
before it. I realize this does not mean that MMT will be in U.S. 
gasoline tomorrow but it does mean one large step closer.
<P>
	Ethyl Corporation still has a hearing before the same court in 
September of this year to confirm final registration of MMT, 
which would then allow for the sale of the additive. It is 
interesting to note that in the above decision by the appeals court 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14146"> 14146 </A></B>
<P>
neither the auto industry nor the Environmental Protection 
Agency appealed the court decision. Why? There was likely no 
grounds for appeal.
<P>
	On Friday I received material from the Canadian Petroleum 
Products Institute that has been following the issue with great 
interest. The CPPI official who was in attendance in Washington 
for the decision stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>EPA officials made it clear that, assuming Ethyl does win, the burden of proof 
for any future attempts to have MMT banned will shift from Ethyl to the auto 
makers. This is leading the auto makers in the U.S. to all of a sudden start talking 
about a joint testing program. This is what CPPI has been proposing for the last 
two years in Canada and what the auto makers have continually refused to 
support.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Maybe the auto manufacturers' lobbyists are not so confident 
of their position.
<P>
	Even before Bill C-94 was introduced Reformers asked the 
environment minister to conduct independent tests. She has 
adamantly refused. Somehow the minister at least could have 
facilitated it. The MVMA knew it had the inside track with the 
minister. All it had to do was stall with Ethyl.
<P>
	In the early stages I think the minister believed the U.S. courts 
would maybe side with the EPA. The bill will become the 
environment minister's legacy. There is a good chance that the 
bill will pass through the House about the same time that the 
U.S. begins using MMT in its gasoline again. What will the 
minister do then? Will she stick to her legislation and continue 
with the ban or will she flip-flop or succumb to some 
international pressure?
<P>
<B>(2115) </B>
<P>
	The industry minister has also said on numerous occasions 
that the key to banning MMT in Canada is to create a uniformity 
of standards between the U.S. and Canada so costs to the auto 
makers rather than environmental concerns are behind this 
move. According to this statement Canada will go back and 
forth like a lost puppy or maybe a lapdog.
<P>
	The minister introduced this legislation with hopes it would 
get quick passage before the summer. She is on a deadline set by 
the MVMA. The 1996 cars were about to be shipped and they 
wanted to ship them with the OBD-II systems all hooked up.
<P>
	It is clear now the bill will not get through all stages. The bill 
will wait until the fall to be reopened for debate. Even if the bill 
is passed before the end of the year manufacturers will have 
already shipped their cars. The 1996 cars will not have gone up 
in price and the warranties will not have been reduced, since all 
the warranty manuals will already have been printed and 
shipped with the cars. This is a perfect opportunity for the 
environment minister since she knows the passage of the bill is 
irrelevant to the timing of production for the 1996 cars.
<P>
	It was once said the Liberal philosophy holds that enduring 
governments must be accountable to someone besides 
themselves, that a government responsible only to its own 
conscience is not for long tolerable. This is befitting of the 
government which occupies the benches today; to whom is it 
accountable?
<P>
	Before the government goes through with this legislation I 
draw to its attention some of the information I have come across 
during the last several weeks. I raise it for the sake of discussion.
<P>
	On several occasions the minister stated in the House and at 
the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development that if we do not curb global warming much of 
Prince Edward Island will be completely under water. The 
minister has stated that if action is not taken immediately 
thousands upon thousands of jobs could be lost.
<P>
	I still have a lot of questions on the whole issue of global 
warming in relation to greenhouse gases, as do many Canadians. 
In the reading I have done on the topic lately I have discovered 
that according to scientists the biggest contributors to 
greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous 
oxides, NOx.
<P>
	Since we are dealing specifically with MMT we should 
concentrate on the NOx emissions. I do not believe anyone will 
deny that the additive MMT does reduce NOx emissions. 
However, I suppose the only argument may come as to how 
much NOx emissions are reduced with MMT in gasoline. It may 
also be important to point out that at the 1988 international 
treaty Canada committed itself to freezing NOx emissions at the 
1988 level. This was all part of Environment Canada's NOx 
VOC2 management plan.
<P>
	Since the minister's own department feels it is necessary to 
reduce these emissions it would be important for us to better 
understand how much MMT actually reduces NOx emissions 
and helps the environment.
<P>
	This past June a month long cleaner air campaign was 
launched in Toronto after results showed the outrageous levels 
of smog in certain Canadian centres. The campaign was put 
together by pollution probe and included some major sponsors: 
Canadian Tire Corporation, Consumers Gas, Petro-Canada, the 
Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Environment Canada, 
to name a few.
<P>
	B.C.'s lower mainland, where I come from, parts of New 
Brunswick and the Windsor-Quebec corridor were found to be 
the three worst areas in the country for smog pollution. The 
people of Hamilton East, part of the Windsor-Quebec corridor, 
need to know their member of Parliament, who happens to be the 
Minister of the Environment, is banning a substance which 
would help to reduce urban smog. The minister needs to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14147"> 14147 </A></B>
<P>
accountable to the well-being of Canada's environment. She 
should also be accountable to those who elected her to office.
<P>
	Ethyl Canada claims that removing MMT from Canadian 
gasoline would increase NOx emission levels by up to 20 per 
cent. The CPPI has added to this and made the claim that 
removing MMT would be the equivalent of adding over a 
million cars to Canadian roads. Those are pretty substantial 
numbers for the environment.
<P>
	On the other hand, Environment Canada did its own testing on 
MMT and found that removing it from gasoline would increase 
NOx emissions by only 5 per cent; again, two evaluations, two 
substantially different numbers. Which one is correct?
<P>
	I want to look at how Environment Canada came to its 
conclusion of 5 per cent. Environment Canada used an EPA NOx 
benefit of .08 grams per mile, based on John Holly's 1994 
analysis of all Ethyl and Ford testing data. Therefore the .08 
grams per mile was divided by the average of summer and 
winter predicted emissions for a typical Canadian gasoline 
without MMT.
<P>
<B>(2120) </B>
<P>
	I point out something very important. John Holly's analysis is 
based on MMT testing data for late model passenger cars only, 
with vehicles accruing no more than 75,000 miles. Again 
Environment Canada is taking data based on U.S. gasoline 
which has completely different properties, most of which will 
affect NOx emissions. This was something I explained earlier 
when I referred to the testing done by the MVMA. We are 
relatively clear that our gasoline is different than that in the U.S. 
and that this would no doubt skew the results.
<P>
	I am not a technical expert and so reading scientific data and 
making interpretations could only be general in nature. When 
we look at some of the ways MMT was tested it is clear there are 
many intervening factors and uncontrolled variables, the 
number one factor being the type of gasoline used in each of the 
tests.
<P>
	Each side has an argument about what the other side did 
wrong, how its test design was inadequate or how unwarranted 
conclusions were made from the available evidence. I am sure if 
we were to bring both the MVMA and Ethyl together to debate 
their individual cases each would have no problem finding fault 
with each other's data and making circular arguments.
<P>
	I now bring another player into this whole debate. All we have 
heard about so far are the auto makers and Ethyl. However, 
another key component to the equation is the refineries. Studies 
show the removal of MMT would significantly add to refinery 
costs for reformulating gasoline and increase the cost of the 
refining processes.
<P>
	Refineries are required to achieve cleaner burning fuels but 
removal of MMT will cause refineries to increase refinery 
emissions and consume a greater amount of fuel which would 
require an expensive retrofitting process.
<P>
	The Saskatchewan Ministry of the Environment and Resource 
Management stated in a May 1995 letter to Environment 
Canada:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are also concerned with the impact this decision will have on Consumers' 
Co-Operative Refineries Limited in Regina. CCRL has Advised us that refining 
costs will increase in the order of $500,000 annually if MMT is banned. We have 
difficulty rationalizing this cost with no identifiable benefit to air quality by this 
action.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a dollar amount from only one refinery. If we take into 
account other refineries the number would be extremely high. In 
the recent Kilborn study, which I understand the environment 
department has still not released, it is estimated the cost to 
refiners of replacing MMT in Canada would be approximately 
$100,000 million in capital and tens of millions of dollars for 
operating. Perhaps the minister will release this report as soon 
as possible so all Canadians can see the real cost of the 
implication of this legislation.
<P>
	The Canadian Petroleum Products Institute, which represents 
the majority of the petroleum refining and marketing industry in 
Canada in the same way that the MVMA represents the 
Canadian Automobile Manufacturers, states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The MMT controversy is a technical issue between the auto industry and the 
petroleum industry that should be decided on the basis of science-The CPPI 
has repeatedly offered to participate in either a joint testing program or an 
independent scientific evaluation program, and to abide by the results, but all 
offers have been rebuffed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Why should they when there is the appearance that the 
minister is in the pocket of the MVMA?
<P>
	I learned on Friday that the American Automobile 
Manufacturers' Association is considering doing third party 
testing. Apparently the recent decision by the U.S. court of 
appeals has made it think twice. The Minister of the 
Environment should put an immediate stop to her legislation and 
let the key players work this out among themselves. I do not 
believe anyone would consider the Minister of the Environment 
a key player. Putting it simply, she appears to be an all too 
willing politician at the behest of the MVMA.
<P>
	I want to point out to the minister there is still time left before 
she may become rather embarrassed. If all goes well for Ethyl 
the United States may have MMT included in its gasoline by the 
fall. If the minister decides to scrap the bill in the fall, she will 
appear as the minister who has been hasty and not on top of her 
responsibility to protect the public interest rather than the 
interest of those who contribute to her election campaigns. 
There will be no way of making amends at that time.
<P>
	My suggestion is for the government to scrap this legislation 
and begin immediately with independent third party testing. The 
Reform Party would support the minister if she decided to do 
this and would support subsequent government regulations 
when science so indicates.

<P>
	It is time for the minister to be wise. However if the minister 
continues the stubborn course and proceeds with Bill C-94 we 
will have no choice but to oppose this legislation.
<P>
	If the bill passes second reading the House standing 
committee must hear witnesses and provide a public forum for 
the scientific evidence to be displayed, not inside arguments 
made within ministries but out in the open. The merits of the bill 
must stand on their own. The bill must not be rammed through to 
respond to the government's friends and against available 
scientific evidence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to participate in this debate tonight but I am 
dismayed with what I heard from the Reform Party and from the 
BQ. The fact they are not supporting our current producers of 
ethanol is very sad.
<P>
	Both members accused our minister of not doing a proper job. 
I will probably clarify a lot of incorrect inferences they made 
about our minister. I will speak to the BQ critic of the 
environment from Laurentides. Are any cars produced in 
Quebec?
<P>
	She talked about the lack of consistency with ethanol. Ethanol 
is a hydrocarbon. Petroleum comes from the Latin word petra, 
which means rock, and oleum, oil. These substances are 
extracted from the ground and cracked in refineries. My 
colleagues from the west would know all about that since they 
produce energy.
<P>
	It has been said that one gallon of gasoline could actually take 
an automobile 460 miles if all the energy were utilized during 
that combustion process. We are moving closer to that kind of 
situation as on board diagnostic equipment kicks in, knowing 
how much fuel is coming in, exactly how to time the spark and 
exactly how to control the combustion in the engine.
<P>
	With reference to ethanol discussed by the member for 
Laurentides, she was confusing an octane enhancer with a fuel. 
The member accused the Minister of the Environment of not 
acting in the best interest of the environment, which is exactly 
the opposite of what the minister is doing. The minister is 
protecting the environment. She is actually protecting 
customers. She is protecting humans from contaminants.
<P>
	Contaminants from automobiles in places like Los Angeles, 
California, which is in a valley, are noticeable when there is a 
temperature inversion that causes photochemical smog. 
Photochemical smog is caused by an interaction of NOx gases 
from automobile tailpipes and certain atmospheric conditions 
with some sunlight.
<P>
	If members opposite want to ask me a question I will be glad 
to answer any and all, including technical questions. I would be 
glad to tell them how a car works or exactly what the banning of 
MMT means.
<P>
	I will explain to the House why we are taking action against 
MMT. It is a manganese based fuel additive used  to increase the 
octane rating of gasoline. It has been used in Canada since 1977 
as a replacement for lead in unleaded gasolines. The lead was 
phased out in virtually all Canadian gasoline engines by 1990. 
Octane rating is a unit of measurement established by the 
automative industry to determine the antiknock quality of a fuel.
<P>
	When we talk about compression ratios in race cars it may be 
up to 10:1 or 11:1. In diesels it is about 20:1. In a diesel the air is 
compressed until it gets extremely hot, about 1000 degrees 
Fahrenheit, then fuel is introduced into that engine. In an 
automotive engine a spark plug is used to ignite fuel. In the case 
of a high compression engine the fuel becomes very unstable 
and will self-ignite.
<P>
<B>(2130 ) </B>
<P>
	If a car engine continues to run after the ignition has been 
turned off, it is called dieseling. The reason it diesels is that 
maybe a spark other than the gasoline in the combustion 
chamber triggers it and allows it to run. It becomes very 
unpredictable. In order to stop the unpredictability an octane 
enhancer is used. That is partially what an octane enhancer does.
<P>
	Who uses MMT? Just about every Canadian motorist does 
because Canadian refineries use it. The exact amount of MMT 
used may vary depending on the batch of gasoline. However, 
premium grade gasolines generally contain a higher dosage than 
regular grade gasoline. Canada is the only country that uses 
MMT. The United States for example banned it from unleaded 
gasoline in 1978.
<P>
	The automobile industry is convinced that gasoline 
containing MMT adversely impacts the operation of 
sophisticated on board diagnostic systems. These OBD systems 
are important because they monitor the performance of emission 
control components in vehicles.
<P>
	The automotive industry has made the decision that it will not 
accept the risk of increased warranty repair costs caused by 
MMT related damage. Some companies have even indicated 
they will disconnect the OBD systems in whole or in part and 
may reduce Canadian vehicle warranty coverage starting in the 
1996 model year if MMT continues to be used in Canadian 
gasoline.
<P>
	The cost of maintaining these systems are to be passed 
directly on to Canadian consumers. This is where the federal 
government comes in. Last October the Minister of the 
Environment urged both industries to voluntarily resolve the 
issue of MMT in Canada by the end of 1994 otherwise the 
government would take action. This deadline was subsequently 
extended into February of this year to review the automobile 
petroleum industry proposals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14149"> 14149 </A></B>
<P>
	The matter was not resolved so the federal government had to 
step in. This action is Bill C-94. The MMT issue is no longer an 
industry dispute. Its outcome can affect the vehicle emission 
programs we are putting into place. In the long term it could also 
negatively impact the automotive sector.
<P>
	Successful resolution of the MMT issue will ensure that the 
environmental benefits are realized through the use of the most 
advanced emission control technologies. It will ensure that 
Canadians are offered the same warranty coverage as in the 
United States and will ensure that Canadian motor vehicle 
emissions control programs do not diverge from those in the 
United States.
<P>
	This means that Canadians continue to benefit from the cost 
and technological advances in North American harmonized 
fleets. It means good news to Canadians and jobs for Canadians 
in the Canadian automotive sector. That is because diverging 
emission standards and differing anti-pollution equipment on 
Canadian cars will negatively impact the marketplace and 
decrease the competitiveness of the automotive sector.
<P>
	We would also be faced with a situation where cars built in 
Canada that go south of the border could have more advanced 
equipment than those sold in Canada with better pollution 
controls on them giving better atmospheric conditions. That 
clearly is not acceptable.
<P>
	Let us be clear about the economic impact of removing MMT. 
It will be small for the entire petroleum industry. Estimates for 
the cost of MMT removal provided by the industry range from 
$50 million to $83 million per year. Yes, it costs a little bit of 
money to clean up the environment. It means an additional .1 or 
.24 cents per litre increase at the pump. I may add that the on 
board diagnostic equipment gives better mileage so that may not 
necessarily affect the car. In fact the car may give better mileage 
because the systems are designed to do that.
<P>
	Permit me now to take a few moments to explain some key 
highlights of the bill. Bill C-94 would prohibit the import or 
interprovincial trade for a commercial purpose of MMT or 
anything containing MMT. It will give the minister the power to 
authorize exceptions for MMT that would not be used in 
unleaded gasoline, subject to the monitoring requirement.
<P>
	Coverage of the act can be expanded by an order in council to 
cover other manganese based substances. The act is binding on 
all persons and entities, including the federal and provincial 
governments. The enforcement tools are similar to the ones in 
the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
<B>(2135) </B>
<P>
	The penalties are strict. For the unauthorized import or 
interprovincial trade of MMT, the maximum penalty on 
summary conviction is a $300,000 fine and/or six months in jail 
and on indictment the maximum fine is $1 million and/or three 
years in jail. For knowingly providing false or misleading 
information on the importation or interprovincial trade of MMT, 
the penalties are the same but with a maximum of five years in 
jail instead of three on indictment. On conviction, as in the 
CEPA, a court can also order an additional fine equal to the 
monetary benefits resulting from the offence, prohibit conduct 
that may lead to a repeat offence and direct the offender to notify 
third parties about the contravention.
<P>
	That gives members of the House an idea of what the 
government is proposing in Bill C-94. What does all this mean 
to our constituents?
<P>
	I do not mind saying that I come from one of the most 
beautiful parts of Canada, the riding of Bruce-Grey. 
Thousands of others have said they enjoy driving up to beautiful 
Georgian Bay and visiting Owen Sound, Wiarton, Hanover, 
Walkerton, Flesherton or going across to South Baymouth on the 
<I>Chi-cheemaun</I> throughout the year. As happy as we are with the 
tourism that our region attracts, we are also very concerned with 
the toll increasing motor traffic is having on the fragile 
environment.
<P>
	The people of Bruce-Grey want the government and the 
industry to take all necessary measures to make sure the 
thousands and thousands of cars and trucks that travel our 
highways and roads are operating as cleanly as possible. They 
want us to make sure that increased tourism and increased 
vehicular activity does not lead to an increase in environmental 
degradation. In Bruce-Grey we want to protect all we have, not 
just for our children but for their children, our economy and 
future generations of Canadian visitors.
<P>
	The views and concerns of my constituents are no different 
from those expressed by other Canadians in all parts of Canada. 
Canadians expect us to do what we can to preserve the 
environment. They also expect us to protect jobs, consumers and 
Canadian automotive technology. That is what Bill C-94 does.
<P>
	I would be glad and willing to answer any questions. There are 
no dumb questions on this subject because I know we are right to 
protect the environment. We are protecting our plants and 
animals. We are providing jobs in a sector that is extremely 
important to us and we are protecting the environment. We are 
protecting the air we breathe.
<P>
	In California weather forecasting they talk about temperature 
inversions and harmful emissions from automobiles. In many 
forecasts people are told to stay off the streets because they could 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14150"> 14150 </A></B>
<P>
actually suffer from eye irritation. This will not happen here if 
we allow these new technologies to be fed into the computer.
<P>
	Just to recap, when we go into our modern cars and turn on the 
ignition we have these on board diagnostic systems that 
function. We have exhaust gas recirculation and a charcoal 
container that captures the hydrocarbons. At a gas station when 
someone puts the hose in the gas tank and drops of gas fall out, 
that is hydrocarbon emission. In the old cars there was a vent so 
they had to put in charcoal to stop it from getting into the 
atmosphere. They have PCV valves. They have catalytic 
converters. A catalyst is a device that will change the substances 
so we can manipulate what comes out of the tailpipe.
<P>
	We are trying to protect the environment with the best 
technologies possible. We are trying to protect Canadian jobs. 
That is what the minister is trying to do.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-94, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and the 
importation for commercial purposes of certain managese based 
substances, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the member gave a very eloquent dialogue on MMT. He 
based most of his discussion on the environmental aspects of 
MMT and said that it was banned in the United States.
<P>
	Last week the United States district court of appeals issued its 
mandate ordering the Environmental Protection Agency to grant 
a waiver to permit the use of MMT in unleaded gas in the United 
States because it is clearly not an environmental hazard. What 
does the member for Bruce-Grey have to say about that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jackson:</B> Madam Speaker, I am not a lawyer and lawyers 
have fun with these topics. This will be in the courts forever.
<P>
	I do know that in the United States the EPA reasons are that 
MMT will cause certain medical problems. That is the major 
thing it is going with now. We have to understand that billions of 
dollars are involved. I am sure there will be campaigns, full page 
ads and what have you. It is the scientific community that has to 
deal with this. Sure there will be things going back and forth. 
The jury is still out on it. This dispute has been around for a long 
time. It is a legal one and I do not have an answer to it. I am sure 
that in the end the United States EPA will win out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the member for Bruce-Grey talked about a 
number of issues. He talked about standards and harmonization. 
He talked about MMT being banned. I think he also touched on 
the issue that Canada is the only country that uses it.
<P>
	Our industry minister said in April: ``The member will know 
that MMT is not permitted in the United States by legislation. It 
is crucial that we have uniformity of standards''. The U.S. court 
of appeals has now ordered the U.S. EPA to grant Ethyl 
Corporation's application for a waiver, paving the way for the 
use of MMT in unleaded gasoline in the United States. Several 
U.S. refiners have provided written notice of their intention to 
use MMT. Uniformity of gasoline additives within North 
America would now require Canada to maintain rather than 
restrict MMT.
<P>
	The member also talked about it being banned. The 
environment minister on May 5, 1995 said: ``The United States 
Environmental Protection Agency banned MMT in 1977 and 
since that time Ethyl Corporation has consistently tried to turn 
around the ban by court case after court case in which it 
continues to fail''.
<P>
	MMT was not banned by the EPA. It is still used in the United 
States in leaded gasoline and after market products. It was used 
in unleaded gasoline during the crude oil shortages of the 1970s. 
In 1977 the U.S. Clean Air Act established a process requiring 
new fuel additives not substantially similar to gasoline to obtain 
a waiver by demonstrating compatibility with vehicle emission 
systems.
<P>
	Ethyl of course undertook the largest fuel additives testing 
program in history which resulted in the EPA's conclusion in 
December 1993 that MMT will not cause or contribute to the 
failure of any emission control device or system. Contrary to the 
minister's statements in May the U.S. court of appeals ordered 
the EPA to grant a waiver approval to Ethyl Corporation on April 
14, 1995. The minister was fully informed of this decision but 
did not say anything to this House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14151"> 14151 </A></B>
<P>
	Another comment was made by an Environment Canada news 
release on May 19: ``Canada is currently the only country in the 
world tht permits the use of MMT in unleaded gasoline''. MMT 
is approved for use in Canada, Argentina, Bulgaria and Ukraine. 
It is being actively considered for introduction in Australia, 
New Zealand and other countries in southeast Asia and around 
the world. These countries have closely monitored Ethyl's EPA 
fleet testing program and have noted the U.S. court of appeals 
ruling ordering the U.S. EPA to grant Ethyl's waiver 
application. Several U.S. refiners have confirmed their interest 
in using MMT in the United States.
<P>
	If MMT is considered bad for automobiles and the 
environment, why then does the minister not ban the substance 
under the schedule in the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act? Why can we not use CEPA to ban MMT?
<P>
<B>(2145 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jackson:</B> Madam Speaker, first I would like to make a 
point of clarification. I forgot that I was sharing my time with 
the member for Simcoe North.
<P>
	Some of the comments by the member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby were contradictory. He said that in the 
United States there is a court case going on with regard to the 
banning of MMT, yet he says that MMT is used. If MMT is used 
then we do not have a problem. I suspect that there are times 
when we would have to do that. There probably are old 
fashioned cars that do not use the highways as much. Certain 
facilities are made in order for those people to operate their 
vehicles. That may be one of the reasons they are using MMT.
<P>
	The basic thing we are looking at here is as the member for 
Davenport explained, there are 18 automotive manufacturers 
that say that MMT will foul up the onboard diagnostic 
equipment. We are talking about Canadian consumers, and we 
must understand that the on board diagnostic equipment sends 
messages to the computer. These are all little electronic devices. 
If they become plugged and turn on the on board diagnostic 
lights, it will cause these cars to be taken in for repair. The 
manufacturer is going to get fed up with it and pull the plug, 
which they said they would do, and stop using the light, which is 
so important for these vehicles as the technology advances to the 
stage where you know when your car is starting to pollute the 
environment.
<P>
	In the United States they have stickers and at certain times 
cars go in to be fixed. But the on board diagnostics show right 
away when there is a problem. The MMT will foul them up and 
render them useless. By doing that it impairs the pollution 
device it impairs the fuel economy of the car sputter, and it 
makes the car sputter and not function properly. It takes away 
that protection from the consumer.
<P>
	That is what we are trying to do. The hon. member does not 
want to spend any money. If the manufacturers of MMT want to 
push this product and make it acceptable to the automobile 
manufactuers then let them get their scientists to make sure it 
works in a way that it does not do that. Let them do that, but the 
Government of Canada should not be spending money for that 
kind of stuff.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member for 
Bruce-Grey to comment on the fact that in 1991 auto research 
laboratories did a study on various fuel formulations and tests 
showed that an addition of a small amount of MMT to a 10 per 
cent ethanol blend will significantly enhance environmental 
benefits by reducing emissions that contribute to ground level 
ozone and urban smog. The test demonstrated that with an 
industry average fuel MMT and the 10 per cent ethanol it 
reduced NOx emissions by more than 30 per cent. How would 
the member respond to that piece of evidence?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jackson:</B> Madam Speaker, basically by using exhaust gas 
recirculation. NOx emissions are caused by high combustion 
chamber temperatures. Therefore by using exhaust gas 
recirculation, which is triggered by the computer, it drops the 
temperature in the combustion chamber and we can regulate 
NOx that way through the standards that EPA expects.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-94, as most of my colleagues have 
already well pointed out, is intended to prohibit the use of the 
product MMT in the production of gasoline. This product is a 
manganese-based additive used in practically all unleaded 
gasolines in Canada since 1977.
<P>
	Before I start, I think I should point out that the research done 
by Health Canada indicates that the fears expressed by a number 
of groups regarding the harmful effects MMT may have on 
health are unfounded. On its own, this product does not harm the 
environment. However, and this is the crux of the matter and the 
reason the minister is putting Bill C-94 before us today, 
automobile manufacturers claim that MMT in gasoline clogs the 
anti-pollution devices, impeding their effectiveness and thus, 
indirectly, of course, harming the environment.
<P>
	I listened earlier to my colleague for Davenport say that the 
only people with any interest in opposing the bill were MMT 
producers or distributors. This, however, is not quite the case. 
The major oil producers also have an interest in opposing it, and 
we will see why in due course.
<P>
<B>(2150) </B>
<P>
	The oil producers claim in response to the automobile 
manufacturers that MMT means gasoline can be produced at a 
considerably lower cost in environmental terms at the refining 
stage. MMT requires less intensive processing and this means 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14152"> 14152 </A></B>
<P>
less carbon dioxide, nitrous  oxide, carbon monoxide and 
sulphur dioxide from the smokestacks of gasoline 
manufacturing plants.
<P>
	In addition, MMT allows refineries to reduce the aromatic 
cycles in gas and thus benzene emissions. Caught between these 
two industry giants, the automobile manufacturers and the big 
oil companies, which are fighting each other, is the product 
distributor, Ethyl Canada, which, according to several analyses, 
has passed all the required tests and is said to be ready to put its 
product on the market in the United States where it was, as my 
hon. colleague from the Reform Party put it, partly banned.
<P>
	In fact, on April 14, 1995, the United States of America Court 
of Appeal for the district of Columbia, rendered its decision in 
the case involving Ethyl Corporation and the Environmental 
Protection Agency, in which Ethyl contested the refusal of the 
agency, on July 13, 1994, to meet its request to put an end to the 
banning of MMT in unleaded gas.
<P>
	The court decided and I quote: ``The administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency has broken the clearly 
stipulated conditions of clause 211 by rejecting the request of 
Ethyl to put an end to the banning of MMT for public health 
reasons''. The court added that since Congress had given the 
agency the mandate to evaluate, only in terms of emissions, 
what is implied by some of the requests to stop banning a 
product, and since Ethyl had met the requirements concerning 
the emissions, the administrator of the agency had exceeded his 
powers by rejecting the request made by Ethyl. Because of these 
facts, the court sent a direct order to the agency which will, as 
the court said, have to grant Ethyl its request to remove the ban 
on its additive.
<P>
	Therefore we can see that, in any event, the United States is 
getting ready to put MMT back in circulation in a few months. 
The court's explanation was as follows: ``As regards the 
arguments made by the American Automobile Manufacturers 
Association against the opinion of the Environmental Protection 
Agency according to which MMT does not affect in whole or in 
part the proper operation of the emission control system in 
vehicles, the American court ruled that those arguments had no 
value at all. First of all, the court emphasized that the agency 
had established that ethyl used as an additive had easily passed 
tests required in all the most stringent studies ever conducted''. 
The court is referring here to statistics.
<P>
	The court also noted that ``the Environment Protection 
Agency has examined, using more restrictive criteria, Ethyl's 
data on the use of the additive in more technologically advanced 
vehicles'', and the court found that the agency had detected no 
significant emission increase, that is no increase which could 
reasonably be attributed to a sampling error.
<P>
	As for the allegation by automotive manufacturers that MMT 
interferes with the operation of OBD-II systems, the court said 
in its ruling that ``the EPA had reasonably refuted the doubts of 
the three automotive manufacturers concerning the effect of 
MMT on these systems''. The court went on to say that ``under 
the Clean Air Act, the EPA still has the authority needed to 
establish these facts''.
<P>
<B>(2155) </B>
<P>
	As a result, Ethyl intends to reintroduce MMT on the U.S. 
market very soon, once registration matters have been settled.
<P>
	Faced with this, the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute 
has recommended-as have the hon. member from Davenport 
and my colleague from the Reform Party-that a committee of 
independent experts be asked to settle the issue.
<P>
	Not too long ago, Claude Brouillard, president of the institute, 
said, and I quote: ``We have solid scientific and technical data 
supporting MMT and its use in Canada''. However, as some 
players question these facts, we are prepared to submit this issue 
to an independent committee of experts and to abide by their 
decision. We hope that the federal government, the automakers 
and the product manufacturer will endorse this proposal''. This 
comes from the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute. 
Therefore, the manufacturer of MMT is not the only one 
dissatisfied with the decisions which are being made.
<P>
	As well, Mr. Fisher, chairman of the board of this institute, 
sent the following letter to the Prime Minister. I will read some 
paragraphs in English. Mr. Fisher wrote this:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``The Canadian Petroleum Products Institute, which represents 
the vast majority of the petroleum refining and marketing 
industry in Canada, is strongly opposed to the announced plan of 
the government to legislate a ban on imports of the gasoline 
additive MMT.''
<P>
	``We understand that the proposed legislation will be 
presented to Cabinet soon. This proposal is being justified under 
the banner of harmonization with the United States, but actions 
currently under way in the U.S. are leading towards the probable 
reintroduction of MMT into unleaded gasolines.''
<P>
	``The MMT controversy is a technical issue between the auto 
industry and the petroleum industry''-he is quite right-``an 
issue that should be decided on the basis of sound science. It 
does not require a legislative solution and it is not appropriate 
for your government''-the letter was addressed to the Prime 
Minister-``to be taking the action at this time. We submit that 
the process followed by your government has been seriously 
flawed.'' So wrote the petroleum producers, not the company 
producing MMT.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14153"> 14153 </A></B>
<P>
	``When the Minister of Environment first spoke publicly on 
the issue, she prbably stated that the issue should be resolved by 
the two industries. The minister then went on, however, to 
declare that in the absence of an agreement she would legislate 
MMT out of gasoline. By declaring the outcome, any incentive 
for the auto industry to cooperate in a joint scientifically based 
testing program was removed.''
<P>
	``The CPPI has repeatedly offered to participate in either a 
joint testing program or independent scientific evaluation 
program and to abide by the results''.
<P>
	The chairman went on as follows:
<P>
	``There are demonstrated environmental, economic, and 
energy efficiency benefits from the use of MMT. We do not 
believe these benefits should be lost to Canada without a sound 
database on information to demonstrate that the allegations of 
the automakers against MMT are valid. To date, this information 
has not been forthcoming. Indeed, as the U.S. Court of Appeals 
recently decided, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
has accepted that automakers have not demonstrated their case 
against MMT.''
<P>
	``Given the probability of MMT being reintroduced in the 
U.S., the lack of a sound scientific case against MMT, the 
benefits of the additive and the flawed process of political 
development, we strongly urge the government to not proceed 
with the proposed legislation to ban imports of MMT.''
<P>
<B>(2200) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Clearly, it is not only refining and marketing companies that 
find this bill premature, at least in its present state, as is now 
being submitted to us today.
<P>
	In spite of all the adverse opinions, the minister is still 
presenting her bill which settles, or tries to settle the question by 
banning MMT. I think, as my colleague the member for 
Laurentides said earlier, that they want to give a chance to the 
ethanol program.
<P>
	On December 21, 1994, the federal government announced a 
new program that would promote the extraction of ethanol from 
biomass. According to the Minister of the Environment, in 
accordance with her policy on agriculture and with the 
government's will to develop an innovative economy, the 
government will implement the national program on biomass 
ethanol to promote private sector investment in that industry.
<P>
	Again according to the environment minister, the national 
program on biomass ethanol shows that the government is quite 
determined to encourage the production and the utilization of 
renewable fuels wherever it is advantageous from an 
environmental and an economical standpoint. Apparently, that 
would be a step forward in setting up, in Canada, a renewable 
energy industry. The program provides for the establishment of 
a reimbursable line of credit guaranteed by the federal 
government, to which a limited number of eligible  applicants 
would have access. A total amount of $70 million would then be 
offered under certain specific conditions between the years 1999 
and 2005. We can see that there is a real desire on the 
government's part to promote ethanol in any way possible.
<P>
	However, my colleague from the Laurentides asked a very 
relevant question. What would be the point of banning MMT if 
we are to spend money to use ethanol as a new gasoline additive? 
I think that question deserves to be studied in committee. 
Indeed, this little bill, apparently quite simple and quite 
insignificant, might have an extremely serious and complex 
impact.
<P>
	I was listening to my hon. colleague opposite who was telling 
us about technical considerations behind this project. The fact is 
that there is a complex technical problem with various 
consequences. My colleague was remarking that ``there are 
billions behind this'', and he is absolutely right. When billions 
of dollars are at stake, we should at least think about the reason 
why the bill is put forward.
<P>
	The Bloc will reluctantly support this bill at second reading, 
with so many reservations that it will not be real support. We 
hope to review it thoroughly in committee.
<P>
	I hope the committee, both the staff and the members, will 
take the time to make a careful study of this issue, as my 
colleague from the Reform Party was asking for.
<P>
	We will conduct a study that will be as exhaustive as the 
government will allow, because there are too many different 
interests at stake in addition to technical points about which 
decisions must be made. To do so, we will need complete 
explanations from some players who are independent, in some 
way, in the analysis itself, because they are not part of it.
<P>
	But during the whole time this bill is studied in committee, we 
will keep in mind that Quebec as a whole has often been a loser 
to date, in terms of investment in the energy sector, and in all 
possible ways.
<P>
	I would like to give the establishment of the Borden line as an 
example. Those who sat in the House, or were interested in 
politics at the time, remember very clearly that, in the early 
1960s, international oil prices dropped so dramatically after 
worldwide overproduction, that western Canadian oil prices far 
exceeded oil prices on foreign markets. Refineries in the east 
end of Montreal, almost all of which are in my riding or very 
close to it, refused to buy oil from western Canada because it 
was so expensive.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14154"> 14154 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2205) </B>
<P>
	At that point, western oil producers complained and asked the 
federal government to find a solution to their problem. The 
government appointed the Borden commission. That 
commission, which had no representative from Quebec, decided 
that a line would be set, the Borden line, giving western Canada 
a captive market, that is the region west of the Ottawa River, and 
that a pipeline would come to Sarnia. It also decided that eastern 
refiners, that is Quebec refiners, would have to get their oil from 
that pipeline. Consequently, within a few years, the whole 
petrochemical industry was transferred from eastern Montreal 
to Ontario. Quebecers, who were refiners and sellers of finished 
oil products, became buyers of refined products from Ontario.
<P>
	This is a clear case, in the energy sector, of Quebec being 
deprived of an economic activity which it had developed.
<P>
	This morning, I was listening to the hon. member for 
Longueuil. He was quite right when he said that all the major 
investments made in recent years in the energy sector, including 
CANDU research, amount to about $12 billion. Indeed, billions 
of dollars are invested in projects such as Hibernia, but not one 
penny was ever spent on hydro projects in Quebec.
<P>
	Before concluding, I want to remind this House that 23 per 
cent of the money invested elsewhere than Quebec comes from 
Quebecers. We want to look at every side of the issue, and we 
hope that the committee will give us the opportunity to meet all 
those concerned with this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member made reference to the District of Columbia 
circuit court decision, as have previous speakers.
<P>
	I have a fax statement I would like to read and ask the member 
a question. It is fax from the EPA to Environment Canada that 
reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>EPA has just learned of the D.C. circuit's decision requiring the agency to 
grant a fuel additive waiver for the manganese-based gasoline additive MMT. 
The agency is disappointed in the court's decision that EPA cannot consider 
health effects in deciding whether or not to grant these waivers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This decision does not mean that unleaded gasoline containing MMT can 
now be sold. The Clean Air Act also requires that all new fuel additives, 
including MMT, must be tested and their health effects studied before they can 
be registered for use.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1994 EPA issued rules implementing this requirement that will govern the 
testing of MMT. MMT is not currently registered for use in unleaded gasoline. 
The agency will therefore require the testing concerning potential health effects 
of MMT be completed prior to its approval for this use.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to know whether the hon. member is aware that 
tests will have to be completed before MMT can be used in the 
United States.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Madam Speaker, I was not aware of that. A 
Health Canada study showed that MMT is not a threat to health 
and the environment. We will find that report for my colleague. 
Mind you, reports coming out of Health Canada are not always 
reliable.
<P>
	For example, UFFI was supposed to be fabulous. People had 
to spend billions of dollars to remove the stuff from their homes. 
Let us remember also the thalidomide and silicone breast 
implant problems. I always take what comes out of Health 
Canada with a grain of salt. Health Canada tells us that MMT is 
not a health hazard.
<P>
	My colleague's question underscores an obvious fact. We are 
dealing here with an extremely complex issue that has 
implications in health, technology, and chemistry. Those who 
will examine this issue in committee will have to rely on experts 
to understand all the aspects of it.
<P>
<B>(2210) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to mention a rather interesting 
phenomenon. Listening to this discussion in the House 
concerning additives to the gas used in cars is a reminder of 
where the federal government is at compared to Quebec. In 
Quebec the electric car has been invented. An inventor in 
Montreal by the name of Couture has reinvented the wheel.
<P>
	He has developed an electrical system by equipping each 
wheel with a motor, making this car the car of the future. 
Pollutants will be eliminated because, as we know, the whole 
discussion around MMT involves whether or not it pollutes, 
whether or not it is detrimental to health. In Quebec, we will 
eliminate pollutants. We will eliminate exhaust pipes. This will 
be a car without an engine. This electronic car is a major step 
forward for the entire world, and it began in Quebec.
<P>
	Once again, this shows how Quebec has made progress in this 
field, as it has in many others, in trying to come up with the best, 
environmentally friendly solution for a healthier society. I was 
curious to know if the hon. member agreed with me that Quebec 
is already a frontrunner in the search for a solution to all these 
questions of gas and pollutants.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Madam Speaker, I found my colleague's 
remarks most interesting, as I was just speaking about this this 
morning. In fact, whenever we look at gas and additives to it 
such as MMT, ethanol or whatever, we are looking at chemical 
roducts, all of which, in one way or another, pollute. Take 
ethanol, which is not supposed to be a pollutant. Its manufacture 
from corn and fertilizers will damage the soil.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14155"> 14155 </A></B>
<P>
	So the electric car, which needs no gas or other fuel, is an 
unprecedented opportunity for Quebec to take the lead in 
technology that does not exist anywhere else. I think that the 
people who are asking us for our vision of society see this as part 
of that vision. We could very well decide to electrify all our 
public transportation in Quebec, the buses travelling between 
cities and, gradually, all cars, and develop our own technology, 
which we could eventually export, especially now that we are 
the largest producers of electricity.
<P>
	So I think my colleague is right, it is a key to the future, one 
which, in our case, will mean that in a few years we will no 
longer be wondering about chemical products, with their 
inevitable repercussions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
my colleague from Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies poses an 
interesting question. I would like to ask him a question.
<P>
	It is said that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can 
only be changed from one form to the next. Nothing is free. 
Electric technology is still in its infancy. Battery technology is 
getting better but only for short runs. However, when we build 
hydro dams there is environmental damage. If we move to 
nuclear, there are costs as well. There are no free rides. We 
cannot say that electric cars are a panacea. They may become 
part of the mix of transportation systems but there are costs.
<P>
	For instance, in the 1960s the demand for hydro power was 
doubling every 10 years. There are costs. Nothing is free. The 
automobile will still be there and we will still have to contend 
with the way it performs and try to improve it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this bill today. Bill C-94 
proposes to regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation 
for commercial purposes of certain manganese based 
substances.
<P>
<B>(2215) </B>
<P>
	Before I go any further, let me clarify for the House what 
MMT is. MMT or methylcyclopentadienyl manganese 
tricarbonyl is a fuel additive. I am really pleased I had my two 
years of organic chemistry in order to be able to fumble through 
that. I will be using MMT for the rest of my speech.
<P>
	MMT is a fuel additive which boosts the octane of gasoline 
and increases its efficiency. It has been used since 1977 in 
almost all Canadian unleaded gasoline.
<P>
	MMT was introduced as an additive to gasoline when lead was 
banned and its addition has proven to enhance the effectiveness 
of fuel and has shown environmental benefits. This bill is 
designed to eliminate the use of MMT which is a lead 
replacement in unleaded fuels.
<P>
	Bill C-94 allows the minister to authorize an exception for 
MMT. It will not be used in unleaded gasoline subject to 
monitoring requirements. Coverage of the bill can  also be 
expanded by order in council to cover other manganese based 
substances and the bill will be binding on all persons, including 
the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	The penalties for unauthorized import or interprovincial trade 
of MMT are harsh and range from a $300,000 to $1 million fine 
and six months to three years in jail. That is pretty stiff.
<P>
	I have several concerns with the bill. I am concerned about the 
government initiative in this matter in the first place. The 
government should not be interfering into private disputes 
between businesses. That is what this is. It should be resolved 
between the concerned parties and not by government 
legislation.
<P>
	I am also concerned about the lack of research behind the bill. 
The government has refused to conduct an independent 
technical reviews to address the issues in dispute, as suggested 
by several provinces, gasoline refiners and the manufacturers of 
MMT. Instead the government is legislating a ban on a product 
without any proper investigation.
<P>
	This is a technical industry issue which can only be resolved 
through an independent technical review, not by subjective 
government action. Reform has been very clear that it does not 
want to take sides on the issue. It has met with both sides, Ethyl 
and the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Associations, MVMA, 
and both sides appear to have credible arguments. Both sides 
have run exhaustive tests and come up with two different and 
contradictory results. This is why Reform feels that there is a 
need to run a third party independent test on the product before 
any conclusions are reached.
<P>
	I am concerned that the bill is going ahead despite the fact that 
government does not have any conclusive evidence that MMT 
has an adverse effect on the environment. The minister's claim 
that MMT has been linked to increasing vehicle repair costs to 
the engine and emission control systems are unfounded. There is 
no external evidence to support any claim that the removal of 
MMT will decrease repair costs to the motorists.
<P>
	The minister also claims that MMT causes on board 
diagnostic units to malfunction in the new 1996 cars. There is no 
evidence to support this either. The MVMA claims to have data 
to support this claim, but Ethyl says that test results from the 
largest EPA approved fuel additives testing program in history 
demonstrate that contrary to claims by the MVMA, MMT in 
Canadian gasoline is fully compatible with the new on board 
diagnostic catalyst monitoring systems.
<P>
	Again, no independent third party testing has been conducted 
in Canada on MMT and the 1996 on board diagnostics. There is 
also no evidence to support claims that MMT damages the life of 
<BR>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14156"> 14156 </A></B>
<P>
emission control equipment or that the use of MMT in gas 
increases fuel consumption or pollution.
<P>
This legislatio is based solely on the evidence developed and put 
forward by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, one 
of the parties directly involved in the dispute. Again, none of the 
evidence has been subject to third party analysis.
<P>
	The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Associations has not made 
their evidence available to the general public. One has to ask 
why. Of what are they afraid?
<P>
<B>(2220) </B>
<P>
	When asked in the House of Commons for evidence to support 
this legislation, the minister side stepped the issue, refusing to 
bring the evidence into the open. Why? Clearly because the 
minister does not have sufficient evidence.
<P>
	In fact there is evidence that appears to point to the contrary. 
Health Canada conducted a study in December 1994 which 
concluded that the current use of MMT does not harm 
Canadians. The report stated: ``All analyses indicate that the 
combustion products of MMT in gasoline do not represent an 
added health risk to the Canadian population''. Evidence 
provided by Ethyl Corporation, the manufacturer of MMT, also 
contradicts the conclusions of the MVMA.
<P>
	It is important to note the method the government is using to 
implement this ban. The legislation proposes to ban MMT 
through a trade restriction, not an environmental ban. It is 
important. Why? Because the government has no legislative 
grounds to remove MMT for health, environmental or technical 
reasons. If there is something environmentally wrong with 
MMT then use the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. Do 
not use a trade ban. There is something wrong with this picture. 
If the government is going to ban a substance it should have 
conclusive evidence that will support the ban which it does not 
have.
<P>
	I am concerned about the precedent set by this bill of 
government interfering in business. The two concerned parties, 
industry and Ethyl, are both making contradictory claims and 
have been unable to smooth out their differences on their own.
<P>
	Before the environment minister stepped in, the two sides 
were close to negotiating an understanding to bring in third 
party testing, which is what we want. However, the minister's 
interference in this issue has brought matters to a standstill. As 
soon as one side felt the minister was on its side, all talks were 
broken off. Rather than helping the situation the minister's 
interference hindered the course of events.
<P>
	I am also concerned that Bill C-94 sets a precedent for 
business to drive the government agenda. The MVMA has 
threatened to raise automobile prices and to withdraw 
automobile manufacturers across the border if these companies 
do not get their way. This bill is clearly the response.
<P>
	Government should not be responding to unfounded threats 
from the business community with legislation. This is no way to 
run the country, although it may now be the new way of Liberals 
doing business.
<P>
	My concern with Bill C-94 is not who is right or wrong. I do 
not feel I can take a position on the issue because at this point 
there is not enough evidence to support one side or the other. My 
concern with the bill is the manner in which decisions are being 
made by government. Government should not be making 
decisions until there is clear third party, unbiased evidence on 
the table. There needs to be a fair and independent technical 
review of the facts.
<P>
	Given that most automobile manufacturers are based in 
Ontario it is clear why the government has chosen to support the 
Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association in this dispute. 
Lobbying is the issue here, not MMT.
<P>
	Government should not base its legislative decisions on 
lobbying or on where it feels its election interests may lie. MMT 
is the only gasoline additive available in Canada that is capable 
of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by as much as 20 per cent. 
Nitrogen oxide emissions cause urban smog. A ban on MMT 
could have the equivalent effect of adding one million cars to 
Canadian roads by the year 2000 if we do not have an equivalent 
replacement.
<P>
	If a replacement for MMT is not identified, its removal from 
gasoline will prove to be more environmentally detrimental than 
leaving it there in the first place. This should be of concern 
because it appears that environment department officials do not 
know what will replace MMT. This bill only allows six months 
for its ban to be effective. Six months does not allow enough 
time for industry to adjust.
<P>
	Canadians should also be concerned about the cost of the 
legislation on the individual consumer. It is estimated that 
taking MMT out of gasoline will cost an estimated $109 million 
in capital costs and tens of millions of dollars for operating 
costs. These costs will be dumped on the consumer which will 
mean an increase in gas prices.
<P>
<B>(2225 ) </B>
<P>
	Several provinces have voiced their opposition to this bill. I 
wonder how the government justifies the restriction of import 
and interprovincial trade of MMT with Bill C-88 which 
proposes to remove interprovincial barriers to trade. Again it 
does not fit.
<P>
	The spirit and intent of Bill C-94 represents a unilateral 
interference into provincial affairs. The province of Alberta has 
stated that Bill C-94 contradicts the energy chapter of the 
agreement on internal trade. Article 1209, section 1 states that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14157"> 14157 </A></B>
<P>
no party shall restrict, prohibit or hinder access to its petroleum 
markets or its petroleum products markets.
<P>
	Alberta has questioned the environmental benefits of 
removing MMT and has demanded a fair and timely process to 
resolve the dispute. Saskatchewan's deputy minister of 
environment has stated the MVMA has not convinced 
Saskatchewan and the majority of provinces that there is any 
evidence to show MMT has an adverse effect on the on board 
diagnostic systems.
<P>
	Why is the Minister of the Environment ignoring these 
concerns shared by Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and 
New Brunswick? Could it be that perhaps she is in the pocket of 
the auto industry?
<P>
	I am also concerned that the environment minister's actions 
directly contradict what is currently taking place in the United 
States. The Americans have recently overturned the Motor 
Vehicle Manufacturers Association's evidence, the same 
evidence on which the proposed legislation is based.
<P>
	Let me repeat that because it is important. The Americans 
have recently overturned the MVMA evidence, the same 
evidence on which the proposed legislation is based. The 
19-year prohibition of MMT was recently lifted by an U.S. 
appeals court because the evidence of its effect on the 
environment has been shown to be inconclusive. Last week the 
United States district court of appeals issued its mandate 
ordering the Environmental Protection Agency to grant a waiver 
to permit the use of MMT in unleaded gasoline in the United 
States.
<P>
	This reaffirms the findings that MMT does not cause or 
contribute to the failure of any emission control system or 
damage the environment. The order to grant a waiver follows 
from extensive program testing of the fuel additive.
<P>
	I am concerned that the minister is jumping the gun with the 
bill. It appears that MMT will probably be reintroduced into the 
United States this fall. At the same time, the minister is taking 
action to ban the product in Canada. It simply does not make any 
sense.
<P>
	Actions in the United States put a large question mark on the 
efforts of the environment minister to ban MMT in Canada. We 
have to ask again, why?
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to make it clear that I do not 
support this legislation. I do not support legislation based on 
lobbying and threats, and I do not support legislation that fails to 
obtain a fair and independent technical review of the facts.
<P>
	If this legislation is to go forward, I agree with my colleague 
that it must go to the environment committee. Extensive 
witnesses from both sides should be called. The only way that 
this can be solved is a clear third party independent study to find 
out what are the basics.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member a question. The hon. member 
for Westminster-Burnaby before him made the allegation that 
the minister is in the pocket of the motor vehicle manufacturers.
<P>
	If that is the case, I would like to ask the hon. member why it 
is that MMT has been disallowed for use in leaded gasoline in 
the United States since 1978? Was the EPA in the pocket of the 
motor vehicle manufacturers as well?
<P>
	Did he not hear the statement that was read containing the 
facts from the EPA to the effect that the granting of the waiver 
does not permit the use of MMT in unleaded gasoline? It was 
simply a technical decision made by the District of Columbia 
circuit court to the effect that the EPA could not consider health 
effects in deciding whether or not to grant these waivers. The 
issue of using MMT still will be the subject matter of extensive 
testing on health effects.
<P>
<B>(2230 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Madam Speaker, on the first point, about the 
minister being in the automakers' pocket, clearly this whole 
process is coming forth through pressure from the automakers, 
many of whom are in southern Ontario. The pressure is there. 
The minister has bowed to the pressure, and that is unfortunate.
<P>
	In terms of the waiver, the minister is making my point, in that 
what we require is a third party independent look at this 
situation. I will go back to my former life and use 2,4-D as an 
example. The member for Davenport will understand the 
background. No matter which side of the issue, whether the 
banning of 2,4-D or the use of it, either side could get as big a 
pile as they wanted of the evidence. It was very difficult to get a 
clear, independent, middle of the road decision. This is what is 
required. I believe this is what the Americans are fighting for on 
this waiver. Again they are just bowing to saying this is exactly 
what we want.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, to 
the hon. member for Comox-Alberni, for whom I have the 
greatest respect, no matter where the automotive industry is 
located, the industry serves Canadians from coast to coast, 
regardless of their location.
<P>
	Here we are talking, among other things, of meeting the 
requirements of the customers in terms of warranty and in terms 
of the ability of the car owner to determine whether through the 
diagnostic system the anti-pollution devices can work or not.
<P>
	The hon. member is shaking his head, but that is a fact. If he 
has more information to add, I would be glad to listen to him in 
this debate.
<P>
	The member for Comox-Alberni spoke about the importance 
of independent testing. I am told that independent testing has 
been carried out by both sides of the debate, by the car 
manufacturers as well as by the petroleum industry. How much 
more independent testing  does the member for 
Comox-Alberni want? Does he realize that testing is 
expensive, that it takes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14158"> 14158 </A></B>
<P>
time? And while further tests are taking place, as proposed by 
him, the manufacturing industry is in the process of producing 
the diagnostic devices, which will then not be switched on or 
connected if the MMT additive is not removed from gasoline. 
Therefore everybody will be losing in the process.
<P>
	Has the member for Comox-Alberni given any thought to all 
the consequences of his suggestion flowing from further 
independent testing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Davenport. We are on the same committee and I have a great 
amount of respect for the member.
<P>
	In terms of the diagnostics and the unit that is already being 
made, I view this as industrial blackmail in that the automakers 
are saying they already have it on board and since it is already 
made we have to change the legislation. That is just absolutely 
wrong. We cannot have the automakers or any industry in 
Canada ruling the government which is what they are attempting 
to do here.
<P>
	Again I will go back to my independent study. The member 
says that both sides have their studies. I agree but where is the 
independent study that is in the middle?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, if some months ago someone had come to me 
saying that a political party in this House with a strong rural base 
is going to be advocating a position in favour of prolonging the 
use of MMT in Canada, I would have said to such a person that 
obviously they were wrong, that could not possibly be true.
<P>
<B>(2235 ) </B>
<P>
	Tonight we have in this debate something rather unusual 
happening. I submit this to the House and invite my colleague to 
respond.
<P>
	I represent an agricultural constituency where corn is 
produced. With the use of ethanol there is little or no need for 
MMT. I understand there are other substitutes as well that 
produce octane enhancement.
<P>
	The member opposite was challenging the hon. member for 
Davenport a moment ago in advocating that we need further 
independent tests. What kind of a reason do we have to prolong 
this product, which is largely if not totally made outside of the 
country, banned in the country where it is manufactured, used in 
this country principally because it is banned where it comes 
from, and furthermore damages motor vehicles, the health of 
Canadians, and does no good for the agricultural industry in 
Canada on top of that? With that kind of evidence, how much 
more independent testing do we need before we realize there is 
damage being done to cars, the health of Canadians and the 
agricultural industry? Why is the member supporting it given 
that kind of evidence?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Madam Speaker, the member simply backs up 
my point. There is a U.S. ban that has been overturned by the 
court of appeal and members on the other side fail to recognize 
that. They just seem to think that it will go away, and here we 
have an industry that is pushing forward.
<P>
	The member was pushing the ethanol industry. Ethanol is 
fine. It is one of the additions, but it is not the answer. It takes 
more energy to make ethanol than it does to make gasoline. It is 
certainly part of the formula, but it is not the answer.
<P>
	The hon. member was saying that he was surprised to see a 
member opposite stand up with this point of view. Again, it 
simply shows that the other side knows very little about where 
the Reform Party is coming from. They are going to see an awful 
lot more of the Reform Party. I am putting them on notice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, if there is still time I want the 
hon. member to respond to the following.
<P>
	Last year I was forced to replace my car. As part of the new car 
warranty I was told by the dealer that in Canada the oil in that 
particular model has to be changed every 6,000 kilometres, 
versus every 18,000 in the United States. I asked the dealer why. 
The only reason I was given was that the gasoline additives we 
use in Canada cause damage to motor vehicles.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member how he could possibly be promoting 
and supporting the production and sale of a product that has been 
banned in the United States and somehow is still legal in 
Canada, given the damage it does to cars as well as to all the 
other things I mentioned previously? Does he not see that this 
product is not desirable for our environment, for motor vehicles, 
or for the health of Canadians? It does all this harm and the 
member opposite, for reasons I do not understand, says that all 
of this does not matter. It has not been used for years and years in 
the United States, and now, just because there has been a recent 
court decision, notwithstanding the fact that it has not been used 
in heaven knows how long, all of a sudden he takes a position in 
favour of this particular product which was banned south of the 
border.
<P>
<B>(2240 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> A very brief answer, the 
hon. member for Comox-Alberni. Your time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Very briefly, Madam Speaker, I will just sum 
up. What can we expect from a member who is going to take his 
advice from a used car salesman?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14159"> 14159 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the privilege to speak to this Chamber about 
Bill C-94, the Manganese-based Fuel Additives Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Before addressing specific elements of Bill C-94, I would 
like to say a few words about some environmental concerns of 
mine regarding what the government has already done and, more 
importantly, what it is going to do in this area.
<P>
	Allow me to underline a few facts supporting my concerns. 
World population is increasing at the rate of about 90 million 
people every year. In the last 150 years, it has climbed from 1 
billion to 6 billion. According to projections, it will reach 
between 10 billion and 14 billion in the years 2000 to 2050. 
From 1960 to 1990, economic activity grew at a compounded 
annual rate of 3.8 per cent. The growth rate in any given year 
exceeded in absolute terms the global economic activity in 
Europe in 1939.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Clearly at the heart of our environmental concerns lies the 
historical trend of unprecedented expansion and acceleration of 
human activities that now threaten vital components of the 
earth's ecology. Major impacts include forests vanishing at the 
rate of 17 million hectares per year, 6 million hectares of 
productive dry land turning to desert each year, 140 plant and 
animal species becoming extinct each day, and air and water 
quality on a global scale is declining at an equally alarming rate.
<P>
	The bottom line of all this is that the combined impacts of 
population and these other pressures cause environmental 
capacity limits to be exceeded locally, regionally, and globally. 
It is now clear that without some major shifts in policies and 
practices a continuation of these trends is ecologically 
unsustainable.
<P>
	Clearly with our current transportation practices we are not 
winning the war. Canada has launched a number of initiatives to 
limit pollution from motor vehicles. We have eliminated the use 
of lead additives in gasoline. No longer will we have to worry 
about the potential threat to health, especially to the health of 
our young children, that the presence of lead in gasoline posed.
<P>
	As of last fall we have reduced the sulphur content of diesel 
fuel, which when used with more technologically advanced 
engines will reduce the emission of particulates and black 
smoke emanating from large trucks and buses.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the red book, the Prime Minister supported the 
development of renewable energy technologies. To this end, the 
government has launched the national bio-ethanol program. 
Announced last December, this program will support the 
development of ethanol production through a refundable line of 
credit to qualified candidates who want to establish bio-ethanol 
fuel production plants in Canada.
<P>
	The program, which will be managed by the Farm Credit 
Corporation, will guarantee up to $70 million in loans between 
1999 and 2005. In other words, the government will help only 
those renewable energy companies that initially invest their own 
capital and resources. There will be no subsidy, no megaproject. 
The government will lend its assistance only after the private 
sector has invested its own capital for five years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is the fiscally responsible way to help turn wood chips, 
straw, grain, and other biomass waste into energy that can be 
used to fuel our vehicles.
<P>
	Properly blended ethanol gasoline can reduce carbon 
monoxide emissions, which degrade urban air quality, can 
reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which are the primary source 
of greenhouse gases, and can also reduce benzene emissions, a 
substance declared toxic under CEPA, into the atmosphere. The 
program is targeted to encourage ethanol production in every 
region of the country.
<P>
<B>(2245) </B>
<P>
	This is a sound example of the concept of sustainable 
development. We can deal with an environmental problem and 
create jobs at the same time.
<P>
	Our standards for exhaust coming out of the tailpipes of our 
cars and trucks are among the most stringent in the world. These 
standards set strict limits of nitrogen oxides which contribute to 
acid rain and are a key component in the formation of smog. 
They also set limits on the amount of hydrocarbons, another 
major contributor to smog, cars can emit and on carbon 
monoxide.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While pollution created by individual cars and trucks has 
gone down significantly, these vehicles are still a major source 
of air pollution, since their number has increased considerably. 
They are said to be responsible for 60 per cent of carbon 
monoxide emissions in Canada, 35 per cent of nitrogen oxide 
emissions, and 20 per cent of emissions of carbon dioxide, the 
greenhouse gas primarily responsible for climatic changes.
<P>
	This is why my colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of the Environment, is going ahead with a number of 
initiatives, including a comprehensive program designed to 
control pollution caused by motor vehicles. To that end, the 
federal government is pursuing a strategy to control motor 
vehicle emissions. That strategy includes, among other 
measures, the implementation of more rigorous standards to 
control exhaust emissions. This requires advanced technology, 
such as the sophisticated systems developed by Diagnostic Inc.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14160"> 14160 </A></B>
<P>
[E<I>nglish</I>] 
<P>
	However there remains one obstacle to the introduction in 
Canada of the next generation of emission control technologies, 
the continued presence of MMT, an octane enhancer presently 
used in unleaded gasoline. Bill C-94 calls for a ban on the 
import and interprovincial trade of MMT. MMT is not 
manufactured in Canada but imported from the U.S.
<P>
	In Canada the use of MMT as an octane enhancer is allowed in 
unleaded gasoline up to the maximum of 18 milligrams of 
manganese per litre. In the United States the use of MMT in 
unleaded gasoline has not been allowed since 1978. We have 
heard much discussion this evening about the case in the District 
of Columbia where the waiver has been ordered to be issued by 
the EPA to the manufacturers of MMT, but this does not allow 
the use of MMT in unleaded gasoline in the United States.
<P>
	The automobile industry is convinced MMT adversely affects 
the operation of these advanced emission control technologies. 
All the domestic manufacturers and automobile importers agree 
that MMT adversely affects their sophisticated on board 
diagnostic systems.
<P>
	These systems are planned for introduction on new Canadian 
vehicles starting in the 1996 model year vehicles. On board 
diagnostic systems will monitor the emission control 
components and alert the driver to a malfunction. This 
equipment could ensure that automobiles are properly 
maintained, resulting in decreased tailpipe emissions and 
improved fuel economy. In other words this is one more 
important tool to help us address pollution, including urban 
smog and climate change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Clearly, reducing motor vehicle pollution requires a 
concerted effort on two fronts: first, improvements in motor 
vehicle emission control technology such as those allowed by 
the advanced systems used by Diagnostic Incorporated, and 
second, improvements in the composition and properties of 
fuels.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore the government cannot allow MMT to compromise 
the ability of Canada's auto industry to design and deliver 
vehicles to Canadians that can achieve important pollution 
reductions. Canada's environment and Canadian consumers 
have the right to the latest emission control technology 
available. This is especially apparent when this same 
technology will be offered to American consumers starting with 
the 1996 model year because the United States presently has 
MMT free fuel.
<P>
<B>(2250) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To repeat what the Deputy Prime Minister stated, we cannot 
wait any longer. It is now time for action. Any additional delay 
would threaten the federal emission control programs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In summary, this action is pro-consumer, pro-business and 
pro-environment. Therefore, I urge all members to support this 
action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have listened to a number of speakers from 
the government side and to their rationalizations and 
explanations. I want to further respond because a lot of 
questions remain unanswered. In my questions and comments I 
will put some more questions and maybe we will get some 
answers. I have a dozen questions.
<P>
	Why has the government refused to conduct an independent 
technical review to address issues in dispute as suggested by 
Ethyl, Canada's gasoline refiners and several provinces?
<P>
	Having refused an independent technical review, how can the 
government justify removing MMT when the claims and 
concerns of the MVMA about MMT and vehicle emission 
systems, including the new OBD systems, have been considered 
and rejected by the U.S. EPA and the U.S. court of appeals?
<P>
	Why would Canada ban the import of MMT as it is about to be 
reintroduced into unleaded gasoline in the United States? Why 
would the environment minister have chosen to address this 
issue by restricting trade?
<P>
	How does the government square the restrictions of import 
and interprovincial trade of MMT with legislation currently 
before the House of Commons to remove interprovincial trade 
barriers?
<P>
	Why is the government ignoring opposition and concerns 
expressed about this unilateral federal action by the provinces of 
Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick?
<P>
	How can the Minister of the Environment support an action 
which studies conclude will result in an annual 50,000 to 60,000 
tonne increase in smog causing NOx from Canadian vehicles?
<P>
	If MMT is replaced, what will the replacement be and what 
will the cost to consumers and refiners be? What are the 
environmental and health impacts of potential replacements? 
Why have the Minister of the Environment and all major 
automobile manufacturers refused to meet with Ethyl Canada?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14161"> 14161 </A></B>
<P>
	What pre-1996 models have been impacted by these alleged 
MMT related problems and what specific MMT related 
warranty claims have been made and why have the 
manufacturers not notified consumers before?
<P>
	Why did the MVMA turn down a specific proposal for a 
technical review of alleged MMT related problems made by key 
executives representing petroleum refiners and automobile 
makers at the joint industry task force in 1993?
<P>
	How can the Minister of the Environment explain her 
statement if vehicle manufacturers carry through on threats to 
remove OBD systems? This would result in a tenfold increase in 
vehicle emissions; lots of questions and no answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member is correct, 
there are lots of questions. I will give him several answers. I do 
not think I will be able to list them all because I could not write 
them down quickly enough.
<P>
	In answer to the first question about the government's not 
ordering independent testing, for a party constantly telling us 
there should not be government intervention in the business 
affairs of the country, I find it very difficult to understand. This 
is an issue motor vehicle manufacturers and petroleum 
producers have been working on for quite some time. They have 
not been able to come to an agreement or to an understanding on 
it. Consequently the government is forced to act and I think that 
is appropriate.
<P>
	The hon. member asks why the ministry is acting on a trade 
basis. It is not. It is on a consumer protection basis. CEPA is not 
being used. The hon. member is a member of the environment 
committee and knows the environment committee is completing 
and will be tabling tomorrow its report on the five year review of 
CEPA so that it is seen by many to be inadequate for the purpose 
and a very long and protracted reason. That is why the minister 
has chosen to take the course she has taken here.
<P>
	Reference was made to the court case in the District of 
Columbia, and several speakers have referred to it this evening. 
The case does not guarantee or permit the reuse of MMT in the 
United States. That was a decision on a technical basis as it was 
read from the fax sent from the EPA on the technicality that the 
EPA could not use health considerations. It could use only the 
testing of the equipment in refusing to issue that waiver. Under 
the Clean Air Act there is still much testing to be done on the 
health issue. It is far from a given that MMT will pass all those 
tests.
<P>
<B>(2255) </B>
<P>
	On the question of substitutes, ethanol is a very acceptable 
substitute to MMT. The government has taken the initiative to 
assist with some tax considerations with the establishment of 
ethanol plants throughout the country, including in areas 
represented by our hon. friends in the Reform Party. That is a 
very reasonable substitute and the government is acting 
properly in allowing it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have four questions which I was able to jot down while the 
member for New Westminster-Burnaby made his intervention. 
If MMT is replaced, what will happen then? Nothing different 
than what happened-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, I 
believe it was the hon. member from the government side who 
was speaking. The hon. member for Davenport is asking the hon. 
member from-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster is correct. The person we should be 
asking our questions of or making our comments to is the hon. 
member for Simcoe North.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> I would be glad to ask the member for Simcoe 
North whether he would agree that the answer to the question 
posed to him by the member for New Westminster-Burnaby in 
relation to the removal of MMT has not been answered already 
in the United States by the fact that it has happily functioned in a 
very responsible way since 1978, the date when MMT was 
removed. Therefore there would be no difference in Canada to 
the pattern already established south of the border.
<P>
	The question was also raised, and I ask again my hon. 
colleague whether he would agree, as to CEPA. That is a very 
legitimate question. The member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby is a member of our committee. The 
CEPA legislation does not permit at the present time to deal with 
substances like MMT. An amendment would be required to 
CEPA. He may want to take that initiative.
<P>
	The other question was why move now when MMT is being 
reintroduced. This is the strange notion tonight that has emerged 
as a result of various interventions across the aisle. MMT is not 
being reintroduced. There is only a technical procedure in the 
courts that has been somehow upheld by way of a waiver. It has 
nothing to do with reintroducing MMT.
<P>
	It was asked why the Ethyl corporation was refused a hearing 
by the government or by the minister. I can understand very well 
why Ethyl would not be given an interview. It is one of the most 
regressive and litigious corporations in North America. It has 
never taken to heart public interest or public health. In that 
respect Ethyl is out of luck with any good government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Madam Speaker, out of deference and respect 
for the hon. member for Davenport, I agree with all of his 
statements.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, despite the late hour of 11 p.m., it is somewhat of a 
pleasure to rise to address Bill C-94, the Manganese based Fuel 
Additives Act.
<P>
	For those members who have been told they must vote for this 
bill and have therefore decided that they do not need to 
understand the whole issue, I would like to give them a few of 
the facts surrounding this lobby effort by the powerful auto 
industry.
<P>
	MMT has been used in Canada in unleaded fuel since 1977. 
Contrary to some disinformation in the papers, MMT has also 
been used in the United States since 1978 in leaded gas. 
Congress passed laws that said that all additives for unleaded 
fuels had to get a waiver from the Environmental Protection 
Agency before they could be used-all additives, not just MMT.
<P>
	In their previous applications to use MMT, petroleum 
companies were unable to provide sufficient evidence to 
demonstrate that MMT should be given a waiver. In the last 
application the EPA reviewed evidence from both sides. Auto 
manufacturers contend that MMT should be banned because 
they believe that MMT gums up the new anti-pollution systems 
mandated for all cars in 1996. The onboard diagnostic systems, 
or OBD as they are called, apparently get coated with 
manganese and the car companies claim this results in 
inaccurate readings. They state: ``Manganese based additives 
precipitate the degradation and failure of vehicle emission 
systems''.
<P>
	The petroleum companies ran their own tests and did not find 
MMT adversely affected the performance of the OBDs. Further, 
they point out that the auto companies' own tests prove that 
MMT does not adversely affect the detection of emission 
failures. When the system detected a problem, the failure light 
went on.
<P>
	This finding is important, because now Canadian auto 
manufacturers are threatening to disable the dashboard light that 
signals the control system is not operating at optimum. By 
disabling the detection system, the car companies are 
deliberately, and spitefully I might add, preventing Canada from 
achieving pollution and emission targets.
<P>
	The EPA, with its very strict standards, reviewed the evidence 
from both sides. It found no reason to refuse a waiver for MMT 
based on its effects on the emissions control equipment. The 
EPA administrator first noted that ``use of Ethol's product in 
unleaded gasoline at the specified concentration will not cause 
or contribute to a failure to achieve compliance with vehicle 
emission standards''.
<P>
	However, she went on to cover other factors beyond her 
mandate with respect to the waiver application. She found that 
``there is a reasonable basis for concern about the effects on 
public health that could result if EPA were to approve the use of 
MMT in unleaded gasoline''. On those grounds the 
administrator again denied the waiver. However, on April 14 the 
U.S. Court  of Appeals overturned this decision, noting that the 
reasonable basis for concern that she applied was not consistent 
with section 211(c) of the act, which deals with health factors. 
Specifically there must be ``significant risk to public health'', 
which was not found in this case.
<P>
	I would like to know why the Minister of the Environment has 
not addressed this aspect of MMT. It would seem to be her duty 
to protect Canadians against airborne pollutants, which will 
negatively impact on their health. Instead of pursuing this, the 
main objection by the EPA administrator, she is passing 
legislation to ban the importation or movement of MMT across 
borders.
<P>
	Why does the government not have the gumption to stand up 
to blatant threats by the auto industry? It has warned that it 
would slap an extra $3,000 on the price of all 1996 model cars, 
void all exhaust system warranties and simply disconnect the 
new anti-pollution devices if Ottawa did not act by August. I 
want to know what the $3,000 would be used for. Is it going to 
research and development to make slightly different pollution 
control systems for Canada? Or, is it a fearmongering tactic by 
the car companies?
<P>
	We have had MMT additives since 1977 in Canada. Why were 
the effects of MMT not built into the OBD tests over the last 
several years?
<P>
	Another reason the auto industry has given for its position is 
to harmonize the North American market. It does not want to 
invest in technology to meet Canada's requirements, only those 
of the U.S.
<P>
<B>(2305) </B>
<P>
	Harmonizing the North American market sounds like a great 
plan during this age of NAFTA and free trade, except for one 
thing: the EPA has been ordered to give a waiver to American 
petroleum producers to start using MMT in unleaded gas. The 
appeal date on that decision expired last week without an appeal 
by the auto manufacturers or the EPA. If they felt their facts 
were so solid, why did they not appeal?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> No evidence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Even more 
important for Canada, it appears that as a result auto 
manufacturers are now considering a joint testing program 
between the U.S. and Canada because MMT may be on the U.S. 
unleaded gas market within the year. And note I said ``may be''.
<P>
	What will Canada be doing as MMT fills gas stations across 
the border? Preventing its movement to appease the current 
whims of the auto industry. While the government commits 
itself to eliminating internal trade barriers in Bill C-88, the
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14163"> 14163 </A></B>
<P>
Minister of the Environment is busy erecting them in Bill C-94. 
Not only does this demonstrate the hypocrisy of the Liberal 
commitment to freer trade between the provinces. It also 
demonstrates the inability of the Minister of the Environment to 
act decisively and responsibly on an important issue. Lacking 
the hard evidence to defend the outright elimination of  MMT in 
fuels, she is caving in to the lobbying efforts of one group. 
Instead of making her decision based on technical information 
regarding the problems with the use of MMT, she is completely 
sidestepping the issue.
<P>
	Bill C-94 means MMT can still be sold and used wherever it 
is produced. So petroleum producers could produce MMT in 
southern Ontario, where most cars are driven, and they would 
not be prohibited from selling it at the pumps. Somehow I do not 
see how this addresses the real issue of whether or not MMT 
contributes to pollution or should be used at all in Canada. This 
merely prevents the transport of MMT across borders but does 
not prevent its use.
<P>
	If I were a suspicious and cynical westerner I might question 
the regional economic impacts of this bill, which seem to far 
outweigh any environmental concerns the minister might have. I 
might wonder why the minister refuses to consider studies by 
petroleum producers in western Canada or the United States. I 
might wonder if she represents the interests of all Canadians in 
all industries or merely a select few in Liberal territory in 
central Canada.
<P>
	If I were really cynical I might wonder at the timing of the 
introduction of this bill, during the Ontario election campaign, 
in the province most dependent on the auto industry. When faced 
with an ultimatum by the auto companies to ban MMT use by 
August, what did the government do? Did it get tough and try to 
determine what the truth is regarding its effects? No, that would 
be too much to expect.
<P>
	The government has a very bad track record when it comes to 
standing up for Canadians in the face of pressure from big 
industry. Remember the powerful tobacco lobby last year, when 
the government refused to look at a real solution to the 
smuggling problem. Instead of raising export tariffs or beefing 
up our anti-smuggling patrols, it gave the tobacco companies 
what they wanted: lower taxes to add new teenage smokers to 
their growing list of the addicted.
<P>
	Instead of finding out the truth about MMT, the government is 
acceding to the demands of the car lobby without independent 
proof of its claims. What is more, possibly because they cannot 
prove the harmful effects of MMT, the environment minister is 
not actually banning it, just restricting its movement.
<P>
	Something is not quite right here. Why is the Minister of the 
Environment championing a bill that says and does absolutely 
nothing about protecting the environment? Until we have an 
independent study, the only things being protected here are the 
interests of the auto industry.
<P>
	What will some of the consequences of this legislation be? 
For one thing, increased pollution from sulphur emissions in 
western Canada, where the refineries must change their 
processing. If MMT cannot be moved interprovincially, 
producers will spend an additional $100 million to switch over 
to another fuel additive and will have to refine the gas more for 
higher octane levels, thereby increasing sulphur emissions. Is 
that increase in pollution included in the minister's 
calculations?
<P>
	There will be up to a 20 per cent increase in nitrogen oxide 
levels emitted by cars if we ban MMT. Of course now the car 
manufacturers dispute the 20 per cent figure because of the 
changes they have been forced to make with the new pollution 
controls.
<P>
<B>(2310) </B>
<P>
	Kicking and screaming, the auto industry finally started to 
invest some research and development dollars into eliminating 
pollution. Suddenly it has found that it can reduce nitrogen 
oxide levels substantially. It does not dispute that MMT would 
decrease nitrogen oxide levels further, only that it will not be as 
much as 20 per cent because it has finally started producing 
more efficient cars. However, no one has calculated how much 
nitrogen oxide levels will go up once a final balance is reached 
between more efficient cars and less efficient alternate fuel 
additives.
<P>
	Let us look at the other side of the equation. How much would 
it cost auto manufacturers to develop a flushing system or 
technology to deal with the effects of MMT? I think $100 
million seems a little steep, but I am not a scientist or a chemist. 
I do not pretend to understand why research to solve the problem 
would cost more than $100 million. Either way, it is the 
Canadian driver who is going to lose.
<P>
	MMT has been in use in Canada for 18 years. There is no 
guarantee that it will not be around for another 18 years. If the 
auto industry had such grave concern about the effect of MMT 
on emission systems, why was that not built into the original R 
and D? Why should the federal government legislate a ban on 
the movement of MMT because the auto industry did not deem 
the Canadian fuel market important enough to consider it while 
it was developing its OBD systems?
<P>
	On the one hand, if we do not use MMT we have the potential 
for increasing hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and other smog 
ingredients, with their various negative health effects. On the 
other hand, if we keep MMT no one will know if or when the 
emission systems fail because the detection systems will be 
disabled.
<P>
	I want to turn now to the second part of the debate, which 
seems to have been buried in Canada but was the reason the EPA 
initially denied the waiver for MMT in unleaded gas in the U.S. 
That is the issue of airborne manganese and its effects on the 
health of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14164"> 14164 </A></B>
<P>
	We have known for more than a hundred years that airborne 
manganese is harmful and results in neurological disorders 
similar to Parkinson's disease. It has been an occupational 
hazard in manganese mines, where workers breathe in an 
extremely high level of manganese dust.
<P>
	One would think that the Minister of the Environment would 
want to ban MMT if it contributed to unsafe manganese levels in 
our air. In light of the EPA statements, one would think she 
would want to conduct tests to see whether Canada should 
control airborne manganese. Why does she not? Why instead 
does she go through a ridiculous loop to ban the interprovincial 
trade of manganese based substances? Should she not as 
Minister of the Environment be more concerned about 
emissions?
<P>
	Although Environment Canada has not conducted studies on 
this issue, Health Canada has. Its findings are very interesting 
and refute the EPA administrator's reasonable concerns about 
the health risks of MMT with hard evidence. The Health Canada 
study attempted to determine a safe daily intake of airborne 
manganese. Our bodies can handle ingested manganese much 
better than airborne manganese. It is an essential part of our diet. 
However excessive intake of manganese can result in an 
accumulation in the brain, which will cause the neurological 
problems I mentioned. Infants and older people are particularly 
susceptible to the negative effects.
<P>
	What did Health Canada discover? After establishing a safe 
daily intake level it studied airborne manganese, particularly 
that related to MMT. Even garage mechanics fell well inside the 
acceptable range of manganese inhalation. The major findings 
regarding MMT are as follows, and I quote from the study:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Levels of respirable manganese in major Canadian urban centres have 
remained constant or decreased from 1986 to 1992, and do not reflect major 
changes in MMT use during that time, suggesting that MMT does not contribute 
substantially to manganese concentrations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The part of the study I found most enlightening was with 
respect to why the minister might be reluctant to initiate a study 
on the effects of MMT related specifically to airborne 
manganese in particular industrial towns. The study reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Inhalation exposure to manganese has been assessed for residents of cities 
with large manganese-emitting industries such as steel mills. Current mean 
ambient air manganese levels are at, or substantially above, the acceptable daily 
intake. Inhalation uptake from all age groups approaches or exceeds the total 
daily uptake. This raises concern regarding chronic exposure to manganese for 
residents in these cities and recommendations are made regarding this issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(2315) </B>
<P>
	If we had an environment minister truly concerned about the 
effect of emissions on Canadian health one she would be right on 
top of trying to control manganese emissions from steel plants 
in towns like Hamilton. Perhaps that is expecting a bit too much.
<P>
	Obviously we need an independent review or study to 
determine the truth. Each side has studies supporting its 
particular view. The petroleum industry has been pushing for 
such an independent study but the auto industry has balked. I 
wonder why that would be. Why has the Minister of the 
Environment not proposed an independent study? A number of 
reasons come to mind.
<P>
	One reason might be the power of the auto industry in 
southern Ontario, a veritable Liberal stronghold. Maybe she 
does not think we need an independent study because she only 
believes the studies by the auto industry and not the ones by the 
petroleum producers.
<P>
	Before putting this ban in place, the Minister of the 
Environment must act responsibly and commission an 
independent investigation into the environmental effects of 
MMT and its use in cars. This must include pollutants such as 
the expected increase in sulphur and other emissions at 
refineries and the increase in nitrogen oxide levels estimated at 
the equivalent of one million additional cars on the road.
<P>
	Then it should look at the other side of the equation that might 
result from the removal of MMT, at the increase in airborne 
manganese levels, verification of a Health Canada study which 
indicated there was not a health risk linked to MMT use, the 
failure of emission control systems and the overall failure rate. 
Car manufacturers have not provided such numbers to my 
knowledge.
<P>
	When all these factors are considered perhaps the government 
could make a rational decision based on hard evidence rather 
than just cave in to the auto industry and the jobs and votes they 
represent in Liberal ridings.
<P>
	The main objective of the car companies appears to be to 
standardize fuels in North America. They could not care less 
about pollution or emissions in Canada. Because they cannot 
change the American market, they will get their wish by 
coercing the Canadian government. Do we not have a right to 
our own standards in this country? Why should any industry be 
able to dictate terms to us?
<P>
	In conclusion, the Minister of the Environment by passing 
this bill to block the interprovincial trade of MMT is not acting 
in the best interests of the Canadian people. If there are 
significant health risks and pollution problems associated with 
the use of MMT, I would be the first to stand behind her, back her 
up and support her. However she refuses to conduct an 
independent study.
<P>
	A reduction in nitrogen oxide levels for every car may far 
outstrip any potential pollution from a few failed OBD systems. 
It is time the minister starts acting like the Minister of the 
Environment for Canada, not the minister of the Motor Vehicle 
Manufacturers Association.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14165"> 14165 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister should do the right thing and order an 
independent study.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member, as did the other two speakers on behalf of the 
Reform Party, called for an independent study. I am a little bit at 
a loss to understand what is going to be accomplished by this 
independent study.
<P>
	The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association issues 
warranties. It is to the benefit of consumers that we have 
warranties with our motor vehicles when they are purchased. If 
an independent study was done and the petroleum industry was 
proven right, what would that do toward compelling the auto 
industry to change its opinion and issue warranties? As far as I 
am aware, this is done strictly as a business decision by the 
manufacturers. There is no legislation compelling them.
<P>
	What would be accomplished by the result of an independent 
study favouring the opinion of the petroleum industry?
<P>
<B>(2320 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the member for his question.
<P>
	It is my understanding that the OBD systems on these vehicles 
were requested by the American government, obviously to 
control pollution.
<P>
	One of the biggest problems with the whole issue has been the 
inability of the petroleum industry on one side and the car 
manufacturers on the other side to get together and develop 
something that would benefit both industries and all Canadians 
and Americans. I hope that would be the outcome of an 
independent study. If the two sides could agree who should 
conduct the study and to abide by the results of the study, that is 
the kind of thing Canadians are looking for.
<P>
	Suffice it to say that the two sides should be brought together, 
which has not been the case in the past. We have been getting 
these constantly conflicting statements from one side versus the 
other.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
imagine that the Reform Party had the same experience as us last 
week. The Minister of the Environment came to our offices to 
brief us on MMT.
<P>
	As the official opposition critic on environmental issues, I 
asked to see the studies conducted by car makers to find out why 
they oppose the use of MMT. We were told that these studies 
were not available because they were secret.
<P>
	It is very difficult to take a stand on an issue when we cannot 
have access to documents and when we are not informed. It is 
true that the department's position was explained to us and that 
officials from Ethyl Canada also came to present their own 
position. Yet, we cannot get a clear picture of the real situation.
<P>
	I certainly understand the position of the member for Simcoe, 
as well as that of the chairman of my committee, who are 
environmentalists, but they are also members of the Liberal 
government. What we are asking for-and I agree with Reform 
Party members, this is a rare event, but it sometimes 
happens-is a clear, independent study, conducted according to 
the rules of ethics.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member if he agrees with that and if he 
had access to the studies by auto manufacturers to the effect that 
MMT is really harmful to the anti-pollution system in cars?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
quite an occasion for me to completely agree with a member 
from the Bloc Quebecois. I thank her for the kind comments on 
this subject.
<P>
	It is indicative of the difficulty that Canadians and industries 
have trying to deal with the issue. We agree that we require a 
neutral third party to look at the issue rather than forge ahead 
based on the information on one side of the argument.
<P>
	It is interesting to note her comments about the studies the 
automobile industry says it has done and yet these studies are a 
secret. If the studies support their side of the argument, why 
would they not bring them forward? To me that would be 
obvious.
<P>
	I support the position of the Reform member for 
Comox-Alberni who earlier said that at the very least if the 
government is intent on forging ahead and ramming through the 
legislation as it has done with so many others in the past month. I 
would hope, following the vote at second reading, that the issue 
would be referred to the environment committee with a mandate 
to do a very intensive study and hear the various sides.
<P>
<B>(2325 ) </B>
<P>
	I certainly prefer, as does the Bloc obviously, to see an 
independent neutral study done but at the very least the 
environment committee should be given the mandate to look at 
this issue.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
fascinating to hear the member for Prince George-Peace River 
insisting on this question of an independent study.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Is the 
hon. member on questions and comments or is this on debate?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> I will make it short. The member admits that 
there are conflicting opinions on this matter. They are 
conflicting because these are industries with diverging if not 
conflicting interests. Therefore the study would have to be 
carried out by an independent source.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14166"> 14166 </A></B>
<P>
	Is the hon. member willing to have these studies, which are 
rather expensive, conducted by the government at the expense of 
the taxpayer? That is my first question.
<P>
	My second question has to do with the statement he made 
earlier about the cars costing $3,000 extra. This is a cost, 
assuming the figure is correct, that would be levied on the 
Canadian consumer in his riding as well. Would it not make 
sense to the hon. member to support a measure that would 
prevent an additional cost being charged to the consumers in his 
own riding?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel 
the premise is that we just assume this $3,000 figure. I have not 
seen evidence to support it. That is fear mongering on the part of 
the auto industry to get its way with the government.
<P>
	I have not seen the evidence that would support the $3,000. I 
used it because it was a threat that the automobile industry used 
to get its way with the government and the government bowed to 
that pressure.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
know we are running out of time, but I cannot stand by when 
threats such as these are made. I must say these threats that we 
would have to pay an additional $3,000 in insurance are 
somewhat ludicrous when we are talking about the environment. 
Quite frankly, a great environmentalist like the hon. member for 
Davenport should not even mention things like that.
<P>
	I have a great deal of respect for the hon. member for 
Davenport, because I think he has done some excellent work on 
our committee, but if it is a matter of politics, and I have a 
feeling this is strictly political, a conflict between the industry 
and the auto makers. It involves Ethyl Canada and the new 
ethanol plants in which the minister is about to invest $70 
million. A number of levels are involved here, and it is very 
political.
<P>
	Now, I want to see this matter discussed at the environmental 
level, starting today, and for heaven's sake, let us get serious and 
start considering the environment, once and for all. The 
government got rid of the Green Plan, and in its stead, we got a 
commissioner for the environment. The government eliminated 
a number of things that were very important for the 
environment.
<P>
	We should stop digging in our heels about a matter that is 
purely political. I would like to see this referred to committee, 
with as many witnesses as possible, so that we can get a really 
clear picture of what is at stake here. Right now, the amount of 
lobbying going on is incredible. I have never seen this with other 
bills, especially not on the environment.
<P>
	I think the environment comes first. I hope all members in this 
House who work on environmental issues will get together and 
make an environmental decision, not a political one just because 
the minister has decided to invest in a certain issue.
<P>
<B>(2330) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member from the Bloc is quite right: We have to 
depoliticize the whole process and get it back on sound technical 
grounds. That is what the opposition in unity is calling for.
<P>
	On who should pay for the independent review, the two 
conflicting positions should equally pay for the independent 
review.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I declare Motion No. 4 lost.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, in an effort to co-operate and 
perhaps accelerate things here, you might find unanimous 
consent to apply the vote just taken to Motions Nos. 8, 9, 10 and 
17. For Motions Nos. 14 and 15 you might find that same 
consent, but I understand that New Democratic Party members 
might be voting otherwise on Motions Nos. 14 and 15.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, we would give unanimous consent 
to applying the vote just taken to Motions 8, 9, 10 and 17. On 
Motions Nos. 14 and 15 the NDP votes no. On Motion No. 11 we 
vote yes.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: See list under Division No. 301.</I>]
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker:</B> I declare Motions Nos. 8, 9 and 10 lost.
<P>
	We have it all straightened out. The only thing we had not 
talked about in the last series was Motion No. 11. The question is 
on Motion No. 11.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you will find there is 
unanimous consent for applying the result of the vote just taken 
on the previous motion to the motion now before the House. 
Members of the Liberal Party will vote against Motion No. 11.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Bloc Quebecois members will vote in favour of 
the motion, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members will vote yea, 
with the exception of members who wish to vote otherwise.
<P>
<B>(2405) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, the NDP votes yea on this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maheu:</B> I would like to add my vote to that of the 
Liberal members on Motion No. 11.

	The House resumed from June 16 consideration of Bill S-7, 
an act to accelerate the use of alternative fuels for motor 
vehicles, as reported (with amendments) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This vote will be a bit different and I will tell 
you why. It is on Bill S-7 and we are going to be voting by row.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 45(6), the House will now proceed 
to the deferred divisions at report stage on Bill S-7, an act to 
accelerate the use of alternative fuels for motor vehicles.
<P>
	The question is on Motion No. 2. A vote on this motion also 
applies to Motions 3, 5, and 6.
<P>
	As is the practice, the division will be taken row by row, as I 
said, starting with the mover and then proceeding with those in 
favour of the motion sitting on the same side of the House as the 
mover. Then those in favour of the motion sitting on the other 
side of the House will be called. Those opposed to the motion 
will be called in the same order.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="POSTALSERVICES">POSTAL SERVICES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on May 5, 1995, I put a question to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage about budget cuts affecting a program 
designed to subsidize the distribution of magazines and 
publications. At the time the minister told me he would check 
with his officials and find out how effective the cuts were.
<P>
	However, I may recall for the benefit of the minister that 
cutting a job in the cultural sector has a more significant impact 
than it would in other sectors. For instance, it is said it costs 
about $20,000 to create a job in the cultural sector. Reducing 
subsidies for magazines and publications would have a far more 
significant impact in terms of jobs lost than similar cuts in other 
sectors.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="14185"> 14185 </A></B>
<P>
	The cultural sector is very sensitive to reductions in subsidies. 
In the current context it is clear the government must make cuts. 
However, one always wonders whether the cuts are appropriate 
and if it would have been possible to avoid them by raising 
additional taxes in some way, to avoid having to cut this kind of 
program.
<P>
	In this particular case the current government's decision is not 
one with which we can feel comfortable, considering the impact 
this decision will have on cultural industries. Furthermore, this 
decision adversely affects the dissemination of Canadian and 
Quebec culture. The publications and magazines that receive 
these subsidies tend to have a fairly low circulation and may as a 
result of this decision be forced to stop publishing, which is a far 
more drastic impact than what the minister had in mind.
<P>
	I would like to know whether since my question was put, the 
government received additional information it could use to 
analyse the situation or perhaps find alternatives so that the 
cultural sector would not be penalized by the government's 
decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
respond to the concerns of the hon. member.
<P>
	As announced in the finance minister's February budget, the 
postal subsidy will be reduced. This cut follows earlier cuts 
already announced in the previous government's December 
1992 economic statement and in the finance minister's April 
1994 budget.
<P>
	These cuts have been planned as follows: 10 per cent in 
1993-94; 10 per cent in 1994-95; 15 per cent in 1995-96; and 20 
per cent in 1996-97.
<P>
	This breakdown explains the difference between the 8 per cent 
reduction reported in the latest budget and a 24 per cent 
reduction mentioned in some newspaper articles.
<P>
	Despite the extent of these cuts, we are happy to point out 
once again that the postal rate increases for 1995-96 have been 
restricted to 5 per cent for paid circulation periodicals and to 10 
per cent for small community weekly newspapers.
<P>
	Also, we have successfully participated in the effort to reduce 
the deficit while protecting minority language weekly 
newspapers and ethnic newspapers. It is a success that deserves 
special recognition.
<P>
	With regard to the overall evolution of the budget for the 
postal subsidy, it was first reduced from $220 million to $110 
million by the previous government by excluding certain 
categories of beneficiaries and by moderately increasing the 
rates for the existing beneficiaries.
<P>
	The previous government had decided to eliminate all foreign 
publications, periodicals distributed free of charge and dailies 
from the program. In April 1993, $25 million was devoted to the 
creation of a replacement program for the Canadian book trade. 
Access to the  postal subsidy is now reserved for paid circulation 
periodicals, for library books and for small community 
weeklies.
<P>
	I hope this response will reassure the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup regarding the short and 
medium term future of the postal subsidy.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), the motion 
to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. Accordingly, the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 1.19 a.m.)
<P>
