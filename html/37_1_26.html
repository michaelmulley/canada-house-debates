that Bill C-233, an act to amend the Corrections and Conditional

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-233 is neither extensive nor is it complicated.  It is 
another attempt to bring balance to our justice system.  Having 
been intimately involved with various aspects of our justice 
system over the past number of years, I can fully appreciate its 
complexities, its size, its drain on resources and the necessity 
to balance the interests of the state, the offender and the 
victim.  Bill C-233 is merely an attempt to readjust one aspect 
of what I perceive to be an injustice in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I start to get into substantive issues about my proposed 
legislation, I would first like to advise listeners that the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs has decided to 
make the bill not votable.  I could question the rationale for 
that decision and I could criticize the government members who 
comprise the majority of that committee, but I will not.  I was 
not privy to their contemplations toward deciding what bills will 
be deemed votable and what bills will be deemed not votable.  I 
fully understand that as backbenchers we are competing against 
each other for a chance to bring our own interest to law. 
Perhaps the next time my issue will be more successful.  Perhaps 
even some day I may have the opportunity to sit on that committee 
and be forced to decide among many competing interests and 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I can say is that it is most unfortunate that Bill C-233 is 
not a votable bill.  It would dramatically lessen some of the 
emotional damages inflicted on individuals who have already been 
victimized by crime.  Our justice process should not further 
victimize these individuals.  I will attempt to explain the 
problem presented by the current process and how I am suggesting 
that it be alleviated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, the majority of incarcerated criminal offenders 
will at some time have served their sentences and be released 
back into the community.  At some point during their sentences 
they are permitted to apply for parole.  If successful, they are 
released back into the community under many forms of supervision. 
As a society we need to ensure this gradual reintroduction and 
reclamation to our streets is successfully accomplished without 
threat to law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My proposal only deals with one minor aspect of this process. 
Once the offender applies for consideration for parole, a number 
of other people are affected.  Correctional personnel may be 
interviewed to provide impressions and reflections on the 
character of the offender and whether that offender has made 
steps towards rehabilitation and contrition.  Parole personnel 
will prepare a file on the history of that offender in order to 
assist the hearing process to ensure adequate information is 
available to aid and determine the suitability for release. 
Victims may be interested in presenting their fears or opinions 
respecting the release of someone who may still present a danger 
of committing additional criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that there is nothing to stop offenders from 
withdrawing their applications for parole at any time during that 
process.  Some offenders make application only to withdraw at the 
last moment before the parole board hearing actually takes place. 
When this form of abuse occurs, time and money is expended to 
obtain and prepare the corrections aspect for these hearings. 
Some people might say the taxpayer is already paying the 
correctional employees so there is really not additional cost 
involved.  In some cases that may be so, but we are all probably 
aware that Canada does not have an overabundance of resources 
within the corrections department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also understand that because our corrections personnel 
are stretched so thinly additional demands for their attention 
often necessitates the working of overtime.  It may also require 
some travel as corrections personnel move from one location to 
another for many reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, parole board members have to prepare themselves to 
learn the file for each specific offender applying for parole. 
They must be able to adequately question witnesses who provide 
information to form the basis of a decision on whether or not to 
release an offender back into the community.  This costs time and 
money.  More significant, we all know how important it is to have 
these parole boards do their job properly and completely.  It 
does not help when time and effort is expended on a specific 
hearing, only to have it wasted when the offender subsequently 
withdraws that application.  The time and effort wasted could 
have been better spent on other applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are dealing with scarce resources it does not help when 
the process permits waste to occur.  We cannot afford the waste. 
The parole board must expend limited resources on the cases that 
are going to come to decision.  We must ensure that the proper 
decision to release or detain is made on the basis of all 
available information, otherwise offenders may be released back 
into our communities when they should not and others may be held 
in custody when they should be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victim is another important participant in the process.  The 
victim has the right to provide input into the granting of 
parole.  Victims often have to travel great distances to attend 
hearings which are nearly always held in the institution in which 
the offender is incarcerated.  The institution may be miles from 
the home of the victim.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frequently it may be in another province.  I have a very 
personal example.  Members of my family wishing to attend such a 
hearing for my son's killer would have had to travel from the 
west coast to Quebec.  When victims expend the time, money and 
effort to attend a hearing, only to have it cancelled at the last 
minute by the offender, I would suggest that the offender is 
revictimizing those individuals once again, both financially and 
emotionally.  The offender can reapply almost immediately and the 
roller coaster continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully I have sufficiently outlined the problem.  It becomes 
a question of control and balance.  It is the offender who has 
violated our laws but, as is so typical of our system, it is the 
same offender who possesses almost complete control over the 
parole process.  That is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it has often been said, quite derogatorily, “the inmates are 
running the asylum”.  This is not a debate about the right to 
parole.  I am speaking only about improving our present system. 
If we are to permit an offender to apply for parole there must be 
some controls and consequences to that offender so that everyone 
else is not disadvantaged.  Offenders who play “silly-bugger” 
with the process affect the stress and workload of corrections 
and parole board personnel as well as the lives of their victims. 
The whole parole process is needlessly skewed by legislation as 
an attempt to make a minor adjustment to bring that process into 
balance.  Reforming a process is not rocket science.  All I am 
suggesting is that there be some form of a consequence to the 
offender who initiates the process and then stops it without an 
acceptable reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment would permit withdrawal for “illness, mental or 
physical capacity” and that is for causes beyond the offender's 
control.  All we are doing is holding the offender to account. 
Withdrawal without proper excuse would have a consequence. 
Reapplication would not be permitted for two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some critics have looked at this legislation with a typical 
jaundiced view just because a member of the Canadian Alliance is 
proposing it.  They have challenged the bill over who will decide 
whether there is a valid excuse for the withdrawal of the 
application.  The legislation leaves that determination to the 
parole board.  They are the experts on parole hearings.  They can 
decide this simply aspect.  The offender of course will have the 
power to appeal any decision of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is not a partisan attack on the parole process. 
It is merely an attempt to bring some common sense to a problem. 
We have offenders who apply for parole, withdraw the application 
anywhere down the timeline up to the last moment without having 
to give a reason, and then reapply almost immediately without any 
consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move to some real examples of what has been occurring 
under the current provisions of this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Donald Alexander Hay kidnapped, raped and tortured 12 year old 
Abby Drover and held her in an underground dungeon for six 
months.  In November 1997 he withdrew his parole application 
after a public outcry over his possible release.  In March 1998 
he reapplied.  It does not take much to appreciate how much he 
has been able to further emotionally traumatize Abby Drover and 
her family when this situation occurs every few months.  There 
must be something to cause such a situation to be decided one way 
or the other or at least be put on hold for a set period of time. 
It cannot be left entirely in his hands to decide when and how 
often he can wreak emotional turmoil on others.  It cannot remain 
completely in his hands to cause needless work for the 
authorities when he unilaterally and without consequence 
withdraws from the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ali Rasai, in Edmonton, sexually assaulted Holly Desimone.  In 
1998 she travelled to Winnipeg for his parole hearing with the 
help of a stranger who donated enough air miles for the trip.  In 
August 1999 Holly once again had to travel for another scheduled 
hearing.  He was denied parole each time.  Another hearing was to 
take place in July 2000 and Holly was once again being forced to 
make plans to attend to say her peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government is most anxious to get offenders back on 
the streets in order to reduce incarceration costs.  However, not 
only was Holly horrendously damaged by Rasai, she was being 
forced to become inextricably intertwined with her abuser almost 
constantly over the past few years.  She became a puppet on a 
string being held and controlled by someone as devious and unfit 
to be a part of society as Ali Rasai.  I should tell listeners 
that Rasai is a former bodyguard for the shah of Iran and was 
convicted of raping three Alberta women, including Holly.  He is 
a martial arts expert who entered Canada as a refugee and then 
has treated his adopted home in this manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, the July 2000 hearing was postponed to August and 
then Rasai backed out once again.  Surely there is something 
desperately wrong with the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is a much more public case of Robert Thompson.  He 
murdered Brenda Fitzgerald in 1983 while he was out of prison on 
a work pass.  Brenda's mother, Helen Leadley, has become another 
puppet on a string. 
She has been forced to spend time and money to travel from 
Calgary to Dorchester Penitentiary in New Brunswick to attend the 
hearings that Thompson cancels at the last minute.  Helen Leadley 
has stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I've spent a lot of money going to these parole hearings, plus 
sometimes as soon as you get there, they're cancelled. 
</UL>

</I></B></P><P align=left>She estimates that she spent at least $3,000 attending 
Thompson's parole hearings in the maritimes. She further states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And it's not only the money, it's the emotional stress involved 
around this in trying to fight to keep him in prison. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to leave the wrong impression that Helen Leadley 
voluntarily has taken on this grudge match against the interests 
of Robert Thompson.  There is a much more societal interest in 
this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, Thompson committed the murder while he was already 
serving time for other offences.  He has continued to issue 
threats to the victim's family from the prison.  He once took a 
nurse hostage and stabbed two corrections officers during his 
time behind bars.  In short, he is not a nice guy but we still 
permit him to exercise almost total control over the parole 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice announced in August of last year that 
the government would allocate $25 million to help victims of 
crime.  The vast majority of that money is targeted toward 
research, consultation and public awareness of victims' rights. 
Some will go to emergency and other programs to help victims over 
the next years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen from many government financed programs, $25 
million sounds great when it is first announced but when we 
consider $5 million per year will get divided among 10 provinces 
and three territories, we soon realize that the money is not all 
that significant.  Then we have to fund the administration of the 
programs with that money.  It is difficult to see any funding 
support being available to victims to travel to parole hearings. 
Besides, as Helen Leadley has said, it is not just the money, it 
is the emotional turmoil that is hard to overcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not votable.  I would appreciate the support of all 
members to pressure the government into bringing forth this 
proposal as it is long overdue.  The minister is often fond of 
talking about balance within justice.  My suggestions will bring 
balance and accountability to the parole process.  I am only 
trying to bring fairness to all participants, including the 
administration.  These amendments to the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act will improve the efficiency and the 
effectiveness of a tiny but significant portion of the parole 
process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to 
speak to the member's proposal contained in Bill C-233. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is outlined and is put before us today to discourage an 
offender from cancelling or postponing his or her parole hearing 
within a certain period of time before it is scheduled to take 
place.  I understand that this proposal is being put forward to 
stop the inconvenience that such a cancellation would cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that is a laudable goal.  Last minute 
postponements can be an inconvenience, especially for those who 
have to travel great distances, as was pointed out by the speaker 
prior to me, and also for the victims, media representatives and 
other observers.  Of most concern, obviously, is the situation 
where a victim has planned to attend a hearing only to have the 
offender then cancel the hearing after the travel arrangements 
have been made.  This can only add to the upset the victims feel 
in that kind of situation and with the whole system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims do not choose to be in the situation they are in.  To 
the extent that it is possible to make the process work better 
for them of course we should do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I fear that the hon. member has gone too far with this 
bill.  If an offender cancels for any reason not found acceptable 
to the National Parole Board, he or she would not be eligible for 
another hearing for two years.  This is extreme punishment for an 
offender for what may turn out to be a minor inconvenience. If an 
offender cancels his or hearing a month or six weeks before it is 
scheduled to take place, the bill would deny the offender another 
chance for a parole hearing for two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid that this lengthy deprivation of access to 
conditional release in cases where only a very minor 
inconvenience was caused would not stand up to legal challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also referred to the need to protect the 
taxpayer in the first reading presentation of the bill.  Any 
initiatives that would make our system of delivery of services to 
Canadians more effective would certainly be welcome.  That being 
said, however, I am afraid that is not really an area where 
substantial or even minimal savings can be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the National Parole Board schedules hearings, it normally 
schedules a number of hearings on the same day.  If one such 
hearing is cancelled it can still proceed with the other hearings 
and no additional costs are incurred.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the case management work has already been done then it is not 
lost if a hearing is not held.  Case management is an ongoing 
process and reports are continually updated to reflect the 
current progress the offender is making.  A report may need to be 
updated for a future hearing but again the costs are minimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do in these cases is to ensure that the victims 
and other observers are told as quickly as possible of the 
cancellation or postponement.  We need to ensure that they find 
out when the hearing is rescheduled and we need to assist them in 
participating in a way that is most meaningful to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to point out that the government continues to work hard 
to understand the concerns of victims and supports the goal of 
helping them.  We have a track record in that area and will 
continue it.  That is why the government has taken a number of 
initiatives that will help victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have established the policy centre for victims issues in the 
Department of Justice.  The policy centre is mandated to develop 
and co-ordinate federal initiatives to strengthen the voice of 
victims in the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79 was brought into force December 1, 1999.  It is 
legislation to enhance the safety, security and privacy of 
victims of crime in the criminal justice system.  It is intended 
to ensure that victims are informed about opportunities to 
prepare victim impact statements and permits victims to read the 
statements out loud if they so choose.  It requires police and 
judges to consider the safety of victims in all bail decisions. 
It makes it easier for victims and witnesses to participate in 
trials and permits a judge to ban the publication of the identity 
of victims and witnesses in the appropriate circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it requires all offenders to pay an automatic victim 
surcharge, an additional monetary penalty, which will increase 
revenue for provinces and territories to expand and improve 
victim services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims policy centre will administer a $10 million victims' 
fund which will help to ensure that the perspective of victims of 
crime is considered in the development of all policies and 
legislation that may affect them.  These funds will support 
innovative programs and services, public education initiatives, 
conferences and research by non-governmental experts.  It will 
also be used to involve victim advocates and service providers, 
in partnership with provincial and territorial authorities, to 
identify key concerns and to develop options and strategies to 
meet the needs of victims in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funds will also assist provinces and territories to 
implement the new criminal code provisions benefiting victims of 
crime and the principles enunciated in the Canadian statement of 
basic principles of justice for victims of crime agreed to by 
provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 2000 the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights 
tabled its report on the five year review of the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act known as the CCRA.  In that review it 
made a number of additional recommendations that will assist 
victims.  In its response, the government has committed to take 
action on those recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What victims have told us is that they want more information and 
they want access to information earlier in the process.  They 
want more opportunities to be heard and more opportunities to 
provide information.  To that end, the government is committed to 
build on those identified needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, for example, has agreed to expand the 
information that will be provided to victims in the CCRA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, victims can attend National Parole Board hearings as 
observers.  They can submit an impact statement to the board for 
consideration.  New policies will allow victims to personally 
read a victim impact statement during the conditional release 
hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those victims who cannot attend the hearing, we will be 
exploring how they can have an opportunity to listen to the tapes 
of parole board hearings at local offices of the National Parole 
Board or the Correctional Service Canada.  This is an attempt 
to bring the hearings closer to the victim, recognizing that not 
all victims can or want to be at a hearing in person. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also made a commitment to setting up a national 
office for the victims of crime to improve the links between the 
federal correctional system and victims. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The office will work with the policy centre at the Department of 
Justice.  It will develop information for victims.  It will 
assist in preparing training materials to ensure that all victim 
liaison staff are well trained to meet the needs of the victims. 
That is important and Canadians will recognize that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it will be focused on solving problems that are 
identified by victims who find themselves in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be sure that whatever measures are put in place meet the 
needs of victims, consultations are taking place right now across 
Canada to meet with victims and seek their input on what they 
want from the system and how best to meet their needs.  These are 
the types of meaningful actions that will work to support victims 
once they find themselves in our criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully suggest that the approaches taken by the 
government and that are in the process of being taken by the 
government go a long way to improving the lot of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I cannot support the hon. member's bill.  While the 
inconvenience caused to other observers is regrettable, I think 
we need to ensure that whatever approach we take balances the 
rights of all participants, including the offender's right to 
have a hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of offenders do not cancel their hearings to 
cause inconvenience to either the National Parole Board members, 
their case management staff or the people who attend.  In a small 
number of cases, unfortunately, this does happen.  When it does, 
it reflects an attitude on the part of the offender that I am 
sure is taken into account by the parole board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I think it is important that we not support 
this non-votable item.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
chastise, punish, stigmatize: this would summarize the Alliance 
philosophy, one from which the hon. member for Surrey North has 
not deviated with his introduction of this bill.  It is intended 
as an extension of the repressive and punitive approach that is 
characteristic of the Canadian Alliance.  The same approach has 
been used in connection with the newest young offenders bill, 
Bill C-7, which that party does not feel is harsh enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outside of its propensity for the rod, the Canadian Alliance has 
nothing particularly tangible to propose.  Its concept of 
justice is way out of date, hearkening back to the days when the 
law was enforced by threats and terror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies have proven that extreme measures have never constituted 
a remedy, so why does the Alliance persist in promoting this 
outmoded model of justice?  That party is limited by its 
short term vision, which offers no concrete solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill of the hon. member for Surrey North represents an 
excessively punitive addition to the parole application process 
for inmates eligible for this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes the addition of two paragraphs to section 123 
of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Pierrette Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, pardon me, but there is someone 
talking behind me, and I find it very distracting.  Would it be 
possible to ask that person to keep quiet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> The hon. member has just 
indicated to me she is being bothered by the talking going on 
behind her.  If hon. members are having private conversations, 
would they hold them behind the curtain or in the lobby, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Pierrette Venne:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, which proposes to add two paragraphs to section 123 
of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, creates 
disproportionate penalties inappropriate to the logic of the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the bill of the member for Surrey North, an 
offender serving a sentence of two years or more, who withdraws 
a application for parole at a late stage in the review, without 
good reason, will not have a new application considered for two 
years. 
By contrast, in the case of an ordinary application for full 
parole the board turns down, the period before a new application 
may be submitted is only six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The excessive severity of the penalty proposed by the member for 
Surrey North is apparent. Withdrawal results in the imposition 
of a two year waiting period, while denial results in a six 
month period.  The difference between the two situations is 
unjustifiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, intended to limit a multiplicity of unwarranted 
withdrawals once the review process has begun, would be more 
relevant with an amendment to the penalty imposed for 
withdrawal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference to subsection 123(6) of the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act, which states that, when the board decides 
“not to grant full parole following a review pursuant to this 
section, no further application for full parole may be made 
until six months after the decision, reveals that the bill 
introduced by my Canadian Alliance colleague would only introduce 
a degree of discord in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member for Surrey North want to impose a harsher 
penalty in the case of a late stage withdrawal than in the case 
of a full parole request made at the end and rejected? Inmates 
would be unduly penalized by such a measure. They might as well 
not bother to withdraw an application for a review of their 
case, at the risk of having that application denied and start 
the process all over again six months later. Given this 
situation, why not shorten the suggested period from two years 
to six months? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this bill does not seem, on the face of it, to be a bad 
piece of legislation, the only thing that should be changed is 
the penalty, to make it more equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By setting a period similar to the one prescribed in the case of 
a new application for parole after a denial, namely six months, 
we would not lose sight of the objective pursued, while also 
establishing a fairer system. Inmates would not benefit from 
withdrawing their application for futile motives. They would 
have to take responsibility and face an appropriate penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With its proposed two year period, the bill could create a 
problem in that it could deter inmates from withdrawing their 
application even though they no longer quite feel ready for 
parole, this in spite of the motives that they might invoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the adjustment of the penalty, however, another 
factor needs to be considered in connection with this bill.  The 
statistics in a document dated April 2000 produced by the 
Correctional Service of Canada raise even more questions about 
the wisdom of Bill C-233. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statistics concern applications for parole from female 
inmates.  They reveal that none, 0%, of the 436 applications 
submitted between April 1998 and March 1999 were withdrawn. 
These results are very interesting and show how pointless it is 
to regulate a practice that, among women anyway, is exceptional, 
being quite simply non-existent.  In these conditions, what 
purpose is served by introducing a measure such as this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we therefore see the addition proposed by the 
member for Surrey North as a completely superfluous manoeuvre 
that has unfortunately done nothing but take up an hour of the 
House's time.  It is superfluous because, on the one hand, it 
would include in the bill a measure that is not absolutely 
essential, as the figures tend to show and, on the other, it 
would propose a penalty completely disproportionate to the 
action it is intended to discourage.  These are two reasons why 
such a bill is not votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem that the member has been carried away by the 
vindictive approach typical of his party, which tends to favour 
a heavy-handed approach to justice.  Imposing overly repressive 
measures is not the appropriate response to a situation that 
does not really require any particular action. 
Nothing is served by creating a threat-based justice system.  In 
fact, laying down the law is the only vision some political 
systems have come up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there must be respect for the law, but prevention and 
rehabilitation must also be considered.  Above all, experience 
has shown us that there must be a thoughtful, fair and equitable 
approach, as this is the only way of ensuring that justice 
becomes a tool for the evolution of society and not a mere 
reflection of its instincts.

familiar with the current criminal justice system given the 
tragic circumstances that befell him and his family when his son 
Jesse was murdered.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the member 
is completely sincere in his efforts to have this anomaly 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I will say that the purpose of this enactment 
is quite clearly to restrict the ability of an individual 
applying for parole to withdraw the parole request at the last 
moment, at the 11th hour, thus causing the system, but more 
important the victims and the victims' families, undue suffering, 
frustration and often significant financial loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment, as already discussed in the Chamber, does 
propose that a penalty be imposed, that is, there would be a 
two-year minimum before an individual could apply for parole once 
again.  My colleague from the Bloc suggests that this particular 
time period might be amended.  I would very much associate myself 
with that remark as well.  I think the hon. member for Surrey 
North would also be amenable to looking at this possible 
amendment to Bill C-233, because it is a discretionary act on the 
part of the parole board in any event.  Its ability to restrict 
the time in which an individual could apply once again for parole 
should also perhaps be discretionary.  This is a useful amendment 
and once again demonstrates the usefulness of this discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very least, the response would be to caution or to send a 
message of deterrence and denunciation when there is evidence 
that a system is being abused or flouted.  Clearly there may not 
be a rampant number of instances where this has happened, but I 
would humbly suggest to the House that if it happens at all it is 
an abuse.  If the system allows it to happen it is an anomaly 
that should be addressed, which is the purpose of the proposed 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation in its current form has no recourse.  Even in 
instances where it has been demonstrated that there has been a 
frivolous reason given for withdrawing application for parole, 
there is no actual recourse available for the parole board.  The 
bill will prevent an application from being withdrawn without 
good reason, after substantial preparation has been made, and 
then renewed again shortly.  There is a very common sense 
approach in this legislation.  There is a reason behind it that 
one can quite clearly embrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party will support the bill for the simple 
reason that the current practice allows offenders to waste 
resources of the parole board but more important because it 
allows mental anguish for the victims of the offender.  Upon 
examination of the facts, a determination of the reason for the 
cancellation can be made quite easily.  This would be weighed to 
determine the validity, and if it is not valid then surely some 
consequences should follow.  This is consistent with all 
principles of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that further punishment should be unfairly 
meted out to individuals in addition to their sentences.  It is 
simply a response when it becomes clear that a potential parolee 
has made a tactical decision to withdraw his or her application 
for whatever reason. 
One can only imagine the demented mind of a person who would do 
this for the simple joy of causing anguish to victims, but sadly 
there are those in the system who do just that.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, it may be done for a tactical reason.  It may be done 
to throw off the efforts of the victims to attend the parole 
board hearing, for example, where their comments might have some 
impact on whether parole is granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple principle that there have to be consequences, as I 
have stated, is very consistent with principles of justice and 
deterrence.  This would put in place some deterrents for the 
parole board if it was proven on fact and on evidence that a 
parolee had abused the system to his or her advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill surely aims at subduing the antics of anyone who would 
behave in this fashion.  Without mentioning the names of some of 
our more high profile heinous criminals in the country, we know 
that there are those who have engaged in this type of activity. 
The hon. member for Surrey North has recited some concrete 
examples of what has happened in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial implications are also a consideration when 
examining the facts of the legislation.  Costs for travel and 
accommodation are most often borne by the victims.  We have a 
vast country and clearly we have institutions from coast to 
coast.  Through no fault of their own, victims very often feel it 
incumbent upon themselves, as abhorrent as it seems to the 
offender, to see that justice is being done, to attend parole 
hearings and to have their say.  They feel a personal attachment 
to the file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hasten to add that there have been improvements in our justice 
system.  There have been efforts made to be more inclusive and to 
ensure that victims are heard within our system.  There have been 
recent changes which I and our party applaud, but we are also 
familiar with the fact that there remain a lot of areas for 
improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often there is a lack of information.  Lack of information plays 
into the situation that is the subject of the bill.  Often this 
occurs when a victim is not given ample warning or advance notice 
of when a parole hearing is going to be cancelled; the victim 
therefore suffers all of the consequences of not having that 
information in advance.  Having a national victims ombudsman 
office would address some of this lack of information which is 
sometimes inherent in the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is one that I feel is laudable.  It is a concrete 
effort by the member to close a loophole, which would very much 
be to the advantage, not an unfair advantage but a fair 
advantage, of victims who are striving to participate in our 
justice system at whatever level they choose.  That is often key 
when dealing with victims.  The key is to ensure that they have 
the discretionary power to participate to whatever level they 
choose within the current law and to ensure that they feel they 
have a voice, that their opinions and their input matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the individual who put the bill forward has 
personal knowledge and understanding from a victim's perspective 
of how the system is currently working and, in some cases, 
currently failing.  He has identified quite clearly with Bill 
C-233 a substantive change that could be made which would address 
the current problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party has been a consistent supporter of 
victims of crime and will continue to support efforts such as 
this when they are brought forward with the best of intentions 
and with great honesty and integrity, as is the case before us. 
The Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime is also very 
supportive, as are other victims who have faced this situation in 
the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not in any way to undermine the laudable goals of 
rehabilitation and reintegration within our current system. 
However, support for victims is needed and enacting this 
legislation would inject fairness and greater access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest as well that it is a bill which should be made 
votable.  We certainly would support the hon. member's motion to 
make this matter votable.  I would hope all members would do the 
same.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when I came here today I thought this 
subject would be something we could discuss calmly and 
rationally. There would be some differences of opinion, but I did 
not think it would evoke a tremendous amount of emotion.  It 
would be based on some facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I saw the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice rise to respond to my colleague.  He is known to go off 
like a Roman candle with very little requirement or cause 
whatsoever.  I was pleased he was relatively calm today.  In fact 
he was quite calm.  I do not think his reasoning was very good, 
but he was uncharacteristically calm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we heard from the Bloc Quebecois member. I have never in my 
life heard such garbage spewed forth in the House.  The attack 
made by that member, and I certainly will not expand on it— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member, but I would ask him to address his comments 
through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  I believe I was, Mr. Speaker.  I was 
referring to a member.  I certainly did not intend to speak 
directly to her.  In light of the comments she made, I really do 
not want to speak to her.  If I made that mistake, I apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Bloc Quebecois rose in the House to question 
the motives and the whole concept of how the hon. member for 
Surrey North approaches this problem.  If there is a member in 
the House that has a right to be bitter and enraged about the way 
the system works, it is he.  I have never found a more reasoned 
person trying to make honest changes.  I am absolutely disgusted 
that any member of the House would rise to put forth the 
unmentionable types of statements she made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will look at some of them.  She talked about how this would be 
so unfair to these poor prisoners because it would give them 
additional time in prison.  May I remind her that when people are 
sentenced to eight years in prison it is intended that they be in 
prison for eight years.  Parole is a privilege, not a right. They 
should have to show they have earned parole.   Manipulating the 
system is certainly not a good way to earn parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am absolutely shocked that someone from Quebec of all places 
that has such a huge problem with organized crime would stand in 
this place to start defending the rights of people in prisons who 
further twist the system once they have been caught and 
convicted.  It is no wonder there are so many problems with 
criminals in the province of Quebec when people like that 
represent the criminals themselves.  I think it is disgusting. As 
far as the fact that she was bothered by other conversations, I 
think it is pretty obvious I was bothered by hers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to address a couple of comments that were made 
by the parliamentary secretary.  He talked about the wonderful 
things the government was doing for victims.  It has developed a 
policy centre for victims of crime.  What is the good of having a 
policy centre if it does not listen to what those very people are 
saying and does not provide the help that they plead for when 
they come before the parliamentary committee of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard these people and they did not ask for a lot.  I was a 
member of the committee that reviewed the CCRA.  They did not 
come in pounding on the table, frothing at the mouth and making 
demands.  They came in with quiet reasoning, with a great amount 
of sadness and heaviness in their hearts.  They said there were 
problems in the system which they hoped the government would try 
to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of sitting with the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  I was happy to have his support 
because there was scant support on that committee.  The hon. 
member from the Bloc Quebecois joined the committee later as a 
replacement member.  I do not know if her attitude would have 
changed if she had seen the whole thing and had an opportunity to 
see what we did while we studied the issue.  I would like to 
think it would have, that she had some misplaced ideas rather 
than a strange point of view overall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said that they were striving for 
more opportunities for victims to be heard.  That is what this is 
all about.  We want more opportunities for these people to be 
heard.  The problem occurs when they come in, in keeping what the 
government has said, to avail themselves of greater opportunities 
to be heard, only to have someone who wants to manipulate the 
system cancel the hearing at the last moment.  That is not in 
keeping with what the parliamentary secretary says the government 
wishes to do. 
Ironically all we are doing with the bill is trying to help him 
keep his own word.  We work very hard to try to keep them honest 
over there.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we need a much better look at the issue.  One of the 
points made today was that sometimes when good ideas come forth 
in this place from the Canadian Alliance there is an automatic, 
and I do mean automatic, rejection of those ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be more than happy to have the government steal the 
idea and bring it out as its own.  We would be happy to applaud 
it for doing so.  We do not care how it gets out.  We do not care 
who gets the credit for it.  We just want the system to work 
better and to be fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, these victims did not come forward with 
great demands.  They came forward very humbly and did not ask for 
a lot.  They came forward knowing that they would not be able to 
make great changes but hoping the government was listening and 
would address the serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said that there would be minor 
inconvenience for the parole board and really no cost.  What 
about the victims?  Maybe it is not a great cost to him if he has 
to travel across the country, only to have the plan cancelled at 
the last minute, because he has more time for something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims do not look at it in that way.  They plan leave from 
their business, place of work or employment.  They may use their 
vacation time, not for a vacation or to do something that 
relieves their lives and helps them to rejuvenate themselves but 
to immerse themselves back in the horrors of the original crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that time they make a commitment and prepare themselves 
mentally to undergo the ordeal.  They commit time from their 
employer.  They may buy a ticket, a non-refundable ticket, to 
travel.  To have offenders cancel a hearing without good cause, 
sometimes as victims are literally walking into the room, is not 
a small hardship for victims.  It is a massive one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes what it says.  If the parliamentary 
secretary believes in the things he said a few moments ago, that 
he would like more opportunities for victims to be heard and the 
system to be fairer, the bill must go ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be amended to give more flexibility to the parole 
board in terms of how much time or when exactly it should be 
impacted, but government members should not turn their back on 
it.  They must do something with it.  It is not a partisan issue. 
The parliamentary secretary knows that if anyone is non-partisan 
in trying to fix the problems of the parole system and the 
justice system, it is the hon. member for Surrey North. 
I ask those members to consider the matter, not as members of 
government, not as members who are whipped into a particular 
position by their party, but by their own conscience.  I urge 
them to try to place themselves in the shoes of victims and try 
to imagine, even just for a moment, how they would feel if they 
were in these circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are few over there, if they honestly did this, who would 
not support the bill or at least something very close to it. 
Victims have rights.  Those rights should far outweigh the rights 
of the people who made them victims in the first place.  It 
should not even be a major consideration on the part of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good bill.  It is a bill that has been brought forward 
with honourable intentions by someone who has worked very hard to 
see that the system is balanced and balanced fairly.  I urge 
members to consider allowing the bill to go ahead. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank all those who spoke to the bill.  Even though 
the bill is not votable, at least we have been provided with an 
opportunity for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In bringing the issue forward in this manner I hope it may cause 
the government to think about the proposal.  I respectfully ask 
government members to use their influence to attempt to sway the 
powers that be to consider this suggestion for change. 
I also respectfully ask the parole authorities to think about 
this and attempt to influence the government to act.  It would 
lessen their workload and enable them to more effectively 
administer their program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not ask for this change for myself.  I ask it on behalf of 
victims of crime.  I ask it on behalf of the Canadian taxpayer. 
Yes, I even ask it on behalf of those offenders who are most 
affected by the parole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may well ask where I am coming from when I suggest that 
even the offenders could be helped by this proposal.  As I stated 
earlier, criminal offenders are classified as such because they 
have been unable to follow the rules set out by society.  We have 
laws and they have offended those laws.  They are being punished 
and rehabilitated to convince them and others of the necessity 
for all of us to follow the norm set out to enable all of us to 
peacefully co-exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, even after they are incarcerated and placed on the 
so-called road to rehabilitation, it accomplishes nothing to just 
forget about them.  We have rules and laws to ensure that they 
are properly considered and treated.  One of the rights we 
provide is the right to be heard and considered for parole at 
some point during their sentence.  The problem the bill attempts 
to address is the abuse of that right.  Because there is no 
consequence for the abuse of that right, we are doing a rather 
poor job of rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of rehabilitation is showing offenders the error of their 
ways and assisting them to correct their behaviour and desist 
from future criminal activity.  If we set up a right to apply for 
parole and then permit an offender to abuse that right, what are 
we teaching that individual?   Are we not permitting deviant 
behaviour to continue?  Would it not make more sense to provide 
the right and include a consequence for abuse of that right? This 
is what I am suggesting.  It only makes sense.  It may not be 
that big a deal in the overall scheme of things but I really fail 
to understand why something so elemental has been ignored and 
allowed to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please do not get me wrong.  I would be the last to ever suggest 
that this issue is insignificant to victims of crime.  I know how 
important it is to them.  I know how they have been messed around 
because of the shenanigans perpetrated by some offenders.  It is 
time to stop this abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked how prevalent this abuse may be.  I do not 
think I could come up with a better answer than that provided by 
the chair of the subcommittee of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs.  She stated “One case is one case 
too many.  We do not play number games here”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To provide more information is difficult because we often do not 
learn of abuses unless the victims go public with their 
complaints.  The parole authorities have been good soldiers for 
the government and they merely carry on to administer the laws 
they are presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three cases I mentioned were easily found when I went 
looking for examples.  The Canadian resource centre for victims 
of crime supports this initiative and considers the issue of 
extreme importance.  In fact, I have a letter from the centre's 
president, Mr. Steve Sullivan, expressing his disappointment with 
the fact that the bill was deemed to be non-votable.  He has 
personally attended a number of parole hearings with victims who 
have been re-victimized in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to debate this matter and, rest 
assured, I do not intend to let it go.  I will continue to do my 
part to attempt to bring about the necessary change.  I 
respectfully request the unanimous consent of the House to make 
the bill votable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation has always played a vital role in our history and 
it continues to do so today.  The means of travel have changed 
from the days of the canoe, wagon and steam engine.  Canoes are 
still important today but much has changed in terms of modes of 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts of Canadian geography and economics remain much the 
same.  We are a country of distances and space, a comparatively 
small population spread across a vast land mass, relying on trade 
with other nations for our prosperity.  Those are the facts of 
Canadian life and they are the reasons transportation continues 
to be so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation remains essential to our lives and to our 
economy. Transport Canada has examined every aspect of our 
transportation system in recent years to determine what tools the 
economy needs to thrive.  In turn, the government has worked to 
improve the legislative framework governing air transportation, 
railways and ports.  It is time to bring Canadian shipping into 
the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Shipping Act is the principal piece of legislation 
governing personal safety and environmental protection in the 
marine sector.  No one can deny the pressing need to review and 
overhaul the legislation.  I say pressing need because the 
legislation is sorely outdated and a successful marine industry, 
essential to our prosperity, needs modern legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a maritime nation with three coasts and vast interior 
waterways.  We are a trading nation and we depend on shipping to 
move much of our trade.  Transport Canada data indicates that in 
1999 the civil marine industry directly employed approximately 
31,000 people and shipped a total of 334 million tonnes of cargo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shipping industry moved imports and exports worth $83 
billion in 1999.  Over 90% of marine tonnage derives from bulk 
commodities such as coal, ores, petroleum, grain and forest 
products.  International shipments comprise about 84% of total 
traffic, a number expected to grow in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite that impressive record, Canada's shipping industry will 
find it increasingly difficult to compete internationally unless 
we implement transportation policies that are based on sound, 
modern legislation and consistent with those of our trading 
partners.  We can readily see that transportation is vital to 
Canada, that the marine industry is important to our economy and 
that the Canada Shipping Act is outdated and needs revision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the proposed legislation before the House?  How will 
it answer the needs I have outlined? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives of Bill C-14 are stated clearly in part 1 of the 
bill.  The objectives are threefold:  First, to protect the 
health, safety and well-being of individuals; second, to protect 
the marine environment; and third, to encourage viable, effective 
and economical marine transportation and commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To support those objectives a complete reform of the Canada 
Shipping Act was undertaken.  The reform had three goals: First, 
to simplify the legislation by replacing outdated terminology 
with plainer language, harmonizing it with other regimes and 
taking out excessively prescriptive details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, to make it consistent with federal regulatory policies, 
reducing reliance on regulations and permitting alternative 
approaches, such as compliance agreements, performance standards 
and voluntary industry codes which are much more consistent with 
today's regulatory practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, to contribute to the economic performance of the marine 
industry by reducing prescriptive elements and the administrative 
burden imposed by the current legislation, and by giving the 
industry the increased flexibility it needs to maintain safety 
and to increase business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current act is, without exaggeration, antiquated.  The act 
came into law in 1936 and was based on the 1896 British merchant 
shipping law.  Many parts of the existing act are so out of date 
they would be amusing if the act were not a crucial piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act is also supported by an extensive regulatory regime 
composed of at least 90 separate regulations.  The sheer size, 
difficult language and vast coverage of the legislation make it 
as difficult to enforce as to follow.  Canada needs modern 
legislation that will benefit, not hinder, the marine sector in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-14 is the result of several years' work by the Department 
of Transport in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, Industry and other affected parties and stakeholders. 
It is not a mere retrofitting of the old act.  It has been built, 
much like a vessel, from the keel up.  We call Bill C-14 the 
Canada Shipping Act, 2001 because it reflects a complete break 
with the past.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a crucial step toward ensuring that the Canadian 
shipping industry has legislation that reflects modern industry 
practices and keeps up with technological advancements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A joint effort by Transport Canada and Fisheries and Oceans 
Canada, Bill C-14 was developed through unprecedented 
consultations with stakeholders.  This consultative process is an 
excellent example of co-operation between the government and the 
marine communities to achieve the shared objective of improving 
our marine system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the government, I take the opportunity to thank the 
interested parties that brought forward their views on the many 
issues addressed in the legislation.  The Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans and Transport Canada crossed the country five 
different times holding discussion groups and listening to the 
ideas of individuals and industry.  In June 1999 a draft bill was 
shared with the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two departments listened carefully to stakeholders and, 
wherever possible, accommodated their concerns.  They drew the 
line only where accepting a proposal would have undermined their 
ability to protect the marine environment or the health and 
well-being of those who work in the marine industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before the House is appropriate.  It 
incorporates most of the concerns presented to the government by 
diverse groups with differing views from across the country.  The 
aim of the bill is to make Canada's marine legislation a tool 
that benefits all Canadians, to enable industries to be more 
competitive and to protect the marine environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-14 was drafted to be accessible and comprehensible to all 
Canadians.  In keeping with this goal, the language of the new 
act is simpler.  The legislation is more concise and logically 
organized.  The number of sections has been greatly reduced and, 
as requested by the marine community, Bill C-14 contains a 
preamble that states the overall objectives of the act and makes 
it simpler and easier to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also clearly delineates the areas of 
responsibility between the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and 
Transport Canada.  For instance, the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans has responsibility for pleasure craft and Transport Canada 
has responsibility for all non-pleasure craft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both industry and Transport Canada require a mechanism to 
address rapid technological change.  Unlike aircraft or 
locomotives, ships are most often built one at a time.  This 
requires flexibility in how we administer regulations, a 
flexibility that must be tempered within the bounds set by 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-14 clearly outlines the powers of a proposed marine 
technical review panel which would replace the existing board of 
steamship inspection.  The panel would be empowered to grant an 
exemption only if it were in the public interest and would not 
jeopardize marine safety or the environment.  Any exemption would 
need to result in an equivalent or greater level of safety before 
the panel could approve an application or an exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-14 clarifies the shipmaster's responsibility to ensure 
the vessel is adequately staffed with properly qualified and 
trained personnel.  Also clarified is the master's authority to 
maintain good order and discipline on board a vessel. In response 
to stakeholder concerns, the right of seafarers to place a lien 
against a vessel for unpaid wages remains in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour provisions in the existing act, the Canada Labour Code 
and provincial statutes, often overlap.  To avoid this, the 
department's ability to regulate in the area of occupational 
health and safety is restricted to matters not identified in the 
labour code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 4 of the bill is primarily concerned with the safe design, 
construction, inspection and operation of vessels. Detailed 
provisions in the existing legislation have been moved to other 
regulations or standards.  Antiquated provisions were eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In consultation with stakeholders, industry supported Transport 
Canada's retaining responsibility for setting minimum ship safety 
standards.  It was also agreed that the responsibility for safety 
and compliance should be shared among those working on a vessel 
and that these responsibilities, particularly those of the 
master, should be defined in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-14 allows Canada to fulfil its international obligations 
respecting various international conventions, such as safety of 
life at sea and the international safety management code, by 
allowing the department to implement these instruments via 
regulation.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us focuses on safety and covers all 
Canadian waters and fishing zones.  Provisions related to marine 
liability have been transferred to the Marine Liability Act, 
introduced as Bill S-2, which will hopefully soon be before 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commitment to marine safety and protection of the environment 
has been reinforced by Canada's commitment to port state control. 
As a port state, Canada is permitted to board foreign vessels to 
inspect them regardless of the currency of their safety 
certificates.  That means that whoever comes into our ports will 
be inspected, no matter what flag they fly.  More than 25% of all 
vessels that dock in Canadian ports are inspected, with the focus 
being on ships with potential safety concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 Canada inspected 1,076 vessels from 86 registered 
countries.  Of those, about half had deficiencies in such major 
areas as lifesaving, navigation equipment and safety in general. 
The greatest number of deficiencies was in the area of fire 
safety measures.  In 1999, 125 vessels were detained until 
deficiencies were rectified.  To ensure the safety of ports and 
of vessels using Canadian waters, we must maintain vigilance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main objectives of the proposed legislation is to 
protect the marine environment.  Bill C-14 contains regulation 
making authority regarding preventing and responding to pollution 
of the marine environment.  Transport Canada and Fisheries and 
Oceans officials have worked closely with all interested parties 
to ensure that the legislation's pollution preventing provisions 
are modern and consistent with other domestic and international 
standards.  The departments have also worked together to ensure 
that the penalties for non-compliance are competitive and 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada takes all pollution matters seriously.  The 
proposed legislation enhances the ability to protect the marine 
environment.  Measures to prevent marine pollution and improve 
maritime safety are addressed by the International Maritime 
Organization.  The measures are implemented in Canada through the 
Canada Shipping Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the department's efforts focus on preventing pollution 
by setting regulatory requirements for ship based equipment such 
as oil-water separators, inspection and certification of Canadian 
vessels, and inspection of foreign vessels calling at Canadian 
ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When ship sourced pollution is detected in the marine 
environment Transport Canada investigates in close co-operation 
with Environment Canada and the Canadian Coast Guard.  When 
sufficient evidence is collected charges are laid using 
regulations under the Canada Shipping Act or other Canadian 
statutes depending on the source of the pollution incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation provides appropriate deterrents and an 
effective enforcement scheme which includes penalties for minor 
and serious offences relating to the environment.  For major 
pollution offences the penalty provisions contained in the 
proposed act are modelled on the current Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is also a high priority for 
the Canadian government.  Marine transportation contributes only 
about 3% of all transportation related emissions.  That makes 
marine transportation an important part of a sustainable 
transportation system.  We as members of parliament must 
encourage its use wherever possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time even those emissions can be further reduced. 
Transport Canada will continue to have authority to regulate 
emissions from large vessels and will continue to make that a 
priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a need to protect the marine environment from 
harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens that enter our waters in 
ship ballast water.  Transport Canada continues to lead national 
and regional working groups on ballast water.  A commitment has 
been made to have Canadian regulations on ballast water in place 
by 2002.  Having a Great Lakes riding, I can appreciate the 
importance of regulating ballast water that comes from our oceans 
through ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now turn to an aspect of the economic regulations of shipping 
and navigation, namely the Shipping Conferences Exemption Act. 
For the purposes of this discussion I will say SCEA from here on 
in.  Amendments to SCEA are found in part 15 of Bill C-14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 15 addresses an important aspect of transportation 
supporting the Canadian economy: the movement by ship of Canada's 
overseas containerized trade, as well as some general cargo. This 
is specifically known in the industry as the liner trade. 
International shipping lines offer regularly scheduled liner 
services between ports around the globe.  A shipping line has the 
choice to join a shipping conference or to remain as an 
independent operator.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A shipping conference is a group of ocean shipping lines acting 
collectively to set rates and offer services on specific trade 
routes.  Shipping conferences are recognized throughout the world 
and they contribute to reliable service and stable rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of Canada's trading partners, such as the United States, 
Europe, Australia and Japan, accommodate conferences through 
special legislation.  Recently they have reviewed their 
conference legislation and concluded that, while it should be 
retained, more competitive provisions can be accommodated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Shipping Conferences Exemption Act exempts shipping 
conferences from certain provisions of the Competition Act and 
sets the rules for their operations.  Amendments to SCEA are now 
required to keep Canada's shipping conferences legislation and 
rules in balance with Canada's major trading partners.  The 
amendments encourage a more competitive climate within 
conferences and also streamlines the administration of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada enacted its first Shipping Conferences Exemption Act in 
1971.  SCEA was updated and replaced on two occasions, in 1979 
and again in 1987.  Both revisions added new competitive 
provisions in the act.  SCEA was last reviewed by the National 
Transportation Act Review Commission and the Standing Committee 
on Transport during the years 1992 and 1993.  It was concluded 
that, while conferences run counter to the general government 
policy of encouraging competition, the act should be retained on 
grounds that the economic uncertainty created by its elimination 
would not be in Canada's best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While liner shipping represents only 15% of Canada's 
international marine tonnage, this figure does not adequately 
reflect the importance of liner shipping to Canada as lower value 
bulk commodities, like grain and coal, dominate the tonnage 
statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, commodities in the liner trades consist of higher 
value products, such as electronic and telecommunications 
equipment and automobile components. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The container business is also a major contributor to the 
prosperity of ports, such as Vancouver, Montreal and Halifax, 
Canada's three main container ports.  It is therefore in Canada's 
interest to continue to attract the shipping lines while at the 
same time encouraging affordable ocean transportation and an 
adequate and reliable level of service for Canadian industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be understood that even though a shipping conference 
may be entitled to an exemption under SCEA, the act does not 
suspend the application of the Competition Act for any conference 
agreement if any party to the agreement conspires, agrees or 
arranges to engage in predatory pricing or other anti-competitive 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While anxious to protect the interests of Canadian industry, the 
government must be mindful of the need for a balanced approach to 
conference legislation.  Radical anti-conference measures or a 
departure from compatible international rules could result in 
unfavourable repercussions for Canadian industry and Canadian 
ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that the amendments to SCEA, as contained in part 
15, will encourage a more competitive operating climate within 
shipping conferences and will provide added flexibility for 
shippers in dealing with conferences.  Shippers will have the 
ability to more quickly access rates and services offered by 
individual conference lines.  Meanwhile each conference member 
will be able to negotiate service contracts with shippers without 
adhering to terms and conditions set by the conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments are also designed to streamline the 
administration of the act.  Hence, tariff filing by conferences 
with the Canadian Transportation Agency will be replaced with 
public electronic access to conference tariffs and other 
conference information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By adopting these changes to SCEA, Canadian legislation 
pertaining to shipping conferences will remain in balance with 
our major trading partners.  Shippers will benefit from the 
injection of greater competition into the practices of 
conferences while conferencing will continue to have a limited 
exemption from the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the bill will help make Canada's waterways a 
safer place for both seafarers and the public and will ensure a 
competitive industry.  It is a product of unprecedented 
consultations with industry and other stakeholders, a process 
that has helped us to craft legislation that will protect safety 
and the environment through a graduated series of fair and 
appropriate penalties retaining always prosecution for serious 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politics is the art of the possible.  We have practised that art 
balancing the needs and concerns of Canadians with different 
interests and protecting the environment and those who work at 
sea.  The results are an effective piece of legislation that will 
replace an act long overdue for renewal and give Canadians the 
modern, efficient framework we need for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House to support the bill and speedily send it off to 
committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-14, the Canada Shipping Act, 2001. 
This is a major piece of legislation early in this new 
parliament.  We do not know if it will last a full millennium but 
the contents of the bill will stand for decades.  I say that 
based partly on past experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old act has been on the books and has received only minor 
changes since 1936 and has served us reasonably well.  However it 
became apparent within Transport Canada and Fisheries and Oceans 
Canada, as well as to our marine industry and stakeholders, that 
a newer, more comprehensive and modern version of the act was 
needed to keep Canada's marine activities globally competitive 
and environmentally sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members have been hearing, the bill is a major overhaul of 
the old legislation, almost from top to bottom.  It clearly sets 
out the roles of both the Minister of Transport and the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans.  The thrust is to simplify the 
legislation and clarify regulatory authorities which will 
contribute to economic viability and environmental sustainability 
in our marine industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the standpoint of fisheries and oceans, the legislation 
clarifies and strengthens important areas of responsibility, in 
particular, ensuring the safety of navigation, including pleasure 
boating, and the protection of the marine environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arriving at this point took many years of work both within 
government and with stakeholders across the country.  Those 
industries and individuals who must live under the law every day 
had an unprecedented opportunity to improve the legislation 
before this final version of the bill was written.  From 
commercial shipping and supertankers to the recreational boating 
community, everyone had a chance to participate in the review of 
this important legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have before the House today is the government's tangible 
proof of leadership and of commitment to the marine sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I want to urge all hon. members to assist us in proceeding 
quickly with the final track of this much needed reform.  When 
passed by parliament, the Canada Shipping Act, 2001 will be a 
modernized act, one that will satisfy the regulatory needs of the 
marine community and marine stakeholders for years to come.  It 
will enable government and stakeholders to work better together 
to ensure a clean marine environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three of the department's long term priorities and goals are 
directly related to the bill.  The legislation goes a long way 
toward strengthening our ability to make these goals a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the priority of maintaining marine safety.  This 
means safe practices on the water which is essential for saving 
lives and preventing accidents.  We are proud of what we have 
accomplished in the past but we know that the tools in this bill 
are essential for us to go even further toward ensuring safe, 
clean waters to which we can all have access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport said 
in his speech, marine activity is on the rise very dramatically. 
We have to be able to respond so that we not only maintain but 
also improve on past performance.  The bill will contribute to 
enhanced marine safety through new provisions covering vessel 
traffic services, aids to navigation and clear definition of the 
department's responsibilities for pleasure craft.  It also sets 
out the department's responsibilities for pollution prevention 
and response and search and rescue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second long term goal of the department relating to the bill 
is to facilitate marine transportation, commerce and ocean 
development.  The bill is in large part a response to demands for 
much needed clarification and modernization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government demonstrated leadership in undertaking this 
massive task in consultation with many stakeholders.  The result 
before the House today is a document which, I am confident to 
say, satisfies the regulatory needs of the marine community 
within an environmentally sound framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marine traffic is increasing at a tremendous rate, from huge 
ocean going commercial vessels to the vast increase in the number 
of recreational vessels on our waters.  We need to be in a 
position to handle these movements safely and efficiently.  The 
bill before the House provides us with the authority to do just 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the third priority of pollution prevention and 
response.  This means working closely and effectively with 
industry in fulfilling our commitment to manage and protect the 
marine and freshwater environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will be an invaluable tool in helping us prevent oil 
spills.  It will also help us respond quickly and effectively in 
case the unthinkable occurs despite all our best efforts.  The 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans will take the lead in this 
part of the act.  DFO is responsible for ensuring that oil 
handling facilities have oil spill prevention plans in place in 
an arrangement for response with a coast guard certified response 
organization to control the consequences just in case.  As 
sometimes happens, the best laid plans go awry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill maintains the legislative basis for an innovative 
government industry partnership, which now enhances Canada's 
national oil spill preparedness and response capacity.  It also 
allows Canada to fulfill its international commitments in 
co-operating with other countries on measures to strengthen our 
national oil spill preparedness and response system.  It allows 
for greater public scrutiny of the actions that government and 
industry undertake to protect the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that when I talk about provisions concerning 
response to pollution incidents, I do not mean to imply that 
accidents are the norm in the marine environment.  They are not. 
Rather, my point is to show that this is a balanced and realistic 
piece of legislation that focuses on safety by emphasizing 
prevention first and foremost, while at the same time prudently 
recognizing that one must always be prepared for accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marine safety relies upon wisdom which dictates that a combined 
approach is best, an approach that focuses on both prevention and 
response to save lives and protect the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, let me add a few more general observations on the 
importance of the bill.  The minister and the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans are guided by three key objectives:  safety, 
efficiency and environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian coast guard plays a key role in ensuring that the 
department meets these objectives in regard to activities in the 
marine environment.  The coast guard will be instrumental in 
assisting the department to make sure the new act is implemented 
smoothly and effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the bill really provides is an important piece of 
regulatory framework that allows DFO to get on with doing its job 
of providing key services that benefit Canadians.  The Canadian 
coast guard is guided by the motto “Safety first, service 
always”.  That is precisely what the bill is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 the coast guard carried out nearly 6,500 search and 
rescue operations and saved 3,500 lives at risk.  That is an 
impressive record but of course we want to improve by reducing 
the need for this kind of performance.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of the bill before us today is to enhance our preventive 
capacity so fewer lives are endangered in the future.  In short, 
the administrative efficiencies and increased safety aspects of 
the Canada Shipping Act, 2001 will be a benefit for all who work 
or play on the water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members to do their part to make this proposed 
legislation a reality.  Those who come from maritime communities 
know firsthand the importance of clear rules, safe waters and 
shared responsibility.  The Canada Shipping Act, 2001 covers all 
of these aspects, strengthening the government's regulatory role 
where needed while placing increased responsibility on industry 
and on those who enjoy our waterways to plan for good practices 
and safer environments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the studying and planning that went into the bill 
have taken many months.  Now is the time for the House to take on 
its responsibility, show leadership and pass the bill as quickly 
as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise this 
afternoon to address Bill C-14, an act respecting shipping and 
navigation and to amend the Shipping Conferences Exemption Act, 
1987 and other acts on behalf of the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed an honour to be standing before the House today 
giving my maiden speech.  Before I express my opinion on Bill 
C-14, please allow me a moment to say a few words about my riding 
of Skeena, my constituents and the people who have helped to get 
me elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say thanks to my wife Ann, who is in the gallery today to 
support me.  Without her love and understanding I would not be 
here today.  I want to thank our children, Bart, Joann, Lynne, 
Joy and Gail and their families also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My sincere thanks go out to the residents of Skeena in 
northwestern British Columbia, the beautiful and vast area 
encompassing almost 250,000 square kilometres stretching from 
Bella Bella to Atlin, the Queen Charlotte Islands to Telkwa, 
bordered by Alaska and the Yukon in the northern half.  Skeena is 
also the largest riding in British Columbia and one of the 
largest in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am indeed proud and honoured that the constituents of Skeena 
chose me to be their representative in parliament.  I pledge to 
do my very best to represent them and their interests in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Bill C-14, the government's summary of the bill 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment overhauls and replaces the Canada Shipping Act, 
other than the portions that concern liability, with modernized 
legislation that will promote the safety and economic performance 
of the commercial marine industry as well as ensure the safety of 
those who use pleasure craft.  Key changes to the existing 
legislation include improvements to provisions to protect and 
support efficient crews, ensure passenger and vessel safety and 
protect the environment.  A new administrative penalties scheme 
provides an alternative means for dealing with certain 
contraventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment clarifies the marine responsibilities between the 
Department of Transport and the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment organizes the contents, updates the terminology 
and streamlines substantive requirements to make the law much 
clearer and easier to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment amends the Shipping Conferences Exemption Act, 
1987 to inject greater competition within shipping conferences, 
to streamline the administration of the Act and to ensure that 
Canadian legislation covering international liner shipping 
conferences remains in harmony with that of Canada's major 
trading partners. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if it would be possible for the government to be any 
more vague when contemplating the title of such an important 
piece of legislation.  Who thought of the title, an act 
respecting shipping and navigation and to amend the Shipping 
Conferences Exemption Act, 1987 and other acts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-14 is significant in that it represents a complete 
overhaul of the updating of Bill C-35, which was first introduced 
in the 36th parliament and died on the order paper when the 
election was called.  Bill C-35 was rightly entitled the Canada 
Shipping Act, a bill that has served as a cornerstone for 
shipping activity in Canadian waters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Shipping Act has been in dire need of review for many 
years.  I commend the government for undertaking such a 
monumental task.  Bill C-14 contains some 334 articles and is 
just under 200 pages in length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I imagine the introduction of this bill must have been a 
gratifying moment for its authors.  I can appreciate their 
enthusiasm for getting the bill through the House and to 
committee, with the hope of finally seeing the bill passed into 
law.  This is evident in that the bill was only introduced on 
March 1, one day prior to the House rising for the break week and 
here we are our first day back and Bill C-14 is already at second 
reading.  Enthusiasm I can appreciate.  Attempting to railroad 
the parliamentary process I do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speed with which the government has moved from first to 
second reading suggests to me one of two things.  Either the 
government does not have complete faith in the legislation that 
it has introduced and is concerned about it getting a proper 
review, or the government is so devoid of new legislation that 
this is the only activity on the horizon so it had better run 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize the government opposite has become so used to rushing 
bills through the House that it has become second nature to it, 
but I fail to see the national crisis that will be averted by the 
lightning speed passage of this particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a maritime nation, I am confident that there are numerous 
stakeholders that have been waiting patiently for the 
introduction and passage of this bill.  I say that they have been 
waiting patiently because they already know what the bill 
contains as a result of an uncharacteristic move by the 
Department of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the bill's complex nature and the apparent 
inability of Transport Canada officials to adequately prepare new 
legislation, the bill was released in draft form to a limited 
group of stakeholders for review and input, and before the final 
version was prepared for introduction in the House.  I support 
and appreciate the need for public consultation when it comes to 
revising and updating our nation's legislation but, as a member 
of parliament, I take exception when the government deliberately 
circumvents the parliamentary process by handing out copies of 
the bill prior to members of parliament even being made aware of 
its existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that this has set an extremely dangerous 
precedent.  The continued disregard for parliamentary procedure 
and attempts to reduce the power of the elected members of the 
House should not be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In yet another fine display of parliamentary disregard, the 
government has chosen to incorporate changes to the Shipping 
Conferences Exemption Act, 1987 or SCEA into a bill that when 
introduced last session only dealt with shipping regulations.  By 
only the broadest stretch of the imagination do these two bills 
have anything in common.  It is very convenient for the 
government however to attach such a contentious amendment to the 
SCEA bill to Bill C-14, since Bill C-14 is a bill that shipping 
interests have been calling for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SCEA is contentious in that it allows ocean shipping lines to 
collude and form cartels that determine the scheduling and 
pricing for freight movements into and out of Canadian ports.  By 
its provisions, the shipping lines are exempt from the provisions 
of the Competition Act, a move that was originally intended to 
ensure that Canada was well serviced by the shipping lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some groups have come forward and questioned the necessity for 
the continuation of SCEA.  I am confident we will be hearing from 
those groups as the debate on the bill progresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the concerns I have raised regarding the manner in which 
the bill has been introduced, we will be supporting the referral 
of the bill to committee where I am confident it will undergo a 
very detailed paragraph by paragraph review to ensure that the 
members of the House are satisfied with its contents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to shipping, I would like to make some comments 
relating to my riding of Skeena. Skeena has a long history of 
shipping, principally the ports of Prince Rupert, Kitimat and 
Stewart.  However, I will begin by painting a picture of my 
riding for the benefit of those members who have not had the 
pleasure to visit this vast and beautiful area of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Skeena is a wonderful area in which to live, rich 
with fish and wildlife, rich in potential for new mineral 
resource extraction and new opportunity in value added forestry 
operations and oil and gas development.  One of the best kept 
Canadian trade secrets is a transportation corridor through 
northwestern B.C. en route to Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and 
the eastern U.S.A.  This port-road-rail link, which is underused 
and is frankly not well known, has the potential to provide 
tremendous opportunity to large areas of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The potential is there for shipping much more grain and coal 
through the Ridley Island terminals of Prince Rupert, as these 
facilities are vastly underutilized, as is the bulk loading 
facility at the port of Stewart, Canada's most northerly ice free 
port.  Kitimat also has major dock and shipping facilities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation is critical to the social and economic fabric of 
the country, whether it be a seaport, an airport, a rail line or 
a highway.  Transportation infrastructure is an economic engine 
that not only sustains growth but actually generates economic 
prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Skeena is also home to many aboriginal communities 
which face intense challenge, as do most other small resource 
based communities such as Stewart, my home for many years. 
Although Skeena riding offers a great lifestyle, the economy of 
today is creating hardship for families.  For many it is a 
difficult place in which to earn a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results from the recent election show very clearly that the 
west and the north feel alienated and are not satisfied with the 
treatment being received.  Tough love does not cut it.  We must 
be recognized as a contributor to Canada's growth and economy, 
which we truly are and can be in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An issue of major concern to all northerners, and I suspect most 
non-urban dwellers right across Canada, is the badly flawed Bill 
C-68.  Hunting is a way of life for most of rural Canada's 
population.  Putting people who have been around firearms all 
their lives, responsible people, in the position of being 
criminals is neither acceptable nor right.  Changes to this 
legislation are needed if Canadians are to respect and abide by 
this law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Skeena, in northwestern British Columbia, is 
currently in the throes of a horrendous economic downturn due in 
part to circumstances beyond anyone's control.  However, the 
recognition of the difficulties and possible steps toward some 
solution is a federal government necessity and responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's world market economy, recognition of the impact of 
pulp and paper prices, lumber prices, gas, oil and metal prices 
on resource based economies is essential.  There are 
opportunities that must be recognized by government and the 
federal government should not ignore them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, in co-operation with the province of B.C., the 
current moratorium on offshore oil and gas exploration in B.C. 
must be lifted.  The potential oil reserves of that area alone 
are 10 times Hibernia, at 9.8 billion barrels.  Gas reserves 
could exceed 25.9 trillion cubic feet.  There is added potential 
in both the Bowser and the Nechako basins.  These options must be 
pursued and the moratorium on exploration status quo position 
taken by the government is not acceptable.  Development on the 
east coast was acceptable, why not on the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Steps must be taken to revive the mining industry in B.C.  The 
temporary exploration investment tax credit in October's teeny 
budget provides some incentive for B.C. mining interests to 
invest in the ailing mineral exploration sector.  However 
aboriginal land claims and permitting processes such as the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans concerns have huge ramifications for the mining 
industry.  The government has a role in dealing with such issues. 
Cutting red tape and turn around time lines for permit approval 
would assist greatly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The uncertainty of security of mineral tenure because of the 
land claims issue creates a major detriment to investment in the 
mining industry.  Investor perceptions are that elected 
governments, both federal and provincial, have lost control over 
allocation and management of resources.  The implied concept of 
aboriginal veto power over development must be rejected.  Let us 
keep mining in Canada, not chase it away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The March 31, 2001 expiry of the Canada-United States softwood 
lumber agreement requires a strong position from the government. 
The recent formation of the Canadian Lumber Trade Alliance is a 
significant move in dealing with a united approach to Canada's 
position on free trade in softwood lumber with the U.S.A. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>B.C. accounts for over 50% of Canada's softwood lumber exports 
to the U.S. to a value of over $5 billion annually.  Some of the 
producers in my area had no U.S. quota due to Asia being their 
principal market.  That Asian market has collapsed, creating 
layoffs and shutdowns.  In the current agreement, access to a 
U.S. market is based on historic shipping levels: no history, no 
quota. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be recognized that policy changes are necessary to reach 
free trade in softwood lumber between the U.S. and Canada.  I ask 
that the government work with the Canadian Lumber Trade Alliance 
to achieve that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, on the north coast of B.C., the federal Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans weak stock management strategies of upper 
Skeena coho, which represent only one-quarter of 1% of the total 
Skeena River fishery, shut down a $30 million sockeye fishery, a 
tremendous blow to the economy of Prince Rupert and area.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO and the minister must be more cognizant of local situations 
and of the difficulties being caused by allowing the Alaska coho 
catch to affect access to Skeena River sockeye runs.  An 
agreement needs to be reached on a mutually acceptable reduction 
of interceptions, that is, a reduction of Canadian interception 
of Pacific northwest salmon stocks in return for reduced 
interception of Canadian stocks in Alaska.  Life is not easy on 
the north coast these days and a more realistic implementation of 
the Pacific Salmon Treaty would allow our people the opportunity 
to earn a decent living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Areas of western Canada have been sadly ignored by the 
government, especially the northwest.  Airports in Smithers, 
Terrace and Prince Rupert are concerned over the proposed 
reintroduction of an increased level of emergency response 
services, whereas levels were reduced only a few years ago.  This 
highlights the concern that the federal government did not 
bargain in good faith when downloading airports.  Safety is 
paramount, but a realistic approach to the operation of these 
smaller, low traffic operations is needed to keep them 
economically viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The airport at Terrace has been for some time attempting to have 
an instrument landing system installed.  Such a system would 
allow 75% of the flights missed due to bad weather conditions to 
actually be completed.  The failure numbers exceed over 200 on an 
annual basis, at huge cost to the carrier and excessive 
inconvenience to the travelling public.  For example, on my last 
trip home, last week, after the long journey from Ottawa the 
flight I was on from Vancouver to Terrace could not land.  After 
actually seeing the runway at Terrace we flew the 500 miles back 
to Vancouver to stay overnight.  Thankfully I was able to get 
home the next morning but, as I explained, I actually had to fly 
1,500 miles to make a 500 mile flight.  It was very frustrating 
for me and for the many other passengers and business people 
trying to make their way to northwestern B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another topic, the number of business closures in 
northwestern B.C. is another indicator of just how troubled the 
economy is.  Over 50 businesses have closed in the city of Prince 
Rupert in the last few years.  Regional rental vacancy rates 
range from 20% to 75%. The cost to our employment insurance and 
other social benefits is staggering, and a serious review of 
programs and policies is badly needed in order to determine a 
better way to meet the economic development needs and potential 
of our northern communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having spent most of my life in the north, I am fully aware of 
the boom and bust cycles that have been so prevalent.  Lately we 
have seen much more of the latter, creating devastation in the 
communities of the north.  Recognition of the west, and 
especially the northwest, must be a priority for parliament.  We 
want to be a part of Canada and recognized and rewarded as such, 
not through handouts but through good sound decisions based on 
common sense and sound economic principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wealth of Canada has traditionally been generated in the 
north.  Government imposed restraints to developing opportunities 
and creating economic well-being must end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I will get back to the legislation at hand, Bill 
C-14, an act respecting shipping and navigation and to amend the 
Shipping Conferences Exemption Act, 1987, and other acts.  I will 
quickly summarize my comments on the bill.  I recognize that the 
Canada Shipping Act was in desperate need of updating and that 
stakeholders as well as industry have been calling for such 
amendments.  However, I do not see the need to rush the 
legislation through parliament.  It is a large and detailed piece 
of legislation needing much review and analysis, both in 
committee and in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would expect that government backbench members would also want 
sufficient time to review the bill's contents and consult 
industry for its opinions.  One sitting day between first and 
second readings is absolutely insufficient time for review and 
analysis of such an intricate piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, I lodge this complaint and send the following 
message to the government:  when it rushes legislation through 
the House, as it has begun to do with Bill C-14, it sends the 
wrong message to Canadians and to industry, a message of 
arrogance and complete disregard for democratic parliamentary 
procedure.  It also makes one wonder what the government has to 
hide and, frankly, what is wrong with the legislation that the 
government needs to rush it through without proper analysis and 
debate.  As well, to tack on amendments to the Shipping 
Conferences Exemption Act in this bill is completely 
irresponsible, since the government well knows its amendments 
spark much debate and controversy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition looks forward to reviewing every detail 
of this bill in committee.  The government can certainly count on 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I am pleased to 
comment on Bill C-14, the Canada Shipping Act, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill modernizes the legislation that will improve the 
safety and economic performance of the commercial marine 
industry as well as ensure the safety of those who use pleasure 
craft.  Key changes to the existing legislation include 
improvements to provisions to protect and support efficient 
crews, ensure passenger and vessel safety and protect the 
environment.  A new administrative penalties scheme provides an 
alternative means for dealing with certain contraventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment clarifies the marine responsibilities of the 
Department of Transport and the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans.  The enactment organizes the contents, updates the 
terminology and streamlines substantive requirements to make the 
law much clearer and easier to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment amends the Shipping Conferences Act, 1987 to 
inject greater competition within shipping conferences, to 
streamline the administration of the act and to ensure that 
Canadian legislation covering international liner shipping 
conferences remains in harmony with that of Canada's major 
trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 14 parts to this bill.  The first defines certain 
terms and provides details on its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 2 includes provisions with respect to the registration, 
listing and recording of vessels.  This part comes under the 
responsibility of the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 3 includes provisions with respect to the qualifications 
and conditions of employment of crew members.  This part also 
comes under the responsibility of the Department of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 4 includes provisions with respect to the safety of 
passengers and crew members.  This part also comes under the 
responsibility of the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 5 includes provisions with respect to navigation services, 
the creation of VTS zones and the obligations of vessels in 
search and rescue operations.  This part comes under the 
responsibility of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 6 deals with incidents, accidents and casualties.  It 
determines the right to claim for salvage services, the 
obligations of vessels in case of collisions and the authority 
to inquire into causes of death.  This part comes under the 
responsibility of the Department of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 7 has to do with wrecks, specifically their ownership and 
disposition.  This part comes under the responsibility of the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 8 determines the responsibilities of the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans with respect to pollution and establishes 
rules for prevention and intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 9 determines the responsibilities of the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans with respect to pollution prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 10, which has to do with pleasure craft, comes under the 
responsibility of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 11 concerns the application of the act and the 
various powers given the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 12 includes a variety of provisions, including 
provisions on proceedings initiated under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parts 13 and 14 contain transitional 
provisions and amendments in co-ordination with other laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that to say the this bill, which died on the order paper 
at the last session, remains, in our opinion, a fine example of 
the pointlessness of the latest federal elections.  Good bills 
were being studied, of course.  This bill on shipping was one, 
as was Bill S-2 on maritime liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have obviously understood that the government is 
reintroducing, with great show, a bill that gathered dust on the 
shelves of the last parliament and died on the order paper 
because the federal government decided to call an election that 
was too early, according to some, and unnecessary, according to 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the government is not waving the flags over these 
bills that are bursting out in great pomp at the start of this 
parliament.  The work was already done.  I know that my Bloc 
Quebecois colleagues worked on the bill, which appears as C-14, 
identical to what was introduced in the last parliament and 
debated then.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also point out the Minister of Transport said in a press 
release on March 1, when this bill was introduced, that its 
intent was to promote growth in the shipping industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the Bloc Quebecois mentioned on a number of occasions 
and reiterated its position that the only way to achieve this 
objective of promoting economic growth in the shipping industry 
was to establish a real federal shipbuilding policy and to act 
in support of the shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in this bill, which is a carbon copy of the 
legislation introduced in the last parliament, to support the 
shipbuilding industry. We, the members of the Bloc Quebecois, 
have made numerous representations to indicate that the industry 
is experiencing serious difficulties all across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipbuilding used to be a thriving industry. Today, it is only 
operating at 25% of its capacity. This means that millions of 
dollars are not being invested in the regions, and that has 
significant impact, particularly where there is a shipyard, such 
as in Lévis, on Île-aux-Coudres and in Les Méchins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipbuilding has become a high tech sector that creates 
thousands of well paid jobs. However, the number of these jobs 
keeps decreasing. There are currently 2,750 people working in 
the sector, compared to over 12,000 at one time. 
Canada's shipbuilding industry urgently requires new support 
measures. Canada must be able to face international competition 
and better position itself in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The frequent media reports on the problems at the Lévis shipyard 
may give the impression that this shipyard is the only one 
experiencing difficulties. We can see, both in Vancouver and 
in Halifax, the lack of federal involvement. The Lévis shipyard 
is but one example of the federal government's laissez-faire 
approach in the industry. The fact that all Canadian shipyards 
are experiencing problems and are already operating below 
capacity confirms the need for a true federal shipbuilding 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the elements that are to the advantage of Canada's 
shipbuilding industry and that justify federal assistance to 
that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Canada's manpower is qualified and less costly than that 
of most competing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the majority of Canadian shipyards use very modern 
equipment and advanced technology: two of them meet the ISO-9001 
standard, while four meet the ISO-9002 standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, shipyard managers and other stakeholders in the industry 
have felt for at least ten years that the federal government has 
abandoned them and they claim that they are penalized compared 
to other sectors, including the aerospace industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, with direct access to three oceans and to the world's 
longest inland waterway, shipbuilders and shipowners wonder why 
Canada chose to let the industry down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, marine transportation is the most economical and 
environmentally friendly means of transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, a number of shipyards are surviving at the present time 
because of provincial government intervention, although this is 
an area of federal jurisdiction.  Quebec has tax measures, 
including a tax credit; Nova Scotia has a specific program of 
financial guarantees; and British Columbia has encouraged the 
acceleration of its aluminum ferry program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, Canada's shipbuilding industry is at a disadvantage 
compared to its Asian competitors who receive government 
subsidies of up to 30% of the amount of their contracts, the 
Europeans who receive about 9%, and the Americans who benefit 
from protectionist measures.   Yet Canada has neither subsidies 
nor protectionist measures; we have missed the boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 14, 1999, the hon. member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière introduced a private member's bill, 
Bill C-213, on shipbuilding.  His bill provided a clear 
illustration of the framework required to assist the 
shipbuilding industry, as indeed it must be assisted.  It drew 
upon the consensual demands from the various stakeholders in the 
industry, from the unions to the Shipbuilding Association of 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Believe it or not, the Liberal government succeeded in declaring 
Bill C-213 non-votable.  This bill, intended as it was to promote 
shipbuilding in Canada and to enhance the competitive capacity 
of Canadian shipyards, was deferred and struck from the order 
paper by the government of the Liberal party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I would like to list the advantages that were offered by 
Bill C-213 and continue to be concerns for the industry and the 
major stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Bill C-213 called for a loan and loan guarantee program, 
something for which the Bloc Quebecois is still calling. 
Canada's shipbuilding industry everywhere ought to be able to 
benefit from loan guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, the bill called for the establishment of a 
program whereby a maximum of 87.5% of the money borrowed by a 
company from financial institutions to purchase a commercial 
ship that would be built in a shipyard located in Canada would 
be guaranteed by the federal government in the event of default 
in the repayment of the loan, bear a rate of interest comparable 
to that available for loans from financial institutions to large 
and financially strong corporations, and be repayable on terms 
comparable to those usually granted by financial institutions to 
large and financially strong corporations for the repayment of 
their loan.  Therefore, nothing beyond what other major 
industries in Canada could claim was asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Bill C-213 sought to have new vessels excluded from the 
lend-lease regulations. 
Revenue Canada's lend-lease regulations eliminate lend-lease 
purchase of ships in Canada.  Revenue Canada significantly 
reduces the amounts that may be deducted annually from taxable 
revenue as depreciation in the case of lend-lease financing. 
Under the terms of lend-lease, only the notional principal of the 
loan may enter into the calculation of the depreciation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As interest primarily is repaid in the first years of the lease, 
the depreciation permitted is minimal.  It is therefore carried 
over from the first years to the final years of the useful life 
of the ship, something that runs contrary to the economic 
realities of the owner operator, whose major expenses come 
primarily in the first years, with things improving in the final 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By increasing from the outset the tax burden of shipowners who 
use the lend-lease option, Revenue Canada's lend-lease regulations 
make it rather unappealing if not squarely uneconomic to use a 
lend-lease option to buy and finance a ship built in Canada. More 
specifically, the bill proposed to amend the provisions of the 
Income Tax Act and of its regulations to make tax provisions on 
lend-lease more beneficial when buying a ship built by a shipyard 
located in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third major component of Bill C-213 was the creation of a 
refundable tax credit as asked, again, by stakeholders and the 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the government of Quebec announced tax incentives to 
stimulate the shipping industry. These incentives are based on a 
tax credit that the federal government should use as a model. 
The Quebec government raised the refundable tax credit for 
shipbuilding, around since 1996, from 40% to 50%. It also 
introduced a tax credit for the conversion or major refitting of 
ships, and it extended this measure to oil rigs, in addition to 
making some adjustments to the measure to reduce capital taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec tax policy is essentially based on a tax credit. 
Eligible expenses include primarily salaries relating to the 
building of a ship, drawings and specifications, and also half 
of the costs of contracts relating to construction. This tax 
credit amounts to 50% of eligible expenses, but it cannot exceed 
by more than 20% the costs at the end of a taxation year that 
have been incurred to build the ship. 
A tax credit for similar eligible expenses is also provided for 
the conversion or major refitting of ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government refuses to harmonize federal tax measures 
with those of Quebec, as it agreed to do, among others, for the 
motion picture and television production industry. By taxing 
provincial tax benefits granted to the shipbuilding industry, 
Ottawa eliminates the positive effect of the deductions granted 
by Quebec to stimulate the industry. Not only does Ottawa not 
bother to come up with more beneficial measures, it also 
adversely affects the policy put forward by the Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People often say “If you are not able to help, quit always 
making matters worse”.  That is what the federal government is 
doing right now:  it is not helping the industry and it is 
making matters worse for this industry where Quebec's tax credit 
is concerned.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-213 specifically suggested amending the provisions of the 
Income Tax Act and the Income Tax Regulations in order to allow 
owners of vessels and shipyards a refundable tax credit for a 
portion of the costs relating to the construction or refit of a 
commercial ship in a shipyard located in Canada or the 
conversion of a ship in such a shipyard.  Under Bill C-213, 
these people could have obtained tax credits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I repeat, the Liberal government decided to reject 
this bill.  It will not debate it and there will not be a vote. 
This wonderful initiative by the brilliant Bloc Quebecois member 
for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière has therefore been put off 
indefinitely.  It will not be used by the government.  Once 
again, the Government of Canada is passing up a wonderful 
opportunity to breathe new life into the shipbuilding industry, 
which was the pride of Canada and which is now operating at only 
25% of its capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Bloc Quebecois agrees with the reference of Bill 
C-14 to committee for discussion, we regret that the government 
did not take the opportunity to re-examine this text which had 
already been considered in the last parliament and which 
involved no work on the government's part.  It could at least 
have used the opportunity to add a complete chapter on 
assistance for shipbuilding, which would have eased the plight 
of this industry in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me a great deal of pleasure to say a few words today about 
Bill C-14, the Canada Shipping Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's press release when he introduced the bill stated 
that the bill would update, modernize and streamline Canada's 
marine law, and that it would clarify the roles of the Department 
of Transport and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister indicated that the bill would allow the entire 
marine community to operate in a manner that is safer, more 
efficient, environmentally sound and responsive to the needs of 
Canadians in a global community and in a global economy.  Those 
are aims that we in this party can support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Shipping Act also promotes the safety and economic 
performance of the marine industry and ensures the safety of 
those who use pleasure craft.  Key changes include improvements 
to provisions that protect and support crews, ensure passenger 
and vessel safety, and protect the marine environment from damage 
due to navigation and shipping activities.  We support all those 
aims and objectives as well.  We hope the bill will be able to 
fulfil what it maintains it will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims it has consulted widely with all the 
stakeholders in the development of the Canada Shipping Act. 
Generally speaking that is very good since often we see 
legislation come before the House and pass without consultation 
with the people most directly affected by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill amends the Shipping Conferences Exemption Act, 1987. 
Shipping conferences, as we are all aware, are composed of groups 
of shipping lines operating collectively under an agreement to 
provide scheduled service on specific trade routes based on 
agreed rates and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conferences play an important role in Canada's foreign trade by 
providing stability and reliability in shipping services for 
Canadian shippers, importers and exporters.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments to the Shipping Conferences Exemption 
Act, 1987 are designed to encourage greater competition and 
generally streamline the administration of the act.  The 
amendments are to be supported because they bring the legislation 
more in line with that of our major shipping partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier, the Canada Shipping Act clarifies the roles 
of Transport Canada and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
That is very important and should not be lost on the maritime 
community.  From now on the Department of Transport will be 
responsible for all commercial vessels regardless of size. 
Previously, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans handled 
matters with regard to small commercial vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Transport will now create an automated small 
vessel registry tailored to the needs of small commercial 
vessels, that is vessels under 12 metres in length which will not 
require a tonnage measurement certificate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will be a change for many fishermen in Newfoundland and 
Labrador because many of our commercial fishing vessels are under 
35 feet in length.  While most people consider vessels of that 
size to be inshore fishing vessels, the reality in Newfoundland 
waters is that many of these vessels fish, especially for crab, 
in waters that are more than 100 miles offshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current rules of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans will 
not allow fishermen with certain types of fishing licences to 
lengthen or build larger boats.  Given the fierce competition for 
very limited fish and crab resources, that has meant that many 
small inshore vessels operate in waters far offshore at 
considerable risk to life and limb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be curious to know if the transport department is aware 
of these facts and if it intends to make any changes.  I realize 
that vessel size restrictions have to do with the control of 
fishing licences and the conservation of fish stocks, but reality 
has outstripped theory in that area.  Simply put, we have too 
many vessels under 35 feet in length fishing in waters too far 
offshore.  I would contend that safety, in addition to fisheries 
conservation, must be a major consideration here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also hope the new vessel registry will not become a 
bureaucratic nightmare for fishermen and small tour boat 
operators who must comply with the requirements of the act.  We 
are all too familiar with the long gun registry system which was 
supposed to be simple and efficient in its operation.  We all 
know what can occur on the journey between theory and reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-14 introduces new enforcement tools of an administrative 
nature, monetary penalties and assurances of compliance with 
Transport Canada retaining the right to prosecute if necessary. 
The theory is that enforcement practice will eliminate the need 
to go to court in all but the most critical of cases.  Central to 
the enforcement approach will be the appointment of an 
adjudicator who will have the power to review administrative 
decisions by the minister that impose penalties or affect the 
status of documents issued by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case I hope the appointment of an adjudicator will not 
be done in any sort of partisan way.  It is essential that people 
holding these offices be seen as experts in the field.  To date, 
the record of the government in making appointments has been very 
partisan.  I hope that will not be the case here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-14, the department of fisheries, through the 
Canadian Coast Guard, will continue its responsibility for marine 
communication and tracking services, marine navigational aids, 
search and rescue, shipwreck, and pollution prevention and 
response.  DFO will derive powers from the act to protect 
shipwrecks of historical significance in Canadian waters.  The 
department of fisheries will also maintain its current 
responsibility for all aspects of pleasure craft, including 
construction standards, safety equipment, licensing and the 
discharge of sewage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume that the splitting of jurisdictions between the 
transport department and DFO meets with the approval of all 
stakeholders involved.  If not, I am sure I will be informed by 
the fishermen's union and other representatives of the 
Newfoundland fishing industry.  If they have major concerns there 
will be further opportunity in committee to seek clarification or 
amendments to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line on Bill C-14 is that it is to modernize Canada's 
shipping legislation and make its shipping conference legislation 
more compatible with that of our major trading partners.  I have 
no problem with that and I generally support the thrust of the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier when I referenced Transport Canada's new small vessel 
registry, I pointed out my concern about the size and safety of 
Newfoundland's small fishing vessels which operate long distances 
offshore.  I have another couple of concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the Canadian Coast Guard will have 
jurisdiction over marine traffic and pollution.  To help with 
that, the armed forces maritime patrol aircraft have been used 
extensively to patrol waters inside our 200 mile limit.  The 
recent news from the defence department that the number of 
flights will be reduced was not well received in Atlantic Canada. 
I would ask the parliamentary assistant to take that concern to 
the Minister of Transport.  Having jurisdiction over pollution is 
one thing; being informed of high seas polluters in a timely 
manner is another.  There are rules in the bill about the 
discharge of waste at sea, but all the rules in the world will 
not help if we lose the ability to keep track of polluters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's recent cutting back of the number of 
Aurora aircraft doing patrolled surveillance, especially around 
the Atlantic Canada area, did nothing to help what the Minister 
of Transport is trying to do in the bill.  As I said earlier, we 
can have all the fancy rules and regulations we want contained in 
a bill, but if we do not have enforcement backup and enforcement 
potential then everything we say in a bill like this is all for 
naught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to keep track of these high seas polluters.  Every year 
thousands if not tens of thousands of seabirds wash ashore. 
Invariably they are covered in oil.  However, most of the 
casualties among our fish and waterfowl populations do not come 
from the dramatic breakup of an oil tanker at sea, although we 
see that reported a lot in the news.  An oil tanker breaks up at 
sea and then for days and days the media will cover how 
waterfowl, seals and birds of all kinds are being washed ashore 
covered in oil.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, most of the casualties among our fish and waterfowl do 
not occur because oil tankers happen to break up at sea.  Most of 
the damage is done quietly at sea by these unscrupulous sea 
captains, these bandits, these pirates, flushing their bilges at 
sea in contravention of the act.  We need more surveillance 
flights around the Grand Banks area, not less.  The Grand Banks 
happens to be the most environmentally sensitive area in the 
world for fish spawning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, here we have the federal government coming in with a 
bill that talks about polluters and pollution at sea when two 
weeks ago we had an announcement by the minister of defence in 
which he said the government was cutting back on patrols in these 
very areas, that it was cutting back on Aurora aircraft.  What 
kind of scam and sham is that?  We can have all kinds of fancy 
bills coming into the House, but if we have one department 
working against the other department they serve no purpose 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These unscrupulous sea captains have to be caught and dealt with 
in regard to all the damage they have done.  They have to be 
brought into the courts and fines have to be doubled and tripled. 
The penalties have to be doubled and tripled for people who do 
that kind of thing.  We are needing more surveillance, not less, 
as the minister of defence is cutting back on the number of 
aircraft patrolling the waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Shipping Act can contain all the best intentions in 
the world and can promote modern enforcement methods, but if we 
cannot in a timely manner catch these people in the act, it has 
no effect at all.  After all, these people are out there in 
ships, not rockets.  We should be able to catch a big oil tanker 
that is plying the waters around the Grand Banks in Newfoundland 
and blowing its bilges at sea.  We should be able to catch these 
people in a timely manner by using aircraft, but how can we do it 
when the minister of defence has cut back on the number of 
patrols? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said a moment ago, we can have all kinds of well meaning 
legislation but if it is ineffective then there is not much point 
in bringing it in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have is that although we are busy updating and 
modernizing our shipping legislation, most of the ships doing the 
shipping are built elsewhere in the world.  After World War II, I 
believe Canada had the third largest navy in the world after the 
United States and Great Britain.  During those years we were 
heavily involved in supplying Britain and Europe with war 
supplies by sea.  We had a lot of ships and we built a lot of 
ships, but not any more.  Canada's shipbuilding policy is 
virtually non-existent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saddened that as a trading nation we are not maximizing our 
shipbuilding potential.  That is too bad because we have a lot of 
potential in the country with which to develop a great 
shipbuilding nation.  The current Minister of Industry has 
undertaken to do a review of this.  I sincerely hope he comes up 
with something practical, something quick, and something soon as 
many of our shipyards are pretty well on their last legs. 
It is a disgrace that a trading nation like Canada, with all of 
its ports and its endless coastlines, does not have a modern, 
competitive shipbuilding industry.

I have raised, especially as they pertain to the enforcement of 
the act, to polluters at sea and to the unscrupulous seagoing 
captains who blow their bilges at sea.  I sincerely hope that the 
Minister of Transport, with the Minister of National Defence, can 
develop some kind of enforcement policy to make sure that these 
people are held accountable for the deeds they become involved 
in.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was very impressed with the detailed knowledge the 
hon. member demonstrated in his remarks with respect to the bill 
before the House, Bill C-14.  The demonstration of his knowledge 
of the shipping industry, shipbuilding and marine life on the 
east coast was beneficial for all of us, particularly his advice 
for the Minister of Transport.  I congratulate him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him about a particular part of the bill 
which apparently now includes an amendment that was not there 
when the bill was presented sometime last year, I believe.  I am 
referring to the Shipping Conferences Exemption Act.  I notice 
that this particular addition to the bill is really an add-on. It 
looks almost as if it is sort of tacked on, as if somebody had a 
bright idea and thought that maybe the government had better put 
this in there because it wanted to get this thing done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him if he could address some remarks to that 
particular part of the bill, which really suggests that some of 
the amendments do not in fact meet the concerns and wishes of the 
stakeholders involved in the shipping industry.  In fact, some of 
them are suggesting that many of those controls now being 
suggested in that particular part of the bill should in fact be 
reviewed so that they could have greater freedom to enter into 
contracts directly with shipping companies and also with 
shipping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member refer to that part of the bill and give us 
some advice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question and sincerely wish I could give him some advice 
in that area.  I myself have been waiting to get the bill before 
committee in order to delve into a number of these areas.  A 
number of people in the shipbuilding industry have contacted me 
recently with respect to some of these exemptions the hon. member 
is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipping conferences, as we are all aware, are composed of 
groups of shipping lines which operate collectively under an 
agreement to provide scheduled services on these trade routes 
based on agreed rates.  I understand that some of the people 
involved in the shipping industry are very concerned about that 
and want to talk about it.  I would have been a little more 
detailed in my remarks in that area if I knew anything more that 
I could impart to the hon. gentleman.  However, I do not and I am 
waiting to get before committee myself to have a go at this with 
the minister and to satisfy the concerns of the people who have 
contacted me in regard to this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to get the hon. member to expand a little 
on one of the things he alluded to, which was the environment and 
how this bill would help protect our marine environment.  This 
bill was designed to come into line with what the Americans are 
doing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member comment on whether he thinks it brings us up to 
par or is better than what they are doing and indeed deals with 
the issue of protecting our marine environment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been reading over 
the bill and I think the minister has good intentions in trying 
to protect the environment.  I sincerely hope the parliamentary 
secretary will bring the minister up to speed on some of the 
things I have said here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can have all the good intentions we want with respect to the 
bill, but if we do not have the enforcement capability to protect 
the environment in the way it should be protected the bill is 
simply of no use whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the hon. member has given me the opportunity to hammer 
home the point.  Prior to the minister introducing the bill in 
the House of Commons, the Minister of National Defence, only a 
few weeks ago, cut back on Aurora aircraft surveillance in 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many instances where ocean going tankers are blowing 
their bilges at sea.  We do not have the ability to catch them in 
the act.  Therefore it is very difficult to convict them in a 
court of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have that ability.  It should be a fairly easy thing 
for us to do.  I know we have hundreds of thousands of miles of 
coastline.  If we cut back on our ability to catch polluters that 
are blowing their bilges at sea and are causing all kinds of 
difficulties for seabirds and water fowl of every kind, we would 
essentially have an act that does not have the necessary teeth to 
enforce these laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope the Minister of Transport and the Minister of 
National Defence will be able to come together and get some kind 
of co-operation going between the two departments to allow us to 
catch these people.  What is a good act if it cannot be enforced? 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was very impressed with the detail 
and passion with which the hon. member spoke.  Coming from 
Atlantic Canada, he is very concerned about marine environment, 
and rightly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member continually referred to the Grand Banks.  Could he 
tell us if he feels this is a concern of equal weight in all 
parts of the country?  He mentioned the overblowing of problems 
with the breakup of oil tankers at sea as compared to other 
problems he outlined in some detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the west coast we have shipping lines that take tankers 
fairly close to our shore.  I am not sure they have the same 
problem on the east coast.  Does he think the bill gives equal 
consideration to both shores?  Should there be some differential 
to deal with differing problems on the east coast versus the west 
coast? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the member makes a 
very good point.  Canadians from all parts of the country are 
very concerned when it comes to pollution and to protecting our 
environment.  There is no less concern in the west than there 
would be in the east for this kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the Grand Banks in particular because it is a world 
fishing resource.  That area off the coast of Newfoundland has 
some of the most sensitive spawning areas in the world. 
Tankers are passing that way almost on a daily basis and are 
doing damage.  They have very little concern for the environment 
when they blow their bilges at sea, to which I have referred on a 
couple of occasions in debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity 
to speak to Bill C-14, the Canada Shipping Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to have been able to put some questions to 
the hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois who spoke earlier on the 
bill.  I thank him for restoring my faith a little in the Bloc 
Quebecois after that diatribe from his colleague this morning on 
Bill C-233.  I was shocked and I thought surely those members do 
not do this on everything.  I felt that perhaps they were 
slipping away.  He has partially restored my faith by sticking to 
the subject and speaking with great passion and interest on 
something that has certainly a big impact on his province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is really two bills in one.  It sounds like one of 
those old Doublemint chewing gum TV commercials.  We get two for 
our money.  First, there is the Canada Shipping Act which is an 
old bill.  Like many things the government has done in the past, 
it brings forward legislation and tells us when it is introduced 
that it is so important that the House must get going.  It is so 
concerned about its legislation and feels it is so urgent to get 
it through that it has brought in closure 70 times since I have 
been in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past the government brought forward a lot of legislation 
like the Canada Shipping Act.  It has come forward with 
legislation and then diddle around with it until the clock ran 
out.  It would either prorogue the House to get rid of 
legislation it knew was bad and was embarrassed by or, as it has 
done twice since I have been here, prematurely call an election 
which also torpedoed its own bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot say I blame the government.  Some of its bills are 
pretty bad and should be torpedoed.  If I may use an analogy, it 
is interesting to use torpedo when we are talking about a 
shipping act.  I have to be careful because we have enough 
problems with our shipping act right now without starting to talk 
about things of that nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned, the bill has two parts.  One is the Canada 
Shipping Act which is regulatory in nature.  The other one is the 
Shipping Conferences Exemption Act which is primarily a financial 
consideration.  This was what the hon. member spoke to at some 
length.  Coming from Quebec he mentioned his concern about 
shipbuilding, about trying to get more ships built in Canada or 
at least in his province, and having better tax flows in Quebec 
and from the federal government toward the shipbuilding industry. 
Certainly we want to see it preserved in British Columbia.  He 
did make one particular reference to shipbuilding in British 
Columbia that I will come back to in a couple of minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Shipping Conferences Exemption Act is primarily financial in 
nature.  It is something we should look at, particularly with 
regard to Quebec and funding for shipbuilding there.  Part of the 
problem of getting funding is the collection of taxes and since 
this is the shipping act we should be looking at the shipping 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec there is a company known as Canada Steamship Lines 
which ironically is owned by our own Minister of Finance.  He is 
one of the principals in this company.  It is a very big company, 
a huge company with tremendous assets.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would imagine that taxation on those assets would provide 
tremendous revenues for the federal government.  Hopefully in its 
compassion it would provide some to Quebec and other regions to 
help with the shipbuilding industry.  Canadians should be very 
proud of our shipbuilding industry, which is slowly slipping away 
from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member stated, Quebec is putting quite a bit of 
money into this area already.  There are many demands on tax 
dollars as we all know.  Whenever Quebec does that, it is 
draining it from other areas where it perhaps would like to use 
it.  Is it not ironic that the man in charge of raising taxes, 
who has such a wonderful asset located in the province of Quebec, 
has all those ships registered in other countries so that no 
taxes are paid on them in Quebec and in Canada?  I was hoping to 
have the opportunity to ask the hon. member if he felt that was 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we start talking about the Shipping Conferences Exemption 
Act, we should examine some of the exemptions that we already 
have.  We have a Canadian based company that has all its ships 
registered in foreign ports to specifically avoid paying fair 
taxes in Canada toward the very industry that spawned those ships 
that are hidden away in foreign ports.  I would love to hear the 
hon. member's comments on that.  Perhaps under questions and 
comments he may be able to shed some light on his feelings in 
that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also mentioned British Columbia when talking 
about shipbuilding which has a great shipbuilding industry as 
well.  We are very proud of it.  Some tremendous ships have been 
built and there is the capacity to continue doing so long into 
the future.  Certainly we like to be diversified in British 
Columbia.  We have some problems out there right now, aside from 
government, in terms of employment, our industry and our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one flies over the province of British Columbia one may 
wonder if there are any towns, particularly in the interior. All 
one sees are forests.  We are a province covered in great stands 
of timber.  My region particularly has a very forestry dependent 
economy.  We have had a great deal of trouble in our province 
because of the softwood lumber quota system.  It has been 
absolutely devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we come to the end of the five year term we are now looking 
at the possibility of trade wars.  The Americans have basically 
put us on notice that they intend to put countervailing duties in 
place, tariffs, to devastate an industry upon which British 
Columbia depends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be excellent to get our shipbuilding industry and many 
other things going to diversify the economy in British 
Columbia and to soften at least some of the impact we will likely 
look at because of future problems with softwood lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding that we have gone through the World Trade 
Organization's dispute settlement mechanisms three times to deal 
with the fact that Americans are making false claims against our 
product in British Columbia, they still end up threatening to do 
it yet again.  It is very expensive for both the government and 
the industry to deal with these charges.  I would like to see the 
shipbuilding industry flourish in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member mentioned shipbuilding in British Columbia 
he made specific reference to ongoing aluminum shipbuilding, 
which is a bit of a sore point to British Columbians right now. 
The notorious aluminum shipbuilding involved the provincial 
government building three aluminum fast ferries to serve as a 
link between the mainland and Vancouver Island.  Notwithstanding 
the incredible abilities and dedication of the shipbuilding 
industry in British Columbia, they were a tremendous anomaly. 
These things were an unmitigated disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke earlier about the Shipping Conferences Exemption Act 
being financial in nature.  We will probably never know the final 
figure, but the aluminum ferries the government saw fit to build 
have blown somewhere between half a billion and a billion 
dollars.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we know where the ferries are?  They are tied up.  The 
government is trying to sell them.  The last I heard, it was 
trying to get $35 million for them.  There are a lot of people in 
British Columbia who feel so incensed about this that they came 
to me with an idea as to how we can deal with it.  They suggested 
that rather than trying to sell the ferries, even for $35 
million, we should donate them to the government of British 
Columbia because it is about to be outgoing.  As it has its final 
caucus meeting it might consider getting on board one of the 
ferries and heading west at a high rate of speed.  We will see 
how sound they are once they get out on the open ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize to the hon. member from the Conservative Party.  I 
realize it is a different type of pollution that we would be 
sending into the marine environment, but I hope he would agree 
that it might be a worthy exemption for this and perhaps we can 
let it go.  Maybe it would not be quite as bilious as an oil 
slick.  If it is we will need to boom it up, chain it up, take it 
away and hope that it never comes back again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I am concerned about is that the bill is being 
rammed through in such a hurry.  The government, as I mentioned 
earlier, has used closure so many times to rush forward bills and 
here is yet another one it is rushing forward.  As the hon. 
member from the Conservative Party said, there are so many other 
things that need to be done, both in conjunction with this and 
with other issues entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of defence, at a time when we are talking about marine 
safety and the environment and doing a better job of looking 
after our oceans and our coastlines, the government is cutting 
down on patrols by the military off our coasts to ensure there is 
enforcement of our regulations and that the coastline is properly 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a little hard to do some of the things that are necessary 
in the marine environment with some of the equipment we have 
provided to our military.  Sea King helicopters are a prime 
example.  It would be appropriate if perhaps the Liberal caucus 
one day arranged for a little tour over the ocean, in rough 
weather, ideally, so it could get a sense of what it is really 
like in a Sea King helicopter.  I think that would be good for a 
variety of reasons.  I will let your imagination decide what the 
possible advantages might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many other things that are such a priority to 
Canadians that one must wonder why the government is rushing 
forth with a bill like this.  The bill failed before because the 
government let it sit there.  It had the opportunity to bring it 
forward but obviously it was not a priority for it. It did the 
same thing with the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1997 right up until the election call the Minister of 
Justice said that the Young Offenders Act was her highest 
priority.  My God, if that is her highest priority I would hate 
to think what her low priorities are.  Somehow this bill is a 
priority for the Liberal government when there are still things 
like the Young Offenders Act to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things like the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act.  This morning we talked about a simple amendment that could 
make it much better but the government has absolutely no patience 
for a good amendment that was put forward by my colleague from 
Surrey North.  It just wants to rush forward with something like 
this, which it obviously thinks has a much higher priority than 
the basic rights of victims.  I think that is rather shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have organized crime in the country, particularly in Quebec. 
We talked about it this morning.  The hon. member from Quebec, 
who talked about the Canada Shipping Act, is, I am sure, also 
concerned about organized crime.  It is a problem in the province 
of Quebec and all across the country.  Why is the government not 
bringing forward legislation that deals with organized crime as a 
priority instead of Bill C-14?  It is sometimes very confusing as 
to what the government is really concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we start talking about the marine system, the ports 
themselves are very much affected by federal legislation dealing 
with labour.  We have had ports shut down on both our coasts.  We 
have had them in labour strikes in Quebec.  What does the 
government do about labour strikes?  It waits until the whole 
thing shuts down.  As if our poor farmers on the prairies do not 
have enough problems, if a port on either the east coast or west 
coast is closed down they are devastated.  As bad off as they are 
now, they are 100 times worse off after a port gets shut down.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done absolutely nothing to introduce 
legislation that would put into place some form of dispute 
settlement mechanism to ensure a fair settlement for workers in 
the ports and other places without having a labour disruption 
that is devastating to people all across the country.  It is 
absolutely shameful.  It is puzzling why the government is in 
such a rush with this bill when it is passing up on many other 
areas as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a transport issue put out by the Minister of 
Transport.  What about the other things in transport that need to 
be dealt with?   We are talking about regulations to make the 
marine environment a lot safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from the Conservative Party talked about 
environmental issues.  He specifically mentioned the freighters 
that flush their tanks out in the ocean and what a despicable 
thing that is.  However VIA Rail, the government owned passenger 
rail system, has no holding tanks in any of its passenger rail 
cars.  As they travel down the track, everything goes straight out 
onto the tracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a lot of complaints already from workers from 
both CN and CP who work on the rails.  They are very concerned 
about their safety because of what they must in some cases work 
in on the rails, which is quite disgusting, and the environmental 
problems that it brings forth.  Never mind the poor fishermen on 
the river underneath a train trestle as a VIA Rail passenger 
train happens to go over it.  That makes quite a statement.  It 
is almost applicable coming from the Liberal government.  I hear 
them firing up now.  It is a kind of statement on that poor 
fisherman, “You-know-what on you”.  There are so many things 
the minister could be working on instead of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada is an irony for both the east and west coast.  We 
have regulatory agencies right now telling Air Canada it cannot 
cut its fares as much as it has done to certain parts of Atlantic 
Canada because it is anti-competitive.  Ironically, at the same 
time they are telling Air Canada it must stop gouging British 
Columbians so much and that it must cut fares on some of its 
routes because it is overpricing and gouging Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the regulation to deal with that?   That is much more 
harmful to Canadians right across the country at this time.  We 
need a general overhaul of the air regulatory system.  Much of 
this bill is regulatory in nature.  When there are so many things 
of a regulatory nature that need to done, why are we focusing so 
much time on this one while disregarding all the other things 
that need to be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill certainly deals with some issues that have worth.  We 
think there could be a lot of improvements.  As we have pointed 
out to many people, we do not write the legislation.  Any 
legislation we ever get, good or bad, must come from the 
government.  There is no other way.  Sure, we can try a private 
member's bill, but we saw what happened this morning on that. The 
hon. member for Surrey North came out with a very good piece of 
potential legislation that was slapped down and made non-votable. 
Therefore, it automatically dies no matter how good the arguments 
that are brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must live with legislation brought forward by the government 
any time something needs to be changed.  If we need a change to 
the Young Offenders Act we need a piece of legislation from the 
government, even if it is bad.  We need that to be the impetus to 
get us to start.  We can then try two things, as we will do with 
this bill.  We can first bring the attention of the public to the 
shortcomings of the bill.  We can consult with the public, find 
out their concerns and listen to the changes they think are 
necessary.  Once the bill gets to committee we can ensure 
that a consultative process goes on and that, ideally, the 
government listens to what comes in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always found this an irony in the past.  I remember one 
transport bill where over 100 witnesses appeared before the 
committee.  There was a clause dealing with the dispute 
settlement mechanism that most witnesses found offensive.  It 
happened on the Canada Transportation Act.  I do not know the 
exact number, but over 90% of the witnesses who came forward were 
very clear that they did not want that clause in the agreement 
and he government ignored them.  This begs me to ask why it 
bothered to consult.  Why did it spend all the money and waste 
the time of this parliament consulting if it does not listen to 
what Canadians say?

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support getting the bill through second reading so it 
gets to committee, where we hope the government will do the 
consultative process.  We hope this time it will also listen to 
people who come forward to point out things that need to be 
changed in the bill, and that it will support the amendments no 
matter where they come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can bring in its own amendments or accept our 
amendments, but it should recognize that we are not here for 
partisan purposes.  Once bills get back to the House they are 
here to serve Canadians, and we need to do that together.  I hope 
government members will work with us in committee to ensure that 
the bills and the legislation reflect the needs and wishes of 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in response to my representations and speech earlier, 
my Alliance colleague asked me a question on guidelines and on 
all that does not appear in the bill and, among other things, 
with regard to shipbuilding, why the government has not analyzed 
the tax havens available to shipowners in all this concept.  I 
think this is a very interesting idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to what my Alliance colleague told me, we must 
understand that, concerning the industry of the shipowners, the 
Minister of Finance apparently has investments in the business. 
I hope it is not embarrassment that is preventing him from 
investing and having the Government of Canada give tax credits 
to shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying earlier, shipbuilding in Canada is operating at 
25% capacity.  The Canadian economy is doing without millions 
and millions of dollars because the Government of Canada has 
decided not to support this industry.  The governments of 
Quebec, Nova Scotia and British Columbia decided to support the 
shipbuilding industry in Canada by giving it tax or other forms 
of credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Alliance is exactly right. The shipowners 
should, through taxes due the provinces and the Government of 
Canada, do their part in the revival of shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that, if our research went deeper, we would not realize 
that companies belonging to Canadian shipowners are having ships 
built in Asia, for example, where they are getting investment 
credits of 30% more than what they would get in Canada.  In 
Europe, the industry gets 9% in government support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that we would not discover that Canadian shipowners are 
having ships built outside the country, where the industry is 
subsidized, because—

donors have been raising money for a new war museum to be built 
at the former Rockcliffe air station.  Right beside the aviation 
museum and the national military cemetery, this site is a perfect 
location.  At 35 acres it would have ample space to store and 
display the museum's vast collection of tanks, artillery and even 
a submarine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, just three years before its scheduled completion, the 
government has now unexpectedly decided to switch locations to 
LeBreton Flats, which is half the size.  This change in plans 
will not only delay the opening by years but will also 
significantly reduce the outdoor display area and likely double 
the original $80 million price tag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be wiser to stick with the original plan, which 
would give us a bigger and better space sooner and without 
wastefully spending another $80 million?  Perhaps the heritage

more to get less.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is now 
day 152 since potato wart was discovered in the corner of one 
field on Prince Edward Island.  CFIA and the industry immediately 
established proof that this was an isolated case and that our 
potatoes meet all the requirements for movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, since that time potato producers have seen their 
product illegally kept out of the United States market and have 
had very little in the way of a firm indication of federal 
financial support.  Retaliatory action at the border by Canada 
has not occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question Islanders want answered is why.  On softwood lumber 
the federal government is quite prepared to take the fight to the 
U.S.  We as a country are right on that issue and the United 
States is wrong.  The same standards should apply to potatoes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for aggressive trade action and far past time that an 
assistance package was put in place for the P.E.I. potato 
industry.  Would Agriculture Canada please get the job done?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, it might have been worthwhile to remind students of 
certain facts, such as the fact that during the last century 
all provinces with an anglophone majority passed legislation 
which in some cases did away with French language schools in 
order to assimilate their francophone populations; the 
francophones of Canada have never obtained any reparation for 
these discriminatory laws. 
In 1982 the federal government repatriated the Canadian 
constitution, thereby reducing the powers of Quebec, contrary to 
the wishes of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

living in Canada on and off since 1996.  Among his accused crimes 
is the murder of an Italian police officer who was shot in the 
face at point blank range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration told 
the House that her department recently moved to deport Mr. Amodeo 
shortly after learning there was a warrant for his arrest.  Now 
we discover that the Italian government informed the RCMP over 
two years ago that Mr. Amodeo lived here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration please tell us 
when she really learned that the RCMP knew Mr. Amodeo was wanted? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian officials have been co-operating and sharing 
information with Italian officials since 1999.  When there was 
sufficient information, including a positive identification and 
knowledge of Mr. Amodeo's whereabouts, the RCMP engaged the 
assistance of immigration officials.  As stated previously by the 
minister, her department took appropriate steps to initiate 
deportation proceedings after receiving this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within three weeks of the proceedings beginning, Mr. Amodeo was 
arrested.  He is now in custody and is awaiting the appropriate 
legal proceedings. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government's supposed facts are 
all out of line.  Just two weeks ago, the minister of 
education-immigration stood in the House and refused to 
acknowledge these very important details.  For two years the RCMP 
apparently knew about this information.  The solicitor general 
was also in the House and he refused to inform the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration and he refused to inform the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask him:  When did he really know about this file?  When did 
he find out the RCMP had the information?  When did he inform the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, or did he at all? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when, I repeat, there was sufficient information such 
that the RCMP felt that it could be brought to the attention of 
the immigration people, this was done.  It included a positive 
identification and knowledge of Mr. Amodeo's whereabouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, as the ministers have said, the immigration 
department receiving this information issued the appropriate 
warrants and within three weeks Mr. Amodeo was arrested.  He 
remains in custody right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why the Leader of the Opposition is opposed to 
that.  I thought he would be happy that Mr. Amodeo is in custody. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try one more time.  The 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and apparently the 
solicitor general said that they knew nothing, or they kept the 
information from the House.  It was the Italian government that 
told us that it had informed the RCMP over two years ago, not 
just recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I will ask the Prime Minister, which of the two ministers, 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration or the solicitor 
general, will he ask to resign over this scandal? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is the last person who 
should be talking about somebody else resigning after the 
problems he has had the past several years over his lawsuit and 
the donation.  Speaking of resigning, he should start any parade 
on his side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that Canadian officials have been 
co-operating and sharing information with their Italian 
counterparts since 1999. 
I have said that and I repeat that.  The hon. member is not 
providing anything new to the House.  I repeat the answer I have 
given and I stand by that answer.

Canada for two years.  The RCMP and Citizenship and Immigration 
Canada both knew he was here for two years.  Both ministers knew 
he was here.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The moment Gaetano Amodeo's name appeared on an application for 
permanent residency back in June 1999, the department of

the database of the RCMP, especially since it was advised by the 
Italian police that he was wanted.

matters the U.S. plays by the rules when it suits it.  When it 
does not it plays power politics.  Softwood lumber is a perfect 
example:  When we win we lose because the government sells us 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current softwood lumber deal is about to expire.  Will the 
government assure Canadians that it will not capitulate yet again 
to American bullying?  Will it finally stand up for Canada's

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade,

pertinent question.  Softwood lumber is a very important file.  It 
is a file that took up much of our discussions when I met with 
Ambassador Zoellick in Washington a few weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is absolutely right when she says that our Canadian 
practices respect our international trade obligations.  Every 
time the Americans have gone through their own national legislation 
or to international panels we have won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is very important is that our industry is better prepared 
than ever to meet the challenges of American producers.  The 
government will side with its industries.  We will continue to 
work very closely with the provinces and with industries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think 
Canadians know what is important.  What is important is that the 
government finally stands up for Canada's lumber interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and again, Canada has won on softwood lumber.  Time and 
again, the government has capitulated to American pressures.  The 
beginning of the Canadian cave-in was when President Reagan was 
looking for fast tracking authority on the free trade deal.  Now 
President Bush wants fast tracking on the FTAA.

that we do not go back to the sort of agreement that we had in 
1996.  We have been consulting with the industry and the 
provinces.  We all want to go to free trade.  We have the right 
tools and the right ways of dealing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend our industry for being well prepared to meet the 
challenges the American producers might pose to us after the 
termination of the agreement.  However, we will stand united as a 
country.  We will not pitch one region against the other.  We 
will fight for our rights on the American market.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we were in the middle of extensive consultations on the 
budget.  The hon. member knows full well that all the items 
discussed there were items that I had raised in speeches, items 
that had been raised in front of the finance committee, and were 
all part of the extensive consultation process which continued, I 
must say, after this meeting with meetings of economists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows full well that the focus groups are 
randomly chosen.  If he does not understand that, I would suggest 
he might want to read the letter to the <I>Globe and Mail</I> in 
which the head of the polling association said that what was 
recommended by the Conservative Party would have amounted to a 
serious breach of polling ethics. 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
focus group's materials were very specific in detailing the tax 
changes the government was to put in place.  I quote “Our new 
package will cut the capital gains inclusion rate further to 
50%”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What steps did the minister take to ensure that no participants 
of the focus group benefited financially from their access to 
this privileged information?  Will he table those measures in the 
House? 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member knows full well that no final decisions 
were communicated.  In fact, among the various tax issues that we 
consulted on was the flat tax.  I can assure the hon. member we 
had no intention of introducing that particular measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really at issue here is the issue of openness and 
transparency in budget making.  If the hon. member disagrees with 
the government and thinks that public policy arrived at openly 
and in full consultation with Canadians is not a good idea, then 
quite simply we disagree.

must be free from undue influence of any kind, be it from those 
with money or power.  There is a growing recognition that 
stability, human security and the rule of law are necessary to 
economic growth.  There is a growing appreciation that an 
independent judiciary with the proper resources is the first step 
down this path. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are envied around the world for the quality, 
commitment and independence of our judiciary.  Increasingly our 
court system and our judges are looked to as models of integrity 
and impartiality by developing democratic nations as they strive 
to implement fair and effective systems of their own. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only open the papers or listen to the international news 
to be reminded of the importance of a courageous, independent and 
impartial judiciary in ensuring the basic elements of a free and 
civil society.  Like so many of the rights and advantages enjoyed 
by all Canadians, the importance of an independent judiciary 
cannot be underestimated or taken for granted.  Without it our 
country would be a very different place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with real pride that I note that Canada's experience and 
expertise has been sought in the development of judicial and 
court systems in such diverse countries and regions as the former 
Soviet Union, including the Ukraine and Kosovo, as well as South 
Africa and China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, during a recent visit to China the Prime Minister 
commented on the five year co-operation project on the training 
of judges which has been successfully undertaken by our two 
nations.  Canada's contribution toward the training of the 
Chinese judiciary on issues such as ethics and independence of 
the judiciary will be integrated into ongoing judicial teaching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of an independent judiciary was succinctly 
captured by our Prime Minister when he stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For no matter how well the laws are written, there can be no 
justice without a fair trial overseen by a competent, 
independent, impartial and effective judiciary.  A judiciary that 
applies the law equally for all citizens, regardless of gender, 
social status, religious belief, or political opinion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to the principle of 
judicial independence as it is a fundamental precondition to 
ensuring the vitality of the rule of law in our democratic system 
of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three constitutionally required elements of judicial 
independence are security of tenure, independence of 
administration of matters relating to the judicial function and 
financial security.  In his seminal study on judicial 
independence and accountability, Professor Martin Friedland 
observed: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a judge's salary is dependent on the whim of the government, 
the judge will not have the independence we desire in our 
judiciary.  If salaries could be arbitrarily raised or lowered in 
individual cases, or even collectively, the government would have 
a strong measure of control over the judiciary. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in direct support of the principle of judicial 
independence that section 100 of the Constitution has conferred 
on parliament the important task of establishing financial 
security of the federally appointed judiciary.  It is the 
responsibility of parliamentarians, all of us, to ensure that our 
judges are compensated fairly and appropriately in order to 
maintain the quality and independence of our benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1981 parliament established an independent judicial 
compensation and benefits commission to assist in its task under 
section 100 of the Constitution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada explained the purpose of the 
independent commission process in the following words: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—financial security for the courts, as an institution, has three 
components which all flow from the constitutional imperative 
that, to the extent possible, the relationship between the 
judiciary and the other branches of government be 
depoliticized—this imperative demands that the courts both be 
free and appear to be free from political interference through 
economic manipulation by the other branches of government, and 
that they not become entangled in the politics of remuneration 
from the public purse. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 parliament amended the Judges Act in order to further 
enhance the commission's independence, objectivity and overall 
effectiveness in support of the principle of judicial 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new commission process builds on the strength of the former 
commission.  The independence of the new commission has been 
enhanced through the nomination process and the tenure of its 
members.  In terms of their selection the judiciary and the 
government each nominated one member of the commission.  Those 
two members nominated a third member to served as chair of the 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission is required to conduct an inquiry every four 
years and to make recommendations as to the adequacy of judicial 
compensation.  Parliament further reinforced the commission's 
objectivity by establishing criteria which guide the assessment 
of what constitutes adequate judicial salaries, benefits and 
allowances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These objective criteria include: the prevailing economic 
conditions in Canada, including the cost of living and the 
overall economic and financial position of the federal 
government; the role of financial security of the judiciary in 
ensuring judicial independence; the need to attract outstanding 
candidates to the judiciary; and any other objective criteria 
that the commission considers relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The care with which the commission undertook its preparations 
and deliberations is evident in the quality and thoroughness of 
its report.  While the government may not share all the 
commission's conclusions, it is clear that the commission made a 
great effort to offer reasons that are carefully explained and 
supported by evidence to the extent that evidence was available. 
I recommend that all members take the opportunity to read both 
the commission report and the government's response to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be remembered that the commission's recommendations are 
not binding.  It is on parliament that the constitution has 
conferred the exclusive authority and responsibility for 
establishing judicial compensation.  However, where parliament 
decides to reject or modify the commission's recommendations, it 
is legally and constitutionally required to explain publicly a 
reasonable justification for this decision. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Canada is fortunate to have a judiciary renowned 
internationally for its competence, commitment, independence and 
impartiality. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are confident that all members will appreciate the particular 
importance of this first formal response to the new commission 
process in ensuring public confidence in the legitimacy of this 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-12 the government is proposing implementation of 
most of the recommendations of the judicial compensation and 
benefits commission, including proposed salary increases and some 
modest improvements to pensions and allowances.  In light of all 
the factors considered by this independent commission, including 
trends in both the public and the private sectors, the government 
is of the view that the proposals in Bill C-12 are within the 
range of what is reasonable and adequate to meet the 
constitutional principle of financial security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the government is not prepared to implement all the 
commission's recommendations.  Specifically we will defer a 
proposal that would increase numbers of supernumerary or part 
time judges pending the outcome of important consultations with 
my colleagues in the provinces and the territories.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the government has not accepted the commission's 
recommendation with respect to legal fees.  In our view the 
commission's proposal does not establish reasonable limits to 
these expenditures.  Instead we are proposing a statutory formula 
designed to provide for a reasonable contribution to the costs of 
the participation of the judiciary while at the same time limit 
their scope.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitution has entrusted parliament with a duty to fix 
judicial salaries, pensions and allowances at a level sufficient

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can be above the law.  And no one can be forgotten by the

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is precisely to safeguard the principle of judicial

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House and have the 
opportunity to speak to Bill C-12, an act to amend the Judges Act 
and to amend another act in consequence.  I would like to mention 
that I will be splitting my time with the Canadian Alliance 
justice critic from Provencher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its unanimous consent to 
permit the hon. member to split his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in December of last 
year, shortly after the federal election, I was going through an 
Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> article which mentioned that Canadian judges 
would be receiving a $19 million pay raise that would boost their 
income 11.2% on average to more than $205,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 11.2% awarded on December 13, 2000, was according to that 
news article quoting a justice department lawyer a compromise 
between the 26.3% that the judges were asking for and the demands 
of taxpayers to keep costs down.  Government justice lawyer 
Judith Bellis had taken the view that the 11.2% was in the range 
of reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12, the subject of today's debate, enacts that 11.2% pay 
raise, thereby raising the salaries of approximately 1,013 
federally appointed judges who sit on provincial superior courts 
and courts of appeal, as well as the tax courts and the Supreme 
Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase, retroactive to April 1, 2000, will raise the base 
salary from $179,200 to $198,000 for judges who sit on appeal 
courts and superior courts in each province. The salaries for the 
chief justices in those courts will rise to $217,000 from 
$196,500.  The same rates will also apply to federal court 
judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judges on the Supreme Court of Canada will remain the 
highest paid.  The eight regular judges will see an increase to 
$235,700 from $213,000, while Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin's 
salary will jump to $254,000 from $230,200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that while the government considers this 
raise reasonable, the official opposition views it as extremely 
generous considering senior public servants have received raises 
of no more than 5.7%.  As well, the pay of public servants is not 
indexed, while the pay and salaries of judges are.  We on this 
side of the House, therefore, are opposed to Bill C-12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the information of other new members of the House, I would 
like to point out this is not the first time the Liberal 
government has tried to amend the Judges Act.  In fact, this is 
the fourth time the Liberals have come forward and made changes 
to the act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally in 1996, Bill C-2 and Bill C-42, both if I may 
paraphrase a former member of the House, were described as being 
nebulous, inconsequential pieces of legislation with little 
significance to Canadians who were genuinely concerned about 
their safety, as opposed to the simple administrative matters 
that these bills brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1998 Bill C-37 was introduced to establish the judicial 
compensation and benefits commission.  The compensation 
commission was set up as an independent advisory body after the 
supreme court ruled that judges' salaries were constitutionally 
protected and the previous system of setting pay was inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37, increasing judges' salaries retroactively, provided 
them with an 8.3% pay increase over those two years.  Translated 
into dollars, this meant an average $13,000 pay increase for 
federal judges with salaries increasing from $159,000 to over 
$172,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know of any other federal public servant, or any 
hard-working Canadian citizen, who received a $13,000 pay 
increase in 1998.  While the Liberal government and the Tories 
were voting in favour of the huge pay increase, Canadians' 
incomes were on a steady decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on this side of the House, with the exception of the 
Progressive Conservative Party, opposed the bill.  Members on the 
other side of the House wrongfully insisted that our opposition 
to the bill was “the ravings of ill-informed and ill-prepared 
men of parliament who contributed to the ill-repute of the 
justice system”.  The truth is that my party holds the judiciary 
in high esteem.  We were opposed to Bill C-37 and we are opposed 
to Bill C-12, based on the fact that other senior public 
servants, lower level public employees and other Canadian workers 
had not and will not be awarded such generous increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same year that federal judges were being awarded these 
huge salary increases, comparatively Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police officers, who had had their salaries and wages frozen for 
five years, were granted an increase of 2% in March 1998, 
retroactive to January.  A second pay increase was given to them 
in April 1998 and toward the end of that year they received 
another three-quarter per cent increase.  Over the five years 
that they had been frozen, and in the next year of 1998, the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police saw an increase of three and 
three-quarter per cent.  They are on the front lines putting 
their lives in jeopardy.  The average three year constable 
received less than $2,000 over those years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not mention that the former member of 
Crowfoot put forward an amendment to Bill C-37 that was supported 
and passed in the House during report stage.  That amendment 
ensured that every four years the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights had the opportunity to review the report of the 
commission on judges' salaries and benefits.  The task would not 
be left solely to the Minister of Justice as was originally 
contemplated by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be negligent of me if I also did not recognize the 
thorough job the Senate did in reviewing Bill C-37, the 
pre-emptive bill to Bill C-12, and the substantive amendments 
that it brought forward at the upper house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, I would like to single out the efforts of Senator 
Anne Cools for her diligent efforts in revealing the many 
inadequacies of Bill C-37.  Senator Cools apparently exposed the 
fact that Bill C-37 would effectively allow judges to set their 
own wages, salaries and benefits and in so doing would set up the 
possibility of there being a show down between parliament and the 
judiciary.  It would allow judges to appeal parliament's decision 
regarding a recommendation of the salary increase put forward in 
the courts.  Essentially the judges would have the final say over 
whether or not parliamentarians were giving them a sufficient 
raise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although former judicial pay commissioner David Scott said it 
was unlikely that judges would ever be setting their own 
salaries, he would not rule out the possibility of the judiciary 
challenging parliament's response to the commission's 
recommendations for a pay increase or for reducing pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judiciary would have to prove, however, in a court that the 
refusal to increase salaries or a decision to lower them was 
motivated by a wish to diminish the independence of judges.  Mr. 
Scott said that even if the judges won in such a case, the court 
could only declare parliament's motion on the issue void and that 
would result in a stalemate.  As pointed out by the Liberal 
senator, this would “deprive Canadians of their undoubted 
constitutional right to parliament's control over the public 
purse in respect to the judiciary”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the control of the public purse rests with the elected 
members of parliament and not with the unelected members of the 
judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 100 of the 1867, Constitution Act, states in part that the 
salaries, allowances and pensions of the judges shall be fixed 
and provided by the Parliament of Canada.  Clause 6 of Bill C-37 
potentially abolished parliament's role in fixing judges' 
salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we must question why the Minister of Justice at that 
time was so willing to bestow such potentially wielding powers on 
the judiciary through Bill C-37.  One can only surmise, and again 
I use the words of Senator Cools when she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real intent (of Bill C-37) is to remove parliament from the 
process.... There is a problem in that certain particular judges 
seem to crave a closeness to certain individuals in the 
Department of Justice and are trying to cling, closer and closer, 
to the executive rather than to parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to say to the Senate: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, honourable senators, what is happening here is 
that 200 years of history are being turned on their head, and we 
are being told in this judgment that, quite frankly, judges 
prefer their fate to be in the hands of the executive rather than 
in the hands of parliament.  It is a most curious and interesting 
subject matter. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is more than curious and interesting, it is fearful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37, which was also an act to amend the Judges Act as it 
was originally drafted by the Department of Justice, had another 
problem.  It created a legal right for a judge to have two 
spouses.  The two spouses clause was meant to deal with 
circumstances in which a married judge, who was separated from 
his or her wife or husband and was living common law with another 
person, died.  It would have allowed a judge to have both 
spouses, married and common law, to be eligible for the lucrative 
pension. In addition, the common law spouse would collect a one 
time payout of one-sixth of the judge's annual salary at the time 
of his or her passing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former supreme court Justice William Estey said that this 
particular section of Bill C-37 would “give his former 
colleagues on the bench the right to a kind of homemade harem. It 
would effectively create two separate sets of family law, one for 
the judges and one for everyone else”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During debate on this legislation it was noted that the 
situations such as the contemplated one in Bill C-37 were rare. 
Therefore, questions arose as to why such a clause was put into 
Bill C-37.  Critics suggested that this particular clause was 
tailor made for Chief Justice LeSage who was separated from his 
wife and had resided for about a year with Judge Lang.  If Chief 
Justice LeSage were to die, the new amendment would have allowed 
both Judge Lang and Mrs. LeSage to qualify as his surviving 
spouse and share his pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As pointed out by Senator Cools during the debate, Bill C-37 
appeared tailor fit to particular individuals.  Senator Cools 
said “We have a situation in this country where individuals have 
access to the legislative writing machine”.  Senator Cools said 
that it was very bothersome.  Again, that is more than 
bothersome.  That is a huge concern.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that Bill C-37 was not the first time that the 
government has tailor made legislation to amend the Judges Act. 
Bill C-42, as mentioned earlier, also amended the Judges Act.  It 
changed the pension scheme and working conditions of the 
federally appointed judiciary.  In particular, it set out the 
terms on which Canadian judges could participate in international 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it was never explicitly admitted by the House or by the 
government, it was no secret that these amendments to the Judges 
Act arose due to the 1996 appointment of then Madam Justice 
Louise Arbour to the United Nations as a prosecutor for its 
special war crimes division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently opposition members naively agreed in June of that 
year, just before the House recessed for the summer, without any 
debate in the House, without any debate at committee, to pass 
Bill C-42 after being assured by the former justice minister that 
it was a simple innocuous housekeeping bill.  It was not until 
the amended bill was returned from the Senate and the testimony 
of witnesses that appeared before the Senate committee were made 
known that my colleagues realized that Bill C-42, as claimed by 
legal experts, had “the appearance of transgressing the vital 
principle of judicial impartiality”, the very principle that our 
Minister of Justice has just spoken on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, I refer to the testimony of Professor Morton: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is concerned, as well it should be, with the 
current status of Justice Arbour and the implications of her 
status for those responsible at justice.  The government seems to 
hope that by passing Bill C-42 as quickly as possible it can 
retroactively legitimate apparent indiscretions by Justice Arbour 
and possibly others— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear that Justice Arbour agreed to the appointment 
before it had been approved by the Minister of Justice (or any 
other officials), thereby forcing the minister to react to a fait 
accompli.  Furthermore, it then appears that the minister, rather 
than recommending to Justice Arbour that she postpone her new 
activities (at the Hague) pending necessary amendments to the 
Judges Act, sought to temporarily legitimate her actions by an 
order in council; and then (because the order in council is 
conceded to be insufficient) sought to retroactively legitimate 
Justice Arbour's new employment with general amendments to the 
Judges Act, Bill C-42, thereby forcing the hand of Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Morton added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt some will say that this is nit-picking.  My response is 
simple.  If the justice minister and appeal court judges cannot 
be expected to comply with the letter of the law, then who 
can?...Indeed within the last month the justice minister himself 
pronounced on the meaning and the importance of the rule of the 
law.  The rule of the law is “a living” principle that is 
fundamental to our democratic way of life.  In substance it means 
that everyone in our society, including ministers of government, 
premiers, the rich and powerful and the ordinary citizen alike, 
is governed by the same law of the land. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While one section of Bill C-42 at that point in time appeared 
tailor made for Arbour, another section of that very same bill 
was apparently designed for the then chief justice of the supreme 
court in that it offered an unprecedented pension benefit to the 
chief justice and his wife at the very time when the top court 
was considering the most politically sensitive case of the 
decade, perhaps of confederation, whether Quebec had a 
constitutional right to secede from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes did away with the prohibition on judicial 
double-dipping.  Previously a retired judge received a pension 
equal to two-thirds of his annual salary; on average, about 
$104,000.  When he died, his spouse collected a survivor's 
pension worth one-third of his salary or $52,000, provided that 
she was not a retired judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new law retired judge spouses will collect both, thus 
receiving a total pension equivalent to their salary before 
retirement.  The most obvious beneficiary of the change was Chief 
Justice Lamer and his wife, Federal Court of Canada Justice 
Danièle Tremblay-Lamer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to this section of Bill C-42, Professor Morton said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without imputing any illicit motive to anyone involved—the 
timing of this proposed change could not be worse. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Morton also said that sceptics would claim: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable that a chief justice who is about to benefit 
from the minister's proposed pension policy change now sits in 
judgment of the minister's Quebec reference—the most politically 
sensitive constitutional case of the decade. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would assure the House and Canadians in general 
that the official opposition will closely scrutinize Bill C-12. 
In particular, we will review the provision of the bill that 
changes the annuities scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a financial expert.  I am not an expert on annuities or 
the pay schedules that are put forward in the bill.  Without the 
advantage of expert advice at this stage, what appears to happen 
is that the changes being made to the Judges Act allow a judge 
who is married for the second time to another judge after the 
death of his or her first spouse, also a judge, to collect both 
or two survivor benefits upon the death of the second spouse. One 
could only guess why the government is contemplating such a rare 
and highly unlikely situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have already mentioned, four times the Liberal government 
has come to make amendments to the Judges Act.  We have seen time 
and time again where the government has tailor made legislation 
to fit certain individuals and certain situations.  We will also 
assure the House and Canadians in general that Bill C-12 is not 
tailor made to any individuals.  If it were, it would definitely 
compromise the impartiality of our judiciary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-12, 
an act to amend the Judges Act and to amend another act in 
consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill amends the Judges Act to implement the government's 
response to the recommendations made by the 1999 judicial 
compensation and benefits commission.  Among those 
recommendations is a retroactive salary increase of 11.2% for 
1,013 federally appointed judges.  The bill is purely 
administrative in nature, but that is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the fourth time the Liberal government has sought to 
amend the act.  During the 35th parliament the government 
introduced Bill C-2 and Bill C-42 and during the 36th parliament, 
Bill C-37, all of which were minor pieces of legislation or of 
little significance to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we all recognize the need for housekeeping bills, there 
have been no significant initiatives by the current Liberal 
government to address the serious concerns of many Canadians with 
our judiciary.  It appears more and more that the issues 
parliament may address when it comes to the judiciary are merely 
administrative in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the guise of the charter the courts have appropriated for 
themselves the right to deal with substantive policy matters. The 
courts have in addition appropriated for themselves the right to 
effectively control the ability to set their salaries, a matter 
which the Constitution Act, 1867, specifically left to 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision of the courts purported to find a new 
constitutional obligation to require the legislatures to set up a 
commission to establish the salaries for provincially appointed 
judges.  The supreme court, which was called upon to confirm this 
process, not only did so but included a newfound constitutional 
obligation requiring parliament to follow a similar process when 
it came to setting salaries for federally appointed judges.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the fiction is that parliament can exercise its own 
judgment in respect to the salaries recommended by the 
committees, in reality the judges simply overturn those 
legislated decisions where they disagree with them.  One need 
look no further than the Alberta legislature for a very practical 
demonstration of the court's powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is simply a case of judges discovering new constitutional 
principles that benefit themselves financially without political 
accountability or, as one of my constituents observed in 
describing the case, “the judges paying the judge's case”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This newfound constitutional process that the judges discovered 
further decreased parliamentary responsibility for the 
expenditure of public funds and moves toward the creation of an 
economically independent judiciary with its own political agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent letter to <I>Maclean's</I> magazine by a Mr. W. J. Jack 
of Innisfil, Ontario, noted: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that members of Parliament no longer want to or 
can't make laws that work, so they let appointed judges do that 
job.  If the Supreme Court is going to legislate, we won't need 
elections, except to vote for one person who would then appoint 
the members of the court.  This would save taxpayers a lot of 
money, and we'd still have the one-man-rule system that we have 
today. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coupled with the self-granting powers under the charter and an 
executive appointed judiciary as we now have, I would argue the 
courts can be and often are used to advance the political agenda 
of a government in a particular direction without consultation 
with the members of parliament who are accountable to the people 
of Canada and who represent their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judicial activism is all too common in our courts.  Many if not 
most Canadians would agree that it must remain the responsibility 
of parliament to debate and ultimately resolve the political, 
economic and social issues that govern all our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However over the past two decades judges supreme court justices 
in particular have to varying degrees engaged in a frenzy of 
constitutional experimentation that resulted in the judiciary 
substituting its legal and social preferences for those of the 
elected representatives of the people in parliament and the 
legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A leader in this judicial activism was the former Chief Justice 
of Canada, Antonio Lamer.  Although he is now retired, the 
decisions he wrote or participated in will continue to impact on 
the principles and institutions of our democracy.  Unfortunately 
that impact has been at an alarming cost to our democracy and to 
the public safety and security of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another member of the court has recently added his concern to 
the direction of the supreme court and the judicial activism of 
the former chief justice.  Mr. Justice Bastarache has warned the 
nation of the dangers of the judicial government favoured by the 
former chief justice.  In contrast to the former chief justice, 
Justice Bastarache has committed himself to an interpretation of 
the charter of rights and freedoms that pays respect to 
democratic principles and institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House and the people of Canada should commend Mr. Justice 
Bastarache and other jurists who recognize the dangers of the 
legal and constitutional anarchy reflected in the judgments of 
the former chief justice.  Our democratic principles and 
institutions are too important to be hijacked by a non-elected 
political judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider for a moment a recent high profile supreme court 
decision that typifies the issue.  In Minister of Justice v Burns 
and Rafay the supreme court in effect removed the justice 
minister's parliamentary prerogative of choosing whether or not 
to seek assurances before extraditing alleged criminals facing 
the death penalty in another country, the United States or 
otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of where one stands on the issue of capital 
punishment, the court has attempted to deprive parliament of 
debating the issue further. 
The court has overridden Canada's law as written by parliament 
and has chosen to push its political agenda to the forefront by 
opening Canada's borders to violent criminals.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not just my characterization.  The day after the Rafay 
and Burns decision was delivered by the Supreme Court of Canada 
the lawyers for the Minister of Justice, in another related case, 
stood before the court and said that the impact of the decisions 
was to create safe havens for criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the precedent set in previous supreme court 
rulings, the minister had only been required to seek guarantees 
when the possibility of the death penalty would shock the 
conscience or otherwise outrage standards of decency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this decision, the supreme court has attempted to reconcile 
its new position with its 1991 precedent.  However, in actual 
fact it has rewritten the law.  The recent ruling stipulated that 
the Minister of Justice was required to seek guarantees prior to 
the extradition of Rafay and Burns and in the future on all 
accused of such crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our extradition treaty with the United States has also been 
effectively rewritten.  One might think that the practical effect 
of extraditing these individuals, if they are convicted in the 
state of Washington, is that they would face life imprisonment 
without the possibility of parole.  That is only technically 
true.  If they are convicted and all appeals are exhausted, they 
become automatically eligible for the prisoner exchange program. 
They then come back to Canada where the maximum sentence is 25 
years before eligibility for parole and, with the faint hope 
clause, they can apply for parole after 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking into account that these individuals have already been 
held for six or seven years, if they were successful under the 
faint hope clause they would be on the streets after eight years. 
If in fact they are the people who brutally killed three American 
citizens for insurance money, the practical consequence of their 
crime would be eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an issue about the death penalty.  This is the 
circumvention of parliament by refusing to allow parliament to 
have a say in the laws that govern crime in Canada.  This is an 
abdication of our responsibility.  Our responsibility has been 
taken away by the Supreme Court of Canada which has its own 
political agenda when it comes to criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Minister of Justice v Burns and Rafay the supreme court has 
prevented any legislative attempt to reintroduce capital 
punishment in Canada.  This is regardless of where one stands on 
the issue.  Our party does not have a position on capital 
punishment.  The court's decision effectively says that the 
elected people of Canada can never make the decision because it 
is constitutionally prohibited.  The political reason given was 
that the practice is unjust and should be stopped.  That is not a 
legal judgment.  That is a political decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, regardless of where one stands on the issue, it is a 
decision for parliament and its elected representatives to make. 
Regardless of the convictions of the court, amending Canada's 
laws and treaties for policy reasons should be the responsibility 
of parliament and not the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Chief Justice Lamer's judicial activism is not in harmony 
with the democratic principles of Canada, regardless of whether 
we oppose or defend the cause that the court may support.  People 
might say that it is a good decision regardless of it being a 
political one.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The decisions of the court on political matters short-circuit 
the process, undermine the authority of parliament and bring the 
institution of parliament into disrepute.  It is not that it 
insults parliamentarians, it insults the people who elected 
parliamentarians to make these decisions on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this issue is a major concern, it is far from being the 
only problem in our judicial system that requires the attention 
of parliament.  Another such issue is related to the appointment 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the last bill to amend the Judges 
Act, Bill C-37 from the 36th parliament, created the Judicial 
Compensation and Benefits Commission which provided the federal 
government with yet another opportunity to make patronage 
appointments.  The commission consists of three members appointed 
by the governor in council and it should be noted who nominates 
these three:  One is nominated by the judiciary; one is nominated 
by the Minister of Justice; and one, who acts as a chair, is 
nominated by the first two persons nominated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure of the bill to introduce any changes in the 
appointment process means that important and high paying 
positions in our court system will remain essentially part of the 
patronage system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance would like to see the patronage 
appointment process overhauled to make it more transparent and 
publicly accountable.  One option would be to strike a committee 
that would review and interview candidates whose names would be 
put forward to the Prime Minister.  The input of the provinces, 
which are affected directly by decisions of the Supreme Court of 
Canada, is required in these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have with the bill is that the increase in pay 
for federally appointed judges is higher than the federal 
government is prepared to grant the much lower paid civil 
service.  It lately has been the practice of the government to 
grant raises to senior officers in the military, senior 
bureaucrats and now judges while dragging its feet on a general 
salary increase for staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we do not dispute that salaries for appointed judges and 
others should generally be in line with the private sector, it is 
apparent that the foot soldiers of our justice system are being 
ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we propose is an independent and publicly accountable 
judiciary that would act as a safeguard to protect Canadians from 
the arbitrary power of the state.  However it must remain the 
responsibility of parliament, not the courts, to debate and 
assess the conflicting objectives inherent in public policy 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, like its predecessors, deals solely with the 
administrative aspects of the courts and does not address the 
multitude of concerns that many Canadians have with the judicial 
system.  Therefore, my colleagues and I strongly oppose the bill.

raises to our high court judges.  What I said at that time was 
that, given the financial situation in Canada and the cuts that

increase, or at least not to the extent being proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I announce a change in tune.  On the one hand, there are 
far more means available to us now for paying our judges.  We 
have far more financial leeway than we did then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened carefully to the previous speakers, the Minister 
of Justice and certain members of the Canadian Alliance.  I have 
to say that there comes a time when there must be some straight 
dealing in such a matter, as in any other.  No more hiding one's 
head in the sand or talking out of both sides of one's mouth.

they wanted no pensions, felt MPs were overpaid, did not want any

are accepting these benefits, and rightly so.  I feel they 
go with the territory, but there must be no doublespeak here.

Hydro-Quebec. This has little to do with judges, I know, but I 
simply want to give an example. The president of Hydro-Quebec may 
earn $300,000. If he worked in the private sector, he would make 
two, three or even four times that salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the issue, I know judges who earn a lot less 
than they did when they practised law. They agreed to become 
judges for all sorts of reasons. In some cases, it was because 
they had a very demanding practice as lawyers. Others, given 
their experience and expertise, wanted to give something back to 
society. These are not bad people who only think about 
themselves, on the contrary. We have very good judges in Canada. 
We have a system that works well. There is always room for 
improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not antagonize them the way some parties are trying to 
do today. Rather, we must ask ourselves why we now have before us 
a bill to increase the salaries of higher court judges, of 
federally appointed judges. Let us not make this too complicated. 
On the contrary, we must make it simple, so that people will 
understand why we are faced with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 18, 1997, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on the 
whole issue of salaries for the judges of one province, namely 
Prince Edward Island. 
In this reference, the justices of the supreme court in their 
ruling established new constitutional requirements for setting 
the salaries of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a country justice has to start from some point.  It happened 
that it was the justices of the supreme court, Canada's highest 
court, that ruled on this matter.  Yes, at first glance, we might 
say there was a conflict of interest, since judges handed down a 
ruling concerning other judges.  Who should do the judging?  Who 
decides?  Parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an institution, the Supreme Court of Canada. We have the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  I think that, since the 
charter was passed, since the Constitution was patriated, some of 
the powers of the House of Commons have been taken over by 
others, including the Canadian charter. In my opinion, 
parliamentarians have lost some of their jurisdiction under the 
umbrella of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the Supreme Court of Canada is rendering decisions with 
all of its powers.  It handed down a decision on November 18, 
1997.  I know, I was here in the House.  This decision led the 
House of Commons to introduce an amendment to the Judges Act in 
order to establish an independent, and in my opinion, effective 
review board, the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission, 
far more capable than I to consider the salaries judges might 
earn, whether they were at the Supreme Court of Canada, the 
Federal Court, a trial court or an appeal court, in Quebec or in 
the other provinces, or the judges of the higher courts of each 
of the provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This commission looked at what went on in the private sector and 
where judges came from.  It concluded that their salary should be 
increased by 26%, according to my notes here.  I think 26% is a 
bit much, and this is where the minister has the discretion to 
justify not giving 26%, and this is what she has done today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase is 11.2% which I do not consider unreasonable, 
instead of the 26.3% proposed by the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission's mandate was to consider what would be the best 
remuneration for these judges, as well as to look into whether 
salaries and benefits for judges were adequate, with regard to 
three points:  existing economic conditions in Canada, including 
the cost of living and the economic position of the federal 
government as a whole; the role of the financial security of 
judges in maintaining the independence of the judiciary; and the 
need to attract top notch candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that, when we do a comparison and look at where 
judges come from, we see that 73% are from the private sector, 
11% are from lower courts and 16% are from government or other 
fields of legal practice and from universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the remuneration of 73% of appointees from the 
private sector, we see that the average pre-appointment salary of 
those from Quebec was $209,000 a year.  We certainly cannot 
appoint people without the required training or specialization. 
In any event, as everyone knows, there are appointment criteria, 
such as years of practice and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for benefits, a pension and the level of remuneration, this 
committee looked into the matter and decided to recommend a 26% 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 before us today sets the increase at 11.2%.  Compared 
to earlier bills, I do not consider this unreasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois will be supporting Bill C-12.  I 
am sure the minister is paying careful attention and will come to 
the realization that the Bloc Quebecois supports the government 
when it presents bills that are reasonable and in line with the 
interests of the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as I have an attentive ear for this bill, I would like 
to see the minister lend an equally attentive one to the demands 
from Quebec, including those relating to the young offender 
legislation.  I cannot help commenting that I hope the minister 
will also listen to what Quebec is calling for in this 
connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Bill C-12, this is a bill we are going to support.  I 
have two comments, however, that are a little more on the 
negative side, although not jeopardizing our support for Bill 
C-12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first relates to retroactivity. I realize that the 
commission's report was tabled on May 31, 2000, and we are now in 
March 2001.  When this bill is passed, however, there will be 
nearly a year's retroactivity.  I have trouble accepting that.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, I understand the issue of retroactivity, 
and this is my second criticism is, but why did it take so long 
for the government to introduce this bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the commission's report, which is very well made and very 
well detailed. I did not take a whole year to read it. That 
report was tabled on May 31, 2000. What has the minister been 
doing since? She could have introduced a bill, long before the 
government called the election in October 2000, to follow up on 
the commission's report. Had the minister done so, we would not 
be stuck with retroactive payments of this magnitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My two negative comments, therefore, have to do with 
retroactivity and the government's slowness to act regarding an 
issue like this one. I do hope there were reasons other than an 
election call for the minister to postpone the introduction of 
this bill. I do hope the minister cares enough about the justice 
system to not have unduly waited until after the election to 
introduce a bill that provides an 11% increase for our judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are my only two negative comments at this point. The Bloc 
Quebecois will definitely support the bill. We will keep track of 
it. We will follow all the debates on Bill C-12. We will 
certainly be there to ask questions to the witnesses appearing 
before the committee to express their views on this bill. If 
people submit briefs, I will take the time to read them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is about it at this stage. Bill C-12 will get the support 
of the Bloc Quebecois and it should get the support of all 
parliamentarians. I agree with the minister, and I will conclude 
on this note, that in Canada and in Quebec we have extremely 
qualified and competent judges. I have no problems backing the 
judges by supporting this bill, so that they can get fair 
compensation and remain totally independent from the political 
system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague from 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre.  I am pleased to join in the debate 
on Bill C-12, an act to amend the Judges Act and to amend other 
acts in consequence.  I find the bill to be an interesting one, 
especially in the light of some of the contradictions I see 
between the bill and other similar issues over which the 
government has jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that the purpose of the bill is to 
implement the federal government's response to the report of the 
1999 judicial compensation and benefits commission regarding 
compensation and benefits for judges.  Implementing the 
commission's report seems reasonable enough, but let us not 
forget that the creation of the judicial compensation and 
benefits commission provides the federal government with yet 
another opportunity to make patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's response to this issue is to introduce this 
bill to amend the Judges Act to increase judicial salaries and 
allowances, modify the current judicial annuities scheme, and put 
into place a separate life insurance plan for federally appointed 
judges.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative that the independence of judges be maintained. 
The independence of the judiciary cannot be called into question. 
What is important is to determine the fairness of the 
commission's report.  With this bill the government has accepted 
the commission's recommendation of a salary increase of 11.2% for 
1,013 federally appointed judges, retroactive to April 1, 2000. 
The implementation of this increase would cost Canadian taxpayers 
alone approximately $19 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that during this process the judiciary 
had initially proposed a salary increase of 26.3%.  Their 
rationale for the increase was that the federal government must 
compete with high paying law firms to attract superior candidates 
to the bench.  While I believe that a competitive salary is 
required to ensure good candidates, I fail to see any great 
shortage of candidates for the bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past decade there has been an average of eight 
candidates for each opening on the bench.  I can just envision 
the application office for judges absolutely crowded with 
prospective candidates, waiting in line, filling out all the 
applications, and in the back of their minds there is this 
wonderful salary and compensation package.  Surely out of every 
eight candidates for the bench there must be at least one well 
qualified applicant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last pay raise for federal judges was in 1998 when they 
received 4.1%.  The previous year they also received 4.1%.  In 
other words, over a two year period federal judges had received 
an 8.2% increase.  According to Statistics Canada, the consumer 
price index from 1996 to 1998 rose 2.55%.  Mr. Speaker, I presume 
that your salary, my salary and indeed the salaries of most 
Canadians across the country would be somewhat governed by that 
statistic.  However let us remember that these are judges we are 
talking about and that the salaries of judges are already 
indexed.  They receive annual cost of living increases as well as 
particular salary increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be fair, I must say that I favour competitive salaries.  If 
there is a major disparity when comparing a peer position in the 
private sector, either the quality of candidates or the number of 
qualified candidates will diminish.  I do not believe that this 
is in anyone's best interest.  Yet to date I do not see that the 
bench is short of applicants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we have the bill before us I would also like to draw 
attention to one of my major concerns regarding the judiciary.  I 
would like to see an overhaul of the process of patronage 
appointments in the judiciary to make it more transparent and 
publicly accountable.  The Alliance policy by which I am guided 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that a non-partisan civil service, an independent 
judiciary and competent leadership of government agencies, boards 
and commissions are vital in a democracy.  We will therefore 
ensure appointments to these positions are made through an open 
and accountable process based on merit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key words are based on merit: who will do the best job and 
who is the most qualified to do the best job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there has been much talk of late regarding parliamentary 
reform, I believe that by extension the reform should also 
include the public service.  This is an opportunity to show the 
government's sincerity for true reform.  The process should be 
completely open and accountable, and accountable in this case 
includes fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am somewhat alarmed that the proposed increase in pay is 
higher, for instance, than the federal government is reportedly 
prepared to grant the much lower paid civil servants in general. 
It has been the practice of the government to grant raises to 
senior officers in the military, senior bureaucrats and now 
judges, while dragging its feet on a general salary increase for 
staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think one of the most appalling situations in this regard is 
the amount of wages paid to entry level members of our armed 
forces.  Privates, corporals and others often have to moonlight 
at jobs to make ends meet.  This is simply not acceptable. 
There is no way that the people involved in our military who 
stand on guard for us should have to go to food banks.  There 
needs to be a requirement of fairness in the whole issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure of the bill to introduce any changes in the 
appointment process means that these very important and high 
paying positions will essentially remain part of the patronage 
system.  Members only need to look around for a moment to see the 
level of patronage that already emanates from the Prime 
Minister's Office itself.  The Liberal Party has floated a few 
trial balloons about parliamentary change and reform, but it is 
time to walk the talk. It is easy to talk about change but it 
takes real courage and true leadership to implement it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Change is never easy for any of us.  We are getting older and we 
know that in old age it is harder to change.  However, if the 
government introduced real change, real parliamentary reform and 
real accountability, I believe it would have the support of many 
members on this side of the House and of all Canadians. Perhaps 
it should try it.  The bill provides a golden opportunity to 
begin the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also reminded about the way that salaries, expense accounts 
and pensions are set for members of parliament.  I do not believe 
that members of the public would deny parliamentarians a 
reasonable salary and pension.  What the public begrudges is the 
current manner in which MPs' salaries are adjusted by the MPs 
themselves.  Again there would be an opportunity for change as 
submitted by members of the opposition, namely an independent 
body outside the House made up of qualified members of the public 
would bring in recommendations that would be binding upon members 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is simply not willing to continue to have a 
government act unaccountably.  As a critic for Indian affairs I 
constantly hear from grassroot band members who are literally 
crying out for accountability from either their own chiefs and 
councils, the department or both.  What hope could the government 
offer grassroots aboriginal people, or any Canadian for that 
matter, that accountability is important if it will not live by 
the same set of rules itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do better and we should do better.  We as members of the 
House have the opportunity to do it even in this parliament, but 
too often Liberals opposite take the easier road. For instance, 
they occupy the justice committee with administrative matters at 
the expense of more important issues.  The country is 
experiencing a high degree of backlog in the courts and many 
criminal trials must be put on hold in the meantime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the time to make positive change.  There is a 
general feeling in Canada that this Chamber has virtually no real 
power, but Canadians could be told by parliament, by the House, 
that we are interested in real reform if we really want it.  Let 
us start it by making the necessary changes to Bill C-12. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House 
today to address Bill C-12, an act to amend the Judges Act and to 
amend another act in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin this opportunity to address government 
legislation for the first time, I should like to thank my 
constituents in the riding of Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre for 
having granted me the opportunity and honour of representing them 
in this notable House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 proposes an 11.2% salary increase for 1,013 federally 
appointed judges retroactive to April 2000.  No one can be 
faulted for requesting a pay raise.  Let us be honest.  Who would 
not like a pay raise?  What bothers me is our federal 
government's willingness to grant substantial pay increases to 
individuals who are already making what most Canadians would see 
as a very good living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, one of the mainstays of our Canadian economy, 
Canadian farmers, including many in my own riding, time and again 
have to come to the federal government for the funds needed 
simply to stay alive.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in my home province of Saskatchewan, the 2000 net farm 
income is projected to be 35% of the five year average taken from 
1995 to 1999, and that was a bad five years.  That is a 65% 
decrease.  For 2001, total net income is projected to drop 
further, from $251 million to $141 million.  This is only 20% of 
the 1995 to 1999 average, or an 80% decrease in income.  The five 
year average, as I mentioned, already has two bad years of income 
included in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's attempt to get support to farmers, the AIDA 
program, has failed the majority of our farm families.  This is 
why the farmers have and will continue to come to have their 
voices heard on the Hill.  Only 60% of that emergency aid has 
even reached the farmers.  Over a quarter of the claims for 1999 
remain unprocessed by the federal government and the farmers want 
to know why it is taking so long.  The money promised over two 
years ago by the minister of agriculture for losses in 1998 and 
1999 needs to be delivered, but they still do not have their 
money.  Because of the years of farm policy failure by the 
Liberal government, farm families need an immediate cash 
injection.  They demanded this.  The funds that were given were 
merely an insult to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it seems that I have wandered from the topic as I mention 
the farm crisis, but Bill C-12 seems to reward some people who 
are already doing very well and are not in a crisis at all.  We 
are able to easily come up with money to hand to them.  The 
apparent contrast of these two issues begs the question:  where 
are the government's priorities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many constituents of mine in the riding of Regina—Lumsden—Lake 
Centre are disillusioned with the government due to its uncanny 
ability to make decisions that fail to address the real issues 
affecting real people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be clear.  I am not saying that judges are not real 
people, that they do not have real needs and that they do not 
have a right to have the government's attention for their real 
and often valid concerns.  What I am saying is that to the 
majority of my constituents and, I would venture to assume, to 
the majority of Canadians, granting federal judges a salary 
increase of almost 20% in a three year period is not an important 
priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government justify giving its federal court judges 
an additional salary increase of 11.2% over and above the already 
given 8.2% increase that they received in 1997?  How will this 
proposed pay increase help fix the current backlog in federal 
court cases?  Will the federal court be 11.2% more efficient in 
dealing with the current backlog of court cases? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Auditor General of Canada recently stated in his February 
2001 report that government departments must do a better job at 
providing value for money.  In other words, the auditor general 
is asking government departments if taxpayers are getting true 
value for the government's spending of their tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This very day I attended on the Hill a symposium in which we 
were told that value for money would be a valid criteria by which 
we should judge government actions and government programs.  I 
ask this question of the government with respect to proposed Bill 
C-12:  how will this pay increase provide value for money for 
Canadians and for their taxpayer dollars?  How will giving the 
average judge an increase of approximately $19,000 to $20,000 in 
salary address the roots of the problem the federal courts are 
facing today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I am no economist, I did a little math to try to shed 
some light on the amount of dollars being spent on this 
legislation.  If one takes the salary of the lowest paid judge, 
according to Bill C-12 itself, and adds an 11.2% increase, it 
means a minimum salary increase of nearly $20,000 to every 
federal court judge. 
If we multiply $20,000 by the number of federal court judges 
whose salaries will be increased, there is a total salary 
increase of over $19 million.  Is this money, $19 million for 
only 1,000 people, well spent?

colleague has mentioned already, there are plenty of lawyers to 
fill these positions; the Prime Minister has a list.  Yet all he 
can think about is increasing their salaries.  The problem 
requires more imagination than simply adding money.  More money 
in the hands of judges does nothing to address any of the 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I do not support Bill C-12 on the basis of four 
points.  First, it fails to address the vital questions of 
integrity and honesty regarding the appointment process used by 
the Prime Minister and the government.  Second, it fails to meet 
the reasonable expectations of Canadians in regard to how their 
judicial system should serve them.  Third, the bill fails to 
address any backlogs presently being experienced.  Fourth, it 
fails to meet the taxpayers' demand for a reasonable return on 
their hard earned tax money.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to speak to this bill today. 
I am not in favour of increases to the judiciary, for reasons 
similar to those addressed by my colleague.  However, I want to 
take this opportunity to talk about some of the other problems 
that exist in the judiciary in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the reasons for the lack of support for raises to the 
judiciary stem from the frustration of individuals throughout 
Canada with the decisions made by the judiciary, which in recent 
years have become more appalling than anything I have ever seen. 
I would like to run through some of those cases as I have seen 
them and as I have experienced them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago Darren Ursel violently sexually assaulted a 
young lady in my riding.  We followed the case right through the 
courts.  Judge Harry Boyle decided that the penalty for violently 
sexually assaulting this young lady was a conditional sentence, 
that Mr. Ursel would serve no time in jail, that it was a matter 
of “go home, think about this and stay away from the bars”. 
There was no time in jail.  That judge set rape sentencing back 
25 to 30 years in this country.  There was basically no penalty. 
Our community had to fight and fight hard through appeal to get 
that guy two years.  He got two years and ended up serving 
virtually no time because the time from the issuance of the 
conditional sentence through to the appeal was considered in his 
sentence.  The guy walked within a couple of months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear of stupid decisions by judges like this, one could 
not expect me to come to the House of Commons and suggest that 
they deserve a raise.  I will go though a couple more cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Dennis Devitt sentenced convicted child molester William 
Gibson Brown to a two year conditional sentence and probation. He 
was convicted of two counts of sexually assaulting a minor. 
Devitt's reason for the sentence was that both the defence and 
the crown agreed that a conditional sentence of two years would 
suffice.  Is there any reason for that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow we will be debating all day in the House to try to get 
a national sex offender registry throughout Canada.  This guy 
sexually assaulted a minor on two counts and was given a 
conditional sentence.  He did not serve a day in jail.  Yet the 
government asks me to give a raise to a judge.  There is not a 
hope in blazes that I will do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not frustrating enough, let us talk about Dean James 
Bauder of Manitoba, who had his nine month prison sentence 
overturned by a Manitoba court.  Bauder was convicted of sexually 
assaulting a young girl who was his children's babysitter.  He 
sexually assaulted her for a period of time when she was 12 and 
then 13 years old.  The judge, Justice Kerr Twaddle, justified 
the sentence and described the 12 year old as a willing 
participant. A judge sat on the bench and said that this child 
was a willing participant with an adult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the government comes in here and wants me to stand up to 
give judges a raise.  These are not all federal court judges, but 
they are judges, and the image the judiciary is getting in this 
country is really bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been doing a lot of work on the issue of drugs in our 
country, so I get reports of sentences and convictions of 
individuals.  I have them here, as a matter of fact.  They are 
very interesting.  When one looks at them, one wonders what goes 
on in our courtrooms and why drugs are pushed so much by 
individuals and the profit is so high.  I just want to tell the 
House about a couple of decisions that were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A guy was caught with $302,000 worth of drugs, which were 
seized.  He was on welfare at the time.  A judge gave him a 60 
day intermittent sentence on weekends.  Now there was a penalty: 
he had to go to jail on the weekends for the possession of 
$300,000 worth of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In and of itself, one might say that is all right because the 
guy was caught for the first time.  Was it the first time?  Let 
us look at him.  I have here four pages of this guy's 
convictions.  In Calgary, Alberta, he got probation from a judge 
for break and enter, and probation for a second break and enter. 
A few months later he got 18 months for another break and enter. 
He got out of there and was convicted on another break and enter. 
Did the judge give him more time?  No.  The judge suspended his 
sentence and gave him probation again.  Two months after that he 
was convicted of another break and enter.  He got two years and 
was surprised, because he had not been penalized a heck of a lot. 
That was escalating things, that time by a good judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After that he is convicted of break and enter five times.  Those 
are either withdrawn or concurrent.  When he got out of prison on 
parole he was on probation and what did he do?  Breach of 
probation.  What happened?  Nothing.  The judge probably thought 
it was possible to rehabilitate him at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June of the following year he was released on mandatory 
supervision.  He lasted until August when he was recommitted. In 
September he was convicted of break and enter and his sentence 
was 18 months consecutive, which was actually no problem for this 
guy because they let him out very quickly and he was convicted of 
break and enter again.  Then he was caught with stolen property 
and the charges were withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He moved to Winnipeg and was charged with break and enter twice. 
There was a stay of proceedings and he was sentenced to mandatory 
supervision.  A couple of months later there was a break and 
enter, then break and enter, theft, break and enter, theft, times 
five.  This was a nice guy we had going there.  He got a little 
worse.  He moved to Edmonton and was committed for three months 
for theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, this fellow had a string of convictions and the 
judges were not doing this as a deterrent.  These judges were 
looking at him and saying “poor boy”.  They gave him a little 
bit here, a little bit there and nothing here, the poor boy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need some corrective action.  Where are the judges?

</I></B></P><P align=left>He has piles of cases for stolen property, drugs, forged 
documents, using stolen credit cards, mischief, assault, 
trafficking and stolen weapons.  It goes on and on.  I could 
spend all week talking about these guys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that these individuals are going into our 
courtrooms and the judges are treating the cases like 
misdemeanours.  Yet, the judges say they are doing a pretty good 
job and that they want a raise.  I have the greatest of 
difficulty, having lost confidence in many of the decisions that 
happen in courtrooms, standing here and say it is justified.  It 
is not justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more cases across the country where people have lost 
confidence in the system than I could name.  I went to my office 
a few minutes ago and asked the staff to pull me up a few 
decisions by the judiciary.  A Quebec judge decided Friday to end 
the trial of the parents accused of letting their baby starve to 
death.  He cited the 18 month gap between the incident and the 
couple's arrest, so they walked.  A child was starved to death 
and nothing happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how we have come to this.  I believe however that 
the legal industry, which was once our justice system, has now 
lost sight of the common sense of the common law and spends more 
of its time on the technicalities of the law.  That is wrong.  I 
have had victims come to my office.  They have said that they 
were victims, that they did not matter and that when they went 
into the courtrooms they saw bad decisions.  They said there was 
no help for them and that nothing could be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes help does come.  There is a great movement in the 
country today to try to get the judiciary to smarten up and 
finally make some decent decisions.  Once in a while it does but 
it has been a long time in coming.  Before one ounce of money 
goes on the paycheque, I want to see some accountability and 
responsibility picked up by the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a meeting with a victim last Thursday in my office in 
British Columbia.  A judge in British Columbia convicted an 
individual of murder.  He was in the car when another guy blew a 
lady away.  He shot her in the head.  He was sentenced in 
December, I believe, for murder.  He appealed it.  What did the 
judge do?  He said “Why keep the guy in jail.  We do not want to 
corrupt him”.  So he let him out.  It was one of the rare 
situations where a person was convicted of murder and a couple of 
months later, because a lawyer applied for an appeal, the court 
let him out pending the appeal.  That judge showed a great 
disrespect for the crime of murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just me saying that.  All the Liberals are listening, 
as we can see.  It is like pounding on deaf ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Collenette:</B>  Say something intelligent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  The minister wants me to say something 
intelligent.  It is very interesting that he says that.  I know 
every one of the victims whom I talked about.  It is kind of sad 
that what I have been saying is considered unintelligent.  I 
guess that is just where the government comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have a concern about the judiciary, we speak about it in 
the House of Commons and bring comments of victims of crime to 
its attention. If the government disagrees with it, then it is 
unintelligent. 
I will make sure that the comment of the minister is well known 
across the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government thinks that just because there are lawyers and 
judges in courtrooms today that everything is A-OK and the system 
works.  In many cases the system is not working.  One wonders why 
people continue to push drugs.  I have and do talk to pushers. 
One of the reasons they do it is because there is no penalty for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently read about the guy who was caught with about $300,000 
worth of drugs.  His penalty was maybe a fine or maybe a 
conditional sentence.  There was virtually no penalty.  What is 
the deterrent for these individuals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  That is not on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  A member has asked me to get back to the 
subject.  The subject is that judges stand to get a raise in pay 
from this legislation.  I suggest to members opposite that many 
people do not think it is a good idea.  They do not have the 
confidence in the judiciary to allow for a raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  That is rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  It is true.  Time and time again we find 
that when we issue these kinds of raises people ask whether they 
deserve it.  It is the same for members of parliament.  When 
raises come up for members of parliament people say that they 
just do not deserve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that I can come into the House, knowing the 
system as well as I do as far as victims go and being in 
courtrooms, and listen to that kind of foolish remark from the 
other side.  I find it interesting that once again it really does 
not matter in the House how bad things are.  As long as it is a 
majority government it is A-OK in the courtroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again victims are being revictimized the moment 
they get into the courtroom.  I do not think there is a way in 
blazes that we could ever justify an increase, although the 
majority government would give it to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I just want to express my profound disappointment in 
many of the stupid, irresponsible decisions that judges have made 
in our courtrooms.  I will continue to take every opportunity to 
address that issue as I stand here.  I thank the minister for his 
comment and will make sure that the people I deal with truly 
understand how abrasive a minister of the crown can be toward 
victims.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to make the observation 
that I appreciate that the member who just spoke has reservations 
about how efficiently the court system operates.  He certainly, 
as we all have done, encountered occasions when he has felt that 
judges have ruled in ways in which we might not agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My problem though is that he fails to appreciate that the 
courts, like our democracy, are not perfect.  They make mistakes 
just as parliamentarians make mistakes.  However, the very basis 
of our belief in the rule of law is our faith that the court 
system and the judges in that court system will exercise their 
judgments without interference, will exercise those judgments 
impartially.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister said, when she made the opening remarks for this 
legislation, the whole point of this legislation that we have 
before the House, Bill C-12, is to provide a salary regime for 
the judges, which once provided for, ends the kind of 
interference or pressure that might be put on the judges 
politically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important principle.  This separation of the 
courts and the government is absolutely vital.  I find it a 
little bit discouraging to hear the member take what in fact is a 
fundamental principle in the separation of powers in our society 
and turn it into a dissertation about his disenchantment with the 
rulings of various judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, it is true that judges are fallible.  Laws are 
fallible.  Members of parliament are fallible.  However, the one 
thing we must protect, and this legislation does that, is we must 
protect the impartiality of the system, be it the House of 
Commons with its privileges or the courts with their separation 
from the government.  I just wanted to say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess one could say that 
this legislation is objective and it does make that separation. 
However, the fact is that if a person in Canada wants to register 
his or her complaints and concerns on behalf of victims of crime, 
the person has to do it at an appropriate time.  I choose the 
debate on judicial salaries to introduce that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heaven forbid if the Liberals ever brought legislation in the 
House to clean up the mess in those courtrooms, like the lengthy 
delays, the deliberate delays, the judge picking that goes on and 
the inappropriate stoppages of court cases.  Heaven forbid if 
they ever brought that in here but they will not.  That is the 
difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to address these kind of issues and these 
inappropriate decisions, then we have to take every opportunity 
to do it.  I choose to do it now.  That is my right and my 
privilege and I am damn well going to do it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
want to prolong the debate needlessly, but I just realized that 
what the member was saying could be very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand his wanting to speak at the appropriate time, which 
happens only very infrequently.  However I do not think it 
appropriate for him to use his right to speak today to put our 
justice system on trial.  He could talk about salary and about 
how the justice system could be improved.  How does the 
government expect to attract qualified people if it does not make 
enough money available to pay judges well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with what the member is saying, but we must also 
remember that while improvements are necessary, we must let 
ability find expression as well.  I believe that a salary must 
befit a judge of the supreme court, all judges of the supreme 
court, not only the chief justice, and all the judges of the 
federal court and the judges of the court of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports this argument, because it follows 
from the ability of our judicial system.  Yes, partisan 
appointments are made.  Yes, it is good to bring this sort of 
thing out, but today we should concentrate on this particular 
fact.  I think judges' ability is related to salary, and the 
member should answer this question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I happen to think 
performance is related to remuneration.  In a country like ours 
one does not issue incomes or remuneration without having some 
accountability and some performance associated with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case we are talking about remuneration of judges.  I 
choose to talk about performance in conjunction with remuneration 
of judges.  I think it is appropriate as do a lot of people with 
and for whom I work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was precisely the point.  The 
problem is that the member is mixing performance with 
remuneration, and it is precisely that kind of interference with 
the courts that the bill is designed to avoid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this remuneration is described in an act of this 
parliament.  It is to take it out of the hands of government.  It 
is to take it away from this idea that if one does not perform as 
I suggest, as I the government want or as a member of parliament 
wants, we will change the remuneration.  We will lower it.  That 
is precisely what we have to avoid and what we have to protect if 
we want to have the kind of arm's length judiciary that this 
democracy needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, Mr. Speaker, that member is on another planet in comparison 
to this member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the problem is that there 
is no separation.  Judges are appointed for life by the political 
party that is in power.  It happens to be the Liberals for the 
third successive time so we have a Liberal judiciary.  That is 
why it is not separate.  Politics are up to their ears in the 
judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Nonsense.  That's why they are appointed 
for life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  He says that is nonsense.  Can anyone 
believe that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Many people involved in the Liberal 
Party over there, as lawyers, have moved up into the judiciary. 
The decisions in many cases are Liberalized decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is totally separate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  It is not separate at all.  The 
government attaches a very close relationship between politics 
and decisions in the judiciary.  I am not telling any secrets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, so much for the 
independence of judges.  I want to put on the record that this 
member is not a lawyer.  This member does believe that there are 
reforms that can be done to our judiciary but this member also 
believes that politics, the judges and the courts should be as 
separated as much as humanly possible, and that is precisely what 
the bill is designed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, he actually thinks that 
politics and the judiciary are separate from a party that 
appoints judges from lawyers who have been with the Liberal 
Party, that appoint parole boards, immigration boards, refugee 
boards and harbour boards.  I cannot believe that anybody on that 
side would think there is a separation between politics and the 
judiciary.  That is just not the case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I certainly hesitate to bring this exciting exchange of opinions 
to an end, but perhaps those two members will be able to engage 
themselves fruitfully in some other context without the benefit 
of an audience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few remarks to make before we send the bill off to 
committee, as I think we should probably do with some 
expeditiousness.  It is something that had progressed quite far, 
if I understand correctly, in the last parliament and there does 
not seem to be a great need to beat it to death in this one, 
particularly at second reading.  If there are amendments to be 
suggested or made, or if further discussion is needed on the 
details of the bill, it seems to me that is something that can be 
done in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few remarks would nevertheless be in order.  In the context of 
our overall opposition to the bill, the NDP does see some merit 
in some aspects of the bill, particularly those aspects that have 
to do with the creation of unified family courts and justices to 
deal with them, as well as the division of annuities, which is 
also found to be a positive element.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the major thrust of the bill, which is where we have 
some reservations, is to provide judges with big raises.  It is 
not that judges should not be well paid.  I think most Canadians 
would contend that they are well paid.  It is a question of 
whether they should be paid even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have noticed that one can never separate out discussions about 
pay raises, not just with respect to judges' pay raises but also 
with respect to remuneration for MPs and various other categories 
of people, from the context.  The context in which the NDP 
operates with respect to the bill is the way in which so many 
other aspects of our justice system are being starved for money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a bill before us that gives an 11.2% increase to people 
who are already making well over $120,000 or $130,000 a year when 
there are so many other people within the justice system, equally 
important to its proper functioning, who are not getting this 
kind of increase and are not making that kind of money. They may 
also have to deal with many of the stresses and strains that come 
from years of cutbacks to the justice system.  When these raises 
come in that context, it is a little hard for us to stand up and 
say amen to this without taking the opportunity to bring forward 
some of these other concerns which I think are quite legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many would contend that there is a crisis in the justice system 
and that if money can be found to increase the salaries of judges 
then money should also be found to address some of the other very 
serious problems that exist within the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many provinces crown attorneys do not have sufficient 
resources to prosecute the crimes that come before them.  Surely 
that should be a priority if we are concerned about justice.  In 
many parts of the country legal aid lawyers do not have 
sufficient resources to ensure proper fundamental freedoms are 
met and that trials are done in a proper way.  That results in 
many injustices not only for the accused but also for the victims 
and those involved in the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anything that tends to increase and aggravate delays within the 
justice system is a problem.  Certainly a lack of resources 
contributes to a lot of the delays that people experience.  We 
are saying that if there are resources to deal with pay raises 
for judges then why are there not resources to deal with these 
other problems in the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just some opening remarks.  I look forward to a 
further study of the bill when it gets to committee.  I must say 
though that I found the exchange between the Alliance member and 
the Liberal member somewhat interesting.  I think the Liberal 
member makes a point when he says that we would not want a 
situation in which judges felt they had to please politicians in 
order to maintain their remuneration or in order to be eligible 
for raises in the future.  I do not think that would be a good 
thing because that would imitate, to some degree but to a much 
lesser extent, the flaws of the American system where they elect 
their judges.  Here we would have judges answerable to people who 
were elected.  That would introduce an element of politics into 
it but it would be qualitatively different than the politics 
that are already in the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance member quite properly pointed out that judges tend 
to be appointed, not always but in many cases, from the ranks of 
the ruling party.  If the same party is in power over many years, 
it tends to create a situation whereby people begin to see the 
judiciary as politicized in the sense of the appointment process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once people are appointed then presumably they have a great deal 
of independence and their appointments cannot be revoked. To the 
extent that good appointments are made, even if they be 
appointments from within the ruling party, the politics is 
removed from the system to a certain degree after the 
appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think people are fearful when they hear some of the things the 
Canadian Alliance member said.  He said that people would like 
the politics to stay throughout the judicial process and that 
there be some answering to the political process at certain 
stages or at some critical point in the life of a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I think it is quite legitimate for Canadians, 
whether they be Alliance members of parliament or others, to be 
critical of decisions that judges make.  I do not think that 
there is anything wrong with that.  Judges are not beyond 
criticism or above criticism.  I think all Canadians from time to 
time, including myself, are somewhat bewildered sometimes by the 
judgments some judges make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I do not think that is a matter that should effect a 
debate on how to compensate judges or remunerate judges.  It may 
be an opportunity for somebody to get up and get a few things off 
their chest.  That is okay.  That is what parliament is about and 
that is the context in which to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance member was quite within his rights to use a bill on 
judges to talk about what he did not like about judges or what he 
did not like about certain decisions or pattern of decisions that 
judges make.  There is no problem there.  To suggest a connection 
between meeting a certain political criterion and remuneration I 
would think would be something that everyone, and perhaps even 
the Alliance member himself, would want to reject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting that the bill responds to a recommendation 
that the remuneration of judges be taken out of the political 
context altogether and that parliament from here on in accept 
uncritically or without amendment the recommendations made by the 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the extent that the Alliance finds itself against this there 
is a certain irony.  If I have heard correctly over the years, 
this is the very thing it has advocated for members of 
parliament.  Those members have said that we have to take the 
politics out of the determination of the salaries of members of 
parliament: take it away from members of parliament, give it to 
an independent commission and be prepared to accept the 
recommendations of that commission.  If I am being unfair to what 
they have said over the years I hope somebody will correct me, 
but it seems to me that is what I have heard many times, that 
this is something that should be decided independently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does just that with respect to judges.  Either we have 
some inconsistency in principle with respect to how we allocate 
or set up independent commissions to make these kinds of 
judgments or we have an interesting variety of opinions on the 
matter as we sometimes get from members of the Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It struck me as ironic that this issue should be criticized. 
Would people suggest that it constantly be a decision of 
parliament to determine what judges are paid?  I have seen that 
for 20 years.  Every time the government feels we have to give 
judges a raise, we have a debate about judges and the same old 
speeches are trailed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the idea of giving it to an independent commission is 
not such a bad idea after all, but it does not mean that we have 
to agree necessarily with the way in which the government handles 
these particular recommendations.  For our part we feel that the 
government would be on a lot stronger ground if at the same time 
it was committed to addressing a lot of the other inadequacies in 
the justice system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the comments of my friend from the NDP were very 
good comments.  There are a couple of matters I want to point out 
to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned something about it being easy to criticize the 
courts in Canada.  I know it is easy to criticize an umpire or a 
referee in a hockey game and to deal with that, but I can say as 
a practising lawyer myself that one has to be very careful about 
what one says about judges and their judgments.  It is far easier 
to say things in the House than it is outside the House, unless 
we want to find out what the rules are for contempt of court. I 
point that matter out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put something in perspective too.  Comments were made 
about the American system of justice.  I can think of a lot of 
great supreme court judges in the United States:  Justice Holmes, 
Justice Warren and Justice Marshall.  They were appointed but 
went through a very rigorous appointment process.  They have a 
lot of power like the judges in Canada.  The public there 
believes it has a right to know what agenda these people are 
bringing to the courts.  This is vetted and is publicly dealt 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person who I personally and politically had a lot of 
admiration for during the Reagan era was Robert Bork.  He was 
turned down in that process.  That would probably make my NDP 
friends happy.  It did not make me happy but it showed that the 
system worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our system we do not get any scrutiny on that.  Basically, my 
own reading of how one gets to be a judge on the Supreme Court of 
Canada is to be a good donator.  A person who earns $110,000 a 
year is going to have a lot better chance of getting into our 
Supreme Court of Canada or our courts of appeal.  Another thing 
would be to be a good fundraiser.  That means being a lawyer, but 
if someone has one of those criteria and is with the right party, 
chances are pretty good he or she will be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not exactly sure the public or anyone else would say that 
is the proper way of determining who should be in the courts.  I 
want to put a few of those points in perspective.  There have 
been a lot of excellent judges on the supreme court of the United 
States over the years.  We can criticize that system all we want, 
but I think the level of judicial decision making that has come 
out of the U.S. supreme court generally has been far superior to 
our system here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to perhaps get my learned colleague's reaction to these 
comments.  I do not think we are advocating electing Supreme 
Court of Canada judges but we are talking about having a good 
independent system in place to make sure we get the very best men 
and women as our judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to 
extend my congratulations to the member for Prince Albert.  I 
believe this is his first parliament.  Of course, he has a very 
distinguished pedigree in terms of the constituency but I do not 
know about the party.  Members have represented Prince Albert in 
the past, some from my party and also a couple prime ministers, I 
believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, the member makes a good point.  It is certainly 
not a point that I was wanting to disagree with.  I just did not 
talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is asking me what I think about the view that perhaps we 
should have a way of appointing our supreme court which gives 
Canadians more of an opportunity through the appropriate 
parliamentary committee to hear what they think.  This is not to 
politicize it or get them elected or anything like that, and not 
to uncritically imitate the American system necessarily, but 
something to take into account the fact that judges, since the 
inception of the charter, have a lot more say about a lot more 
things than they used to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps an appointment process that was created before the 
charter is not adequate to that task.  I am sure that is a matter 
of debate within all political parties as we try to wrestle with 
the increased role of the judiciary in our society and what we 
welcome, what we have reservations about and what we should have 
concerns about as parliamentarians.  Some people have more 
concerns than others.  I think the point the member raises is a 
legitimate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to criticizing judges, I did not criticize any 
judges.  In fact, it is members of the hon. member's own party, 
some of whom have made a political career out of criticizing, not 
judges in the abstract, but specific judges and specific 
judgments.  I would hope he might share the advice he had for me 
in terms of contempt of court and exercising caution with respect 
to criticizing judges with some of his caucus members at some 
point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I recognize that the hon. member who just gave us his 
speech with regard to this particular bill is populist.  I 
recognize from the comments he made that he does not see the 
election of judges as the way he would go.  I happen to favour 
the idea of electing judges, but obviously it does not carry the 
day with all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He alluded in his comments to the idea that possibly the 
appointment process might need to be changed.  My question would 
be along the lines of what ways or suggestions he might propose 
for changing the appointment process.  I happen to like the idea 
of people being brought before committees, which are responsible 
in some way or degree for those particular departments, to face 
some sort of vetting process.  There was earlier discussion on 
this very matter in terms of the process that goes on south of 
the border, but certainly there are other ways it can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to mention in the question as well that the 
way I am familiar with the process working at least in my 
province, and I am sure it is not the only province that this is 
done for, is basically along the lines of political favours, 
whereby a group of cabinet lawyers or possibly, if there is not 
enough lawyers in the cabinet, the caucus lawyers in a particular 
party gather around and names of potential appointees are 
suggested.  They run the gauntlet.  During the process the 
lawyers in that particular governing party determine it by saying 
“Know him, know him, don't know him”.  If a person gets enough 
know hims and general favourable nods, the person gets the 
appointment.  If a person gets more do not know hims, where people 
say they know him but they do not happen to enjoy his particular 
political stripe, then he does not get appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous comment about people being good donators or good 
fundraisers does have validity in terms of how people get some of 
these things.  Does the member think that that process is a 
fairly accurate way of describing some of the ways in which 
people get chosen to be justices?  Does he think that there is 
some form or process that would be appropriate?  What does he 
particularly think about the idea of running appointees past a 
cabinet committee that is in the area of responsibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will take the member's 
word on it for that damning critique of the way the provincial 
government appoints judges in his province.  I would not want to 
dispute that.  Hopefully it is something the people of Alberta 
will take into account today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to the first part of his question or comment when he 
talked about the appointment process.  I seems to me that like so 
many other things around here everything is connected to 
everything else.  He suggested that possible appointees, or 
recommended appointees or candidates for appointment to the 
supreme court should be brought before the appropriate committee 
of the House of Commons for vetting, or for conversation, or for 
investigation or whatever.  To do that without parliamentary 
reform will not do the trick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American system works because the government does not 
control the committees.  The American system works because there 
is some chance that people who are of the same party as the 
appointer, the president, might not do what the president wants. 
There is a real process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem in Canada.  There are all kinds of things we 
cannot really reform unless we reform the House of Commons.  To 
just bring candidates for nomination to the supreme court before 
a committee that is run by Liberals for Liberals and have them 
rubber stamped in the way that so many other things are rubber 
stamped, what would that accomplish?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to be the counsel of despair but on the other hand 
we have a bigger job ahead of us than just putting them before a 
committee.  We have to change the committee and parliamentary 
culture in order to make it a meaningful event, otherwise it will 
be another charade like so many of the other things that happen 
around here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the words put forward by my colleague, the 
House leader for the New Democratic Party.  He has put forward a 
number of pearls of wisdom and some provocative issues that add 
to this debate.  This is a debate that could be very far reaching 
should we choose that route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 is a fairly focused piece of legislation when it comes 
to remuneration for judges.  It speaks to process and speaks of a 
committee that will and has made recommendations on the issue of 
remuneration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of important elements to this bill and 
members have discussed some in great detail, such as the 
shortcomings of judges, their decisions and the appointment 
process.  All of that is worthy of debate.  To quote my friend 
from Winnipeg—Transcona “parliament is certainly well healed, 
well versed for that to take place”.  Parle, meaning to speak, 
is what we are here to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular subject matter is one that has been very 
controversial for not only members of the House but for Canadians 
generally.  People are quite rightly concerned about the ever 
increasing, some would say ever expansive, role of judges in 
challenging laws.  The charter plays a great deal in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is specific concern about the resources to which 
individuals working in the justice system are sorely in need of 
support, whether it be legislative support or resource support. 
This is another huge expansive topic that we could speak to at 
this time.  This particular legislation is aimed at trying to 
make a distinct difference between the political process of 
appointment and process of remuneration, or the salary structure 
that is in place for judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party is supporting this bill.  We look forward 
to having it come before committee where some of the other issues 
that might stem from the bill can be looked at.  I have some 
limited experience in the judicial system, but for the most part, 
I believe the majority of judges in this country are hardworking. 
I believe they perform an incredibly important task.  Arguably, 
members of the judiciary, whether at the provincial court, or 
appeal court or supreme court level, have more individual 
discretion over a person's life than members of parliament or 
other officials in Canada.  They have incredible discretion in 
their hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party also believes in being responsible to 
taxpayers.  We support the government's acceptance of the 
recommendations which were made by the independent Judicial 
Compensation and Benefits Commission.  This is now entrenched by 
virtue of Bill C-12.  This is another important aspect of 
consideration when it comes to better pay for judges.  The 
compensation that is being put forward is coming about on the 
recommendation of an independent commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reading of this bill on February 21 set forward that 
the Judges Act will implement the government's response to 
recommendations made by the 1999 Judicial Compensation and 
Benefits Commission.  That came about historically as a result of 
a decision from the Supreme Court of Canada in 1997 that 
established new constitutional requirements for determining 
judicial compensation and requiring every Canadian jurisdiction 
to have an independent, objective and effective commission.  If 
there is to be credibility and accountability, it is extremely 
important that it is arm's length from government and that it 
looks at the issue of compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Delving into that further, it also amends the Judges Act to 
increase judicial salaries and allowances.  Let us be very clear 
about what the bill does. 
It raises judicial salaries.  It is intended quite clearly to 
improve the current judicial annuities scheme, to put in place a 
separate life insurance plan for federally appointed judges and 
to make other consequential amendments to the Judges Act and the 
Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act.  It is certainly well 
intended to give judges the security they need.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years there has been a lot of concern about criminal 
activities in the country.  That has led to much of the 
controversy and frustration on the part not only of victims but 
of those who work actively in the legal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the decisions we have seen judges make lead people to 
question whether the system is working.  However let us question 
the decisions rather than the personalities and the judges 
themselves.  Let us look at the decisions in isolation, based on 
the facts from which judges made those decisions.  If criticism 
is then merited, it is fair game.  There is a forum and a way to 
appeal.  There is also ample discussion in the general public 
about the wisdom of judges' decisions on occasion.  That is fair 
game.  Once again, that is healthy.  That is democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The separate and important issue is not to let that criticism 
and discussion permeate the issue of whether we should compensate 
judges fairly or whether we should look at their salaries as a 
separate issue from their performance on occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put it another way.  The issue of judges' salaries is 
important, but we must ensure judicial independence is always 
maintained, that judges are not tempted by any outside influence 
that could compromise any ruling from the bench.  What I am 
getting at quite clearly is that with some of the elements of 
organized crime in the country, and I hate to raise the spectre, 
there is the real possibility of bribery, judicial interference 
and temptation if our judges are not being compensated fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also put this into perspective in terms of salary ranges 
in Canada.  We must look at other functionaries and their pay 
scales, for example heads of corporations, doctors and athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly performance is one issue, but the function judges 
perform is also something we must take very seriously.  The 
performance a judge puts forward in his or her daily exercise is 
crucial to the preservation of justice.  It is an absolute 
cornerstone if the system is to function properly.  Judicial 
compensation and benefits very much preserve the independence of 
judges and their ability to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compensation commission is appointed for a four year term. 
Its mandate is to consider the compensation and benefits for 
judges and to make recommendations to government.  It does so 
every four years.  It reviews the situation and takes into 
consideration factors including the salaries relative to the role 
they perform.  It must report to government within a nine month 
period.  It talks of modernization and talks of keeping pace with 
other current pay scales.  It calls for setting a certain 
priority relative to other professions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer once again to the comments of my friend from 
Winnipeg—Transcona.  There is ample evidence that there are 
problems in our justice system with crown prosecutors, legal aid, 
lawyers, court officials and police, those who administer the day 
to day meting out of justice.  Those who are in the trenches, in 
the <I>MASH</I> unit of the judicial system, similarly must be 
compensated fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there is a methodology or a system in place where we 
could have some sort of association between reviewing judges and 
their pay scales and those of the functionaries that perform the 
very important day to day tasks before the judges which allow the 
judges to make their decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crown prosecutors and legal aid lawyers are under such terrible 
constraints of caseloads and backlogs that they are not able to 
put forward to a judge crucial information to enable him or her 
to make those decisions. 
Perhaps there is wisdom in broadening the discussion and perhaps 
even broadening the legislation at some point in the near future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning back to the commission itself, the commission makes a 
recommendation of a salary increase of 11.2%.  I note this is 
significantly less than the 26.3% increase proposed by the 
judiciary itself.  Clearly that would not be appropriate. Clearly 
we could not have judges themselves making recommendations on 
what their pay increase should be.  That would be akin to what we 
do as members of parliament, and we know how the public feels 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least the bill does not go down that road.  At least the bill 
respects the fact that there is a judicial committee, arm's 
length from government, that is making the recommendation.  Once 
again perhaps we in this place should be learning from that 
caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission's recommendations were based on research 
comparing judges' salaries to those of private sector lawyers.  I 
would suggest, and I challenge others to talk to some high 
ranking lawyers who work for big firms, that there are many who 
literally would be taking a pay cut if they were to take a 
judicial appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to put the cream of the crop on the bench, if we want 
the very best litigators and lawyers to be sitting on the bench 
making these crucial decisions, we must be prepared to compensate 
them fairly, and in some cases comparable to what they could make 
in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The salary performances and bonuses of senior federal deputy 
ministers, for example, also bear scrutiny and comparison.  The 
importance of salary and benefits in attracting outstanding 
candidates to the bench cannot be understated.  Quality is an 
absolute necessity.  It is too important not to strive to have 
the best of the best on the bench.  What an important function it 
is that judges perform.  I reflect on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Judges Act will also officially establish the compensation 
committee for the long term.  It will be required, as I stated 
before, to convene every four years, make recommendations and 
come forward with those recommendations nine months after they 
have commenced.  Its mandate is to inquire into the adequacy of 
judicial compensation and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee's mandate consists of three important 
considerations:  the economic conditions of the country, cost of 
living, overall economic position of the federal government 
vis-à-vis budget surpluses, et cetera; the financial security of 
the judiciary to ensure judicial independence; and the need to 
attract outstanding candidates.  Those are the basic criteria for 
which the committee would meet.  They are certainly important 
criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendations, I think it also bears noting, are not 
binding, but the supreme court decision requires that the 
government publicly justify any decision of acceptance or 
rejection of the recommendations.  This response is reviewable in 
the court and must meet the legal standard of simple rationality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A common sense strain runs through the commission and the 
government's use of the information it provides.  It would be 
measured by the reasons and evidence offered in support of the 
government's decision.  There are some checks and balances within 
the bill that are laudable and that meet the objectives it seeks 
to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The salary regime, the pressures and independence are also very 
important.  The pressures that judges feel is also a 
consideration when they decide whether they would accept an 
appointment.  We have talked a bit about the appointment process 
but salary is certainly a factor.  Financial security is 
certainly a factor for an individual to accept an appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put on the record the yearly salary of the 
judges of the Supreme Court of Canada.  The basic salary for 
chief justices is $230,000.  The puisne judges make $213,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The yearly salaries of the federal court judges are as follows: 
the chief justice makes $196,000; 10 other judges of the Federal 
Court of Appeal make $179,000; the associate chief justice of the 
federal court makes $196,000; and judges in the trial division 
make $179,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current salaries in accordance with section 11 of the act 
and the adjustments in section 25 are also as follows:  the Tax 
Court of Canada chief judge makes $196,000; the associate chief 
judge similarly makes $196,000; and other judges in the tax court 
make $179,000.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The yearly salaries in the provincial court of the province of 
Nova Scotia are as follows:  the chief justice, $196,000 and the 
court of appeal judges, $179,000.  I am putting these salaries on 
record because it is important that we keep the figures in mind 
when we look at salaries of other occupations, other heads of 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are undeniably large numbers for the average Canadian to 
consider.  They are significant and yet appropriate rates of pay 
must be put in place if we are expected to get the highest 
quality of individual into those jobs.  Judges are undeniably the 
cornerstone of democracy and defenders of fundamental rights from 
the bench.  If they are to have that respect, ability and 
prestige they must be remunerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a good one.  We may need to have a look at some of 
the specifics and potentially a look at the tie-in to the 
shortfall in other areas of our judicial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The priorizing of this bill in returning to parliament is one we 
might question.  However I suspect it is because there will be 
speedy passage.  One would hope that the bill will go to 
committee and will be dealt with quite quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is something that is necessary to get in place quickly. 
If there is any anxiety or pressure brought to bear by delaying 
Bill C-12, it will not be healthy for our current judicial 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also reason on occasion to recite some of the atrocious 
and ridiculous decisions that have come out of the courts, but I 
would not suggest there is merit in doing that in the context of 
this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point is that there are ways to correct some of the 
shortcomings.  There are ways to approach the remuneration of 
judges.  We can review some of the shortcomings.  We can cite 
chapter and verse some of the decisions we take great umbrage 
with, great outrage as to what the findings might have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can then question the quality of the judiciary.  We can try 
to make the argument that we should not reward judges by 
increasing their salaries based on perceived performance, or lack 
thereof in certain instances, and that therefore judges should 
not get a raise.  That would be the rationale in simple terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Or, we can look at it in terms of how we make sure it does not 
happen with greater frequency, that we do not continue to have 
substandard individuals in positions on the bench where they 
would make poor decisions.  How do we attract the very best?  How 
do we ensure we will have individuals who will let their names 
stand and who will come forward to serve, which is a great 
privilege to do in that capacity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we do that?  We compensate them fairly.  We ensure that 
they will be given salaries on par with other important positions 
in society and that they will be given the financial respect they 
deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most judges have served with great distinction under difficult 
circumstances and are forced to make real gut wrenching decisions 
on a regular basis.  Quite clearly they struggle with those 
decisions.  They do not always get it right.  I am not here to 
defend the judiciary at great length.  I suggest the system 
itself, although not perfect, is the best in the free world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must clearly ensure that we attract those with the greatest 
ability.  On the whole judges perform their task quite 
adequately.  The legislation has led to an interesting debate of 
the various philosophies of how the judiciary and the appointment 
process and the politicization of it should work.  However Bill 
C-12 is exactly what we need in attempting to distance politics 
from remuneration.  The appointment process is something we 
should look at next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party will be supporting it.  We look forward 
to having it at committee where we can discuss it further.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member from Nova Scotia touched on a number of 
areas that I think are of interest here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the comments was in regard to the question of bribery.  I 
would have thought that for most men and women in law school who 
were told that some day they would have the privilege of serving 
on a court of appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada the first 
thing that would come to mind would be service above money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it seems to me that the need to have this vetting 
process is very important in order to make sure that the people 
we are appointing to the courts are people who we are satisfied 
have high levels of integrity and personal behaviour.  That is 
something I think this process could identify.  Even if they have 
different ideologies from mine, I can respect that they are 
honest people and of good integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually if money ensured high levels of integrity in our world, 
Hollywood would be the best place in the world to go to find 
that.  The sports world would be another area.  Presumably the 
people who are getting the most money would be the people who 
would conduct themselves with the highest standards of integrity. 
I am not exactly sure the money issue is as big as people make it 
out to be.  I am willing to guess that $190,000 a year would put 
someone in the top 1% in the country.  In some provinces it would 
be one-tenth of 1%.  In Saskatchewan there are not many people 
who make $190,000 a year, and I am sure that in the province of 
Nova Scotia they are few and far between as well.  In Toronto or 
Calgary it may be a different situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another area I am concerned about, and I raise it for 
my learned colleague from Nova Scotia.  It is the vast disparity 
in lawyers' incomes in this country.  I practised law in 
Saskatchewan for 25 years and I looked in envy at the income 
levels of lawyers in Toronto and Calgary.  There are big 
differences. Maybe in a place like Toronto, where a $500,000 a 
year income level is not unusual for skilled lawyers, there may 
be a problem attracting people, but in Saskatchewan there would 
be no shortage of competent lawyers available for judicial 
appointments at a salary of $190,000.  They are competent people 
and the lineup would be a long one.  I am not exactly sure that 
the bill addresses that sort of concern about the vast disparity 
in incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot explain this vast disparity in incomes in these 
regions.  I know that Alberta and Ontario are like the beacons on 
the hill in this country.  They have booming, growing, prosperous 
provinces that attract thousands of people and lawyers from other 
regions of the country in massive numbers, and they do very well 
economically.  However, I am not from one of those areas.  I am 
from one of those areas where we have had a different philosophy 
and a different way of doing things and our standard of living 
and our incomes are much lower.  Maybe the member from Nova 
Scotia could address this concern.  Maybe we need some 
flexibility in our levels of remuneration based on the region of 
the country one comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my learned friend 
for the comments.  He raises a number of interesting points.  I 
am not going to stand before the House and debate the merits of 
or try to in any way defend some of the inflated salaries of 
certain professions.  I am a huge sports fan, Mr. Speaker, as I 
know you are, and as are many members of the House, but I would 
never try to justify the merits of paying an athlete literally 
hundreds of millions of dollars on occasion to sign long term 
contracts versus the paying for the performance of a researcher 
who is trying to find the cure for cancer or of an individual who 
is volunteering to go into a war torn area and put his life at 
risk to try to aid others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These discrepancies and anomalies in certain professions and in 
the remuneration that people receive are in many ways cannon 
fodder for debate and criticism, but there is no way to justify 
or even begin to reconcile the remuneration and the salaries that 
are put in place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I come from a region not unlike the hon. 
member's when it comes to the salaries that a person would 
command in our profession as a lawyer or in other professions. 
There are certainly cost of living considerations when one looks 
at other regions of the country.  Calgary, Toronto and Montreal 
are perhaps the most obvious that come to mind when one considers 
the salaries in some regions versus others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether that would merit an examination of regional bonuses when 
it comes to judges or judicial appointments and differences in 
the judicial salaries of his province of Saskatchewan or my own 
of Nova Scotia vis-à-vis Ontario, I would suggest that it might 
cause more consternation and more difficulty than it would 
resolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I particularly agree that we should be examining 
how to somehow perhaps skew the compensation based on the salary 
levels of various provinces, although it does raise problems. Are 
we going to be drawing the very best from Ontario if we cannot 
offer them a salary in the range which they command in their 
profession currently?  It is a difficulty that I guess can only 
be resolved when one can peer into the heart and soul of a person 
who wants to serve in that capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest, and I think the hon. member would be quick to 
agree, that anyone in the legal profession who has practised law 
as long as he has and is now serving his country with distinction 
in the House of Commons would consider it a great honour to be 
appointed to a judgeship at any level.  That is part of the 
individual personal decision that one has to make, along with 
remuneration, job satisfaction and any number of other listed 
factors that come into play when a person makes a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raises a number of interesting points.  I look 
forward to debating this issue further in committee and I thank 
him again for his comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I realize that the hon. member of course was previously, 
and I imagine still is, a lawyer himself, so he speaks with some 
level of knowledge about this, which many others in the country 
would not have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him, as I asked the colleague from the New 
Democratic Party who spoke before him, about what he feels might 
be a way to improve the appointment process.  In his speech he 
talked a great deal about the compensation judges should be given 
for the type of job they do.  I can appreciate some of the 
arguments made in that respect, but I know there are abuses in 
the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will relate to him one example that I am aware of in Calgary, 
whereby a particular firm was given the nod, as it were, in terms 
of it being the firm's time to put forward one of its people for 
a judgeship.  Officially it is supposed to be an open process. 
What happened was that someone who did wills and estates in a 
particular firm—and I do not want to name that particular firm 
even though I could here in the House—and who was not a 
particularly accomplished lawyer sent in an application.  When 
the government received it, it took that application to be the 
application that the firm in a sense had anointed as its 
application and that person was appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on, two individuals, one of them representing the 
government, happened to meet on an elevator.  The one 
representing the government said to a senior partner with the law 
firm that he hoped everything had worked out okay, that the 
government had received the firm's appointment and everything was 
taken care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senior partner said that the firm's selection had not yet 
been made.  The government official said that of course the firm 
had made its selection, that the government had the piece of 
paper, and he asked if that was not what it was supposed to get. 
The official said he thought that was what the firm wanted.  The 
lawyer then replied that he did not even know who the individual 
was and that he would look it up on the letterhead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had to look at a list of about 200 lawyers and finally found 
the lawyer who had been struggling in wills and estates.  He then 
realized that someone had openly sent in a bid and had been given 
the judgeship.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell the story because I know there have been problems.  I 
know that people have been appointed to these positions— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry.  I was trying to catch 
the eye of the hon. member.  Time is running very short in the 
question and comment period.  There will only be one minute for 
reply, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  I am sorry, Mr. Speaker.  Basically the 
question was this:  Does the member have suggestions for 
improving the selection process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question and I agree that there are some shortcomings in 
the way the system currently works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I think a system may someday evolve where we will 
have judges who deal with specific types of law.  I believe that 
the law in this country is becoming so complex there may be a 
need to have a criminal bench, as we currently have a tax court. 
There may be a need to specify that a certain individual will 
only hear employment law.  There may be a need to diversify the 
bench in such a way that we may have to shrink the pool for the 
types of selections we are making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trying to get politics out of this is increasingly difficult. 
It is like trying to pour rum in milk and then somehow trying to 
siphon it out.  It is a very difficult thing to do.  The politics 
of it will be there, but if it is based on the competence, the 
performance and the ability of the individual, then that is 
certainly the base we will continually strive for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having the provinces further involved and having them put 
forward lists of competent individuals who have been vetted is an 
idea worth examining.  The possibility of having potential judges 
come before committees is one idea I would not rule out. However, 
I believe the final selection process is always going to be the 
privilege of the crown and that is something we may have to 
examine in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in this context I would like to ask a rhetorical 
question:  in a democratic society, who should ultimately have 
the final political power and authority to make decisions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 Canada made a major change.  Up to that time we believed 
in the principle of the supremacy of parliament.  We believed 
that the 301 men and women who were elected to parliament every 
four or five years would ultimately have the final say on our 
laws in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 we changed that.  We brought in a constitution that 
included a charter of rights.  The charter basically and 
essentially transferred the ultimate power and authority to our 
judges.  That is like giving the referee in a hockey game the 
rule book and telling him that if he does not like the rules he 
can change them as he goes along; it is like giving the umpire at 
a baseball game the same kind of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three premiers, all lawyers at that time and two of them Rhodes 
scholars, Mr. Blakeney, Mr. Lyon and Mr. Lougheed, saw great 
danger in this change.  As a condition of adopting both 
constitutional changes, they insisted that we have a safeguard in 
our constitution.  That safeguard was the notwithstanding clause. 
The notwithstanding clause was there to give parliament the final 
say on our lawmaking abilities in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the federal government's unwillingness to 
exercise the notwithstanding clause, we have had a Supreme Court 
of Canada that has made some fairly major astounding decisions in 
our times, which have had tremendous fiscal impacts on Canada.  I 
am talking about things that could have caught the Minister of 
Finance totally off guard, costing $5 billion, $6 billion or $7 
billion a crack.  Its decisions have had major economic and 
social consequences.  I could mention specific cases but I do not 
think there is much merit in that.  I will, however, mention the 
Singh decision, which has had a radical impact on immigration law 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am getting at is that if we are going to have this system 
in the future, we need a strong independent system for appointing 
people and we have to make sure that the people who are appointed 
are people with very high standards of integrity and honesty. 
That is very important.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already talked about some of the appointment criteria. I 
can give an example from my home province.  It is well known 
among lawyers that one of the larger law firms had a lawyer in 
its employ that it did not really want or like, and since it was 
its turn to send in a name, as the member from Calgary mentioned, 
it sent in that lawyer's name.  Unfortunately the public had to 
live with that judge for 20 years and with his decisions.  There 
are a lot of inadequacies in the appointment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of salary and benefits, I want to emphasize the point 
that service above monetary rewards should be the compelling 
reason to serve on a court of appeal or the Supreme Court of 
Canada.  I know many noble and honourable lawyers who would find 
it a great privilege to be asked to serve on the Supreme Court of 
Canada.  I have often wondered why we have to go around seeking 
applications from people.  Why we do not seek out these folks and 
make sure that we get the very best on our Supreme Court of 
Canada?  If we have a Gretzky equivalent in the legal community, 
why are we not seeking that person's service on our Supreme Court 
of Canada?  I do not think money would really be a major problem 
with these people.  They would see it as a great privilege to 
serve on the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a bit concerned that the court will ultimately have the 
power to decide whether this independent committee is independent 
enough.  If it finds that it is not independent enough, we will 
receive some court decisions that sort of imply or suggest that 
the court would ultimately have the power to decide what are fair 
enumerations and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is very important to note is that when the public interest 
cries out for action, it is parliament that has the final say on 
what our laws should be not the judges.  If I go back to how I 
would like to see things operate and I would use the analogy of a 
hockey game.  The league owners and teams decide on the rules. 
They create a rule book that they give to judges, who are called 
referees and officials, and they would decide off sides and 
whether its a goal and so on but they do not make the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a very difficult bind because we have given tremendous 
power to a handful of people at the court level.  I wonder where 
this mentality came from in 1992.  It seems to me that implicit 
in the whole argument of shifting from the supremacy of 
parliament to the supremacy of the Supreme Court of Canada was 
that there was something dangerous about democracy.  It implies 
that to elect men and women to our system of government and have 
them make decisions is dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sort of belief implies that because a person has spent a 
lot of years as a lawyer and a lot of years doing partisan things 
for his or her political party, and fundraising seems to be one 
of the things that lawyers are really good at in the partisan 
sense, that this somehow qualifies the person as an elite. It 
further implies that the elite know better than the democratic 
will of the people and that nine or ten people should have the 
final wisdom on decisions on public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that whole notion very disturbing.  Some people would 
suggest that if we took that far enough it would get us into an 
authoritarian type system.  It would perhaps be a more benevolent 
type of dictatorship than that of other countries.  However these 
folks are not elected.  They do not have to face the media scrums 
after a day in parliament.  They do not have to come into 
parliament and be accountable for their actions and decisions. 
They are pretty immune from it. 
The finance minister has to determine how he pays for their 
decisions and other ministers have to determine how to deal with 
the economic and social impact of the decisions.  A lot of times 
it is like trying to drive a square peg into a round hole.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be far better if those decisions were made by 
our elected people.  We have a lot problems with our elected 
system but, as Sir Winston Churchill said many years ago, it is a 
terrible system of government but it is better than all other 
forms of government invented by now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested to hear what other parliamentarians think 
about the mentality behind the transfer of democratic power from 
our elected men and women to an appointed group of eight or nine 
people.  Implicit in that appointment is that they are smarter 
and wiser than the public's will, as expressed through our 
election process, and that they are a better judge of deciding 
what is good for society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own view is that it is a liberal value.  During the election 
we were going to debate values, but one of the legacies of 
liberalism is that it is better to have elites make the decisions 
for people.  It is dangerous for people to make decisions for 
themselves.   It is also dangerous to have elected democracies 
because these people are not quite smart enough.   I recall one 
prime minister saying that we were nobodies when we were two feet 
out of the House of Commons.   He had a lot to do with some of 
this stuff, if I recall things correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that some individuals had some good intentions.  They 
were going to create a superior system of government, our 
parliamentary system and our present way of doing things.  I 
refer to the words of William Shakespeare who said something that 
I think is very relevant to this topic, “The road to Hell is 
paved with good intentions.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the person responsible for this fundamental change in 
our system of government had good intentions.  I am not exactly 
sure that living with the results of this system are really 
showing the sort of things we want in our society, such as 
accountability and good public policy.  Judges can make very 
major decisions and simply walk away from it, leaving people 
sitting in parliament trying to deal with the carnage and the 
damage that results from these sorts of decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give some very specific examples in recent times of 
those kind of decisions.  The Marshall decision on lobster 
fishing rights off Nova Scotia would be one that is very current 
to me.  That decision will cost us a lot of money and it will 
cause a lot of unnecessary conflict and division in our society. 
We will need to tackle those problems.  The people that made 
those decisions in the Supreme Court of Canada are not 
accountable for those decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have major reservations about the bill.  The Supreme Court of 
Canada said that if it had independent commissions to decide 
salary and remuneration, it would accept that.  We should bear in 
mind that the Supreme Court of Canada will decide whether that is 
independent enough for it or not.  With some of the cases 
involving provincial court judges, they superimposed themselves 
in there and have become the decision makers for their salary and 
remuneration.  In Saskatchewan, there was a fairly significant 
increase in provincial court salaries because of this sort of 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who would review that process would know it is flawed. 
How can we have people with that much power decide salary and 
then use something like judicial independence as an argument for 
this sort of thing?  Does somebody seriously think that our 
judges are in trouble because they are receiving $190,000 a year? 
Does anyone think that they do not have a roof over their heads, 
cannot put three meals on the table or take care of themselves, 
and so on?  That is utter nonsense.  They are in the top 1% of 
the country.  Most Canadians would just love to have that level 
of remuneration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the salaries for our judges have always been adequate. 
That is not a problem.  I think it is absolute nonsense for 
judges to imply that somehow their judicial independence would be 
usurped by having salaries decided by somebody outside their own 
control.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was rather taken by the last couple of sentences the 
member expressed about the business of judicial independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if there could be any sort of connection between 
judicial independence and judicial imperialism.  We have a 
specific attempt by the Supreme Court of Canada to actually 
interpret legislation, not in the form of an executive branch but 
rather in the form of a legislative branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member say something about that part of it and 
whether there is a deficiency on the part of legislation that is 
passed in the House?  It is so broad and so general that it is 
almost as if parliament is saying it does not wish to deal with 
it and is asking the supreme court to deal with it.  Are there 
two parts to the issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have a solution to 
the problem.  We had two Rhodes scholars and another very 
intelligent lawyer, Peter Lougheed, who saw the danger.  All 
three of them saw it.  One was NDP.  One was a middle of the road 
Tory.  I think the other one may have been on the right a bit. 
They all saw the danger and they insisted on including the 
notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister at the time and the current Prime Minister, 
were very much involved with that process and they consented to 
it.  However, since the adoption of that act in 1982 we have not 
had a prime minister decide to exercise that power in the face of 
some really outrageous things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example was the Singh decision.  This person landed on our 
shores.  The Supreme Court of Canada decided that even though he 
was not a Canadian he was entitled to the full protection of our 
Canadian legal system:  the charter or rights, due process and 
everything along the line.  Then there was a series of appeals 
and so on, and in reaction to it the government said the only way 
to deal with it was to expand the immigration department and all 
our internal appeal procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody who had anything to do with immigration law smiled from 
ear to ear.  This was a new engine of growth for that whole area 
and there has been a flock of people move into the area. That is 
why we have these problems today.  They are being debated in the 
House and taxpayers are spending a disproportionate amount of 
money on the whole system when common sense would say that there 
is a better way of dealing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not decided to take that action because it 
would mean exercising something called the notwithstanding clause 
which enshrined in our constitution the supremacy of parliament. 
The prime minister at the time would not have gone ahead with the 
constitution if he had not understood that.  He was a very 
intelligent man.  He understood the significance of what that 
notwithstanding clause meant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really amazed at how governments since that period of time 
have failed to exercise that power.  It is very frightening.  I 
keep going back to my analogy of the hockey referee.  I cannot 
see the owners ever turning all that power over to referees, not 
just to enforce the rules and call them fairly and so on, but to 
say that if they do not like the rules halfway through the third 
period they can be rewritten whichever way they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is basically what the government has been doing with our 
system.  It has given the nine men and women on the Supreme Court 
of Canada a blank cheque in this whole area.  It has basically 
told them they have the ultimate authority, that although people 
elected them to be the Government of Canada they are wiser and 
smarter, and that the public really does not know what is best so 
they have the final decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a few moments ago the hon. colleague 
from Prince Albert talked about the possibility of it being 
unwise to select judges specifically on their need or greed of 
money.  It would seem to me that those were pretty good comments. 
Selecting someone to be my judge who is so greedy or so needy 
that his love of money causes him to not take that position 
unless he makes over $200,000, in my mind brings him into 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend is a lawyer.  He has had experience in a lot of 
court cases.  There are two questions I would like to ask him. 
Could you give us some specific examples of how the courts have 
usurped the power of parliament?  What is the proper way of 
selecting judges? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Just before I give the floor to the 
hon. member for Prince Albert, I would like to remind members 
that when asking questions to one another to direct them through 
the Chair, not directly to each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member 
for that very challenging question.  I could go through a lot of 
decisions but I guess the most recent one I can think of is a 
murder that occurred in Washington state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims were in Washington state.  The crime was committed 
there.  Canada really did not have any interest in this crime 
other than we do not like to see innocent people murdered. 
However the people who were murdered were not Canadian citizens, 
they were American citizens.  Through good fortune, the people 
who committed the crime ended up in Canadian territory.  With the 
Singh decision and so on, they had full rights to use our system 
or to basically exhaust it.  They made it to the Supreme Court of 
Canada and the supreme court did something very astonishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a lawyer, I respect the American process.  It believes in 
reasonable doubt.  One is innocent until proven guilty.  One is 
entitled to a defence counsel.  Long before that was ever an 
entitlement in Canada, the public purse provided one with defence 
counsel.  The supreme court of the United States has a long 
history of appointing defence counsel to represent people who 
have limited means and so on and some major decisions have worked 
through the system.  One is entitled to a trial before one's 
peers, a jury and so on.  It is a system much criticized in the 
rest of the world as favouring the accused too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada decides that American judgment as to 
what it should do with criminals in America is not good enough, 
that Canadians know better, especially the Supreme Court of 
Canada, and that Americans have no right to decide the penalties 
if they are not in line with our penalty system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Capital punishment is totally alien to our value system.  The 
American supreme court never asked the people of Washington state 
or the other 280 million people in the United States whether they 
thought capital punishment was warranted in this situation.  It 
knew better and decided to impose its decision on the Americans 
as if they were in some banana republic or in some dictatorship 
in Africa or in the Middle East or something like that.  The 
Supreme Court of Canada has been doing that internally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many other cases.  There was a case seven or 
eight years ago.  It was actually from my province.  A person, 
whose name I forget, killed 14 or 15 children in California and 
ended up on our soil.  It was a decision very much like this. He 
worked his way through the system.  Fortunately, the Supreme 
Court of Canada still had some people who had some good 
judgement.  A four to three decision ruled that this guy should 
go back to California.  The plane was running at the airport in 
Prince Albert.  American authorities were waiting at the Prince 
Albert institution.  They rushed him out of there, put him on the 
plane and flew him out of the country before some immigration 
lawyer could start another application.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that this fellow is still working his way 
through the system in the United States.  The Americans are not 
finished with him.  However, I think in many ways the government 
would have preferred that this individual stay in Canada where we 
are much more compassionate and caring in regard to these sorts 
of individuals than a lot of other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know better and we have a Supreme Court of Canada that 
definitely knows a lot better than the average Joe in Canada. 
Those people have a lot more wisdom.  They have been on the 28th 
storey in Toronto, looking out the window through a lot of smog 
for a lot of time and that gives them a lot clearer picture of 
the landscape of the country and what should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of examples of this sort of thing.  To me it 
gets right to the whole question of the justice system in the 
country.  It is defective. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, for the folks back home, what is happening today? 
Basically we have a Liberal government that has just come off an 
election.  It did not really have much of a mandate to go to the 
people with, so it is putting forward a Judges Act which was put 
forward in the last parliament, and it wants to give a 
significant raise to judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing for people back home to keep in mind, and I 
will discuss many of the details of the bill, is that rather than 
bringing forward legislation on the Young Offenders Act in order 
to strike at serious repeat offenders who are causing all sorts 
of problems with the legal system, the Liberals want to deal with 
judges' compensation.   The Liberals did not want to talk about 
the Young Offenders Act.  They did not want to deal with serious 
repeat offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on.  The Liberals did not want to deal with consecutive 
sentencing, where somebody who commits a crime only serves one 
murder sentence and gets a multiple discount for multiple 
murders.  They did not want to deal with consecutive sentencing 
so that the individual could serve one sentence after another 
sentence, which is, by the way, something that the Liberal member 
for Mississauga East brought up in the House and tried 
desperately to get her government to adopt.  Despite that fact, 
they tried to kill her bill in committee.  Despite that, no, they 
do not want to talk about consecutive sentencing.  The Liberals 
do not want to deal with issues that have been brought forward by 
their own members like the member for Mississauga East, a good 
loyal Liberal who has probably been there for a decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not want to listen to that.  It does not 
want to listen to what her constituents have to say on this. 
Instead it is raising judges' salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go on.  These Liberals do not want to deal with 
pedophiles.  They say it is okay for people to possess kiddie 
porn, that the judge's decision on it is all right.  They do not 
want to deal with pedophiles, pedophile legislation and 
possession of child pornography.  No, the top priority for the 
Liberals when they come back after going out on the stump and 
getting elected is raising judges' salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are Liberal priorities for you.  This goes on.  They do 
not want to bring up the idea of a violent sex offender registry. 
We have people in Canada who have committed multiple rapes, yet 
does the government come up with an effective strategy to deal 
with multiple rapists?  No.  The government paroles them and put 
them back on the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of dealing with these real and serious issues, what does 
the government come to us with after an election?  It wants to 
raise judges' salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about raising judges' salaries since we are not 
going to talk about all those other important things that a 
Liberal justice minister should be bringing forward.  We are not 
going to talk about the things people really want.  We are going 
to talk about what the bureaucrats want.  We are going to let 
them drive the agenda.  That is the Liberal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about this whole idea of how judges are chosen.  I 
take issue with the Prime Minister.  I recognize that the Prime 
Minister was elected yet again by the people in his riding.  I 
would not have voted for him, but at least a plurality of the 
people in the Prime Minister's riding decided to vote for him. At 
least he has some sort of mandate.  Not only was he elected by 
some number of people in his own riding, but as well he actually 
had to get enough delegates at the convention for the Liberal 
Party. 
Back in 1990 he was in my home town of Calgary, much to my 
chagrin.  Nonetheless that was where he was elected.  He had 
probably a few thousand people who said they wanted to give this 
guy the nod.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least the Prime Minister has been chosen by the delegates 
within his own party and by the people within his own 
constituency.  It is not as democratic as I might like.  I think 
it would have been better if all Liberal Party members across the 
country would have voted rather than just the palace guard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  I hear some squawking on the other side. 
I know I am hitting home when that happens.  I know they are 
sensitive to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all these problems with their process, nonetheless the 
Prime Minister has been democratically elected.  If we can choose 
the Prime Minister democratically in the country, who then goes 
on to appoint people to the supreme court and to thousands of 
other positions, many of which are patronage positions including 
the other place which I like to rant about every now and again, 
and if he seems to accept the will of the people for his 
nomination and for his choosing, then by what rational argument 
do members across the way or anyone in this place say that 
judges, or any other position for that matter, cannot be 
democratically elected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we choose the man who is supposed to be the head of the 
government in this place, the Prime Minister, and he is 
democratically elected as one of the most important decision 
makers supposedly around, then why would we not choose judges or 
senators or many other people by democratic election?  This makes 
absolutely perfect sense to me.  Yet we have people across the 
way who will argue one side and then the other side, equivocate 
and try to muddle this issue by saying it is complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamentally it comes down to from where people believe the 
power is derived.  I happen to believe, and I will state it 
squarely today, that the power is derived from the people.  I 
think they generally make pretty good decisions when they are 
given the chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have asked many people today about the appointment process, 
what they think would be a better process than the one we have 
now.  I happen to think that vetting them before a committee at 
least would be better than what we have.  In my ideal scenario I 
would probably want to have them democratically elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know right now with the process as it stands that people are 
given justice positions because of political favours they have 
done for a government.  There are people in this place that can 
try to sideline that by saying that is not the case and by asking 
how dare I raise questions about these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one of the people in here, especially the practising 
lawyers in this place, know all too well that there are people 
who are given justice positions because of their political 
favouritism, of their stripe, of their donations or some mishap 
like that.  Frankly there is a better way to go about it and I 
think the wisdom of the people is a good way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that one of my NDP colleagues in this place asked why we 
would want to have these people determined by committee because 
the Liberals would just use that as a rubber stamp anyhow; they 
go ahead and do whatever they want in committee so why would we 
want a committee to vet it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that the Liberals abuse the committee process in this 
place better than pretty much anybody could.  They are experts at 
abusing the committee process, even for their own members like 
the member for Mississauga East where they severely abused the 
committee process to try to kill her bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that if these appointments had to go before 
committee at least they could be some form of questioning. 
Hopefully we could shed the light of day on some of these 
appointments.  If we cannot actually change what the Liberals 
decide they want to shove down peoples' throats, we could point 
out to the public that a person has made large contributions to 
the Liberal Party or has some sort of connection to someone in 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an issue that deserves a lot more time than what you are 
giving me, Mr. Speaker.  Nonetheless, there are ways we can 
improve the process by vetting through committee and possibly 
electing them.
