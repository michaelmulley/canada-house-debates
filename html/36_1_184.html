</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  I am informed by the 
departments of health and national defence as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) There has been only one case reported in Canada prior to 
1993 of a patient with a medical history of alcoholism 
experiencing two episodes of hallucinations, depression and 
suicide ideation while taking mefloquine for malaria prophylaxis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) There have been four additional cases reported in Canada 
after 1993.  Two cases of suicide and two cases of suicidal 
ideation have been reported.  Of these, two were potentially 
associated with alcohol use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Of the Canadian forces members who were administered 
mefloquine since 1992, there has been one attempted suicide, 
Somalia 1993, and one suicide, Rwanda 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) One. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) Health Canada continues to follow the adverse reaction 
profile of mefloquine but has not formally undertaken a review of 
the international experience concerning suicides, suicide 
attempts and suicidal ideation associated with mefloquine use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) Health Canada has not formally undertaken a review of the 
scientific literature with regard to suicides, suicide attempts or 
suicidal ideation associated with mefloquine use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(g) The product monograph for mefloquine has been revised twice 
subsequent to the issuance of the notice of compliance. There has 
been no revision to the product monograph relating specifically 
to suicide.  Depression is a contraindication to use of the drug, 
product monograph revision of January 1997. The precautions 
section of the product monograph states that “During 
prophylactic use, if signs of unexplained anxiety, depression, 
restlessness or confusion are noticed, these may be considered 
prodromal to a more serious event.  In these cases the drug must 
be discontinued”.  Similar information is repeated in the 
adverse reactions section of the monograph and in the information 
to the consumer section of the monograph.  With respect to 
mefloquine and alcohol, given that both mefloquine and alcohol 
are known to have central nervous system effects, in January 1995 
a statement was included in the information to the consumer 
section of the monograph to read as follows:  “It is best to 
avoid alcoholic drinks during treatment with Lariam”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(h) Immediately following a 1995 report in the Canadian Medical 
Association Journal of a single case of a psychosis developing in 
association with excessive alcohol and mefloquine prophylaxis, 
the Canadian forces issued a warning message advising of this 
potential adverse reaction. Subsequently all deploying personnel 
are to be given a briefing regarding potential adverse effects of 
mefloquine and a warning against excess consumption of alcohol. 
In addition, alcohol consumption during Canadian forces 
deployments is closely regulated by the commanding officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) The product monograph is the official document used to 
inform physicians of the properties of drugs and the approved 
instructions for use.  As indicated in response to part(g), the 
product monograph was updated to reflect current information 
available to Health Canada about mefloquine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(j) The Canadian forces-Department of National Defence at the 
national level has had no reports of cases or complaints 
regarding miscarriages or infant deaths related to use of 
mefloquine in Canadian forces members.  However, if such an event 
was reported to Health Canada through a dependant's doctor, we 
would not necessarily be informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 139—<B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each of the three previously recorded fiscal years, what has 
the government determined to be: (<I>a</I>) the total amount of federal 
tax dollars used to compensate Canadians whose firearms have 
been confiscated by the government; (<I>b</I>) the total amount of 
federal tax dollars given to El Salvador for use in a firearms 
buyback program; (<I>c</I>) the names of all countries to which 
federal tax dollars have been given for similar firearms buyback 
programs; and (<I>d</I>) the total amount of federal tax dollars 
spent to fund these initiatives?

Canadian International Development Agency and the Department of 
Justice as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) The compensation file originated in 1994 with the passing of 
Order in Council No. 11 on November 29, 1994. OIC No. 11 
identified a series of firearms as prohibited weapons effective 
January 1, 1995. Of the firearms that have been turned in under 
OIC No. 11, 47 of these were deemed to be eligible for 
compensation resulting in payments totalling $36,009.77. Most of 
these payments have occurred in 1995 or the early part of 1996. 
By fiscal year the payments were as follows: 1995-96, $31,613.56; 
1996-97, $1,110.17; and 1997-98, $3,286.04.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK26">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 17, consideration of the 
motion that this House approves in general the budgetary policy 
of the government; of the amendment; and of the amendment to the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with enthusiasm and 
pride that I stand today to speak to the budget that was tabled 
two days ago in the House, enthusiasm and pride because this is a 
Liberal budget.  It is a Liberal budget because it has balanced 
all of the needs of the people of Canada in trying to find a way 
to reduce the debt and in trying to find a way to do progressive 
tax reform and in trying to find a way to look at building a new 
social and economic infrastructure for the needs of Canadians in 
the 21st century. That is what makes me proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes me even more enthusiastic about this budget is that 
as a physician this budget has focused on health.  This budget 
has focused very clearly on something I know a great deal about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not speak only as a physician.  I speak as someone who for 
the last 20 years has been very involved in all aspects of health 
care:  in the financing of health care; in understanding how the 
health care system works at the provincial level and at the 
federal level; in understanding and working closely on issues of 
health promotion and disease prevention; and clearly, as 
president of the British Columbia Medical Association, in 
understanding the issues that affect the providers of health. I 
have worked for many years with the other health care providers 
in this country. I think with due modesty that I know something 
about the health care system in all of its intricacies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why I am pleased about this budget is that we have done the very 
important thing of injecting some acute care into the health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a physician, and as a patient well knows, physicians are 
supposed to make accurate or as accurate as possible diagnoses. 
In spite of what we may hear from members of the opposition 
party, the health care system in Canada has not been in crisis 
and never has been in crisis.  What the health care system of 
Canada has been— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  I hear other members shouting.  Obviously 
they do not understand the difference between crisis and acute 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here to say that the health care system in Canada was not 
well and that it needed some acute care.  It has been given that 
acute care.  It has been given the immediate acute care it 
needed, which is to take care of the patient now for today and 
for the very immediate future.  We have done this by infusing $8 
billion over the next five years into the transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of acute care, we have also put in place a 
supplementary fund of $3.5 billion so that the provinces over the 
next three years in ways that they see fit for their needs can 
take money out of the trust fund to deal with some of the more 
acute issues that concern them in their provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is also important in this system is not only that the 
diagnosis has been made but the treatment has been started. First 
in the treatment of dealing with the acute care of the patient 
was to inject funds into the system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this budget puts $1.4 billion into systems, research, 
accountability and looking at how we develop best practices and 
how we create a more effective and more efficient health care 
system, one that will provide a high quality of care. That is the 
other component of caring for patients which doctors know all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That component is not only to give patients the medicine needed 
to make them feel better immediately, but it also ensures that in 
the long term the rehabilitation of patients will take place, 
that patients will be able, as time goes on, to get better and to 
build a sound basis for having a better quality of life. Patients 
will become stronger and be able over time to extend their lives. 
This is the sustainability component of the budget that is key. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People like Robert Evans from the University of British 
Columbia, a health care economist who has spoken for health care 
for over 25 years, has said over and over again that what the 
health care system needs is not just money, that the health care 
system actually needs to change the way we have been doing 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system worked very well for us in the 1960s and the 1970s 
and in part of the 1980s, but as with every system that works 
well we need to constantly be evaluating, to be evolving and to 
be able to meet the newer and newer needs of patients.  Things 
have changed in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an aging population and brand new technologies.  These 
things need to be taken care of, and not just with money.  We 
must find ways in which we can use technology appropriately and 
wisely.  We do not need a CAT scan on every street corner.  We do 
not need new technology in every hospital in the country, but 
appropriate use of technology is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $1.4 billion that will go into research and into building 
our system will help us how to do it better.  It will assist the 
providers of health care, the administrators, hospitals and 
institutions to understand how to use technology better, to 
understand the things we need to do to give better and more 
effective care, and to deal with these issues a lot better than 
has been done in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evolution of the system is extremely important.  That is 
key.  This is something that Mr. Evans recently said very 
carefully.  Every royal commission over the last 15 years that 
has sat in every province of the country has said the same thing. 
It is not money alone that will fix the system.  We need to 
change the way the system works.  We need to ensure that the 
system is more effective, that there are guidelines for good 
care, that we have appropriate guidelines for technology, and 
that we use the system far more wisely than we have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am stressing the $1.4 billion.  It is nice to point to the 
$11.5 billion that will be going into the health care system over 
the next five years, but what is more important is that little 
$1.4 billion.  That will make the system work better. That will 
ensure what all health care economists who understand health care 
have been saying over the last few years, that we need to deal 
with the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will turn the system around.  It will make a better system 
for us.  Let us not ever believe that we are spending too little 
money on health care.  We are one country that has been spending 
far more of a percentage of GDP on health care than many 
countries in the world with far better outcomes than we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fixing the health care system has to involve looking at outcomes 
and at appropriate ways of dealing with the system so that the 
outcomes will be achieved.  It is about allowing people to 
monitor what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about acute care.  We have talked about the 
rehabilitation of the system.  We have talked about putting the 
system back on track in a new way so that it can serve 21st 
century Canadians better.  We also need to know that health care 
is more than just hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is about preventing disease.  Health care is about 
assisting those who are disadvantaged in other parts of the 
country and need health care and prevention.  One thing that is 
going into the new health care budget is money for aboriginal 
people such as the Inuit people of the country who have had very 
bad health outcomes over past years.  This will start to make 
those changes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to talk about prevention.  We are talking about the fact 
that over the last few years we have seen more and more low birth 
weight babies.  One of the reasons for low birth weight babies 
has to do very clearly with mothers at risk, especially at risk 
of poor nutrition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new money going into the prenatal nutrition program is very 
important money.  We will look at how to fix the outcome of low 
birth weight babies.  It ties very clearly into the government's 
focus on helping children not only when they reach the ages of 
six and seven but when they are beginning to develop in the first 
three years of their lives and pre-birth when important 
developmental processes are beginning in the fetus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health care budget is more than just an infusion of cash 
into the system.  It is more than just the infusion of immediate 
acute care needs for dollars.  It is building a new health care 
system that will serve Canadians better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said before that the system is not only made up of the 
people who use it.  It is made up of the people around the 
country who provide care.  One thing that is most exciting about 
the budget is the nurse program.  Some providers will get the 
skills and tools they need to be able to build good information 
systems and to be able to assist them with good practices so they 
can provide health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also inject some much needed morale into the system. 
Nurses have laboured with very little thanks and very poor 
remuneration for the work they do.  That is why nobody wants to 
go into nursing any more.  The $25 million endowment fund will 
assist nurses to start recruiting.  It will give them the skills 
and tools—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member 
opposite spoke very eloquently about her background as a 
physician.  She is a member of the Canadian Medical Association 
which has a comment to make on the budget as it relates to health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like her to comment on this particular perception of the 
budget.  It is from Hugh Scully, president of the CMA.  He says 
that the health care system is in an emergency situation now and 
that with the budget it has moved down to urgency status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Liberals choose to take what was a monetary 
emergency in 1993-94 and turn it into a medical emergency?  The 
CMA disagrees with her perception that medicare is in good shape 
today.  It has gone from emergency down to urgency.  What does 
she say to that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not say that the system 
is in good shape.  Let us be very clear about that.  I said that 
the system was in need of urgent care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member across the way has been telling us over and 
over is kind of strange.  Physicians are supposed to diffuse 
anxiety, help patients find a better way to get well and build a 
strong rehabilitative program for patients.  Physician are not to 
panic, not to yell crisis, not to be a Chicken Little and say the 
sky is falling when it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The medical association is saying that the system is in need of 
good acute care.  We go to the emergency for good acute care. 
That acute care has occurred.  This infusion of money into the 
system will help to give us the acute care we need.  What is more 
important is that it will build a strong system for the future. 
That is what all health care economists like Robert Evans and 
many people across the country have been asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten royal commissions across the country have said the same 
thing over and over, that there is a need to build new structures 
in the system.  That is what the budget is doing.  It is not just 
throwing money at the problem.  We all know that throwing money 
at the problem will mean that in two year's time we will be 
asking for another $12 billion.  That will not resolve the 
problem.  As a physician the hon. member should know that very 
well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that all they were able to get for Quebec is less than 
10% of the money available for health? What did they do? Were 
they asleep during cabinet meetings? Did they stand up for 
Quebec's interests or did they just sit on their hands as usual, 
letting Quebeckers down in favour of the federal government and 
Ontario? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I suggest again that this 
budget is to be placed on top of the last three budgets because 
it is building a clear layer by layer infrastructure.  It is also 
to be placed on top of the social accord which, the hon. member 
would agree, the premier of his province did not sign on to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I should ask him why his premier did not consider the 
needs of Quebeckers in the context of the needs of all Canadians. 
By denying the ability to look at the social accord he is denying 
Quebeckers the right to work together in partnership with the 
federal government to build a stronger infrastructure, not only 
of health care but for social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is a very clear indicator of health.  Productivity is 
one issue that we need to look at.  Those are some of the 
built-in issues.  A budget does not stand alone.  The issues that 
we are talking about are not in isolation from everything else. 
Economic and social issues are interdependent on each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to build something for Quebeckers we would have to look 
at the whole, at how we deal with all the issues and whether 
Quebeckers get an opportunity to participate as the other nine 
provinces are. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let 
me say right at the outset that the 1999 budget as tabled by our 
finance minister on Tuesday truly reflects the social and 
economic needs of all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget highlights this government's commitment to continued 
co-operation with the provinces, on behalf of all Canadians, in 
order to safeguard and strengthen our society into the 21st 
century. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget was developed through an open and consultative 
process in which all members of the government were involved. The 
Ontario caucus, which I chair, fought hard to promote the 
interests of all Ontarians and all Canadians.  I am pleased that 
our strong and united voice has been heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have told parliament that our health care system needs 
more funding to better serve those in need. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, for instance, the 1999 budget announced that the 
provinces and territories will receive an extra $11.5 billion 
over five years for health care. This is the most substantial 
one-time investment ever made by the government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario Liberal caucus fought hard for accountability 
measures to ensure that the new funding will be spent on health 
care and not for other purposes.  Such assurances have been 
obtained from the Premier of Ontario and all territorial and 
provincial leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is good news for Ontario.  It ensures that the 
federal government's health care investment will be distributed 
on an equitable per capita basis.  Thanks to a policy of inequity 
introduced by the last federal Conservative government, Canadians 
have been treated differently under the CHST depending on where 
they live.  Given the population of Ontario, we have not been 
receiving our fair share.  The budget provides for a gradual 
narrowing of these disparities.  Increases in CHST makes it 
possible for Canadians to obtain equal per capita entitlements by 
2001-02.  This will benefit provinces such as Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transfers to Ontario will grow significantly over the next five 
years.  New health money means transfers are projected to grow 
from about $9.5 billion this year to $12 billion over the next 
five years.  Per capital CHST entitlements will grow from $830 
million to $985 million by 2003-04.  This means almost $5.3 
billion more for Ontario over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are significant funds in these increased transfers to 
Ontario that could be deployed to assist the homeless in Ontario 
if this were the priority of the Ontario government.  They have 
that flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario will also benefit from $1.4 billion invested by our own 
government to promote health care research and prevention. 
In Ontario federal research dollars will support the work of two 
doctors from the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario whose 
research on genes will help patients suffering from Parkinson's 
disease, strokes and other related diseases.  Researchers at 
Carleton University and Kingston General Hospital will also 
directly benefit from upgrades to MRI machines which will improve 
the detection of breast cancer.  Mr. Speaker, I know that would 
be of great interest to yourself.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a position to strengthen our health care system 
because of the prudent fiscal discipline undertaken by this 
government.  After inheriting a federal Conservative deficit of 
$42 billion, we needed the help of all Canadians to put our 
finances in order. The sacrifices made by many will allow Canada 
to enjoy a prosperous future in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99 we will balance the books or better. This is the 
first time since 1951-52 that the Government of Canada has been 
deficit free for two consecutive years. We are also on track for 
balanced budgets or better in both 2000 and 2001. This will mark 
only the third time since Confederation that the Government of 
Canada has recorded four consecutive balanced budgets. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cuts in income tax are vital to the government's objective of 
building a better future today.  Accordingly, the federal 
government is committed to making major tax reductions as 
equitably as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time since 1965, individuals are given a tax 
reduction without borrowing being required.  The largest cuts 
planned in the 1998 and 1999 budgets will be for low and middle 
income Canadians, out of concern for fairness. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget builds on the $7 billion in tax cuts that were 
delivered last year by providing $7.7 billion in tax reductions 
over the next three years.  The 1998 budget benefited low income 
Canadians by increasing the amount of income they can earn 
annually before paying income tax by $500.  The 1999 budget 
increases the amount by $175 to $675 and extends it to all 
Canadian taxpayers.  This means that effective July 1, 1999 the 
basic amount of income that all Canadians can earn annually on a 
tax free basis will rise to $7,131.  In addition this budget also 
fully eliminates the 3% surtax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is committed to substantially reducing taxes in 
the fairest possible way.  Nonetheless for tax relief to be 
permanent, it must be affordable and not jeopardize the soundness 
of Canada's finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget also shows a strong commitment to keeping the 
debt to GDP ratio on a downward path.  Last year Canada's debt to 
GDP ratio saw its largest single yearly decline since 1956-57, 
from 70.3% to 66.9%.  For the current year, 1998-99, it will fall 
still further to around 65.3% and by 2000-01 the debt ratio 
should be down to just under 62%. This falling debt burden is 
allowing us to reallocate funds that would otherwise have been 
needed for interest payments on the debt.  We increasingly will 
be able to free up resources for targeted social programs, tax 
relief and for investments in a more productive economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we need not be obsessed with paying down the debt.  As 
our economy continues to grow, our debt ratio will shrink 
naturally as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget is based on a fact that applies the world over. 
Technology is changing at a phenomenal rate, before our very 
eyes.  It is totally changing the nature of the labour and 
business markets and it is changing the skills and knowledge we 
require to remain competitive at home and abroad. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new economy makes investing in knowledge and innovation 
essential for the creation of well-paying jobs and improving our 
standard of living. It is for this reason that the government has 
committed to spend more than $1.8 billion in knowledge spending. 
This money will help strengthen research and development and aid 
those companies producing leading edge products and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I rose in the House to announce that the unemployment 
rate in Canada had fallen to 7.8%, the lowest in almost nine 
years.  In 1998 Canada created 453,000 new jobs and led the G-7 
with the highest job growth rate.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these results are encouraging, we must continue to focus 
on reducing our unemployment rate even further.  The best way to 
create jobs is by providing Canadians with the knowledge and 
training they need to adapt to our changing global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a final note, I would like to congratulate the Minister of 
Finance and the Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions for responding to an important initiative that I 
have promoted.  This budget will amend the Income Tax Act to 
allow offshore investment funds to engage Canadian service 
providers without jeopardizing their tax status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially Canada has responded in kind to measures introduced 
in the United States to eliminate tax impediments for offshore 
investment companies that wish to conduct their back office work 
within the United States. Canada has done the same, allowing 
offshore investment companies to set up back offices in our 
financial centres to perform administrative work and investment 
services.  This will help to create jobs and stimulate economic 
activity in the Toronto financial services sector and throughout 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this budget is good for Ontario and good for 
Canada and it positions us very well to enter the next 
millennium.  It is for this reason that I am proud and very 
pleased to support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened with interest to the comments of the hon. member 
opposite, especially when he said that this budget reflects and 
meets the economic and social needs of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The elimination of the 3% surtax amounts to some considerable 
savings.  By my calculations every millionaire in this country 
will save $8,000.  That figure resonates with me and this is why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my community this government has just committed to close down 
the coal mines.  The amount of the training allowance that will 
be given to each miner who has spent on average 25 years 
underground, whose average age is 47, who owns a home of about 
$30,000 or $40,000, will be $8,000.  That is the training 
allowance to move them into the new economy which the member 
boasts about. That is the money to bridge them from this labour 
intensive industry in which they have spent their lives to the 
new economy the member boasts about. If we had not given the 
millionaires the reduction that would save them $8,000, we might 
have been able to double the amount of training allowance for 
those miners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best illustration I can give the member is my next door 
neighbour.  He will be 47 when the mines close and will have 
spent 25 years underground.  He has a 17-year old boy who is at 
the top of his class entering university, a 13-year old boy in 
junior high and an 8-year old daughter with special needs.  He 
will not get a pension.  He will get a severance package of maybe 
$50,000, a portion of which will be taxed back and he will get 
$8,000 to train for the new economy in an area where the 
unemployment rate is 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member says that the budget reflects and meets the 
social and economic needs of all Canadians, does he think it 
meets my neighbour's needs?  Would it not have been better to 
keep in the government treasury the $8,000 from the millionaires 
and double the training allowance for those miners? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to 
the comments from the member for Sydney—Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of the unfortunate circumstances with Devco in his 
riding.  That has been a matter for concern for all Canadians and 
all parliamentarians.  I thought I heard the Minister of Natural 
Resources announce in the House a fairly complete package to do 
the very best we can to help those people reposition their lives. 
There were a number of measures announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member talks about high income Canadians with respect 
to the 3% surtax, the vast majority of the balance of the 3% 
surtax being removed is really targeting middle income Canadians 
and lower income Canadians.  There are some at the higher end who 
will also benefit, but I think we owe it to some middle income 
Canadians who have borne a very serious burden in balancing our 
books and bringing our deficit under control that they should 
receive some benefit from their hard work and their sacrifices. 
I have no compunction about delivering some target tax relief to 
middle income Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, reducing and eliminating the deficit is a 
means to an end.  It means we have more flexibility now and in 
the future to direct government resources in more targeted ways 
that benefit more and more Canadians.

<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
budget is a disappointment.  It raises ire and promises the 
worst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is a disappointment because, once again, the 
unemployed are footing the bill.  They will be paying for 
federal generosity, because the employment insurance fund will 
remain the government's cash cow, and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development will continue to be the valet to the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing for the unemployed in this budget.  According 
to the forecasts, the government will be taking $4.9 billion 
from their pockets. 
In fact, by the end of the fiscal year, it will be more than 
$6 billion, probably $6.5 billion or $7 billion.  That means that 
there will be in the unemployment insurance fund, what they call 
employment insurance—it is shameful to have such terminology 
for such purposes—somewhere around $25 billion taken from the 
pockets of the most disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no relaxation of this plan, which is pushing 
individuals and families into poverty, misery, despair—as I 
have seen in the Gaspé and in my riding.  Children come home 
from school hungry because their parents are no longer entitled 
to employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 36% of those who have contributed and are unemployed are 
entitled to benefits. 
If an insurance agent charged two or three times the amount of 
the premium, compensated two victims out of five and pocketed 
the profits, as the Minister of Finance is doing, he would be 
taken to court and he would end up in jail. Yet, this is what 
the Minister of Finance, who is more interested in looking after 
his ships than after the unemployed, is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also disappointed because the government made the 
deliberate choice of helping the rich rather than the middle 
class, by abolishing the 3% surtax instead of indexing the tax 
tables. Ever since the government stopped indexing the tax 
tables, the middle class has been paying ever increasing taxes. 
There have been no tax cuts. There are more and more middle 
class people whose salary has gone up, but their financial 
situation has not improved, since the price of consumer goods 
has also gone up. These people are paying more taxes because the 
government did not index the tax tables. This means that the tax 
burden of the middle class remains excessively heavy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be sure, the Minister of Finance will tell us about the child 
tax benefit. But let us not forget that this benefit only 
applies to low income families. After all, could it be that, if 
children are poor, it is because their parents are poor? Could 
it be that many children are poor because the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, another bad choice of words, is devoid of 
compassion and cold-hearted? He is a technocrat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister is making sure that some men and women no longer 
qualify for EI benefits and therefore have no money to look 
after their children. And then he sheds tears and laments the 
plight of children who live in poverty. Do members know what 
this sort of behaviour is called? It is called hypocrisy, and 
this is what we get from the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is outrageous, because it clearly shows that the 
federal government does not care about the provinces and that 
social union will, to all intents and purposes, lead directly to 
a unitary state. 
In fact, we are seeing the first fallout from the social union 
because nowhere in the document, with its constant references to 
the social union, is it stated that Quebec did not sign the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refers to it repeatedly, but fails to mention 
that Quebec never signed such an agreement, and a good thing 
when we see what is happening to the other provinces, always of 
course with the complicity of the Premier of Saskatchewan, Roy 
Romanow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will never get us to believe that this agreement runs for 
only three years and that federal interference in provincial 
areas of jurisdiction will therefore be limited to three years 
as well. We know this is not true.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that these are institutions that will become permanent 
and that will sanction the presence of the federal government in 
the health sector.  In fact, what the federal government is 
trying to do is to slip the social union past Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa's strategy is to put $1.4 billion into health, although 
this is an exclusively provincial jurisdiction, through various 
initiatives.  One of the programs announced was the national 
health surveillance network. 
Ottawa knows best.  Big brother is at work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, the federal government is going to link up public health 
laboratories.  Why?  So as to be better able to impose its own 
priorities.  Yet there is no serious problem with the 
interprovincial exchange of information on serious illnesses and 
epidemics.  We do not need the federal government creating 
another bureaucracy, particularly in health because, as I said 
the other day, in biology, the function creates the organ, but 
in Ottawa it is the reverse.  As soon as they have any money at 
all, they create another bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are already all sorts of mechanisms at the interprovincial 
and federal-provincial levels for these purposes.  What is the 
reason for these initiatives by Ottawa at a time when emergency 
rooms are overflowing and waiting lists for surgery are growing? 
What does Ottawa do?  It carries out new studies and collects 
more statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the provinces know where the problems lie.  They do not need 
a federal big brother to do studies for three or four years and 
then tell them emergency rooms are overcrowded.  They know that 
already.  So should Ottawa, because it was the one that cut 
health funding by $6 billion in Quebec alone over the last four 
years. And now it expects us to thank it for giving $1 billion 
back.  It is a bit like expecting someone who has had $6,000 
stolen to thank the thief for giving back $1,000, leaving him 
only $5,000 short. And the spineless Liberal Party members from 
Quebec give it their seal of approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even more disgraceful in all this is that the real needs 
are being felt throughout the health system, but a new 
bureaucracy of statisticians is being created. 
We do not need statisticians; we need doctors, nurses, 
specialized health care providers and support staff. Ottawa 
gives us numbers, paper and bureaucrats. Some priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another program called the NURSE fund, whereby the 
federal government is trying to do indirectly what the 
Constitution prevents it from doing directly, namely interfere 
in health care management through the role it assumes with 
regard to our nursing staff, something a minister was bragging 
about a few moments ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read an excerpt from a budget document dealing with this 
issue. It says, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—better enable nurses to deliver quality care— 
</UL></UL>
<This is under provincial jurisdiction. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—in an environment of health care restructuring; identify 
approaches to retrain— 
</UL></UL>
<This comes under education, which is under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the existing workforce; and attract new members to the 
profession. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one sentence, we see interference in three different areas, 
namely health, education and manpower training. If we want to 
attract new members to the nursing profession, we do not need 
statisticians, sociologists or rocket scientists from the 
federal government. Give us back the money and we will know what 
to do with it. We will give nurses higher salaries and hire more 
of them. We need money, not far-fetched ideas from the finance 
minister and his accomplices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the computer age where communications are transforming our 
society, the federal government will use new technologies to 
further interfere in areas under provincial jurisdiction. I am 
thinking of the telehomecare, telehealth program. Ottawa can now 
have a physical presence in CLSCs and is in the process of 
creating virtual CLSCs. 
This is unacceptable, especially the unfair treatment Quebec is 
getting in the distribution of additional health transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I must point out the hypocritical methods used by 
the federal government in announcing, without ever consulting 
Quebec, how it will distribute the $11.5 billion that will be 
put back into the health care system. Quebec was not consulted, 
probably because this was part of the federal government's 
overall strategy regarding the social union issue. 
Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia were given kickbacks and 
asked to sign. That is what the arrangement was, as we now know.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document on health, signed by the ten premiers, specifies 
that any amount paid back through the Canada health and social 
transfer was to be reinvested in health on the same terms and 
conditions as before. Once again, the Prime Minister broke the 
promise he made, when he signed, but he has done that on many 
occasions before. His whole career has been marked by such 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the social union, consultations and a a one-year notice are 
provided for. The agreement was signed on February 4. The budget 
was brought down on February 16. 
The whole method of funding health care has been changed. That 
is how Ontario's support was bought, and we have seen that the 
stage was set for Mike Harris' comedy. That is how British 
Columbia and Alberta were bought as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only need a few figures to illustrate this. In 1998-99, of the 
extra $2 billion in transfers for health, $150 million will go 
to Quebec and $949 million will go to Ontario. As for the $11.5 
billion over five years, $950 million will go to Quebec and $5.5 
billion to Ontario. That is billion, not million. Overall, Quebec 
will receive 8.3% of the transfers, while Ontario will receive 
47%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the period considered, Ontario receives six times more 
money than Quebec. That is what this good budget for Quebec is 
about, apparently. 
Of course, the spineless Liberal members we have here in Ottawa, 
these federalist yes-men, will contend that Quebec is getting an 
extra $1.4 billion in equalization payments, which is nothing 
but money owned to Quebec for the miscalculations the federal 
government has made three years in a row. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Minister of Immigration state, yesterday, that they 
are trying to repair a historic injustice. In fact, they are 
creating another one for Quebec. This is disappointing on the 
part of a former health and education minister in Quebec. This 
kind of attitude is disappointing, appalling and sad. We are 
expected to be pleased this consolation prize, because that is 
what equalization is, a consolation prize for other policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago, I heard the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs say that, to bring Quebec nationalists and even 
federalist nationalists to take a more realistic view, Quebec 
would have to suffer. I think he has achieved his goal this 
time. 
His prescription has been filled by federal bureaucrat 
pharmacists, “Quebec is getting what the doctor ordered”.  That 
is strong medicine.  This is the sort of utter nonsense this 
minister utters; however, cabinet accepted it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a short term solution.  Ontario will receive ongoing 
transfer payments now and not just on the 50% provided for last 
year by the Minister of Finance in the social transfers, but on 
the whole thing, all 100%, not only for education or health, 
where there is a certain rationale for a per capita basis, but 
also for social welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should a province have 23% of the social welfare cases because 
it represents 23% of the population?  That is the sort of 
nonsensical reasoning of the government and the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at what this per capita method would mean 
overall.  If it applies to social transfers, will it apply to 
current federal spending on goods and services, where Quebec 
receives 20% instead of 24%?  Will it apply to federal capital 
assets and spending, where Quebec receives 19% instead of 24%? 
Will it apply to federal subsidies to business, where Quebec 
received 18% rather than 24%.  And to federal laboratories, 
where the figure is 16%?  And to research and development, where 
it is 14%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the national capital region, of 43 research centres, 42 on 
the Ottawa side and one in Hull. Is that chance?  We do not 
think so.  It is not a matter of chance, this is traditional 
Ottawa politics.  That is 13% of federal personnel in science 
and technology, and I am not including the army. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at regional development.  In the maritimes, 
the per capita amount from the federal government is $1,074; in 
Quebec it is $325.  In this case, the per capita basis is not a 
good thing.  They forget the per capita basis when it is worth 
their while, and the Liberals from Quebec, marching merrily 
along, have not a word to say about it.  They will agree to 
anything.  This sort of attitude is shameful.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government and this Minister of Finance in particular, with 
his henchman, his shylock in human resources, are shameless. 
Political schemes are now what guide the Minister of Finance in 
determining how the accounting should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance tells us he is going to stay the course, 
creating trusts like the millennium scholarships, in the name of 
good public health and transparency. When we ask questions here 
in the House about the millennium scholarships, we are told that 
we must ask the foundation.  What is transparent about that? 
When we notice surpluses, later on, they will tell us there is a 
foundation, 
that they cannot answer our questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call that transparency.  I have another word for it, like 
the term fair play they use so often. Unfortunately, fair play 
seems to be the best we can come up with in French as an 
equivalent for the English, but 90% of the time these people use 
the expression fair play to mean what we call hypocrisy in 
French.  That is the only word for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that surpluses will magically materialize next spring. 
The Minister of Finance will say that the government has done 
much better than he expected it would, and that he had no idea 
three weeks earlier that there would be a $15 billion surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance may be a lot of things, but he is not 
unintelligent.  He is not lacking in the brain department.  He 
knows how to count, we know that.  He is a good counter, but we 
do not have the right accounting book. 
This is because, every year, the minister indulges in a game of 
cooking the books. It reminds me of the recipes of a chef named 
Pol Martin. I can mention that name, because there is indeed a 
chef named Pol Martin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister underestimates revenues, overestimates spending, 
dips into the employment insurance fund of his accomplice, all 
this with a good dose of political cynicism seasoned à la Pol 
Martin, the chef, not the Minister of Finance, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He tells us he is being cautious, but his figures no longer mean 
anything. One cannot be off the mark by $15 billion or $12 
billion year after year. People know that what is being 
announced now is not what will be announced in March and in 
October, when the last quarter will end. Last year, the Bloc 
Quebecois said the surplus would be at least $2.5 billion. We 
were told “No, no, no, this is wrong”. Well, in October, it 
turned out to be $3.5 billion. This is the reality. 
The minister uses the same trick every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, surpluses will appear once again and what will the 
government do? It will set up new trusts. Last year, the 
government got involved in education, while this year it is in 
the health sector. What will it be involved in next year? 
Perhaps in municipal affairs, road infrastructures or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are becoming more and more clear with this government. We 
can see why the Prime Minister was anxious to hold a last minute 
meeting, on February 4, after refusing to do so just before the 
budget. It was to bribe the provinces that would sign the 
agreement and keep quiet afterwards. This government is 
rebuilding Canada for Canadians, for the nine other provinces 
that are working together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have nothing against their wanting to build a Canada in their 
own image. I have known for a long time that Quebec has no place 
in there. We are in each other's way because we are two 
different peoples with two different ways of doing things. And 
there are nine allies on the other side who sign documents, only 
to go back on their word afterwards. The Prime Minister did it 
yesterday by not adhering to the social union agreement with 
regard to transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister told us that the Constitution's general store 
was closed. I can tell you that the Prime Minister's boutique is 
open for business and that federal officials are getting in 
through the back door and getting ready to change everything in 
this country, trying to impose upon Quebec their own vision of 
Canada. They are telling us: “You will comply. You will be 
pleased to get equalization payments. You will be pleased that 
there is no productive policy for Quebec. 
You will be pleased with things such as the energy line in the 
past, even though you are not getting your share of the research 
and development envelope. But you have equalization payments. 
You have more employment insurance, more unemployment 
insurance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be because unemployment is on the rise and federal 
policies have something to do with it? 
All the yes-men, all the happy beggars, Liberal members from 
Quebec, applaud their leader.

If they think they can impose their own vision of Canada, the 
Bloc will be here to defend Quebec's true interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not give in, as those on the other side constantly do,

Parti Quebecois talk about the per capita equalization.  I find 
that strangely ironic because I guess some deal was cooked up 
with the previous Conservative government, the Quebec government 
and other governments.  It is fine to have nice little cosy 
deals, but when they are not fair, that is when we speak up. What 
we have here is a per capita equalization on the CHST that is 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member forgets to mention is the equalization. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the new equalization formula calculated over a 
five-year period, the have-not provinces will get $5 billion more 
in the next five years than they did in the last five. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, Quebec is one of those less prosperous provinces.  Why is 
it less prosperous?  Because of the policies and politics of the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the equalization payments, Quebec received in 
1997-98 $4.2 billion, and in 1998-99 $4 billion.  That is about 
half of all equalization.  In fact it will allow the province of 
Quebec to balance its budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member conveniently forgets the equalization.  He 
conveniently forgets the fairness of the per capita CHST. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not forget it, in fact I 
alluded to it in my speech. The member would know this if he had 
listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I said that this so-called fair-play and fairness was in fact 
hypocrisy to us, this is living proof of what I meant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Quebec is getting more through equalization, and that may 
well be the case, it is because research centres are primarily 
located in Ontario, not in Quebec, it is because goods and 
services are bought primarily in Ontario, not in Quebec. The 
government would like us to believe that we are charity cases. 
We do not want charity, we want productive investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of speech heard even before Confederation. When 
we got together back in 1840, Ontario was in debt, but not 
Quebec. 
They said “Let us be fair and have everyone contribute”. This is 
their idea of fairness. Today, they are again talking about 
fairness. They are saying “You have equalization, we are giving 
you money, you should be pleased with our generosity”. In the 
meantime, they make money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, think of the money invested in Ontario with the 
Borden line, to the detriment of Quebec, and with the auto pact, 
again to the detriment of Quebec. This is productive money, 
unlike the money for welfare and unemployment, as they well 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is total hypocrisy to tell us that you love us, that you give 
us money. If you love us so much, are you prepared to pay for 
Quebec to stay? In any case, I do not believe you for one

we get into this, I think it is prudent to remark on the term 
“hypocritical”. My understanding is that in the form and the 
context used by the hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, he did 
not refer beyond generalities to an action.  He did not refer to 
a specific person or individual but to a circumstance.  It is 
important that that point be made. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have a clear enough 
understanding of what fair play is to know that when my

about fair play, we know that what he is really talking about is 
hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand the concept well enough to know that it is not 
fair play he is talking about but hypocrisy, because if funding 
is on a per capita basis, that is fair, we get 23% of the social 
transfer, fine.  Why not in research and development?  Why not 
in procurement of goods and services?  Why not in regional 
development?  How can they talk about fair play when, if 
something is productive, it is not good for Quebec, but a great 
boost for Ontario? 
But, when health is on the table, fair play is dragged into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a double standard:  it cannot be fair to one party and not 
the other.  If there is agreement for per capita funding, then 
that is what it should be across the board.  And the day we see 
that, we will not need Ottawa, among other things.  We will keep 
our money for our own affairs.  What we do not need is to send 
it here, have it processed by a few bureaucrats and then receive 
it back in another envelope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can work out whatever arrangement they want with the rest 
of Canada.  That is their business and I want nothing to do with 
it. 
But our money belongs to us and we are not receiving it in 
productive sectors, because per capita funding has gone by the 
board.  But when it comes time to redistribute the money for 
health and social assistance, the per capita formula applies. 
Especially for social assistance.  Talk about inconsistencies! 
Will any member opposite rise in their place and defend their

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time 
with the hon. member for Chatham—Kent Essex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 federal budget is good news for the people of 
Guelph—Wellington.  Last August I concluded a prebudget survey 
asking constituents what they would like to see in the budget.  I 
sent a copy of the responses to my colleague the Minister of 
Finance.  I am proud to say that he listened to the needs of our 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When asked about their budget priorities, the most common answer 
in my riding was health care.  This is a health care budget.  An 
increase of $11.5 billion dollars over five years with an 
immediate transfer of $3.5 billion is great news for everyone. 
This infusion of funds brings the so-called health care component 
of the Canada health and social transfer back to the level it was 
before the period of restraint in the mid-1990s.  It is very 
important to note that all of this money will go directly to 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A health accord was recently reached as part of the social union 
negotiations.  There the federal government agreed to increase 
funding for health care.  In turn, the provinces promised to 
dedicate all new health money to health spending.  The federal 
government has upheld its end of the bargain.  I am confident 
that the provinces will do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The era of federal-provincial struggles is over.  The social 
union agreement established an administrative framework for the 
management of Canada's crucial social programs.  It established a 
process of dispute avoidance and resolution.  It is proof that by 
working together the provincial, territorial and federal 
governments can build a better Canada.  I believe that this 
atmosphere of co-operation will continue into the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will this health care money benefit the residents of 
Guelph—Wellington?  It will be used to address the immediate 
problems of the medicare system, bed shortages, waiting lists and 
staffing difficulties. 
However, it will also be used to ensure the long term survival 
and fitness of the health care system that Canadians everywhere 
are so very proud of, a system that is the model for countries 
around the world.

they will receive the money that they need.  This way every 
province will be able to meet the needs of its residents at its 
own pace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to money for front line services, $1.4 billion has 
been allocated to improve health information systems so that 
Canadians know how their health care dollars are being spent.  It 
will also be used to promote health related research and 
innovation in areas like breast cancer treatment and the Canadian 
institutes of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it will focus on prevention and ways to promote 
community health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something else that is big news for Guelph—Wellington is the 
equalization of transfer payments.  It used to be that the have 
provinces, including Ontario, received a lower per capita amount 
under the CHST.  Within three years these payments will be 
equalized so that every Canadian receives the same transfer 
payment because after all, Canadians want a society where 
everyone is treated equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to health care funding, many residents of 
Guelph—Wellington wanted tax cuts.  Once again the federal 
government has delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the federal government initiated a program of 
progressive tax cuts.  This year we have built on that foundation 
by increasing the basic personal income tax credit from $6,456 to 
$7,131, an increase of $675. The 3% surtax has also been 
eliminated.  Families with incomes of up to $45,000 will see 
their taxes reduced by at least 10%.  When combined with the 
measures announced in the previous budget, this amounts to $16.5 
billion in tax relief over three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures will also take an additional 200,000 low income 
Canadians off the tax rolls.  Further, the federal government has 
allocated an additional $300 million for the child tax benefit. 
The threshold for benefits has been increased to allow almost $2 
million for low and modest income families to receive benefits. 
This is an important tool in the fight against child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the residents of Guelph—Wellington, tax relief means more 
money in people's pockets but not at the expense of our standard 
of living.  It is because we have balanced the budget that we are 
able to do things like cut taxes and increase spending on social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do not believe that we should throw caution to the 
wind.  We will not make decisions today that will run us into the 
red causing future generations to pay for past mistakes.  No, we 
will continue to project two-year fiscal plans to have a 
contingency fund and to use that contingency fund to pay down the 
debt if it is not needed for other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only the second time since 1951 that a federal 
government has recorded two balanced or surplus budgets back to 
back.  It is also only the third time since Confederation that we 
have had four consecutive years of budgets in the black.  We will 
continue to improve on our nation's financial situation while 
improving the standard of living for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot pursue either goal at the expense of the other, but 
rather, we must achieve balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The University of Guelph is one of the best post-secondary 
institutions in Canada and an important part of my community.  It 
too will benefit from this budget and therefore so will the 
people of Guelph—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 federal budget builds on the Canadian opportunities 
strategy announced last spring.  Over the next three years the 
federal government has allocated $1.8 billion for the creation, 
sharing and commercialization of knowledge and innovation.  This 
money will benefit the University of Guelph in a very real way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Foundation for Innovation will distribute $200 
million to improve research infrastructure.  The Natural Sciences 
and Engineering Research Council will receive an additional $75 
million to fund research and graduate studies.  Biotechnology 
research will receive a $55 million boost over three years. Larry 
Milligan at the University of Guelph has been very involved in 
this field.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once this knowledge is created the federal government will work 
to commercialize new technology, thereby helping to strengthen 
our economy and create jobs.  Young people especially will 
benefit from this commitment to research and innovation because 
they will be on the cutting edge of technology and possess the 
skills needed to succeed in today's marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our method is working.  The 1998 budget announced the Canada 
education savings grant to help parents save for their children's 
education.  I am happy to report this program has been twice as 
successful as projected.  Between 1972 when registered education 
savings plans were introduced and 1997 there was a net 
accumulation of $2.5 billion in the plan.  With the introduction 
of last year's CESG that amount increased to $4 billion, which is 
very impressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of the success of our fiscal management program 
is continued job creation.  Our national unemployment rate is 
7.8%, the lowest it has been since 1990.  In Guelph the rate is 
5.8%.  Last year youth employment saw its largest increase in 20 
years.  Canada leads the G-7 in job growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over three-quarters of the new spending outlined in this budget 
reflects two of the highest priorities of the constituents of 
Guelph—Wellington and of all Canadians, health care and access 
to knowledge and innovation.  However, it does not neglect other 
important areas such as funding for youth, justice, foreign aid 
and Canadian forces personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend my colleague, the Minister of Finance, 
on a budget that benefits the people of Guelph—Wellington and 
Canadians everywhere.  This budget not only reflects the 
priorities of Canadians but the goals of the government.  We will 
strengthen universal health care, provide tax relief for our 
citizens, fight child poverty and invest to increase our standard 
of living by promoting access to knowledge, research and 
innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget reflects the balanced approach for which the Liberal 
government is known.  It is one of the reasons Canadians have 
elected us to form two consecutive majority governments.  While 
reducing our debt to GDP ratio is important, something we have 
done and will continue to do, our bottom line is people.  We were 
elected by them to help improve their lives by steering the 
nation on the right course. Given the contents of this budget I 
would say we are definitely doing our job.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning the media were reporting that the President of the 
Treasury Board and the Minister of Human Resources Development 
saw a benefit of federalism in the budget. Good grief, I never 
thought I would agree with ministers from the other side of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a fine example of Canadian federalism:  78% of freed up new 
money will go to the three richest provinces.  Ontario will 
receive nearly 50% of the new money.  The member for 
Guelph—Wellington must be very happy with that.  Quebec will 
receive less than 10% of this new money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other terms, Ontario will be getting $950 million and Quebec, 
$150 million. 
Once again, Quebec is being had, and no federal Liberal minister 
or member is rising to defend the interests of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I put my question to the member for Guelph—Wellington. 
What does she think of the Quebec Liberal doormats, who have not 
taken a stand in the defence of Quebec's interests? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this troubles and 
saddens me.  I see Bloc members continually talking in this 
Chamber only for themselves, only for Quebec and never for the 
rest of Canada.  They do not care about the rest of Canadians. It 
is shameful.  It is an uncaring attitude that the Bloc Quebecois 
members have had ever since the first day they came to this 
Chamber. 
I have seen it on a consistent basis day after day in this 
Chamber.  They truly should be ashamed of themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was what about our federal members from Quebec. 
They continually stand in the House of Commons and talk about 
Quebec, but they talk about Quebec as a part of this great 
country.  They talk about Quebec but they also talk about other 
Canadians.  Why do they do this?  Because they care, they have 
compassion and they have humanity.  They do not only wish to 
serve themselves as the Bloc Quebecois is doing in this Chamber. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
interested in the comments of the member about this being a 
budget.  The bottom line is that this is a budget for people and 
it is very good for the people of her riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the people in my riding of Dartmouth will benefit from 
this budget, there is no question.  We do have some millionaires 
in the riding of Dartmouth and they will get an $8,000 tax break. 
But there are a lot of people in my riding who will not benefit 
from the budget and I am very concerned about those people.  I am 
concerned about the fact that we have high levels of disabilities 
in my community, and Nova Scotia has the highest level in the 
country.  In this budget there is $5 million earmarked for the 
disabled and that is an incredibly pitiful amount, given the 
state of disabilities in the country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very concerned of the fact that there is no money for 
social housing.  There is no money to go back into the EI fund 
which has been in fact robbed in order to allow the Minister of 
Finance his so-called health budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how the member believes that this budget is 
reflecting the needs of the one million poor children in this 
country who received nothing whatsoever from the budget, not at 
all affected by the child tax credit.  How is the budget good for 
these children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously they are 
getting a benefit from the budget because of the child tax 
credit.  We have increased that amount to poor families.  There 
is no doubt that children in bad straits come from low income 
families.  We have made a provision for that in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have addressed taxes in the budget.  We have also addressed a 
major concern.  When the member says in Dartmouth maybe we have 
done a little for them, my goodness surely the people in 
Dartmouth will benefit from the health care provisions.  The 
people in Dartmouth will benefit from the provisions for youth, 
for justice and for the military.  Surely the people from 
Dartmouth will benefit from all these things in the budget.  I 
know they will. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, over the last 10 years that I have been in the House I 
have never heard the opposition suggest there is a perfect budget 
or a perfect answer to any question the government puts forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all realize its job is to criticize and try to find practices 
and policies which it feels the average Canadian would disagree 
with.  One of the things I have heard over the last couple of 
days from my constituents is this is a pretty good budget. This 
is a plan that is moving our Canadian culture and society forward 
in many different ways.  If we stop and think about it, it does 
hold a tremendous amount of positives for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to examine three areas of the budget that are very 
important to all Canadians.  The message that comes forth in my 
view is we have a rock solid economy which is the foundation by 
which business, social programs and all that we stand for as 
Canadians can advance. 
Clearly that rock solid foundation has been built by the cabinet 
of the Liberal Party, by the finance minister and by the members 
of the House.  I want to make it very clear it was a combination 
of all members here as well as Canadian society in general who 
have told the House, the finance minister and the government what 
directions they would like to see in this budget.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process has changed dramatically today compared with what it 
was 10 years ago.  Thinking back 10 years when I first came to 
this House a budget leak occurred the night before the budget was 
to be released.  Suddenly, from the Conservative government, all 
the budgets were sent out and everybody ran in circles and nobody 
knew what to do because it was a very secretive process, a 
process in which Canadians did not have a great deal of input and 
as a result I guess there was a tremendous amount of 
dissatisfaction at the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have changed that process dramatically.  Today we are very 
transparent.  We are very open in consulting Canadians.  As a 
matter of fact, the premier point that I can make with this 
budget is there was nothing new.  Canadians knew what was coming 
down in the budget long before the budget day announcement.  They 
did not know the fine details, but they certainly knew the 
direction in which this government was heading because of the 
consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, that probably is the number one change that has 
occurred to make Canadians a part of the process and therefore 
Canadians are very happy with the result of the process as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three areas I want to touch on are the rock solid economy and 
how that is helping the Canadian economy grow, investment in 
social and economic priorities, and the substantial, fair tax 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about this rock solid economy that we are building 
today and in the future, all we have to do is look at the process 
over the last five years.  We had a $42 billion deficit to tackle 
in 1993 when we were elected. Through very tough programs, 
through very difficult decisions Canadians worked along with the 
government to make sure we did not bankrupt this country and 
leave our children and our children's children in dire 
situations.  The process was to eliminate the deficit and get 
our house in order. No one in the House can question that putting 
our house in order was a priority that had to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We paid down the deficit and now we are in a position where we 
are starting to pay down the debt.  The debt to GDP ratio has had 
the largest decline in 40 years in this past year, which went 
from approximately 70.3% to 66.9%.  What it really means is that 
we are getting to a point where we can better afford the debt we 
have.  With the growth the country is experiencing we will be in 
a much better position not only today but in future years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done all we can to support business and make sure 
business has opportunity to grow in this country and expand 
beyond our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For technology partnerships, for aid to business support in 
technology areas, this budget put $380 million.  For the Canadian 
Foundation for Research in which we are moving research forward, 
helping universities, helping technological growth in the 
Canadian foundation as well as teaching hospitals which then feed 
off into our social net, $800 million was placed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the successes we have had in working with foreign 
markets, developing opportunities for business to expand beyond 
our borders, making Canada a world trader and making sure that we 
have stable businesses in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, over this period of four or five years, 
interest rates have been on a constant decline.  There is no 
question that interest rates have afforded business the 
opportunity for greater investment, to move forward and to grow. 
As a result our economy is rated number one in the G-7.  That is 
not frivolous.  That has happened because of serious careful 
planning which has made a huge difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the former government during the 1993 election 
campaign stating that unemployment would remain in double digit 
figures until well beyond the year 2000.  That was not quite 
accurate.  That was a quote from a former prime minister.  She 
said very clearly that unemployment would remain in double digit 
figures at least beyond the year 2000.  Today, unemployment is at 
7.8%.  This drop in unemployment tells us something about the 
social values of the country because there is no greater move to 
ensure social stability than ensured jobs for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not been able to answer every social problem in the 
country, but we did not start out under the best circumstances 
either.  The distance we have gone, from the comments of my 
constituents, is tremendous.  They are very thankful for the 
kinds of policies and issues we have moved forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investing in the social economic side of things is another 
important issue.  We know when we looked at the figures over the 
last several years that youth employment was terrible and we had 
to improve it.  That is why over the last several years we have 
focused on a youth employment strategy.  This year, next year and 
the year after we will be putting $465 million into youth 
employment strategies, which will give young people opportunities 
to develop job skills, to develop scenarios of work, and to 
develop the skills they need to become active participants in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also very important that tax relief has been included in 
the budget.  That tax relief is for all Canadians.  I look 
forward to the questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened to the hon. member for Chatham—Kent Essex and to the 
member for Guelph—Wellington and others.  The member for 
Chatham—Kent Essex said there was no one on the opposition 
benches willing to give the government a passing grade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the government a passing grade on getting the budget 
into the black.  Most members over here would give a passing 
grade for eliminating the deficit and putting the budget in the 
black. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like the report cards kids bring home from school on which 
it is indicated in very careful teacher's writing beside the 
marks that the student is capable of doing much better.  The 
government is certainly capable of doing much better.  It has 
barely received a passing grade.  Now it is time to really go to 
work and do the business the country needs done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Guelph—Wellington talked of knowledge based 
industries.  The government put a levy on CD-ROMs to help the 
music industry in Canada.

Those knowledge based industries will not hire people.  They will 
go to the States, Mexico, Ireland or someplace where they are 
welcome because they will not be able to afford to work here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it difficult that 
my hon. colleague, the Conservative member across the way, is 
saying that the government is not perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who drove us to where we were when we took over in 1993?  It was 
a roller coaster ride from way up there to a deficit of $42 
billion down there.  What on earth did they do for knowledge 
based industries then?  Where did they lead the Canadian economy, 
aside from dividing the country and making people so extremely 
angry that they ended up with a caucus of two that could be put 
in a phone booth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public spoke.  The public knows what they did.  Today the 
public is not saying the same thing.  The public has returned 
this government with two solid majorities.  They should listen to 
the public.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague, who initially claimed the opposition was doing a very 
good job.  However, I would like to tell him that we are here 
not just to criticize the government.  I myself came here to 
resolve the constitutional crisis, this abyss toward which 
Canada keeps moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, when he talks of consultation and transparency, I 
think we have to take it with a grain of salt.  Barely a few 
days before the budget was tabled, the premiers met to discuss 
health and the provincial transfers. 
There was never any question at that point of returning the 
money with criteria other than those used to determine where to 
cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know today whether my colleague thinks the Prime 
Minister had consultations and acted with transparency? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to talk 
to that point.  We in Canada are successful because we have 
different values across the country.  We have different economic 
situations across the country.  We try as a federation to make 
sure that all sectors of the country are heard and have fair and 
equal opportunity to do well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times when my province and I looked at some of the 
issues that came up in federal policy which showed the Ontario 
government had less money than some other poorer provinces, some 
other provinces that were not doing as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general the wealthier help the other provinces.  This has 
been the goal and the rule of the country.  Quite frankly I think 
on a general scale Quebec has been treated equally to all 
provinces on all measures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I encountered many of my Liberal friends in the 
hallways and around Parliament Hill and they all said the same 
thing:  “Wasn't that a wonderful budget?”  I said “Not the one

was a distasteful budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If Brian Mulroney had been sitting in the opposition gallery, he 
would have been cheering for almost the entire budget.  He would 
not believe that things could get this right wing in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received an e-mail this morning—and I know others received it 
as well—announcing the guest speaker Saturday night at the unite 
the right convention in Ottawa.  Guess who it is?  The person 
that symbolizes real right wing fanaticism in the country, the 
single individual who has moved the right wing agenda of our 
country about 185 degrees to the right, the Minister of Finance. 
The Minister of Finance must be the guest speaker Saturday night 
at the unite the right conference because there is no better 
spokesperson for the right wing than the hon. Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That went out this morning to all sorts of people who are 
curious about this weekend's events.  Now we know at least who 
the Saturday night guest speaker will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  No one is surprised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  As my friend from Winnipeg says, we are 
not surprised.  We are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought Brian Mulroney was kind of a wild and woolly right 
winger.  Compared to the Minister of Finance he sounds like some 
kind of economic piker.  He tried to move the agenda to the right 
but he failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my friends thought at the time this seemed a bit 
perplexing.  As a matter of fact, back in 1990 the Minister of 
Finance he wrote a report on housing.  He spent a number of weeks 
touring the country on housing and wrote a report on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, to be fair, he used the term homelessness 
once in his budget.  The term was actually there.  There was one 
reference to the fact that we have homeless people in the 
country.  We happen to have hundreds of thousands of homeless 
people.  This has been identified by the mayors of every major 
city in Canada as a national tragedy.  The finance minister did 
mention it.  Here is what he had to say in 1990: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal role in housing must not be a residual one.  The 
connection between housing and other aspects of both social and 
economic policy means that the federal government must take a 
lead role.  Only the national government has the financial 
resources to address the full dimensions of the needs of this 
country. 
</UL>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  He didn't say that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  He did.  He said earlier this decade 
that only the federal government should be taking the leadership. 
It was only the federal government that had the resources to show 
leadership.  He mentioned homelessness in his budget.  What did 
he about it?  Nothing.  There was not a red cent toward housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayors of the major cities were shocked.  We all got faxes 
and e-mails in the last couple of days.  Mr. Speaker, you will 
probably have a whole pile on your desk when you get back to your 
office.  They were disgusted and dismayed.  They found it 
unbelievable that at a time when we have not $1 billion or $2 
billion or $5 billion or $10 billion but more in surplus that not 
a red cent was given to the housing crisis, the housing tragedy 
in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were a Liberal sitting across there today, I would run out 
of here in shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  There they go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  There they go.  I do not blame them.  I 
would too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Most of them have already.  They are 
not even here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  There is something else that is strange 
about the budget.  The Minister of Finance should be arrested and 
charged.  I will tell you why, Mr. Speaker.  A few years ago an 
individual called Doug Small leaked a little bit of a federal 
budget.  He was a broadcaster in Ottawa.  He leaked a few phrases 
of the budget and was charged by the RCMP.  He went to court for 
leaking a budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance leaked the entire budget.  Every major 
issue has been out in the public domain for weeks and weeks.  He 
should be charged by the RCMP for leaking his own budget.  Why 
did he do that?  Why did the Minister of Finance leak his own 
budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House.  I will have trouble saying it, so I will 
have to muster up my courage.  When the Conservatives were in 
office they had guts.  They actually believed in certain things. 
I do not believe in them.  Most Canadians do not believe in them, 
but the Tories believed in them.  They said the GST was good for 
Canada.  They did not leak it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember Michael Wilson rising and saying “We will introduce 
a GST tax for every walking Canadian”, and the Tories jumped up 
in applause.  They thought it was a great idea.  He also said 
“We have a better one.  We will give a $500,000 capital tax 
exemption for major capital raised in the country”.  There was a 
standing ovation for that one.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They announced it during the budget.  They did not float it out 
weeks before and then do focus groups, polling and trial balloons 
to see what works and what does not work.  This is not 
leadership.  This is cowardly leadership where before they say a 
single word as leaders on financial matters, they test every 
single phrase, every single word, every nuance.  If it does not 
fly then they will not say it.  If it is popular then they will 
say it.  That is not what leadership is.  Leadership is when they 
come in here based on convictions and make announcements on what 
they want to do.  That is not what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What are you saying, do not consult 
Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Does the member think the Minister of 
Finance did not consult Canadians?  He did.  I was part of the 
consultation process.  It is called prebudget consultations. I 
will tell my Liberal friend that the finance committee went into 
every province asking Canadians to come forward and tell us what 
they thought should be done with the surplus.  That was their 
task.  Not a single individual said that the priorities should be 
major tax cuts.  We talked to hundreds of people.  Nobody said 
ignore the homeless, ignore the unemployed, ignore students with 
huge debtloads. They did not say that. They said address these 
serious issues, including health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I went out to consult Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast and asked them what should be in the budget, none of them 
said this stuff.  None of them said they wanted this budget. They 
said they wanted a whole bunch of advances on important fronts. 
What did this Minister of Finance do?  He ignored people.  If we 
go out on the streets of Canada today and ask people what they 
think of this budget they will say that there is nothing in it 
for them.  They did not get anything out of it. Their family did 
not get anything out of it.  They are unemployed.  There is 
nothing in it for them.  There are students $40,000 in debt. 
There is nothing in it for them.  There are single moms on social 
assistance trying to raise three kids. There is nothing in it for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know one guy who is really happy.  Mr. Cleghorn, the CEO of 
the Royal Bank, made a tax break of $30,000 on that announcement. 
He is $30,000 richer today because of this budget. Bob Cleghorn 
is a happy camper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House who is not a happy camper.  The hundreds 
of thousands of single moms and single dads raising children on 
social assistance.  They did not get a single cent from this 
budget.  What kind of a government is that?  What kind of a 
government alienates and ignores Canadians?  For political 
scientists watching this, this is the classic liberalism.  It is 
the Darwinian approach to social policy where the weak die and 
the strong survive.  It is survival of the fittest.  It is based 
on the key role of the individual in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance in his budget actually said that the 
marketplace cannot deal with the social issues of the country. It 
requires a government.  We measure the value of a government not 
by how it treats the Bob Cleghorns of the world, the 
millionaires.  We measure a government by how it treats ordinary 
citizens, particularly citizens in need.  Were the homeless 
recognized in this budget?  No, they were not.  Were the people 
who today are looking for work recognized?  No, they were 
ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us identify a single group of young people.  This morning 
1.5 million children who are living in poverty because their 
parents are living in poverty woke up still living in poverty. 
Is there anything in this budget that is going to change their 
lives to give them hope and optimism?  There is nothing for the 
1.5 million kids living in poverty.  How can my Liberal friends 
sit there and not do anything about it and applaud and say this 
is some great budget?  It is very sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said this was a health care budget.  What does someone who 
knows about health care say about it?  Let us ask the president 
of the Canadian Medical Association. He said it had moved it from 
being an emergency situation to a urgent situation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He acknowledges that over the next number of years the 
government is to restore funding.  Why? Some members will 
remember back in 1995 the occurrence of the Ottawa chainsaw 
massacre.  The Minister of Finance came in here with a chainsaw 
and started to hack $1 million, $2 million, $2.5 million out of 
the health care budget, one of the major symbols of what it means 
to be a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a quality health care system. Yes, I know it started with 
the NDP in the province of Saskatchewan and built up over the 
years, but it was a showcase that we could show around the world 
as what one can do as a country.  President Clinton tried to 
emulate it but he lost that battle.  He said look at what 
Canadians have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To every single Canadian it was a symbol of what differentiated 
us from others.  It was the best of being Canadian.  What did 
this government do?  It just followed suit of Brian Mulroney and 
came here with a chainsaw and started hacking the health care 
system year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally this year the government says “Whoops, we blew it.  We 
made a mistake.  We cut too deeply.  We have destroyed the 
system”.  If one looks carefully out there one will see the 
stealth like change occurring to health care as it is being 
privatized.  Thirty per cent of health care funding today is in 
the private sector.  Nobody talks about this because they are 
embarrassed to talk about it.  It is all because of the slashing, 
hacking and whacking of the health care budget that allowed the 
private sector to move into the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at what this will do.  The government says it 
will restore some of the funding and in a few years from now it 
will be at the same level it was back in 1995.  Big bloody deal. 
In other words, after years of restoration we are going to be at 
the same level we were back in the middle part of this decade. 
Is that progress? At the same time inflation is moving along and 
the population is increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supposed to be cheering here today because the funding is 
to be restored in a few years back to the levels of 1995. This is 
almost unbelievable.  It is pathetic. Somehow this is held up as 
a health care budget.  The reason it is called a health care 
budget is it did not do a bloody thing to anything else.  Nothing 
else was recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we all acknowledge, including the Minister of Finance in 
his comments the other day, that the small business sector 
accounts for most of the jobs being created in Canada. One would 
expect, at a time when we have levels of joblessness in this 
country that have been for the last decade the highest since the 
Great Depression, that the government would want to do something 
significant in terms of creating employment opportunities and 
grow the economy into meaningful jobs with the recognition that 
this involves the small business sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would one not expect the Minister of Finance to do the right 
thing and say he would make the small business sector a priority 
by finding ways and means of assisting and supporting the small 
business sector so it can create employment?  I will bet most 
people thought that would happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Minister of Finance, the government and the Liberal 
Party do about small business?  Diddly-squat.  I do not know if 
that is a parliamentary term but I think I will use it anyway.  I 
cannot even say zero because they decided to put $50 million in 
the next little while into the Business Development Bank of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did some calculations and asked what that meant for the 
province of British Columbia.  It means that the province of 
British Columbia will get over the next few years $5 million to 
assist the small business sector.  This is the only initiative 
taken by this government.  It is absolutely incredible that this 
government would be so insensitive, so uncaring, so unrealistic, 
so impractical that it would not do anything to help the sector 
of the economy that is actually creating some employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all.  Good grief, I wish I had a longer speech 
today. Let us acknowledge that the one sector of our economy that 
creates a lot of meaningful employment is the construction 
sector.  We know that the issue of homelessness is a national 
tragedy. 
I do not think there is a single MP in this House who would not 
say we have a housing crisis in this country.  We have to work at 
this.  We live in the second largest country in the world.  There 
are trees from one end of this country to the other.  We have 
land everywhere.  We have the banks filled with money and we have 
a housing crisis.  To have a housing crisis you have to really 
work at this.  Our government has somehow been able to do that, 
to create a housing crisis.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago the government said it had a big deficit and 
that it could not do much so it was going to get out of the 
business of social housing, out of the business of assisting in 
the development of affordable housing for Canadians.  People said 
that is fair enough, they understood that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are into a situation where we have billions in surplus. 
We have people who do not have houses to live in.  We have many 
more people who do not have decent houses to live in.  They are 
trying to raise children in substandard housing.  I had a moving 
evening one night speaking with the grand chief of Canada.  I 
asked what crucial issue facing aboriginal people we could begin 
to address in the House of Commons.  He answered that it was 
obviously housing.  He asked me to imagine being a young first 
nation child growing up and trying to do homework in a two room 
house with 13 people living in it, no water and no sewage system. 
Imagine trying to raise children in that type of environment, 
and for some that is a good place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been waiting and now that we have $10 billion or $15 
billion in surplus we think we will see some action.  It is not 
that it was not encouraged.  At every single stop as we 
criss-crossed the country people said we should take a step to 
confront the housing issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The construction consortiums from coast to coast said the 
following:  “The industry wishes to help in the development of 
housing infrastructure in this country.  Housing infrastructure 
would put tens of thousands of unemployed Canadians back to work 
at meaningful jobs and do a great deal in addressing this serious 
problem in our country”.  Create jobs and confront a major 
social issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayors of all the major cities got together and asked what 
they could do.  They said that it is an emergency and a tragedy. 
We should put 1% of this year's budget into housing.  That is a 
little over a billion dollars into housing that would really show 
leadership on this.  This is a term that is no longer part of the 
Liberal vocabulary but I will try it anyway.  That would provide 
leadership on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Finance had said 
we are committed to dealing with this issue, we are going to 
allocate 1% of the national budget to the housing sector, 
there would have been a standing ovation around this house and a 
standing ovation from one part of this country to the other.  But 
he did not.  He said we are not going to put a single penny 
into housing, we are not going to take a single step toward 
resolving social housing and affordable housing in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Let's not forget the provinces have 
an important responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  The Minister of Finance said in 1990: 
“Only the federal government has the resources to provide 
leadership on this crucial social issue”.  My friend should be 
embarrassed for suggesting that it is up to the provinces when 
her own Minister of Finance said quite the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much to talk about in terms of this budget.  At the end 
of his budget speech the Minister of Finance quoted Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier saying that the 20th century belonged to Canada.  We are 
entering the 21st century.  What a terrible way to be exiting the 
20th century with one and a half million kids living in poverty 
with the government doing nothing to alleviate it.  There are 
hundreds of thousands of homeless people on the streets yet the 
government does nothing. When we walk out of here today we can 
see on every main corner in the city of Ottawa, the nation's 
capital, people begging with caps in hand, and the government 
does nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing symbolizes this budget.  We acknowledge in this House 
that parents dependent on social assistance and attempting and 
struggling to raise families are not getting a single cent of 
benefit from this budget while millionaires walk away with at 
least $8,000 in extra cash. 
It means that the gap between those who have and have not in this 
country continues to widen, thanks to this budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is apparent that the last 
speaker obviously spent more time reading his speech than 
listening to what the minister of finance from British Columbia 
had to say and what the premier of Saskatchewan had to say.  It 
is obvious he spent more time writing his speech than actually 
reading the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member suggesting, given that poverty is one of the 
single greatest indicators of health and given that the ability 
to have access to good health care increases productivity 
remarkably, that he would not have had us make health care a 
priority in the budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think that we should not have dealt with the GST 
so that single parents in very low income circumstances would 
begin to get the maximum of their GST rebate supplement in a 
timely manner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child tax benefit is going to give $1,975 for the first 
child and an extra $1,775 for the second child in the family. 
That may not sound like a lot of money but it is a substantial 
increase of almost $4,000 to a low income family of two. The 
child tax benefit moved the level up from $26,000 to $29,000 
which may sound like a great deal of money but which is poverty 
and low income circumstances as far as I am concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many initiatives that are helping poor single 
parents in the budget.  Had the member taken the time to read the 
budget he would have known that. Does the hon. member not think 
we should have done all of those things? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
because it allows me to say two or three points which I forgot to 
mention.  By the way, I did not write out my speech, as she could 
probably tell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did I listen to the Minister of Finance, I was in the 
lockup and read all the documents for four straight hours. 
Therefore, it is not as though this were some kind of a flippant 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me inform my hon. friend that a mother on social 
assistance raising children does not get the child tax benefit. 
It is clawed back by the provincial government and the member 
should know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member goes home next week I would ask her to visit 
some of the families in her constituency. Ask them how delighted 
they are with the federal budget.  I know what she is going to 
hear.  They probably do not even know there was a federal budget 
and thank goodness because they were overlooked in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should I or they be thankful for this little tiny handout?  That 
is like walking down the street and getting mugged. Somebody 
takes your wallet with all your money and credit cards and then 
says “By the way pal, here is your wallet back” and you are 
supposed to be thankful for getting the wallet back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If all the minister has to say about child poverty is that there 
is going to be, in her own mind, some minute benefit because of 
the GST—minute benefit I believe are her own words—if that is 
the only initiative that the government has taken, I would hope 
that she would feel kind of badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part of her question was that investing in 
productivity will eventually benefit poor people.  Boy, there is 
Ms. Trickle Down herself.  This is trickle down economics at its 
best:  give breaks to the wealthy; give breaks to some of the big 
corporations; give certain select tax breaks and grants; wait for 
a few weeks, months or years and eventually some will trickle 
down. Canadians have told her many times they do not want to be 
trickled on any more.  They want some trickle up economics, not 
trickle down economics.

voice to that of the hon. member of the New Democratic Party in 
denouncing the Liberal government's lack of will to eradicate 
poverty across Canada, and in Quebec in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the new Canada social transfer formula, which 
penalizes Quebec in particular in terms of health care, is a 
historic achievement. To rely exclusively on a per capita 
formula without taking the needs of the population into account 
really hurts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We keep hearing that Quebec is getting more in equalization 
payments, but we know what that means. It means more people on 
welfare. In turn, this means more people who may need adequate 
health care and better access to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, the rich provinces, the provinces whose economy is 
vibrant and where people can better support themselves and have 
access to quality services, are favoured. That is what hurts 
when we say that this government is not addressing the poverty 
issue in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither is there any provision to increase EI benefits in high 
unemployment regions, especially in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing on social housing. We know how much the federal 
government likes to negotiate third-rate agreements with Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore add my voice to that of the member of the New 
Democratic Party in denouncing the government's lack of will to 
eradicate poverty across Canada. They can give us equalization 
all they want, that is not what we need. We could use more in 
terms of investments in the procurement of government services 
in Quebec, which could result in job creation. That is the kind 
of measure we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague from the New Democratic Party to 
elaborate on that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend has 
summarized a number of obvious concerns regarding the budget. She 
referred to one aspect that I do not have time to address and 
that is the whole issue of employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is well known by all members and most Canadians that 
one of the reasons the government has a surplus in order to 
provide some of these initiatives is as a result of taking a lot 
of money out of the EI fund.  That is really an insurance fund; 
it ought not to be a source of government revenues. It is also 
fair for her to say that it is acknowledged that the level of 
benefits is inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to note on doing an analysis the other day 
that a few years ago 75% of people who lost their jobs and had 
paid into the EI fund actually were able to collect some 
benefits. That has gone down now to about 34% on average across 
Canada. Interestingly enough this 34% is the same level as that 
in the great state of Arkansas, the state which is held as 
probably one of the crummiest states in which to live in terms of 
social policy.  We have now reduced our social program called EI 
or unemployment insurance down to one of the lowest levels of the 
United States, which is what a lot of people feared would occur. 
We thought we would now see some obvious recognition of this 
imbalance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to say in response to my friend that when we went 
into this budget, the social playing field if I can call it that, 
was very much tilted, out of whack.  The gap between those who 
have and those who have not was increasing.  This was an 
opportunity to level the playing field in social policy, to make 
it a little bit more even so that a child growing up in one part 
of Canada under certain circumstances would have a similar 
opportunity as a child growing up in another part of Canada. In 
other words, level the playing field so people have an equal 
opportunity to become the productive citizens they wish to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was that playing field improved, or was it tilted even further? 
It was actually tilted even further.  The gap was made even worse 
as a result of this budget, which is why I started off my speech 
by saying that I found it to be a rather disgusting budget 
presentation, when we consider what could have been done and what 
was done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at this table—and I am not the one saying it, it is the

</I></B></P><P align=left>A single taxpayer earning $1 million will pocket over $8,000, 
and the bank president will save $30,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So my question to the hon. member is this: Would indexing the 
tax tables not be a fairer way to provide tax relief? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend's 
question.  I can best respond to it by saying there would be a 
fair way to approach this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His figures were accurate. I did some checking locally.  He was 
right that a bank president like Mr. Cleghorn would save about 
$30,000 as a result. Bob Price, a gentleman who works in my 
constituency, calculated that he would benefit by about $115 a 
year. This is on taxes.  Remember that at the same time there is 
a tax benefit of $115, the government is taking that much more in 
CPP payments.  In a sense he will actually lose. Carol Smith, a 
single mom raising two children on social assistance, got nothing 
in terms of tax benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously this is a very unfair approach in terms of how the tax 
system is modified.  My friend's suggestion is worth looking at 
and has considerable merit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will share 
my time with the hon. member for Charleswood St. 
James—Assiniboia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to congratulate the Minister of Finance and his 
staff for the remarkable job they did once again this year with 
the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the second year in a row, our federal budget, the Canadians' 
budget, succeeded in being deficit free, this after two decades 
of running deficits. The light is no longer at the end of the 
tunnel, because we have come out of the tunnel. We have every 
reason to be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heartily congratulate the minister for having focused his 
budget on health, thus reflecting the concerns expressed by 
Canadians, who were increasingly worried about health care, to 
the point of thinking that it might be in jeopardy. 
The minister delivered and brilliantly so. Our government 
listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget meets the concerns of my constituents in Laval West 
and of all Canadians. People from all walks of life have 
expressed their legitimate concerns to me. Thanks to the budget, 
these concerns are now greatly alleviated. I am referring to 
issues that concern our aging Canadian population, such as 
health, and the middle generation, which has to deal with the 
dependency of both the younger and older generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This phenomenon will of course not be reversed with the budget, 
but at least this budget will give us the means to adjust to the 
best of our ability to this new situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me mention a few figures to better show the scope of this 
phenomenon. In 1981, 9.6% of the population was 65 or older. 
Since then, this has increased by approximately 1% a year and, 
in 1996, 12% of the population was at least 65 years of age.  It 
is expected that over 20% of Canadians will be in this age group 
by 2031. This means that one in five Canadians will be at least 
65 years old.  Furthermore, I would remind everyone listening 
that this is only 32 years away, and time is flying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aging of our population, a phenomenon common to all 
industrialized countries, has had, and will continue to have, a 
number of important consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, health services must adapt to new demands, for seniors 
have special physical and mental health problems. 
Unfortunately, for instance, they lose their autonomy and their 
mobility.  More gerontologists will therefore be needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long term care is more appropriate for this age group. 
Home care, provided by relatives, helps prevent the loneliness 
to which they are too often prone.  And, of course, research 
must continue, and it must increasingly focus on developing care 
for seniors and the next generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like health care services, social services will also be 
increasingly called upon to meet the needs of a population that 
is demanding programs tailored to its needs.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pensions, for instance, will represent an increasingly large 
component of federal budgets.  Other programs will certainly 
have to be developed to more effectively meet the needs of those 
losing their autonomy.  There must also be support for 
charitable groups and organizations that will undoubtedly come 
on the scene to provide assistance to seniors, which will make 
up one fifth of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the problem will be not so much one of finding 
additional resources as of redistributing them effectively, for 
the rate of dependency will be no higher than it was in the 
1950s and 1960s after the baby boom. 
In those days, the number of young children who depended on 
their parents' work and care was even greater than the number of 
seniors who will depend on social services and on their families 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, part of the population officially categorized as inactive 
belongs to that category because it is getting into the twilight 
years and is taking a well deserved rest to accomplish other 
things. Thirty years ago, there was a similar part of the 
population that was simply too young to work, busy growing up 
and getting an education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that pensions and health care will account for an 
increasing portion of government budgets to meet the needs of 
seniors. Inversely, the portion allocated to family allowances 
and early childhood education will decrease. This trend is well 
reflected in our 1999 budget. 
In other words, in proportion of government revenues, there will 
be more people receiving pensions, but there will be less people 
in our schools and universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the baby boom that followed World War II, millions of young 
people who were not going to enter the labour force until the 
1970s and who required special care were born in Canada. The 
Liberal governments of the day responded to this new situation 
in an intelligent and responsible manner. Specialized social 
services were provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax deductions were granted and the health system put in place 
to respond to a new demographic reality, but today we face a 
similar situation, but in reverse, with an age dependency ratio 
closer to what we had in the 1950s and 1960s. This means moving 
from programs geared toward baby boomers directly to those to be 
developed for seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Programs must once again keep pace with changing demographics. 
Now, we must respond intelligently to an aging population, as we 
did in the past to a younger one. Our government has realized 
how important this is. We have started taking steps and are even 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the health services, the minister has done well. 
Over the next five years, $11.5 billion will be transferred to 
the provinces under the Canada health and social transfer. In 
addition, $1.4 billion will be injected into medical research. 
This is a clear and effective response to the concerns and 
health needs of Canadians in general, and seniors in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rumour has it that the Bloc Quebecois was not too happy with the 
changes made to the terms of transfer under the CHST. Quebec 
will not get as much, they protest. As usual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But our colleagues should know that a budget is a whole, made up 
of different parts. The Minister of Finance can readjust certain 
transfers to make the whole more consistent and ensure that 
everything works properly. He can transfer less under a given 
program in order to transfer more under another. Criticism must 
not be voiced out of context, or deal with concrete issues in 
abstract terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that the so-called cut in transfers 
under the CHST is more than made up by the increase in 
equalization payments. With these two types of transfers, in the 
next 13 months alone, Quebec will receive 48% of all the money 
paid to the provinces, and 29% over the next five years. That is 
not bad for a province with 24% of the Canadian population.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures do not lie.  Quebec, like the rest of Canada, comes 
out a winner with this budget.  In addition to the substantial 
and impressive funds injected into health, the tax relief 
announced in the budget is another way to respond to population 
aging, by leaving more money in the pockets of seniors and the 
families looking after them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 3% surtax introduced to combat the deficit serves no purpose 
now and will disappear completely.  The basic personal exemption 
rises to $7,131.  So the 600,000 Canadians with more modest 
income will not pay income tax.  By the fiscal year 2001-02, our 
government will have cut taxes by $16.5 billion. 
Two million low or middle income families will receive increased 
child benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am unable to finish, because I am out of time, but I would ask 
all members of this House to have the courage to recognize that 
our government, through the Minister of Finance, looked after 
the real problems of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague 
opposite is just as nervy as the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> I do not think the word “nervy” is 
unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The word 
“nervy” in French is an insult, and I reject this insult.  I 
would ask the member to use more polite language with me. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please.  I 
had to get a bit of help because my French is not that good with 
the subtleties.  The help that I received, which is beyond 
reproach, is of course that there are subtleties in the language. 
The use of that particular term could be received by the receiver 
as being bad but it is not necessarily bad.  It depends on the 
thickness of the skin of the person on the receiving end.  Really 
it is more a question of debate than a point of order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I could also have said that 
she is has some nerve, that she has a lot of gall, or that she 
is going too far. There are many synonyms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, the important thing is why I am saying this. We 
need to step back a little. Bloc Quebecois members and 
Quebeckers are upset by what the Minister of Finance calls the 
change in the method of calculating transfers. Why? Because this 
is not a change in the method of calculation, it is the 
rejection by the federal government of the relationship between 
Canada and the provinces, since it took poverty into account 
when calculating transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1969— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I ask the hon. member to 
put her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, in order to put my question, 
I must indicate why I am asking it. 
The Canada assistance plan was established in 1969 to take 
poverty into account. Until the Liberals took office, transfers 
for health and education only took population into account, 
whereas the assistance plan took poverty into account.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, Quebec was getting 34% of the funds from that plan. 
When the Minister of Finance did what was called a block 
transfer he substituted, for the health sector, the figure based 
on the population for a figure that takes poverty into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the hon. member explain that this government, after 
shedding tears over— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for Laval 
West will have an equal amount of time for her response. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is really too bad that the 
hon. member of the Bloc Quebecois got so carried away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to the Quebec finance minister bringing 
down his budget; we will see how much Quebec has gained, not 
lost, from the latest federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the member talks about changes made in the transfers, I 
talk about fairness. Canada is a country where we talk about 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> What fairness? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> Fairness is as important between individuals 
as it is between provinces.

continue. I did not interrupt the hon. member when she spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I raise the issue of fairness, and I am not the only one to 
do so, I include fairness between individuals. And here, through 
transfers and equalization payments to provinces, we will see 
that each individual will be treated fairly on the basis of the 
income earned over the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what fairness is all about in Canada. That is what being 
a Liberal is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to 
address the House in today's budget debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go any further I would like to extend my sincerest 
congratulations to my hon. colleague, the Minister of Finance, on 
the presentation of his sixth budget.  I have had the honour of 
representing my constituents in this place for more than 10 
years.  In all that time I have never seen a budget that was so 
well received by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Average Canadians support the measures in the budget.  I know 
frustrated members opposite are wondering why Canadians are 
feeling so good about budget '99.  I will take the opportunity to 
explain it to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about balance.  The budget builds on and continues the 
tradition of responsible, prudent fiscal management of its five 
predecessors, and provides the balance and fairness that 
Canadians want and expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not skewed to the left with incomprehensible spending, as 
some of the NDP would favour.  It does not provide for the 
irresponsible withering away of the federal government, as the 
Reform Party demands.  It certainly does not manage the nation's 
finances in the capricious manner the Tories were famous for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is balanced, balanced both fiscally and in what it 
provides Canadians.  It is a good news budget for all Canadians. 
That is why it is being so well received across the land, in 
Toronto, Regina, Edmonton and in my home city of Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have only 10 minutes to speak to this important issue, I 
will not spend too much on the minutia of the budget.  Rather I 
would like to concentrate my comments on what the budget means 
for the average Manitoban and the good citizens of Charleswood 
St. James—Assiniboia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us look at health care.  The budget increases federal 
cash transfers for health care to the provinces by an incredible 
$11.5 billion over the next five years.  This is significant.  It 
is a significant reinvestment by any measure and is the single 
largest investment ever announced by the government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cash infusion into our health care system fully restores 
the health component of the Canada health and social transfer to 
its level in the mid-1990s before the attack of the deficit 
curtailed expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this initiative, the Manitoba government will 
receive an additional $425 million in federal transfers to fund 
health care throughout the keystone province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope the provincial government in Manitoba would use 
some of that money to reduce waiting lines, augment staff and 
improve services at the Grace hospital, the main hospital 
servicing the needs of Winnipeg and Headingley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitoba's health care system would also benefit from an 
additional $1.4 billion that this budget sets aside for new 
investments in health pilot projects, prenatal care, aboriginal 
initiatives and health information programs like the screening 
assessment and care planning automated tool recently announced by 
the health minister during a trip to Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether they live in the Courts of St. James or the Kiwanis 
Courts, well known senior citizens complexes in my riding, 
Manitobans want and deserve reasonable access to good quality 
health care.  This budget goes a long way to securing that 
access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it be reductions in EI premiums or the introduction of 
the child tax benefit, every budget this government has 
introduced has included some form of tax reduction.  In the past 
all these measures were targeted for special needs or to low 
income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, however, we began the process of introducing broad 
based tax relief.  This year, I am happy to say, we have built on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget eliminates the 3% surtax introduced by the Tories in 
their unsuccessful attempts to reduce the deficit.  It increases 
the basic personal exemption to $7,131 for every Canadian 
taxpayer.  It also enriches and broadens the child tax benefit by 
a further $300 million.  Combined with the measures in last 
year's budget, the 1999 budget delivers $16.6 billion in tax 
relief over the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best news is that this is only the beginning.  With the 
nation's finances firmly under control, this Liberal government 
is committed to reducing taxes further and will do so over the 
rest of this mandate and into the next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do these tax measures mean for the average Manitoban?  It 
means that the single person living in an apartment on Portage 
Avenue and earning $20,000 a year will see his taxes fall by at 
least 10%.  It means that the single mother living on Carriage 
Road and trying to raise her kids on an income of $30,000 will 
pay absolutely no federal tax.  It means that the middle class 
family of four on Charleswood Road with an income of $50,000 will 
see its federal taxes fall by 15%.  In fact, every Canadian will 
pay less federal tax as a result of this budget.  Even the 
members of the Reform Party have to agree to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is not only about health care and tax cuts.  It is 
also about securing a strong and vibrant future for all 
Canadians.  This budget invests more than $1.8 billion over the 
next three years in the creation, dissemination and 
commercialization of knowledge and jobs.  This money will be used 
to boost funding for the Canada foundation for innovation, a fund 
that has been used to modernize the research infrastructure at 
the University of Manitoba, the Health Sciences Centre in 
Winnipeg and the St. Boniface general hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our university students will also profit from increased funding 
to the research councils and to the network of centres of 
excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitoba's aerospace industry located in the main in my riding 
has already benefited from a $3 million technology partnership 
Canada investment at Bristol Aerospace. 
This investment helped Bristol secure a $100 million contract to 
supply composite components to Boeing creating nearly 300 jobs. 
TPC provides fully repayable loans to assist high technology 
companies develop and market new products.  It will be 
strengthened by an additional $50 million annually.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While Manitoba is fortunate in having the lowest unemployment 
rate in the country, unemployment in the north remains high, 
especially among our aboriginal communities.  This budget 
allocates additional resources for job creation and for 
aboriginal issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia is also home to CFB Winnipeg 
and headquarters for 1 Canadian Air Division.  The base employs 
thousands of military personnel who welcome the $175 million 
increase in the defence budget and who await the implementation 
of the quality of life package by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address one other issue that is of major concern 
to the citizens of Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia.  That issue 
is the national debt.  This government remains committed to the 
prudent fiscal planning that has eliminated the deficit and 
enabled reinvestments in health care, education, economic 
programs and tax cuts.  We will not stray from this course.  The 
nation's books will be balanced for a second year in a row, the 
first time since 1952 that the federal government has been 
deficit free for two consecutive years.  Furthermore, we are 
committed to balancing the books next year and the year after 
that, only the third time since Confederation that the federal 
government will have introduced four consecutive balanced 
budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national debt is falling and will continue to fall in the 
future.  This government has implemented a viable debt repayment 
plan that allocates the contingency reserve of $3 billion in each 
budget to debt repayment.  This measure, coupled with a growing 
economy, will see our debt to GDP ratio fall to under 62% by the 
year 2000-01 and free up more money for programs and tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians appreciate this budget.  They particularly 
appreciate the course that it sets out for the next few years.

today we have seen a lot of patting themselves on the back by 
members of the Liberal government about this budget.  This is 
their sixth budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being the sixth budget and that we have a major trading partner

In other words, living standards in Canada measured as a 
percentage of gross domestic product per person are now a full 
24% lower than they are in the United States.  That is a 6% 
decrease since 1990.

this is only our sixth budget. This is only the sixth year that 
we have been in power in Ottawa.  Things are getting better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came here in the fall of 1993 we were staring at a 
deficit of $42 billion.  It is all gone.  When we came here we 
did not have the luxury of surpluses.  Now we have modest 
surpluses.  Because of the kind of fiscal management that has 
been brought to bear by the finance minister, we can do things 
like restore health care funding, not only that but deliver tax 
cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next three years Canadians will enjoy the benefits of a 
tax cut exceeding $16 billion.  That is better than what we had 
six years ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I remind 
the hon. member for Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia of 20 years 
ago when I was doing documentary work in Winnipeg on the native 
urban migration and this same member was a radio announcer at the 
CBC.  At that time it was indicated that within 20 years we were 
to see massive problems with native people in the city unless we 
took some real initiatives on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have gangs roaming the streets of Winnipeg.  We have one 
million poor children in this country.  The members of the 
government ask us to look at the demographics.  I say look at the 
demographics 35 years from now.  What will those poor children be 
doing?  What will be the strains on the justice system, the human 
misery, their families?  Where on earth do members see this as 
being a positive budget for the poor people in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing an increasing gap between the rich and the poor, 
the elite and the street, and this is a shameful budget when it 
comes to addressing those problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from the hon. member.  I know when she was living in Winnipeg she 
was a fine contributor to the broadcasting community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member touched on a critical issue.  I do not think 
anybody can be proud of the aboriginal problems in this country. 
They exist widely in my city of Winnipeg and in the province of 
Manitoba.  Nobody is proud of these problems.  We are trying to 
aggressively attack them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we went through program review and through deficit 
reductions in program cuts over the last few years, the one 
department that was not affected was the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development.  We did not cut the budget of 
that department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there are strategies laid out in this budget. There will be 
a significant health care announcement regarding the aboriginal 
community in my province next week. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with some pleasure and certainly with a lot of frustration 
that I rise today to detail our position on the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would echo the comments of the previous speaker from the 
Liberal Party as I also come from Manitoba.  I have a lot of 
pride in what has been achieved in Manitoba over the last number 
of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say, however, that the hon. member from the Liberal Party 
and his government do not have a lot they can say about the 
improvements in Manitoba.  The improvements that have happened, 
the 4.8% unemployment rate, the increase in the economy, were 
done because of a provincial government that was able to put into 
place its philosophies and financial understanding of its budget 
so that it could develop that economy in Manitoba. So I take some 
exception to the federal Liberal member's taking credit for 
something that was done in the province of Manitoba.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I stand with some frustration in speaking to the 
budget put forward in the House.  I have a number of areas of 
frustration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess we really did not have to hear the finance minister's 
speech the other night because had we all been listening to the 
media and reading the newspapers we could have heard what would 
be placed on the floor.  It was a budget that was put out to the 
Canadian public long before it ever hit this floor.  Trial 
balloons were being floated constantly by the finance minister. 
Obviously his program was being put out in the media as opposed 
to being put out where it should been, in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was frustration in seeing the Liberals self-congratulating 
themselves on putting forward what I considered to be a smoke and 
mirrors budget.  That is not my comment.  The hon. member says 
that Winnipeg and members of his constituency are pleased about 
what the budget has embraced.  A headline in one Manitoba 
newspapers read “The Smoke and Mirrors Budget”.  I do not see 
where that is embracing the budget.  It does, however, get to the 
root of the issue where there is a lot of smoke and mirrors. A 
shell game is going on in the budget with which I will deal in 
the next couple of minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am splitting my time with the hon. member for New Brunswick 
Southwest who will be speaking for the other 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us deal with a couple of very pertinent issues.  The budget 
is heralded as the health care budget.  The hon. member just said 
in his speech that an incredible—that was the term used; we can 
check <I>Hansard</I>—$11.5 billion would be put back into health 
care over the next five years.  Incredible, incroyable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he use the same term, incredible, to describe the $17 
billion that was cut from the health care budget?  Is that 
incredible, incroyable?  Since 1993, $17 billion were cut from 
the health care budget, but now all of a sudden $11.5 billion is 
incredible.  Canadians are smarter than that.  They do not think 
so, but I know Canadians will see through their shell game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a surplus today.  We do not know what the surplus will 
be because games are being played.  Dollars are being budgeted in 
the 1998-99 budget that have not been expended but will be taken 
forward into the 1999-2000 budget.  What is the real number? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we deal with budgets and budgetary functions we try to 
honestly put before the constituencies the revenue and the 
expenditure.  What was left over from the two was some surplus to 
do with whatever we wished.  We made sure the constituencies had 
input into the spending of those surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know what the surplus is for 1998-99.  We do not know 
what the budgeted surpluses are for 1999-2000 or where in fact 
the finance minister will spend these surpluses.  Let us make no 
mistake about it.  They will be spent on probably a leadership 
campaign, not directly but certainly during the leadership 
campaign.  I suspect we will see a lot of those surpluses rising 
to the surface and being put into programs that are perhaps pet 
programs for particular individuals on the Liberal benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get back to health care.  The hon. member stood here and 
read a press release which said that $425 million over the next 
five years would be put back into Manitoba.  What the hon. member 
neglected to say was that Manitoba had been impacted by $240 
million in cuts every year for the last three years.  The numbers 
do not add up.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitoba has given back substantially more over the last three 
years than the government is prepared to put back in over the 
next five years.  Why did the government not make it 10 years 
instead of 5 years?  Why did the government not give a real big 
number so Canadians could be snowed?  Why only five years?  Why 
did it not deal with 10 years?  Maybe I am giving the finance 
minister some opportunity to change his mandate or his method of 
operation for the next budget so he can expand it over more than 
a five year term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about some other areas of serious importance in my 
constituency.  That area obviously is agriculture.  The 1998-99 
budget, the one that will be ending on March 31 of this year, 
shows $600 million being put to an aid program, the AIDA program. 
I find it very unlikely that dollars will flow to farmers by 
March 31 of this year, but $600 million are reflected in that 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume that will be put in trust and will be put forward to 
the next budget year, the year 1999-2000.  The auditor general 
will have a lot to say about the shenanigans in this budget. It 
is not good accounting procedure, but it makes the government 
look good.  Unfortunately it will come back to haunt the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In agriculture we have been saying all along that we do not need 
an ad hoc program.  We agree that the government should put 
together some vision, foresight and thought and put dollars in a 
budget that will be able to look after the cyclical problems of 
agriculture on a regular basis, like the GRIP program that was 
cut by the government in 1995.  Short term gain for long term 
pain continues.  There is nothing reflected in the budget to show 
for a long term solution to agricultural cyclical downturns. That 
to me is a deficiency in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Charlesbourg said with great pride that he 
has a Canadian forces base in his constituency.  With great pride 
I say that I also have a Canadian forces base in my constituency. 
I probably see the personnel, talk to them and deal with them 
more often than does the hon. member.  I am in constant touch 
with that constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $175 million reflected in the budget do not even come within 
a fraction of what was requested to bring military families up to 
standard.  The budget does not reflect anything for needed 
equipment purchases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sit in the House every day and talk about the Sea King 
helicopters.  We talk about military equipment that is 30 and 35 
years old.  That was not reflected in the budget because it is a 
health care budget that is also a farce and a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one request I could make—and I know there is a 
majority government and that the budget will pass—of the 
Minister of Finance and the government, it would be that the next 
time they table a budget in the House they should be totally up 
front with Canadians, tell them exactly what they are doing to 
them and tell them that the tax cuts will not be reflected in 
their next paycheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have request of Canadians.  They should not start spending 
their tax breaks because they will find there is not a lot there. 
With the CPP increases and because the tax breaks will take place 
on July 1 of this year, an income of $39,000 will have a $3 
income tax increase for the year 1999.  I would really like to 
thank the Liberal government for that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to some of the debate today.  I understand 
when members of the New Democratic Party give a long list of 
things that we should have done and could have done that add 
another $10 billion to $15 billion to the cost of operating the 
nation's programs. 
However what puzzles me completely is that for years and years I 
have sat in the House, both in opposition and on the government 
side, and have heard speaker after speaker from the Conservative 
Party talk about the importance of the Liberal Party putting the 
fiscal framework of the country's books back in order and about 
over the last few years our Minister of Finance following the 
direction of the Progressive Conservative Party so much so that 
for the first time in 50 years we have a balanced set of books.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a balanced set of books.  We did all this in terms of 
health care and huge tax cuts.  The member lists many other areas 
in which he would have wanted spending.  How much of a deficit 
would he have wanted the Minister of Finance to take on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for pointing out that the reason the budget is balanced is the 
policies that were put in place by the previous Conservative 
government.  I will not go over them, but because of NAFTA we now 
have an export economy that is generating substantial revenues 
that the government can hide and spend.  We have low interest 
rates because the government has more money to hide and spend.  I 
do not understand how the government can take the GST as its own 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not like to see a deficit.  What is the surplus?  Is it 
$7 million or $14 billion?  The government has hidden the 
surplus.  There may not be a deficit.  Some of those dollars from 
the surplus can go into better programs.  The government could do 
a much better job than what it did in the budget simply by 
identifying what the real surplus will be. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
too bad members of the Liberal Party will not congratulate the 
taxpayers of Canada for paying the highest taxes in the land or 
in the world, practically, in order to make this work.  They do 
not want to give credit where credit is due. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming from Manitoba and as one of the Indian Affairs critics I 
spend a lot of time in the city of Winnipeg where I have 
witnesses many tragedies regarding people from the native 
communities who are on the streets.  Mike Calder is one of the 
directors of an organization which I think is called St. Norbert. 
He came to the government at least five times with proposals to 
the health care minister and to the justice minister to help to 
alleviate the problems which exist in Winnipeg with the natives 
who are on the streets.  There has been no response during my 
tenure in this portfolio from the government whatsoever to assist 
the city of Winnipeg with that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member has been to that area and is familiar with 
what is going on.  Since 1993 has the government ever shown any 
initiative whatsoever to alleviate the serious problems that 
exist with natives on the streets of Winnipeg? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  I was born and raised in Manitoba and lived 
there for most of my live, but fortunately or unfortunately not 
in the city of Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a serious problem in Manitoba as the member pointed out 
with respect to aboriginals in Winnipeg.  To answer the question 
simply, I have been trying to get to the Department of Indian and 
Northern Affair.  I have been stonewalled on a number of 
occasions in trying to deal with some aboriginal issues in my own 
constituency.  The understanding in the federal government is 
somewhat lax or missing.  It does not necessarily want to deal 
with the issues that should be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about deficits and we talk about spending.  The one good 
thing that happened in the budget was that there was nothing 
reflected there to help professional sports teams. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is nice to respond to the budget.  In all fairness, 
there has been a lot of good publicity on the budget and most of 
us would accept that fact although we may disagree with some of 
the headlines. 
There has been some analytical appraisal of the budget and not 
all of it has been favourable.  Despite the optics, this budget 
is going to have a very short shelf life and the reason has been 
articulated in the House more than once this morning.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the budget, at the numbers and at how it was 
presented by the finance minister, I cannot help but think of 
Mark Twain who coined the expression “lies, damned lies and 
statistics”.  I am much too polite to use the word “lie” in 
this House when it comes to the budget but I would suggest that 
the minister is using a lot of creative accounting to come up 
with the numbers. No one here knows what the real numbers are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not one member on either side of the House can tell us how the 
surplus in the EI account works into the budget numbers.  No one 
knows and if they do know they are not going to tell us.  If they 
did, I think it would expose the finance minister for what he is, 
someone who is capable of balancing the budget on the backs of 
the unemployed.  The number we often hear is $20 billion which 
has been taken out of the hides of the employers and the 
employees and used to help creatively balance his books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of doubt in the minds of ordinary Canadians as to 
what the minister has really done in the last six budgets he has 
brought into this House.  I agree with the member next to me that 
a lot of the policies this very government fought against are the 
ones that are delivering the numbers the Liberals brag about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We mentioned specifically the free trade agreement.  We mention 
the GST from time to time on this side of the House. It is 
rolling in revenues of about $20 billion this year compared with 
about $12 billion the day it was brought in.  That is about $20 
billion the minister would not have to play with if he had lived 
up to the 1993 red book promise to rid this country of that hated 
GST.  He can roll around in the luxury of having it there but he 
has not had to pay the political price for introducing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not the Liberal way?  Mr. Speaker, I see you nodding in 
agreement.  There is at least one person in this House who is 
agreeing with me.  You were there and you fought that election. 
You know on the basis of how you fought.  That is even a bigger 
nod, Mr. Speaker.  Thank you for that honesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been called the health budget.  We have to be careful 
what the Liberals call it.  I think this same minister called a 
budget he introduced a couple of years ago the youth budget. 
Immediately after he introduced the so-called youth budget, 
12,000 young Canadians filed for bankruptcy because of their 
inability to pay off their student loans.  Thousands are leaving 
this country to seek employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the minister can take too much satisfaction from 
the thematic approach to budget making. Goodness knows what is 
going to happen to those people who depend on health care 
services, given the track record of this minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme is health care.  The Liberals are bragging about 
putting $11.5 billion in.  You are right, Mr. Speaker, they are 
putting it in or we are being led to believe they are.  But the 
timing is the thing, is it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first chunk of change to go in is going into what is called 
a third party fund.  Mr. Speaker, have you ever heard of that 
type of fund before?  It is a clever word game, a third party 
fund is being created.  It will be a $3.5 billion fund but no one 
is going to draw down any money this year.  It will be next year 
and the year after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member from Manitoba in that I think it is 
going to coincide with the finance minister's leadership bid.  I 
should not mention the dirty word leadership in here but that is 
exactly what he has done. 
He is very clever.  The timing will work out perfectly for the 
finance minister.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, this is like giving the arsonist credit for burning down 
your house and then building you a one room shanty. That is 
exactly what the finance minister has done.  He took the torch to 
health care five years ago.  And torched it he did.  He 
immediately extracted almost $6 billion out of health care.  He 
put back $11.5 billion after extracting $6 billion in health care 
alone and he took $17 billion from the social transfers.  If we 
follow his scenario to its logical conclusion, in the year 2004, 
we will be into the next millennium if we make it that far, and 
health care spending will be back to the very same level that we 
had in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Atlantic Canada we call that backward speaking.  That is 
absolutely bizarre.  He is taking credit for inventing health 
care when he is the man who single-handedly wrecked health care. 
Now the Liberals are standing up and bragging about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in all the provinces where the hurt was really inflicted, 
back in New Brunswick and every other province, including his 
friend Roy's whom he likes to brag about in the House, they are 
questioning what they are going to do with this money. The 
feeling is that this infusion of $11.5 billion is going to be 
used by the provinces to eradicate debt that this character 
imposed upon them.  There will be no change in patient care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking about the shelf life of this budget.  There will 
be no changes in terms of rural doctors and services for rural 
Canadians for years to come.  There will be no change in waiting 
lines or in emergency wards.  People are still going to be 
waiting.  They still will not receive the care they should be 
receiving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, when money is taken out at the rate the minister has 
taken it out of health care, it takes more to bring it back to 
where it was.  An analogy would be a house with a leaking roof. 
If we let the roof leak, the problem gets worse and instead of 
just having to fix the roof, we would have to fix the rafters, 
the floor joists and the floors.  We are talking about 
maintenance. They have not had the money to sustain the system 
over the years.  Now we are going to have to wait until the year 
2004 before we are back to the level we had in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it take a rocket scientist to figure this guy out? No it 
would not.  It would take an ordinary citizen to look at the 
numbers, if they were provided.  Unfortunately the minister does 
not disclose the real numbers because he is devious.  He is the 
Houdini of finance.  I suggest that he go back to the provinces 
and teach those finance ministers the magic in his numbers.  I go 
back to the old Mark Twain expression “lies, damned lies and 
statistics”.  This minister fits into the very first category 
mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Now the hon. member knows that this 
kind of talk is quite unparliamentary.  I know that he would want 
to comply with the rules.  He cannot do by the back door what he 
is not allowed to do by the front door. I suggest that perhaps he 
withdraw those words and carry on for the few seconds he has left 
in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize to Mark 
Twain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member will have to do more 
than apologize to Mark Twain.  He is going to have to apologize 
to me and to the House, and he is going to have to withdraw those 
words.  I would ask him to do so at once.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to both of the members' speeches and found them quite 
humourous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is quoting newspaper articles and I want to 
quote one. I have heard him mention how well this individual does 
his job.  It is a quote by the premier of Alberta.  The premier 
of Alberta says that the Minister of Finance's Liberal budget is 
a blueprint for the type of policies Tories and Reformers should 
embrace if they merge into a new party.  He also said that the 
Minister of Finance would deliver good government to Canadians if 
he became prime minister.  He also said that he was “very happy 
with the Liberals' decision in Tuesday's federal budget to pump 
$11.5 billion into provincial health care coffers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear what the hon. member across the way has to 
say about Ralph Klein's comments.  Is he wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we know it would be on 
very rare occasions that a Conservative premier would be wrong. 
The problem with Ralph of course is that he succumbs to the 
beating the finance minister inflicts on him with his big 
chequebook.  I am sure Ralph mentioned this under great duress 
because there would be no other way that he would say that.  The 
minister is famous for doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Brunswick finance minister was not quite that 
complimentary.  In fact, yesterday the New Brunswick finance 
minister said just the opposite.  At least a few of them, even 
though they may be political pals, do have the strength from time 
to time to speak the truth, not to say that Ralph would speak 
anything but the truth. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we have an old family fight going on over here and I 
thought maybe I could insert some rationale into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that Premier Klein and Premier Harris are smart enough 
to know that the last thing they should be saying is “Take your 
money, I don't want it.  Get out of my sight”.  No.  They are 
going to placate this government.  They are going to take the 
money and at the same time continue their fight and struggle to 
defeat this government in the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was an intelligent 
intervention and of course it had to come from this side of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes in this business we have to eat our own words.  I 
would love to see the finance minister do that.  Last week when 
the Prime Minister was out of the country, he was talking about 
how supportive he was when the prime minister of the day, Brian 
Mulroney, brought in the GST and why he had to do it. What goes 
on in the minds of some politicians one never knows, but I think 
the hon. member is absolutely right.  This is a man who controls 
the nation's finances, he and the Prime Minister.  It is not too 
often that we will get a premier going on the attack, especially 
when he is waiting for some of those health care dollars that 
were taken away from his province. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member was talking about numbers earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member was in this House up until 1993. I am 
wondering if he could tell me what the unemployment numbers were 
at that time.  If I remember correctly it was 11.5%.  Today it is 
7.8%. Could the hon. member tell us what the budget deficit was 
at that time?  I am sure he will remember that it was at $42 
billion a year.  Could he also tell us what the budget deficit is 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about numbers but those are the things we 
had to deal with before we brought in this budget.  This budget 
is our attempt to try to deal with those dramatic numbers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have an institutional 
memory.  I think that sometimes comes in handy in this place. 
The member for Fredericton and I had a little discussion on the 
very topic of the numbers of unemployment last night in 
Fredericton in terms of New Brunswick's unemployment. I wish the 
rate of unemployment in my home province and Atlantic Canada were 
as low as the national average.  I do not disagree with that 
because the economy as we know is very cyclical.  What goes up 
comes down sometimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is right, the unemployment rate was too high 
when we left office.  Prior to that it was lower.  We get to the 
bottom of the cycle as well in terms of a low number of 
unemployed.  But back in New Brunswick this very day it is very 
high.  It is very high in Atlantic Canada.  I wish that we were 
experiencing the prosperity of southern Ontario.  Maybe some day 
we will, but it will need more attention by this government to 
achieve those low numbers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
sharing my time with the member for Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very intense debate and I am very honoured to enter 
into it and to offer my congratulations to the government on what 
I consider to be another tremendous budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget offers all Canadians a high standard of living and 
again makes Canada a better place in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our obligations as members of Canada's parliament are to ensure 
that Canadians receive what they put into their country and to 
ensure that we give Canadians the support they need to build a 
strong and prosperous nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our strategy of building a stronger and more prosperous Canada 
takes action on three fronts, maintaining sound economic and 
financial management, investing in key economic and social 
priorities, and providing tax relief and improving tax fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These fronts mesh together to improve Canada's standard of 
living and quality of life.  I would like to take a look at each 
of these three fronts to see how they affect Canada as a nation 
but Prince Edward Island also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one looks at the present fiscal situation it is apparent that 
we as Canadians are living in a very unique time, a time in which 
economic and financial management of the nation is once again a 
possibility, a time in which the light at the end of the tunnel 
is a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998-99 fiscal year is the second consecutive year in which 
the budget has been deficit free.  The last time this occurred 
was almost half a century ago.  Program spending as a share of 
GDP will decline from 12.6% to 12% in 2000-01.  This also is the 
lowest in almost 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will post a financial surplus for the 
third consecutive year, the only G-7 country to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial position of the territories and the provinces has 
also improved.  The maintenance of a sound economy is something 
to be very proud of, something this Liberal government has done 
in a timely and efficient manner, in a manner of effective and 
responsible government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has not forgotten the fundamental principle that 
has guided Canada through the 20th century, the fundamental 
principle of fairness and social responsibility.  This is a 
government that recognizes the importance of health care, a 
government that recognizes the burdens that taxes place on us, a 
government that recognizes the importance of investing in 
knowledge and innovation so that we are fortified as we enter the 
new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is proof that our government has recognized the 
importance of knowledge and the development of a dynamic business 
sector and workforce.  An innovative and dynamic business sector 
and workforce are essential for success in today's knowledge 
based economy and we have recognized this through increased 
support to the Canadian opportunities strategy.  This strategy 
supports employment through creation, dissemination and 
commercialization of Canadian knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic and social priorities seem to concentrate on one 
entity, employment.  Creating permanent and prosperous jobs for 
Canadians is a key economic and social priority and this is no 
surprise.  Without a strong economy we do not have a strong 
society and vice versa.  We must invest in both sides of this 
relationship.  That is what our government has done.  We have 
given our economy a boost as well as giving Canadians a boost.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does little good for us to educate Canadians, give them the 
life investments they need and not supply them with the proper 
innovative environments to put these skills to work.  To 
stimulate the creation of jobs in our workforce through the 
careless allocation of money is not a solution.  What good 
government must do is create an environment where innovation and 
the promotion of knowledge can flourish. Investments in knowledge 
and innovation are key to improving our productivity performance 
and increasing our standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This in turn creates a highly trained workforce that can stand 
the test of the new millennium.  This is what our government is 
doing when it builds on the existing Canadian opportunities 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is taking measures to create knowledge, creating 
knowledge through increased funding for the Natural Sciences and 
Engineering Research Council and for the Social Sciences and 
Humanities Research Council for advanced research in graduate 
studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also made money available to the National Research 
Council to invest in leading edge equipment.  This money will be 
available this year and for the next three years.  Without 
cutting edge equipment, our national research will suffer and in 
turn affect employment.  Jobs depend on research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only must we take measures to create knowledge but we must 
also disseminate this knowledge so Canadians can use it.  The 
Internet and its ability to transfer information to vast numbers 
makes it a natural choice for keeping Canadians abreast of up to 
the minute information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government plans to make information and knowledge 
infrastructure accessible to all Canadians by the year 2000. This 
will make Canada the most connected country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget will make for the investment of $60 million over 
three years to establish a smart community demonstration project 
in each province and territory.  These projects use information 
and communication technology to support economic development and 
enrich community life. Several aspects of society will be 
fortified with speedy information channels for sharing and mass 
dissemination of valuable knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives support innovation by creating a network where 
industry can reach out to potential partners, where small 
business can network with large business and where students can 
learn more about business innovation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only must we help stimulate ideas and innovation, we must 
also connect ideas with our markets.  Innovation is the driving 
force behind increased productivity and improved standards of 
living. It is the commercialization of innovation and knowledge 
that results in the creation of new products, new markets and new 
processes that will lead to economic growth and the generation of 
job opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget supports the commercialization of knowledge and 
innovation.  Our government designates money for the investment 
in partnerships with the private sector to help firms 
commercialize new technology.  That is where research and 
investment comes to the main street of Canada, where our 
commitment to the creation of economic stability through 
innovation meets the average Canadian.  This is where investment 
in knowledge bears its fruit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget also supports the development of innovative projects 
that support alternate energy development.  For example, in my 
home province of Prince Edward Island our government is 
continuing to provide funding for the Atlantic wind test site. 
This site contributes to the development of wind energy 
technology and illustrates this government's commitment to the 
diversification of the Atlantic economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now to deal with health care.  This is very important to 
Canadians and to this government.  There is $11.5 billion 
specifically for health care over the next five years. This is a 
lot of money.  As a matter of fact, it is the largest single new 
investment this government has made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For my province of Prince Edward Island this government has 
committed an estimated $51 million over the next five years, an 
average of over $10 million a year.  This amount is substantial. 
It will clearly have positive effects for the people of my riding 
and the people of my province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is also investing in health information systems 
and health research.  Information systems improvements will 
enable Canadians to make more informed choices about their own 
health, improve decision making by those in health care roles and 
allow for the public to hold these people more accountable.  It 
is a win-win situation.  Here is how we are doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the Canadian health network, our government is improving 
health information channels by giving millions to increase public 
access to health information.  The government is giving $95 
million to the Canadian Institute for Health Information to 
strengthen its capacity to report on the health of Canadians and 
the functioning of the Canadian health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Health will be given major financial support 
so that it may report on the performance of federal health 
programs in a more effective manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are we giving considerable support to health care 
information systems but we have also strengthened our health 
related research. 
Over the remainder of the fiscal year and over the next three 
years our government will commit a half billion dollars to health 
related research.  This is a considerable amount and I think it 
will clearly have a visible effect on the type of health care 
this country experiences in the next century.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care research and innovation is traditionally focused on 
the scientific aspect of health care. This budget provides $25 
million to develop solutions to challenges facing nursing in the 
next decade.  It is thoughtful of our government to look at the 
problems associated with the profession of nursing.  This 
profession is facing some serious challenges in the next decade 
and this government had the foresight to fund research to prevent 
a potential health catastrophe, a lack of nurses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where our government differs from past governments. We 
care about all these things and we are doing something about it. 
Clearly this budget is providing substantial gains for Canadians, 
health care, job creation through our knowledge investment and 
tax relief for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not get much better than this.  The people of Prince 
Edward Island and all Canadians can celebrate this Liberal 
government's budget, a budget for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to rise and question the member who just finished his 
speech.  We are from the same generation. We are about the same 
age and it is always nice to compare notes.  I often wonder, 
though, what happened to him over the years as he was growing up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was speaking about how wonderful this health care proposal is 
to the people of Canada.  I read in the headlines this morning in 
the <I>National Post</I> where the Liberals are now a little 
concerned that the budget may help Mike Harris win the election. 
Is it not pathetic that suddenly the care about health care is 
not as important as Mike Harris might win the election? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For members of his caucus to make those kinds of statements 
really shows that it is a political concern.  Win, win, make sure 
you get a seat in the House of Commons and keep the ego going. 
We have to win these elections. That is pathetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member's comments with regard to the 
auditor general who year after year condemns the government for 
the way it keeps the books.  It is not illegal but it is 
unethical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Betty Crocker's Cook Book</I> should be renamed Paul Cookers' 
Crock Book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I suppose what someone 
saying this budget would help get someone elected is something 
everyone has to live with.  The party in my province is a 
different stripe from mine and I am certain it is hoping this 
will help it get elected. That is what politics is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great thing about this is that it shows that all the 
premiers, the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister of Canada and 
the finance ministers of the provinces got together and made this 
thing work and they are all very happy with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the auditor general's comments on the way the 
government keeps the books, I suppose there is a difference of 
opinion between the auditor general, the people in the Department 
of Finance and people in other departments. That will go on 
forever.  It always has and always will. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have 
been sitting here in this budget debate listening to the hon. 
members on the government side and what a great job they have 
done.  I made the point before that we will give this budget 
barely a passing grade.  It is nice to see the books in the 
black.  I will repeat that statement.  It is not a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us draw it into perspective.  These guys are talking about 
knowledge based industries and there is nothing in the budget for 
knowledge based industries.  They are talking about the military. 
There is nothing in there for the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw the House's attention to something that is very 
critical to P.E.I. and very critical to coastal Canadians. On 
budget night we had in all of Canada three search and rescue 
helicopters that were fit to fly and that men and women in the 
Canadian Armed Forces would actually get into to try to rescue 
someone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may not mean a lot to the member from P.E.I, but I bet it 
means a lot to his constituents.  It means a lot to my 
constituents in South Shore, Nova Scotia.  It means a lot in 
Hudson Bay if one is adrift in a boat. It means a lot in just 
about every place in Canada; three choppers fit to fly with crews 
that would get in them.

committee.  I am the senior member of that committee.  I have 
been on it since 1990 and if there is anything I can do to make 
sure we have a fleet of search and rescue helicopters and a fleet 
of shipborne helicopters, it is something I have been fighting 
for since I went on the committee and will continue to do so as 
long as I am part of this government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is with a great deal of honour that I rise today to enter this 
historic budget debate.  I do so on behalf of the residents of 
Waterloo—Wellington and indeed on behalf of all Canadians who 
recognize the tremendous work that the government has done to get 
our fiscal house in order, to provide tax relief and to ensure 
that our health care system is secured for the next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by outlining the strong fiscal outlook contained in the 
budget.  It is no secret that budget '99 is an outstanding 
testament to the efforts and sacrifices of all Canadians to put 
Canada's fiscal house in order.  The government is dedicated to 
advancing the living standards of Canadians through the creation 
of well paying jobs, a robust economy, equal opportunities for 
all and a safety net for those in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 Canada's economy flourished despite the uncertainty in 
overseas markets that has hit some parts of Canada, our western 
provinces particularly hard.  Yet job creation in Canada outpaces 
the other G-7 countries.  Employment growth remains strong. 
There were 453,000 jobs created in 1998 following the impressive 
gain of 368,000 jobs in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that almost 40% of the new jobs created in the last 
12 months were to Canada's youth who posted their strongest 
yearly employment growth in over 25 years.  I also want to note 
that interest rates remain low and long term rates are nearly 
historically low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that Canada's economic success is due to 
sound economic and fiscal policies and the hard work and 
sacrifice of all Canadians.  The budgetary deficit which stood at 
$42 billion in 1993-94 was eliminated in just four years.  In 
fact, a surplus of $3.5 billion, the first surplus in 28 years, 
was recorded in 1997-98 and went to pay down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year the government will begin balancing its books or 
better.  For the first time since 1951-52 the government has been 
deficit free for two consecutive years.  The government is 
committed to further balancing budgets in both 1999-2000 and in 
2000-2001.  This will be the third time since Confederation that 
the government will record balanced budgets for at least four 
consecutive years.  That is truly historic and worthy of note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The balanced books means an ability to invest more in health 
care.  Reducing our debt is an investment in our future.  Our 
goal is to put the debt to GDP ratio on a steady downward track. 
As we reduce our federal debt it means that more resources are 
available to strengthen health care, to provide tax relief, fight 
child poverty and invest in research and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995-96 when the debt to GDP ratio was at its peak, 36 cents 
of every federal revenue dollar went to paying down the debt. 
Last year that was down to 27 cents.  Again, it is truly 
remarkable. This is tremendous progress and underscores the 
government's commitment to debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's strong economy and bright prospects are clear evidence 
that strong economic fundamentals are helping us to prosper.  Our 
record of maintaining sound economic and fiscal management has 
led to strong growth and a reduced debt burden which in turn has 
allowed the government to reinvest in priorities, especially 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn to our health care system. Canadians believe our health 
care system is a fundamental core value.  Canada's publicly 
funded health care system is a pillar of our society and reflects 
the values shared by us all.  I am pleased to see that preserving 
and building on our health care system's strength is a 
cornerstone of budget '99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next five years the provinces and the territories will 
receive, as everyone knows, an additional $11.5 billion for 
health care. 
This represents the largest single new investment our government 
has ever made.  These new monies will help the provinces and the 
territories deal with Canadians' immediate concerns about health 
care, things like waiting lists, crowded emergency rooms, 
diagnostic services and other things.  The government is 
committed to building a stronger health care system that reflects 
the changing needs of Canadians and provides timely access to 
high quality health care.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to fully outline what this means. Of the 
$11.5 billion dedicated to health care, $11 billion will be 
provided through future increases in the Canada health and social 
transfer.  Over the next three years provinces will receive an 
additional $6.5 billion.  For this fiscal year, $3.5 billion will 
be allocated as an immediate one time injection into the CHST. 
Provinces and territories will be able to draw on these funds in 
the manner which best suits their needs and their health care 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $2.5 billion increase to the CHST brings the total cash 
portion to $15 billion, making the health component of the CHST 
as high as it was before the spending restraint of the mid 1990s. 
Combined with the CHST tax transfers and others, federal support 
is expected to reach a new high by the year 2001-02. This is 
truly good news for Canadians wherever they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, budget '99 invests close to $1.4 billion in 
improving information systems, providing health related research 
innovation, improving first nations and Inuit health services and 
preventing health problems.  This will ensure that doctors, 
nurses, administrators and researchers have the most up to date 
knowledge, information, treatment and cures at their fingertips. 
It will also allow them to innovate and learn from each other in 
order to benefit all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health research helps prevent a wide range of diseases from 
polio to tuberculosis.  A national task force representing the 
health research community has developed an innovative proposal to 
create the Canadian institute of health research.  The institute 
would bring together the best researchers from across Canada in 
areas such as aging, arthritis, women's health, cancer and 
diseases of the heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget '99 sets aside $240 million over the next two years to 
support this proposal.  While we lay the groundwork for the 
institute, increased funding will go to the existing federal 
agencies that support health research and to hospitals and 
universities to help create world class research facilities. That 
is truly important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medicare is not only good social policy, it is good short and 
long term economic policy.  We will ensure that every health care 
dollar spent by the Government of Canada is used to the greatest 
possible extent to deliver those services.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to medical research the government is moving to 
strengthen other areas of research, innovation and knowledge. 
This is because we know it is very important to raise the 
standard of living for all Canadians.  In today's fast paced 
world investing in Canadians' access to knowledge and innovation 
is crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget '99 builds on previous efforts by investing more than 
$1.8 billion in innovation over the remainder of this fiscal year 
and the next three years.  This investment will help prepare 
Canadians for the new economy and the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past five years our government has made important 
investments in support of knowledge and innovation and we will 
continue to do this.  Budget '99 provides an additional $200 
million for the Canada foundation for innovation's initial $800 
million endowment which is now being used to support the 
acquisition and modernization of world class research 
infrastructure.  An additional $150 million over three years will 
be invested in technology partnerships Canada starting in 1999

this means a better standard of living and a better quality of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
I listened to the member for Nepean—Carleton it sounded like he 
was painting an awfully rosy picture for Canadians in the next 
few years.  I began to wonder whether he had his stats right.  If 
things are so rosy why has Canada fallen so far in terms of 
standard of living?  Why are Canadians facing such a lower 
standard of living now than we were facing five or ten years ago? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our major trading partner, the United States, has been 
experiencing tremendous growth in standard of living.  We have 
fallen behind the Americans by 25% in standard of living 
expressed in terms of GDP.  We have seen 45,000 of our young 
professional people leaving Canada to go to the United States. 
If things are so rosy why is this happening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the highest personal income tax rate in the G-7, about 
15% higher than in the United States.  The United States is 
experiencing tremendous growth and a tremendous increase in 
standard of living.  Why are we so stagnant here if things are so 
rosy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question.  I represent the riding of Waterloo—Wellington in 
Ontario and I am certainly proud to do so.  I do know that we are 
on the cusp of great prosperity in this great nation. That is 
because we as a government have laid the foundation that enables 
us to take our place in the future and in the 21st century.  That 
is very important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member spoke about the G-7.  We are the envy of the G-7 
in terms of what we are doing.  For the past number of years the 
United Nations has repeatedly shown that we are the leading 
nation when it comes to the kinds of things we do for ourselves 
and for our people.  I think that is very important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the research and innovation we have included in this 
budget, we will ensure that our young people have the fair chance 
here that is needed and necessary.  This we do in the interests 
of all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member said that we were poised for economic greatness. 
Earlier his colleague, the member for Guelph—Wellington, talked 
about balancing the situation in the country.  Let me talk about 
that balance a bit.  I think the member from Guelph indicated 
that the unemployment rate in her region was 5%.  This member has 
spoken about an unemployment rate of 7% nationally. The 
unemployment rate in my riding is 19%.  The unemployment rate on 
the aboriginal reserve in my riding is 85%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I will ask the hon. member a serious question, not rhetoric. 
Would he not agree with me that much of the thrust of the budget, 
the centres for excellence which he talked about and the new 
spending above and beyond the transitional jobs funds should be 
directed to those regions in this country, and my riding is not 
the only one, with the highest unemployment rates so we can see 
those centres of excellence in places like Cape Breton, northern 
Manitoba and eastern Newfoundland?  Would he not agree that would 
be a sensible way to direct the funding of those initiatives?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I do know is that we as a government have taken a very 
balanced approach not only in this budget year but in previous 
years as well.  We have taken an approach that is balanced, 
equitable and fair.  We have ensured that we cut taxes, that we 
pay down the debt and that we make the wise kinds of reinvestment 
Canadians want, need, deserve and expect.  We have done a very 
good job at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specific to the question, I point out that when we put in place 
innovation, research and the new centres of excellence we do so 
for everyone in the country no matter where they live, in a 
manner consistent with the values that sustain us as a people. It 
is important that we do so in a manner that enables Canadians 
wherever they live to access those very important areas and make 
sure that we all prosper and benefit as a result. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there are three ways to look at the budget, in a 
realistic way, an optimistic way and a negative way. Using the 
example of the glass being half full or half empty, this glass is 
seven-eighths full and one-eighth empty. That is a realistic 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Waterloo—Wellington spoke about the positive 
points in this budget.  He failed to mentioned the positive 
responses we received from all the premiers and the favourite son 
of the federal riding of Brampton Centre, Bill Davis.  He spoke 
very highly of this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why my colleague skipped this fact and did not present 
this information to the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know Bill Davis.  I had 
the opportunity not so long ago to speak to him.  I very much 
value and respect his opinion.  When Bill Davis says that this is 
a good budget, we should all listen to that.  He knows what he is 
talking about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege to stand and talk about this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I am the health critic and because I am really keen on 
health, I looked forward to this budget.  I must say that 
frankly, I looked forward to it because it would be a health 
reinvestment budget.  In a non-partisan way, I thought this would 
be the perfect opportunity for me to stand and cheer my 
colleagues across the way.  I honestly, truly hoped that I would 
be able to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because a politician can find negatives in anything, I am going 
to leave the negative comments relating to this budget to health 
care people who are not politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals said they had an excuse for cutting health.  The 
excuse was that there was an emergency, a deficit emergency, a 
money emergency.  Many Canadians asked why the Liberals took a 
money emergency and made it into a medical emergency.  That would 
arch over my questions to my Liberal colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers say that this budget is a pay more and get less for 
health care budget.  Members have heard that a lot.  I hope they 
will hear it a lot more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Liberal record on health since the Liberals came to 
power in 1993?  These facts are absolutely incontrovertible.  In 
1993 Canada was second in the world in spending on health care. 
As a per cent of GDP, Canada was number two.  Today Canada is 
number five in the world.  We have plunged from two to five as a 
per cent of GDP. That is the Liberal record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not just numbers; these matter to the public.  As a 
percentage in the 28 OECD countries, government spending on 
health of all the OECD countries, Canada is 23rd out of 28.  We 
are so close to the bottom we are almost the anchor.  We are told 
that in private health spending we have one tier publicly 
financed health in Canada.  Where are we in terms of private 
spending since 1993 until now?  We went from 22% to 30% in a 
short span of time.  That is the Liberal legacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the big, big health reinvestment; budget increases 
federal support for health care. 
What will be the balanced result of that?  The balance is pretty 
simple.  For every $2 the Liberals have taken out of health care, 
they are going to put $1 back in.  Most eighth graders would tell 
me that is not very good math.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the reception of the budget from those who are 
not politicians, those who stand aside and look at this with no 
axe to grind, none.  I have chosen three big groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Medical Association said, “The patient is the 
health care system.  Budget day, it was an emergency situation, 
just this close to life support.  With the budget it has moved 
from emergence to urgent.  It is still acutely ill,” says the 
president of the Canadian Medical Association, Dr. Hugh Scully. 
“This is a band-aid”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sharon Scholzberg-Gray, the president of the Canadian Health 
Care Association said, “This increased funding is a step in the 
right direction but it will not be enough to deal with a growing 
aging Canadian population.  The amounts are not sufficient”. 
This is not a political statement.  This is a statement by 
somebody who deals with the patient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Nurses Association expressed concern about the long 
term sustainability.  “At the end of four more years,” said 
Mary Ellen Jeans, “we will be at $15 billion which was where we 
were three years ago”.  She did not say when the Liberals took 
power we were at $18.8 billion for health care.  She did not 
mention that but I will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say the reception by non-politicians to this tremendous 
health care reinvestment budget is negative.  Would my colleagues 
agree?  Would my Liberal colleagues agree?  The Liberals talk 
about this as getting all kinds of encouragement and enthusiasm 
from across the country.  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never done this in the House before but I am going to 
take the position of Canadian doctors on the budget.  They made a 
prebudget submission.  Because I am a doctor I have hesitated to 
do this.  Today I am going to present the CMA position, their 
prebudget submission on health care.  I am going to list off the 
things that they said needed to be done. I am going to grade the 
Liberal government on the CMA's behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing concerned funding.  The CMA said there had to be 
sustainable funding and asked for $2.5 billion per year now, to 
raise the floor from $12.5 billion to $15 billion, not where it 
was when they started but at least get started. They also asked 
for $3 billion over the next three years for the damage.  They 
said please do not keep this CHST nonsense. Identify the health 
care funding out in the open so that we can all see it. What was 
the mark?  I will be fair.  It was a C-minus.   The Liberals did 
only one of those three things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMA asked for a complete tobacco policy.  I give the 
Liberals a D for that because it was not even in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMA asked for every doctor to be treated fairly under the 
GST rules, in other words, to have the GST be zero rated. I give 
the Liberals an F. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMA wanted the RRSP limits raised.  I give the Liberals an 
F. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMA wanted the non-taxable health benefits maintained.  That 
was done; an A.  They also wanted a national target for health 
research funding.  Well there is a little bit of money for health 
research funding but no national target so I will give the 
Liberals a C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a C-minus, D, F, F, A and C.  The Liberals did not pass 
and would not get into medical school with this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am sharing my time in case you did not realize 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who was totally missed in this budget?  The 6,600 hepatitis C 
victims of tainted blood.  Not one penny for the left out 
hepatitis C individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make another little announcement today.  It 
looks like we are going to have to go to Washington, U.S.A. to 
get justice for those victims.  Next week that is exactly what 
the victims and I are doing.  We are going to Washington to see 
if we cannot find proper care for them there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not much in these speeches so let me draw a parallel 
for my medical colleagues who are in emergencies this afternoon. 
When hanging up 1,000 cc's of normal saline to look after the 
patient on that gurney today, this is what should be done with 
that 1,000 cc's. 
This will be the way to tell how the Liberals have treated health 
care funding in Canada.  Pour 500 cc's of the 1,000 cc's into the 
dish. Then pull up with a great big syringe exactly 68 cc's and 
put it back in the 1,000 cc's.  That is what is left for the 
patient lying in the emergency room. That 1,000 cc's of saline 
almost went down to half under the Liberal government.  And the 
Liberals put in a little tiny bit with their injection syringe 
from this budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care was too important to be turned into an emergency 
because we had a deficit problem.  There were so many other 
choices.  There was the choice of business subsidies that could 
have been scrubbed.  There was the choice of scrubbing all kinds 
of aid programs. So many wasteful things could have been 
scrubbed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to make one last prediction.  The prediction is that 
just before the next election a wheelbarrow full of money will 
come out and that wheelbarrow full of money will be designed to 
do one thing:  save the political hides of the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is a budget where every single Canadian will pay 
more and get less for health care.  The taxpayer will pay $2,000 
more in taxes and will get $1,500 less in health care. This 
budget could have been so much better.  I am disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member of course has five minutes 
of questions and comments.  I think I can get about a minute in 
at this point.  Then I want to go to Statements by Members.  The 
hon. member for Mississauga South has about 40 seconds to get it 
in. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, 
the member talked about private spending and the increase he said 
from 22% to 30% of private spending in health care.  Could the 
member advise the House how much of this private spending is for 
non-medically necessary purposes?  The member will know that 
medically necessary has specific connotations within the Canada 
Health Act.  Could he at least clarify what percentage of private 
spending in fact is discretionary spending? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the real trick about the 
Canada Health Act is to figure out where the Canada Health Act is 
not working well.  This is one of the areas where the Canada 
Health Act is not working.  The Canada Health Act needs 
improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of comprehensiveness, in the last eight years since 
the Liberals have taken power some 40 separate things have been 
taken out of what health care did pay for.  That is not 
comprehensiveness any more.  There is a slide downward of the 
things that are covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across the way decries, as I do, the changes that 
have been undertaken.  This is not what medicare should do. Fault 
laid at the feet of the Liberals?  Maybe.  Fault laid at the feet 
of the provinces?  Maybe.  But the funding has dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is almost 2 p.m.  There is 
still approximately three minutes in the questions and comments 
of the hon. member.  We will take that up after question period, 
but right now we will hear statements.  The hon. member for

They do not want handouts.  Most just want the chance for a

benefit deducted from their welfare cheques.  The poor who need 
it most will not get a nickel.

on the government's commitment to strengthen the health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario we will receive $4.4 billion, or 38% of the total 
increase in transfers.  The move to per capita entitlement for

transferred for a total increase of $5.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Burlington residents, in particular seniors, should get some 
much needed relief from their Conservative government who made 
bad decisions, like spending more than $85 million in partisan 
advertising while cutting annual hospital budgets and introducing 
millions of dollars in new user fees for seniors and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With investments in research, emerging priorities and a $25 
million nurse fund we will meet the challenges ahead.  Canadians 
can continue to count on their federal government and on an 
affordable and accessible health care system.

care research are the largest that have been made by a federal

that created medicare is going to stand behind it for generations

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr.

biggest swipe at health care in the history of this country. 
Maybe the minister is in the black but unfortunately hospitals 
and health districts in province after province are deeply in the 
red.  Given this accumulated debt imposed on the provinces by 
this radical surgery, can the minister still claim this new money 
is going into patient care, or is the money simply going into 
paying off past debts that he inflicted on these jurisdictions? 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>

immediately to the provinces is available at their discretion to 
solve whatever problems they deem fit.  That money has been made 
available and is part of an $11.5 billion investment, the single

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his ground breaking budget on Tuesday, the Minister of 
Finance outlined an initiative called GeoConnexions, an attempt 
to make geographic information more broadly available and useful 
to Canadians through the information highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister tell me how this initiative might benefit 
people in my riding of Sault Ste. Marie and Canadians in other 
parts of the country? 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this initiative is about Canada's geomatics industry, 
one of the country's fastest growing high tech sectors with more 
than 1,500 companies, 20,000 employees and a global market 
growing at a rate of 20% a year.  Canada is a big player in that 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>GeoConnexions is a unique intergovernmental, private sector, 
academic sector partnership to build an ultra modern information 
highway for the delivery of vital integrated comprehensive 
geographic information all across Canada. 
That means urban, rural, aboriginal, northern and remote areas. 
All Canadians will benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the proof is in.  A recent evaluation of the Canada jobs 
fund shows that grants are awarded for political reasons rather 
than on the merits of job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Liberal government using the Canada jobs fund as its 
own private pork barrel to reward its Liberal friends? 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is absolutely not what 
the study revealed.  It is quite the contrary.  The study talks 
about the role and the strengths of the fact that we do have 
political consultations with the other orders of government, with 
the fact that we consult all members of the House when a project 
takes place in their riding, including members of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we call that political interference, that is the strength of 
the program, to precisely consult the political actors, because 
they know their regions, even when they are in opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let us look at the facts.  First it was a Liberal bagman 
using the Canada jobs fund as a carrot to demand election 
contributions. Then a friend buys the Prime Minister's 
money-losing hotel and is rewarded with $164,000 from the jobs 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now officials with the fund are blowing the whistle on grants 
being handed out for political purposes.  When will the minister 
clean up this mess? 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can say that the program 
is working very well.  It has created 30,000 jobs in regions 
where unemployment remains stubbornly high.  It is a remarkable 
program that is appreciated even by a number of opposition 
members of parliament who have mentioned it to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say one thing.  We will on this side as a government 
continue to provide opportunities for unemployed Canadians in the 
regions where unemployment remains too high because that is what 
they expect of us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance 
who did indicate in his budget the growing concern about the gap 
between the haves and have nots in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the tax changes he introduced the other day, we 
find that the president of the Royal Bank received about a 
$30,000 tax break while hardworking Bob Price in my constituency 
got a tax break of about 35 cents a day.  Holly Olson, a single 
mom with four children on social assistance, got zero tax relief 
from this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these kinds of tax changes, does it not actually expand the 
gap between the haves and have nots as opposed to reducing it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if one takes a look at the budget, what one finds first 
of all is that the increase in the exemption to $675 
overwhelmingly benefits low and medium income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps more important than anything, given the tremendous 
burden that is carried by young families with small children, the 
increase in the child tax benefit, initially directed to low 
income families and now directed as well to middle income 
families, directly benefits those who need it most. 
Overwhelmingly the largest percentage increase— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance likely knows that 
people on social assistance do not get the benefits of that child 
tax benefit.  The provinces claw it back.  He knows that benefit 
is not a great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My supplementary question regards a comment written in the red 
book which I suspect he had something to with. It reads, “The 
introduction of the hated GST has compounded unfairness and 
complexity.  The GST has undermined public confidence in the 
fairness of the tax system”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than come in with this array of tax changes that really 
benefited some very wealthy people and did nothing for those who 
need it the most, why did the Minister of Finance not reduce the 
GST even by one point—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, overwhelmingly the best thing one can do for low income 
families is to make sure that they either pay very low taxes or 
no taxes at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of our budget, to give an example, a family with two 
children earning $30,000 now pays no net federal taxes.  As a 
result of our budget there are 200,000 Canadians added to the 
400,000 from last year for a total of 600,000 Canadians who are 
not paying any income tax in this country at all.

Defence and Veterans Affairs.  There are some 89 recommendations 
that deal with the issues of housing, pay and benefits, care for 
the injured and support for families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened in the budget this week is additional money, 
the first additional money that has come to the Department of

<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, for 17 years, Walter Harris served his constituents and 
his country with great distinction in the House as the MP for 
Grey-Bruce, as parliamentary secretary and as a fine minister in 
the cabinet of Louis St. Laurent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also served Canada with courage during the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a modest and unassuming man, a man who quietly mastered 
his brief and got the job done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He taught himself all the ins 
and outs of our parliamentary rules.  He had a genius for accepting 
the facts as they were and making the best of them.  He was my kind of 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, his modesty never did justice to his record, one that 
included being named Canada's first minister of citizenship and 
immigration, carrying through the new Indian Act and working out 
the details of Newfoundland's entry into Confederation 50 years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps most of all he will be remembered as the father of the 
registered retirement savings plan, a legacy of personal 
retirement security that has become more and more important to 
Canadians over the years.  Every time you see one of those RRSP 
commercials, think of Walter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Minister of Finance he also helped preside over the 
post-World War II economic expansion in which Canada took its 
place among the ranks of the leading industrial nations in the 
world. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of being his friend and benefiting from his 
support over the years.  His integrity, his honour and his 
commitment to his fellow citizens reflect the finest traditions 
of service to the community. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of no higher praise for Walter than the words of his 
law partner:  “This is a prince of a person who never harmed 
anyone”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be able to say that someone of his calibre was 
also a member of our party.  He was a distinguished 
parliamentarian whom everyone will greatly miss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To his family and many, many friends, I offer the deepest 
sympathies of our government and of our caucus. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I stand in the House today to share with my colleague the sincere 
feelings all of us have toward the life of Walter Harris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legacy he has left behind will never be surpassed.  He did 
it with a dedication to Canadians and without looking for the 
self-acclamation to which some politicians may fall prey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we in this country take RRSPs for granted.  We seldom 
think of the hard work, dedication, powers of persuasion and 
genuine empathy to the future of Canadian people it took for 
Walter Harris, as Canada's finance minister, to introduce 
registered retirement savings plans to us.  Just think of the 
contribution he gave to our society in that one issue alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all.  Walter Harris was Canada's first minister 
of citizenship and immigration in 1950.  Just imagine the 
leadership, the ingenuity and the long hours of dedication it 
took to build that department and establish the philosophy that 
would develop our nation.  He was well known for his knowledge of 
parliamentary procedure, which enhanced his ability to get things 
done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of accomplishments of Walter Harris would take many 
hours to expand upon in the House.  Let me identify just a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He practised law in Markdale, Ontario, and he was successful at 
it.  He served in France during World War II.  He served in the 
House of Commons in 1940.  He was re-elected in 1945, again 
re-elected in 1949 and again in 1953.  That is no small feat for 
anyone, but the dedication to one's country is evident in his 
desire to serve.  He returned to law practice in 1957 and was 
again exceptional in that business.  Walter has been described by 
some as a genius in politics, and I doubt whether anyone would 
disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Walter Harris was predeceased by his wife Grace.  He is survived 
by three children.  To his children, his friends and fellow 
members of parliament, we wish to express our sincerest 
condolences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a greater place, its citizens enjoy a greater

return to office in 1949, he was appointed to cabinet as 
minister of citizenship and immigration.  The position was 
especially important because Canadian citizenship had just been 
made distinct from British citizenship, and, in this post-war 
period, Canada was getting thousands of immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Re-elected again in 1953, Walter Harris took on his heaviest 
responsibilities in the final three years of his career.  From 
1954 to 1957, as Canada was going through a period of expansion, 
he served as minister of finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the three budgets that he brought down, it is the second one 
that gave him the greatest shock. In this regard, I would like 
to recount an anecdote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the 1956 budget speech, a journalist from the Montreal 
<I>Gazette</I> wanted to play a trick on a colleague from <I>La Presse</I> and 
pretended that he had received, by mistake, a full copy of the 
new budget. The other journalist quickly informed the Prime 
Minister's office, which called the minister of finance. Having 
heard the rumour about a budget leak, the minister set to the 
task of writing his letter of resignation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, the prime minister already knew what had happened 
and he sent a secretary to inform the minister of finance that 
the whole thing was a joke. History has a way of repeating 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 1957, Walter Harris had a long career as a lawyer in 
Markham, Ontario. He and his wife Grace Elma Morrison had 
three children, Fern, Margaret Helen and Robert Walter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois offers its most sincere condolences to all 
the surviving members of his family, and to the members of the 
Liberal party who knew him.

on behalf of my colleagues in the NDP caucus, I would like to 
join with the members who have already spoken on behalf of other

parliamentary career of Mr. Walter Harris and to pay tribute to a 
long and distinguished life in which we see success not only in 
the political realm but in his work as a lawyer and in his 
service to his country as a soldier.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was particularly struck when I read that in 1940 as a newly

</I></B></P><P align=left>The children of Walter Harris must be very proud of their

country.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  On Wednesday, February 
17, the hon. member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast raised a 
question of privilege concerning picket lines established at 
strategic locations around Parliament Hill and at entrances to 
specific buildings within the precincts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member alleged that these pickets impeded him as a member of 
parliament because they prevented him from carrying out his 
obligations in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two other members, the hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt and 
the hon. member for Souris—Moose Mountain, raised questions of 
privilege relating to the effect of these same picket lines on 
them and their work. The hon. member for Yorkton—Melville rose 
to support those interventions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank all the hon. members who helped me regarding 
this issue, including the Leader of the Government in the House, 
the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, and the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Labour. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before proceeding, let me remind the House that one of these 
questions of privilege has already been disposed of, namely the 
allegation made by the hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt that, 
in his words, a mob of hooligans used physical violence and 
intimidation to prevent him from gaining access to his office in 
one of the picketed buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the seriousness of the allegation I ruled immediately 
that there was in that case a prima facie question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member moved the appropriate motion which the House adopted 
without debate and so the matter of the alleged molestation of 
the hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt now stands referred to 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I carefully reviewed what hon. members said when they informed 
the House of their very justified fear about the events that 
occurred yesterday morning, and I am now prepared to make a 
ruling on the other incidents, which were reported to me and 
which I took under advisement.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One hon. member alleges that he was impeded from fulfilling his 
responsibilities as a member because at least initially he was 
unable to enter his building while other hon. members have argued 
that their privileges were breached because the strikers 
interfered with the usual operations of their offices and staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mindful of the role of the Speaker as the guardian of the rights 
of members, I have reviewed the facts presented yesterday 
regarding impeded access to the parliamentary precincts.  I have 
been persuaded by the interventions made by the hon. member for 
West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, the hon. member for Souris—Moose 
Mountain and the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville and have 
decided that these concerns are sufficiently serious for me to 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair therefore rules that the incident of February 17, 
1999, impeding access to the parliamentary precincts, constitute a 
prima facie case of contempt of the House.  I invite the hon. 
member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Cost to move the appropriate 
motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That the incident of February 17, 1999, relating to picket lines

Affairs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?

<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order arising out of question period.  In 
the closing minutes of question period the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle raised a matter having to do with 
expenditures of the other place and you ruled it 
out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect, I want to suggest that another interpretation of 
the the question might have been available to Chair.  It seems to 
me that when we are talking about the budget, when we are talking 
about expenditures and we are talking about estimates we should 
be able to bring up the other place in this context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand there is a longstanding rule that there are certain 
things we do not talk about it when it comes to the other place. 
We do not even mention it by name, which is why I call it the 
other place, out of respect for that tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from being here for almost 20 years now that there are 
contexts in which it is appropriate to talk about the other 
place, whether we are talking about its abolition, its reform or 
the expenditures associated with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Chair to consider the ruling that was made at 
that time.  It seemed to me the government benches were upset by 
it and I would ask Mr. Speaker to consider whether that ruling 
was the appropriate one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is not usual for a Speaker to give 
reasons for it.  I refer the hon. member to article 409 in 
Beauchesne's sixth edition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But specifically, as I understood the question, whether one side 
or the other is not particularly enamoured with a question does 
not weigh upon me to make a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt that the Minister of Finance is not responsible for 
estimates or expenditures in the Senate and he is not accountable 
to the House for that.  That is the reason for my decision and my 
decision will stand.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approves in general the budgetary policy of the government; of 
the amendment; and of the amendment to the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Macleod for his very 
well delivered and factual presentation on this budget.  He is a 
particular expert in the area of health care, being a licenced 
physician for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question of the member. The government has 
indeed promised to put $11.5 billion back into health care 
funding which brings it back to the 1995 level.  This is over a 
five year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Demographics clearly show that we have an aging population.  As 
well, as we grow older our demands on the health care system 
dramatically increase.  Five years from now when the $11.5 
billion is used up, will the aging population create a demand on 
the health care system such that we will find ourselves right 
where we started again because of the increased demand on the 
health care system?  Is there any chance, given the way we are 
moving to a greater dependency on health care, the 200,000 
waiting list has any hope of being shrunk under this Liberal 
formula? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the question. I have never heard of projecting funds 
five years down the road when there will be an election between 
then and now.  It is very bizarre to be able to think and project 
beyond the mandate of the current government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are talking about five years hence and we go back and 
look at the five years prior, we will find that the cuts have 
been $21.4 billion in the five years prior. Here we have $11.5 
coming.  Simple math would say two dollars taken out and one 
dollar being put in will never get us a shorter waiting line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The demographics, the aging of our population, are extremely 
important and are one of the reasons Reformers are asking for a 
real honest debate on the future of health care.  We are 
bantering back and forth.  We say two tier is presently in place 
in Canada and they are blaming us for two tier.  What we would 
really like is an honest debate with none of the name calling but 
a true fixing of the health care system. 
If we had that I would be proud to be a member of parliament and 
debating health.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance is looking forward to this presentation 
today.  I know he will listen to what I have to say about the 
budget and take the message to the finance minister and his 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that the Liberal government has truly and 
rightfully earned the title as the pay more, get less government 
of all time.  In all of Canadian history there has been no 
government that has picked the pockets of the Canadian taxpayer, 
the individual, small business and large business as has this 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter what the finance minister said a couple of days ago in 
his great budget speech, these are the facts.  Canadians since 
1993 have consistently, every year of this government, paid more 
in taxes and received less in services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some numbers.  Average Canadian taxpayers are now 
paying annually over $2,000 more in personal income taxes than 
they paid in 1993 when the government was elected.  These are the 
people who are out spending their earnings in the marketplace 
trying to create a growing economy.  The average Canadian 
household income has shrunk by over $4,000 since 1993.  Let us 
imagine taking $4,000 out a household income.  One year it is 
there and five years later it is gone.  That is what the 
government has done to Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the government is responsible for the highest increase 
in payroll taxes for workers and employers than any other 
government in the history of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see Canada pension plan premiums increase by a whopping 
73% over the next few years.  And guess what?  When the current 
generation in their early twenties and thirties retire, having 
paid the full 73% increase at least for now, they will get less 
money.  There might be more increases coming down the road. I 
hope not.  Having paid that massive increase through their entire 
working lives, they will get less money in Canada pension 
benefits than someone who has paid the lower amount, lower than 
the 73% amount.  That is the legacy of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Average workers and employers are paying far more in EI premiums 
than necessary.  That is another payroll tax.  The EI 
commissioner has clearly said that the government is scooping an 
additional $7 billion out of the EI fund that it is not entitled 
to.  It is simply not entitled to it.  Why does it not just give 
it back? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that really aggravates hard working Canadians is the 
war on the two parent, single income family begun many years ago 
by the hero of the Liberal Party, Pierre Trudeau.  It is 
continuing today under this Liberal government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT67"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT67"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1535

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average two parent, single income family with a $60,000 
income, that is one parent working and two children, will pay for 
the privilege of having one parent stay home to nurture the 
children, to help to steer them in the direction within the 
belief of the family, over $4,000 more in income tax than a two 
parent, two income family with two children earning the same 
$60,000.  In other words, if a family earns $60,000 with one 
parent working and one parent staying home, they pay $4,000 more 
than if both parents were working earning the same $60,000 and 
had two children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to ask why the government continues this war against the 
family.  Why is the government so determined to drive every last 
stay at home parent out of the house and into the workforce?  Why 
is the government so determined through its discriminatory 
taxation regime to ensure that children growing up do not have at 
least one parent at home to help in their formative years and 
through their teen years into adulthood?  Why is the government 
through its taxation regime so determined to do that?  I do not 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been suggested that some sort of social engineering is 
going on.  It has been suggested that the Liberal government with 
its socialist philosophy has figured out that a family unit has 
strength and as long as that family unit is together the strength 
is present and the government cannot get its clutches on those 
kids.  It wants to break up families, get rid of the parents, get 
them out working, put the kids in day care and make free thinkers 
out of them so that it can come in with its philosophy and teach 
the kids what the world looks like through the eyes of a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not say it lightly when I say there is a war against the 
family.  It was started back in the days of Pierre Elliot 
Trudeau, when he brought in tax regimes that literally forced the 
second parent out of the home and into the workforce so that they 
could maintain the same standard of living.  It was not to 
increase their standard of living but to maintain the same 
standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this master plan the Liberals have had for so many 
years?  We do not know their real agenda, whether it is social 
engineering or whatever.  However, we do know that what they have 
been doing is very real.  It has been very effective in getting 
both parents into the workforce through their discriminatory tax 
regimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can speak on behalf of many families who have made sacrifices 
while raising their children in order to have one parent stay 
home to be with the family.  It happened in our family and it 
happened in many other families of people whom I know very well. 
They say it is no longer a privilege to stay home and raise the 
kids.  It is a true sacrifice because one has to give up so many 
other things to have that ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me very angry when I look at the budget to find some 
relief for the two parent, single income families and it simply 
is not there.  There is over $4,000 difference in taxes between 
those two examples simply because one parent stays at home and 
one works or they both go out to work. 
It is discriminatory.  We had hoped the government would address 
it and it has not.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to all the families out there with one parent at home and 
one income that we will keep the fight up.  We will keep the 
pressure on the government and sooner or later it will recognize 
the value of mothers or parents who stay home to be with their 
kids. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is just astounding for me to hear the word discriminatory from 
the member opposite.  This is not a discriminatory budget at all. 
In fact the budget is absolutely wonderful for every citizen of 
Canada.  It is so obvious that members opposite do not understand 
what is in the budget.  Otherwise they would not be saying these 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about single taxpayers earning $20,000 or less. 
Their taxes will be reduced by at least 10%.  The typical one 
earner family with two children and an income of $30,000 or less 
will pay no net federal income tax.  Families with incomes of 
$45,000 or less will have their taxes reduced by a minimum of 10% 
and in some cases more depending on the specific situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to pull out numbers.  I do not know where those 
numbers come from, but I do know the accuracy of numbers that 
talk about us being in a situation where we can give tax relief. 
I do know that the government pays attention to children with 
some needs and that $300 million extra are going into the child 
tax benefit.  These are very direct federal government 
contributions where there are specific needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax relief for low and middle income Canadians is the top 
priority of the government.  Broad based tax relief should focus 
first on personal income tax.  That is what members saw.  They 
did not see a budget filled with corporate or business tax 
relief.  What they saw was down to the individual Canadian who 
has worked hard to deliver the country to the place where we are 
today where we can bring in these measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home town we have a medical community, a research 
community.  The people in my riding of London West are incredibly 
grateful for the future orientation of the people and the 
priorities of the government.  I think of what that will mean in 
the health of the nation.  The budget will affect the health of 
the nation and every family, no matter what income level, for 
years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we put money in research we are showing forethought.  I am 
getting faxes from people in my riding, researchers, people who 
have perhaps not corresponded with the political network ever 
before, saying thanks for the budget.  This is important to 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering how much into the future they are looking, or 
whether members of the Reform Party are only interested in some 
long ago world which unfortunately in families, and the diversity 
of families in the country, does not exist in that format.  There 
is choice here.  We are talking about current day Canadians and a 
society that is good.  What century does the hon. member plan 
for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
her rhetoric.  However these are the facts.  On that side of the 
street lives the Smith family:  two parents and two children. One 
parent works.  The total household income is $60,000.   On this 
side of the street is the Jones family: two parents and two 
children with both parents working.  Their total income is 
$60,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Jones family pays $4,000 more in taxes than the Smith family 
on that side of the street.  The same size family, the same 
annual income, same street, same house and they even drive the

of the street because of the government's discriminatory tax 
policies against families that choose to have one income and one 
parent staying home.

the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact the Reform Party has put forward many times 
that if we were in power, and we will be in power, there would be 
no family with a household income of under $30,000 paying any tax 
whatsoever.  There would be zero tax for a $30,000 household 
income. That is what we would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would lower the taxation rates for the hardworking Canadians 
out there.  They would have more money in their pockets to spend 
into the economy.  That would bring more revenue into the 
government coffers which would allow us to give more services to 
the poor families the member talked about.

Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Niagara Falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like to address the House about a very important 
investment that the 1999 federal budget is making. That 
investment is in our children.  We all know that today's children 
are tomorrow's leaders. This government has taken that saying to 
heart and we are putting our money where our heart is, in 
Canada's children, in Canada's future.  This budget is an 
important step in giving our children the support they need to 
become active and healthy Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like to speak about Canadian children.  The 1999 
federal budget invests in the future of our children.  By 
protecting their future, we are protecting the future of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spirit of the 1999 federal budget is health.  In addition to 
the $11.5 billion that we are investing in the health of all 
Canadians, we are investing $287 million over the next three 
years in preventative and other health initiatives.  This money 
will go to improve prenatal nutrition, food safety, and toxic 
substance control, to foster innovations in rural and community 
health, and to combat disease. More important, this money will 
help to ensure a healthy future for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada prenatal nutrition program will receive an additional 
$75 million over the next three years to help high risk pregnant 
moms have healthier babies.  This is an investment we are making 
in our future.  From this investment we will reap both financial 
and emotional benefits for generations to come.  The additional 
$75 million is on top of the current $13 million we are investing 
per year. This program is especially dear to my heart because it 
will address a growing Canadian crisis, fetal alcohol syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past 30 years I have been working in Moncton with 
children with fetal alcohol syndrome, their parents and pregnant 
women. They need us.  Fifty-five per cent of people in our 
Canadian prisons are fetal alcohol syndrome victims. It is an 
economic issue and this is the first time we have had a 
government that has looked at the preventative measures.  We need 
to help these children become taxpayers and not offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our children are especially vulnerable to toxic substances in 
the environment, in food and drinking water.  It can affect 
fetal, infant and childhood development.  We all know these are 
the most crucial years of development for all Canadians. We must 
work to prevent these effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has two direct investments to ensure that we protect 
Canadians and our children from these harmful effects.  It has 
allocated $65 million over the next three years to modernize and 
strengthen the federal food and safety program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition it provides Environment Canada with $42 million over 
the next three years to implement the recently introduced 
amendments to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.  This 
act aims to protect all Canadians, including our children, from 
the damaging effects of toxic substances by identifying them 
quicker and controlling them faster. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of New Brunswick, there is a mix of urban and 
rural populations.  It can be a real challenge to get proper 
medical treatment in the rural areas, with time being a vital 
factor in treating children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that care provided at home or in community centres may 
be a favourable alternative in certain circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget will invest $50 million in the next three years to 
come up, in consultation with the provinces, with innovative 
approaches to health care in rural and community settings. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diabetes is a disease that affects Canadians, and the rate of 
this disease is particularly high among aboriginal people, 
striking three times that of the general population.  The 1999 
federal budget will invest $55 million to combat diabetes.  This 
money will go to finding better ways to prevent this disease and 
enhance treatment and care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 federal budget is not just an investment in health for 
our children.  It also provides direct financial support to 
families through the Canada child tax benefit and the national 
child benefit.  The federal government is committed through this 
program to assist low and middle income families with the 
expenses of raising children.  This is an investment in the 
future of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the Prime Minister and premiers made tackling child 
poverty a shared priority.  This government does not take that 
priority lightly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our two previous budgets we provided $1.7 billion for the 
children of low income families.  This budget announced a further 
$300 million to enhance the Canada child tax benefit for modest 
and middle income families.  These investments promote fairness 
and equity among individuals with different incomes and family 
circumstances because no matter the family, we need to ensure 
that all Canadian children are able to benefit from all that this 
great country has to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national child benefit supplement is a federal, provincial 
and territorial initiative designed to tackle child poverty. The 
supplement is available to those who need it the most, low income 
families.  The maximum level of the national child benefit 
supplement would increase by a total of $350 per child. The net 
family income level for eligibility will rise from about $27,000 
to $30,000 by July 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enrichments to the national child benefit supplement will result 
in increased benefits for 1.4 million low income families.  A low 
income family with two children will receive up to 48% more in 
the year 2000 than they did in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year's budget also adds $300 million to the benefits 
provided to modest and middle income families under the Canada 
child tax benefit.  Taken together with the $850 million 
announced in the 1997 budget, these measures will increase the 
child tax benefit by $2 billion this year.  Two million modest 
and middle income families will receive these benefits.  In 
addition, it will be extended to about 100,000 families that 
currently do not receive it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over three quarters of the child tax benefit will go to single 
parent and single income families.  This tax benefit will affect 
some 3.2 million families, or over 80% of all Canadian children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More importantly, this money will help our children to 
successfully prepare their future.  This way we are helping them 
become the pillars of our society.

the importance of our children, a budget that invests in those 
children. I entered politics and came to Ottawa to give a voice 
to those who did not have one, those Canadians who are children, 
children who are the future of Canada.  These children of the new 
millennium have the support and commitment of this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, my question is for the hon. minister who I know is an 
Atlantic Canadian and with whom I share many of the concerns she 
talks about in terms of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talked about toxic substances in toys.  I direct her 
attention to my riding where we have the highest cancer rates in 
the country, where more people are dying because of cancer and it 
is almost directly related to the huge environmental disaster 
known as the tar ponds.  Would she not agree with me that the 
children who live in and around that area are at great risk and 
that it is indeed regrettable that there is no mention in the 
budget of special funding to honour the government's commitment 
to clean up those tar ponds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Claudette Bradshaw:</B>  Madam Speaker, for sure, having 
worked with children I understand what the member is saying. I 
understand the importance of the environment. However, I would 
suggest to the hon. member that the budget we received was not 
very specific.  Maybe we should wait for more specific areas to 
come.  When we talk about the environment, I know that this side 
of the House is very concerned.  We will take his request very 
seriously. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the member speak about the money that 
was going to be pumped back into health care, which is certainly 
welcomed funding.  I want to remind the member that this is the 
government that cut Canadian health and social transfers to the 
provinces from $18.5 billion down to $11.5 billion. With the 
money that is being put back in, it is going to take three years 
to get back to where we were prior to the cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question really has to do with the $3.5 billion that is going 
to be budgeted for in this current fiscal year, 1998-99, the one 
that ends March 31, but which is going to be proportioned out 
over three years.  If it is going to be budgeted for this year, 
why is that $3.5 billion not being pumped in immediately in order 
to see some response as a result of the much needed money that is 
required?  If it is budgeted for this year, maybe it should be 
spent this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Claudette Bradshaw:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not know 
where the hon. member and his colleagues were last year when we 
did the budget because they keep bringing up the $18.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member remembers last year's budget, we put an awful lot 
of money into education for youth.  There is the millennium fund. 
We brought in the child tax credit.  We brought in the 
transitional job fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should look at what we brought in for health 
care, education and poverty. The member wants to talk about 
health care so let us talk about it.  We took away $6 billion but 
with the tax credit we have cut by $3 billion, not $20 billion or 
$15 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians listening to this debate wonder why they are hearing 
all these different numbers.  I sit here every day and wonder 
about all the different numbers.  At home in my region of 
Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe, I can assure the member that our 
nurses, our patients and our citizens are glad because we gave 
the message in this budget that health care, children, youth and 
education are priorities for this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Claudette Bradshaw:</B> Madam Speaker, this is an interesting

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I welcome the opportunity to address this House and to speak to 
the sixth Liberal budget.  The 1999 budget demonstrates the 
dedication of the Liberal government to advance the living 
standards of Canadians through the creation of well paying jobs, 
a robust economy and equal opportunities for all. All this has 
built an excellent health care system and a safety net for those 
in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last five years I have had the privilege of serving with 
the Standing Committee on Finance and to take part in the 
prebudget consultations held throughout Canada.  The great number 
of Canadians who took time from their busy schedule to present 
their views had one thing in common, their strong desire to build 
better lives for themselves and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians wish to be part of a society that not only provides 
opportunities for everyone but that provides support when through 
no fault of their own Canadians need a helping hand.  This 
government has listened.  The results may be seen in the positive 
turn taken by the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment rate has fallen considerably since the Liberals 
first took office.  Now it stands at its lowest level in almost a 
decade.  I am proud to report that my own riding of Niagara Falls 
and the Niagara area continue to grow and to prosper.  Lately we 
have witnessed new developments like expansions of existing 
places of employment and many new businesses opening their doors. 
This in turn translates into jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the month of November alone, 13,000 more people were employed 
in the Niagara area.  This means 13,000 more jobs than last year. 
According to the last labour force survey, 2,600 additional 
people were employed in the accommodation, food and beverage 
industry.  The unadjusted unemployment rate dropped from 8.8% to 
approximately 6%.  In Niagara 70 new businesses have opened since 
last spring, businesses that range from large chains and 
department stores to small entrepreneurs finding their niche in 
today's market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Existing businesses continue to expand and are making large 
investments in their operations.  This will not only ensure that 
employees keep their jobs but it will create new positions.  An 
increase of workers in the agricultural sector has seen an 
additional 5,000 people gain employment.  As a result of previous 
Liberal budgets, interest rates have declined substantially. An 
economist will say that low interest rates encourage both 
investment and expansion.  We have wrestled to the ground.  Now 
it is firmly under control.  All the economist indicators are 
telling us that it will remain so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada today enjoys a solid reputation as a low inflation 
country.  What a difference from the beginning of 1994 when 
Canada's unemployment rate stood at 11.5%, when our country was 
faced with a $42 billion deficit, the largest in Canadian 
history, a large deficit that we were able to eliminate in just 
four years. 
This year for the second consecutive year the government has 
brought down a budget that is balanced.  Not only that but in 
this fiscal year we will again balance the books. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first time since 1951-52 that Canada has been 
deficit free for two years in a row. A surplus of $3.5 billion, 
the first surplus in 28 years, was recorded in 1997-98 and it 
went to pay down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Canadians believe their government can make a difference. 
Despite the progress we have made in balancing the books, we are 
not forgetting that the role of our government is to respond to 
the needs of Canadians. The role of our government is to help 
Canadians adjust to changes and prepare for the challenges that 
we all have to face in the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During prebudget consultations Canadians voiced one main 
concern, the importance of their health system. They expressed to 
us the fear that the quality of care available to them would not 
be there when their loved ones would need it.  These concerns had 
to be addressed.  Here, once more, we have listened to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While budget '98 was an education budget, budget '99 makes 
health the largest single investment this government has ever 
made.  Since the elimination of the deficit in 1998 
three-quarters of all new government spending has been focused on 
health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the provisions in the budget the provinces and territories 
will receive from the federal government over the next five years 
an additional $11.5 billion specifically for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has made major commitments to Canadians 
through Canada's new social union and the new measures announced 
in the 1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now Canadians will be able to see tangible benefits such as 
improved health care, better programs for our children and our 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We share the strong desire of all Canadians to have confidence 
in our health care system and to see that medicare will continue 
to meet everyone's needs well into the 21st century.  Quality 
health care is a priority for Canadians.  We all want to be 
reassured that the health care system is delivering accessible, 
high quality care in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also want to know how and where their health care 
dollars are being spent.  When medicare was first introduced our 
focus was on curing illness with doctors and hospitals.  Now good 
health care is as much about preventing illness as curing it. We 
know we need to develop innovative ways to provide care in the 
home and community for people who are ill or who have long term 
health problems. Good home care will free hospital beds for those 
who need urgent medical attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last decade patients' needs have evolved, health care 
needs have changed and medical technology has had to keep pace 
with these changes.  It is normal therefore to re-examine the way 
we do things to continue to provide all Canadians with a superior 
health care system. I believe that with this budget the Liberal 
government has shown its commitment to medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government will never allow a two tier system of medicine 
to take hold in Canada, one for the poor and one for the rich. 
Support and research are paramount to a good health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget builds on previous Liberal government 
investments in research, knowledge and innovation by injecting 
$1.4 billion over the remainder of 1998-99 and the next three 
fiscal years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will expand and integrate research and innovation in health 
care.  Moreover, this funding will allow us to continue exploring 
with the provinces innovative approaches to rural and community 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget builds on the Canadian opportunities strategies 
outlined in last year's budget.  The investment of more than $1.8 
billion over the remainder of this fiscal year and the next three 
years will support the creation of employment. 
It will strengthen research facilities, provide more 
opportunities for advanced research, develop new and better uses 
of the information highway and directly support employment, 
especially for our youth.  This is a very important measure in 
this budget. It will tell many young bright Canadians, 
scientists, to unpack their bags and stay in Canada.

say that he has a wonderful vineyard and that he makes excellent 
wines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, after the good wine, the sour grapes. Does he not find it 
unfortunate that the Minister of Finance did not put a single

without any specific sector creating unemployment my area now has 
only a 6% unemployment rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the government's responsibility to pay people to stay 
at home.  It is up to the government to create the atmosphere so 
the private sector, individuals like me and my colleagues, can 
create the jobs.  We do not need money to provide for 
unemployment.  We need employers to create an atmosphere where 
the employer could make money and employ more people.  That is 
the role of this government and that is the role for people we 
should be looking at.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, we 
keep hearing from the government side about how wonderful this

having a day to digest what they have heard, have come up with 
some different ideas. One is KPMG. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trying to get through the smoke and mirrors is a problem with 
this.  Some of the issues that were promised last year have been 
repromised.  Some of the things the government is taking credit 
for now will not happen until next year.  Some of the things the 
government is saying will create a savings of $300 or $400 will 
actually create a savings of $57. The fact is Canadians are 
paying more and getting less.  We will keep saying that until 
they get the idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member keeps saying how well his area has done. His area 
happens to be in Ontario.  The other area in Canada that is doing 
well is Alberta.  Most of the jobs created in this country have 
been in Ontario and Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we count in the fact that the Canadian pension plan is going 
up and EI premiums are going up, which the government forgets to 
mention, I wonder if the member would like to tell us how much 
Canadians are saving after those two factors are figured in.

only dealing with statistics.  It is dealing more with people. 
Basically when more people are employed they are paying more 
taxes.  When more people are employed they are creating other 
jobs. This is where we beg to differ with members on the other 
side because they are only looking at statistics.  We are trying 
to put a human face to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one has told me to look at the unemployment rate and at how 
much tax we are paying.  A lot of them come to me and say “Look 
at what I have around me”.  There is more development and more 
people working and paying taxes.  Therefore the whole economy 
moves much better and faster.  They are not asking about the 
percentage of tax but what we have done for the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To some people it is only $1.20 or $1.30 more in their pockets, 
but it is a lot better than raising taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to speak to the budget.  Last year at this time, 
when the Minister of Finance brought down his budget, everyone 
was shocked at the federal government's arrogant disregard for 
provincial jurisdictions, particularly in the area of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, with this new budget, we can hardly believe our eyes as 
the Liberal government openly sets out to invade areas of 
jurisdiction that do not belong to it and to duplicate what is 
being done already in the provinces, simply to ease its 
conscience.  That is what it is doing in this budget and that is 
what we condemn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can hardly believe our eyes, but that will not stop us from 
saying how disastrous this budget is for Quebec. The worst part 
about all this is that the money belongs to us and is being used 
in provincial areas of jurisdiction.  This is unacceptable. 
First they went after education, and now they are going after 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Come now. It is not “our” money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Minister of Human 
Resources Development, I know you think this is no the 
taxpayers' money. Everyone is paying— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Order, please. I must remind 
the hon. member for Québec to address her remarks to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Pardon me, Madam Speaker, but would you 
be so kind as to tell the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to calm down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> This is unacceptable.  First they go 
after education and now it is health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After cutting billions of dollars in transfer payments, after 
hamstringing the provinces, which were already cleaning up their 
finances and did not need this additional burden, and after 
causing an unprecedented crisis in the health care system, the 
Minister of Finance and his colleague, the Minister of Health, 
are stooping to a new low in arrogance and getting ready to 
impose their views on the health sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strategy has been around for quite a while and is quite 
deliberate. 
The intrusions announced in the budget put into effect a 
long-standing plan to deliberately smother the provinces that do 
not generate enough revenue from taxes to take on their full 
responsibilities under the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So there is a hidden agenda here. The President of the Treasury 
Board put it best in an interview to <I>Le Soleil</I>, on March 8, 
1996, and we know that he makes numerous statements to the press. 
He said “When Bouchard has to make cuts, we in Ottawa will be 
able to show that we have the means to preserve the future of 
our social programs”. This is the real intention behind this 
government's long-standing strategy. This kind of reasoning 
speaks volumes about the Liberal government's agenda and 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal cuts contributed to create a crisis in the health 
systems of provinces that had already been affected by the 
freeze on transfers imposed by the Conservative government. This 
government is taking advantage of the difficult situation in 
which it has put the provinces to impose all sorts of new 
encroachments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In education, the latest encroachment by the Liberal government, 
with the millennium scholarships, certainly is a case in point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treating patients with red tape and statistics is strong 
medicine. Who is bearing the brunt of the finance minister's 
generosity? Who is being made to pay for this strategy by the 
Liberals? The unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development should not be 
laughing today, because we know. We have toured the regions and 
we know how the unemployed have been ignored in this budget. The 
provinces have had to come to terms with this offloading of the 
federal deficit. It has not been a laughing matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:  </B>Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I wish to point out to 
the hon. member that I was certainly not laughing when she 
mentioned her regional tour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am afraid that this is not 
a point of order, but part of the debate.  The hon. member for 
Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not know why the 
Minister of Human Resources Development is so intent on 
interrupting my speech, but I can say that we conducted a 
regional tour on the impact of the new EI reform.  Many 
unemployed workers have been overlooked in the new budget's 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The entire middle class has been taxed so heavily that it 
deserved a break.  Yet, in 1993, the Prime Minister was proudly 
dragging his infamous red book around and telling anyone who 
would listen that his government would not cut payments to 
individuals or to the provinces.  It is there in black and 
white. 
A few months later, the Minister of Finance set the record 
straight and said that the next budget would contain deep cuts 
in funding to the provinces for health, social assistance and 
education.  I am not making this up.  This is what he said 
during an interview he gave the <I>Toronto Star</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad how this Minister of Finance juggles the figures and 
makes a mockery of transparency.  I could give many examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> He's a tinkerer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> The few words I quoted earlier show only 
too well how, since 1993, the Liberals have continued to feed 
the public increasingly rosy promises in order to blind it to an 
ever darker future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the budget is really saying is that some of the cuts will 
be reversed over the next three years.  We were promised $42 
billion by 2003, and now it will only be $33 billion.  So they 
are still cuts.  Before they talk about giving presents, they 
should make sure the people getting the presents are not left 
with a debt at the start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that the provinces will have to face cuts of $33 
billion under Liberal management between 1994 and 2003, as 
opposed to the $42 billion in cuts they promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, true to itself, the government never gives without 
taking away.  This time, it is taking advantage of the difficult 
situation it put the provinces in to impose a whole lot more 
meddling.  The millennium scholarships are a case in point. 
They put their finger on the sore spot and talk about fixing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After bleeding the provinces of billions of dollars for health 
care, the Liberals now want to spend hundreds of millions, a 
total of $1.4 billion, on statistics and paperwork.  There will 
be $400 million in administrative costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this money is going to go into reports on waiting lists and 
on the assignment of doctors.  What has the federal government 
to do with all this?  The Canadian Institute for Health 
Information will be spending $95 million over three years, and 
it will have the new task of providing periodic reports on the 
health of Canadians, the health care system, including waiting 
lists, doctor and specialist assignments and the most effective 
courses of treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national health surveillance network will be created.  It will 
monitor the outbreak of serious illnesses and will provide an 
electronic link among laboratories in Canada. This represents an 
investment of $75 million over three years.  It will give 
Canadians access to information on health issues from nutrition 
to colds and from breast cancer to diabetes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, how is all this money—millions of dollars, $75 
million over three years—going to help people waiting for 
hospital beds?  We will know how many are waiting, but I do not 
know how many we will cure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Institute for Health Information is another 
institution that will receive funds to report periodically on 
the health of Canadians and their health system, specifically on 
waiting lists, and the doctors and specialist assignments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will also be $115 million over three years for telehealth 
and home telecare pilot projects. 
This will overlap what CLSCs are doing.  More duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget accountability measures, all for the purpose 
of providing Canadians with better information. This will cost 
another $43 million over three years, so that Canadians are 
better informed about the results of federal health programs, in 
accordance with the social union agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the research and evaluation fund for nursing 
staff. The fund will be used, it is said, to seek solutions to 
the challenges facing nursing staff.  We know the challenges 
they are now facing.  An amount of $25 million has been 
earmarked to help nursing staff provide quality health care, and 
find ways of recycling existing staff and attracting new 
recruits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prenatal nutrition program is another example of 
duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new initiative in health care is a scandal because of the 
duplication and the mountain of paper and statistics involved. 
That is not the way to improve health care in the provinces, and 
we will oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are taking another approach to health care in rural 
communities.  In order to attract doctors to rural regions, the 
federal government plans to spend $50 million over three years 
as it gives us another glaring example of duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the real intent of the government with this intrusion 
into health care?  It is to centralize.  When I was elected in 
1993, the government was being criticized for its tendency to 
centralize and its failure to respect provincial jurisdictions. 
This will be another very unpopular budget in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you what the Quebec minister of health can do with 
$20 million. 
She can invest $3.2 million to be distributed to hospitals with 
crowded emergency rooms.  This also represents 830 additional 
hospital beds, the hiring of 900 people for one month, as well 
as the cost of ambulance transport and new equipment for 
emergencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There you have four measures with $20 million. 
One can only imagine what we could have done in the Quebec 
health care sector with the money the federal government is 
going to use to duplicate services, collect statistics and 
follow doctors around to see how they are responding to demand. 
We will therefore continue to condemn this federal interference 
in provincial areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the public has commented on the surpluses. 
Provincial governments, health and social organizations, the 
public, everyone agrees that the massive cuts in health care 
were responsible for some of the most difficult times the health 
system has experienced in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The saddest thing of all is that the federal government ended 
the 1997-98 fiscal year with a surplus of between $5 billion and 
$6 billion.  It could therefore have achieved a zero deficit in 
1997-98, without cutting so much as one red cent of social 
transfer payments to the provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It obtained this budget surplus through cuts in the Canada 
social transfer for health, education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the misappropriation of the money in the 
employment insurance at the expense of the unemployed.  Now six 
people in ten are excluded from employment insurance, which 
swells the employment insurance fund by $20 billion.  Non 
indexation of tax rates brought in a lot of money too, billions 
of dollars.  Tax rates and tax credits have not been indexed 
since 1986.  So the middle class is again bankrolling the 
government's need for visibility and control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since they have been in power, the Liberals have dramatically 
chopped transfer payments to the provinces.  In 1994, payments 
intended for the provinces were $18.8 billion.  In 1997-98, they 
were $12.5 billion, that is, cut by $6.3 billion.  And the 
government tells us it is being generous with this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, the social transfer was, on average, $678 per capita. 
In 1998, it was only $386, and all the while health care costs 
were increasing because of population aging, the cost of new 
technologies and increase in the cost of medicines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another impact as well raising the cost of health care. 
When a population becomes poorer, it eats less well and the 
quality of life decreases. 
That means also the stress resulting from loss of employment, 
because employment insurance is not an option.  That is what 
that means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are distressed.  They perhaps need more medical care. 
What does the government do in the new budget?  It pulls the rug 
out from under the provinces and Quebec with the new way of 
calculating the Canada social transfer in health matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has reached its deficit objective.  It 
has reached it and now it gloats.  It wants credit for the fact 
that Quebec will eliminate its deficit.  That is shameful.  It 
has emptied the pockets of the provinces, and they will not have 
$7 billion to give the public health care, education and social 
assistance.  That is what that means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the example of what happens because there is no 
indexation. It is the case of people who, in 1986, had two 
children and earned $25,800. With the increase in the cost of 
living, they earn $35,400 in 1996.  That does not mean they earn 
more.  Because the tax on the additional income is not indexed, 
they have $3,790 less in their pockets since 1986.  Since the GST 
credit was not indexed, they have $944 less in his pocket.  Since 
the federal family allowance is not indexed, it means $554 less. 
For the child tax credit, it means $602 less.  The refundable 
child tax credit—I know it does not exist any more, but I am 
talking about 1986—means $1,157 less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So people earning $25,800 in 1986 get $7,047 less this year, 
with a salary of $35,400.  Members cannot say people earning 
$35,000 a year are in the favoured class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about the $7 billion that came out of the EI surplus 
every year to lower the deficit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that they do not like it when we talk about robbery in 
the House, but this was robbery of the poorest— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I would ask hon. members to 
be very careful in their choice of words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> That is a fine general principle, Madam 
Speaker.  I am accusing no one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From whom was this $7 billion taken every year?  From the 
poorest members of society, those who had lost their jobs, who 
needed help the most.  From SMEs, which create the most jobs but 
which are also the most vulnerable.  As a result, fewer people 
are eligible for EI and are forced to turn to social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that not everyone can qualify for social assistance.  An 
individual is not eligible if he or she has any income, however 
small. Therefore, when one of the partners in a relationship is 
working, it is clear that they will not qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing for the poor, and a few crumbs for the middle 
class.  This is a budget that favours the rich, three rich 
provinces, where the quality of life is perhaps better than in 
the poorer provinces, where fewer health services will perhaps 
be used, where there is perhaps less need for support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the Liberal government is talking about equity?  What 
exactly is equity?  The new CHST formula changes the rules of 
the game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Bras D'Or—Cape Breton, Devco; the hon. member for 
Skeena, National Revenue.

<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened intently to the 
comments made by the hon. member opposite.  She continued to 
criticize and to chastise the federal government for investing 
and reinvesting in a shared responsibility in research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but point out my dismay at why the member would 
continue to criticize an investment in research which in fact 
would help Canadians and would help Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Researchers in Quebec have said after the budget that they 
welcome the moneys the government is reinvesting in research.  It 
will help to improve the quality of life for Quebeckers and for 
Canadians.  We have reinvestments in areas like telehealth and 
home care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member went further to criticize the prenatal nutrition 
program, a program where the federal government works with the 
provinces that works directly with the communities. That is 
working extremely well.  If the hon. member has some criticisms 
or some way to improve that program, I would be willing to listen 
to her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talks about all this money being spent by the government and 
how there is no outcome.  I want to point to one specific example 
in terms of the service delivery.   We have done some research in 
service delivery to individuals who suffer from a thyroid 
condition and have been able to improve it and at the same time 
save money to reinvest in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why the hon. member wants to continue to 
treat Quebec in the way she wants to treat it.  Why she does not 
accept that researchers in her own province are supportive of the 
additional money and want to continue to do good work to help 
Quebeckers and to help Canadians? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, the Liberal member is not 
happy with my criticism of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said was that this budget fails to focus on those in the 
greatest need.  One part of the budget deals with research.  My 
criticism was about the budget as a whole and its impact on the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said was that research funding duplicates and overlaps 
existing funding.  The federal government is going to spend 
millions of dollars on administration instead of putting them 
where they will help people who are sick and those on waiting 
lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I criticized the number of documents and statistics that are 
going to be produced, with no regard for what the public is 
going through.  Right now, we need more hospital beds, less 
pressure in emergency wards, more ambulances, and faster 
transportation. We need to give provincial governments the money 
they were entitled to expect, rather than the mere $150 million 
for health care they received.  They were expecting $500 million 
for health.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Quebec on her speech.  The member is 
well known for her concern for the less well off in Canada and I 
think she made some very good points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would she care to reflect on something I came across in an 
newspaper today?  A KPMG accountant took a look at some of the 
tax relief in the budget and discovered, lo and behold, that the 
tax cuts the government is reporting are nowhere near what they 
will actually be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about somebody who has a low income.  According to 
the budget a single taxpayer with $20,000 of taxable income will 
save $178 from the last two budgets, but this accountant says 
that this year the savings would be $57 rising to $114.  This is 
nowhere near the government's numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague be prepared to comment on the government's 
sleight of hand? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, the tax system is indeed 
far from helping low income families, and we know full well that 
those most favoured by the budget are those earning $250,000 or 
more, whose taxes will be cut by over $3,000. In contrast, after 
sending in his tax return, the employee who made $20,000 this 
year will only get a $57 tax cut. That is what we deplored. This 
is a budget for the rich, not for low-income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is right. In our remarks on the tax tables, we 
pointed out that it will not result in a tax saving of hundreds 
of dollars for anyone who earns $20,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I told the hon. member of the Liberal Party that he was 
making a short-sighted comment on the budget as a whole and that 
the tax deductions provided for in the budget for people who 
earn $25,000, $30,000 or $40,000 are minimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you think that someone earning more than $250,000 and getting 
more than $3,000 back will put that money back into the economy? 
No, they are going to invest it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Low-income earners would not use hundreds of dollars in tax 
savings to make investments; they would put the money back into 
the economy because these people often cannot afford basic 
commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, this budget favours the privileged and it could have been a 
little more sensitive to low-income earners. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a follow-up 
question.  In the same article the accountant points out that his 
calculations do not take into account the hike in Canada pension 
plan taxes which took effect on January 1 and will go up again on 
January 1 of successive years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member comment on the fact that this is not taken into 
account in the budget and the fact that Canadians will actually 
be $2 billion worse off over the next three years because of 
hikes in CPP and bracket creep?  In fact there is no tax relief 
in the next three years.  Taxes are going up. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents a total lack of sensitivity toward those who 
contributed significantly to reducing the deficit.  We thought 
there might be some sensitivity.  This government does a lot of 
studies that produce nothing concrete to help people earning 
less than $30,000 or $40,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is very disappointing.  In addition to going after 
provincial jurisdictions, the government goes after the low 
income earners, those who are entitled to expect something, 
those who have contributed are the ones affected.  The middle 
class contributed enormously to the deficit.  They are being 
crushed under the weight of taxes.  They are losing manoeuvring 
room in order to help the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is attuned to the rich, the three wealthy 
provinces that will benefit from the budget and the class of 
individuals earning above $100,000.  Anyone earning $100,000 and 
paying perhaps $3,000 in taxes is not going to be prevented from 
buying the essentials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, someone earning $30,000 with two or three children can 
often use the few hundred dollars they get from a tax break to 
make ends meet at the end of the month or on weekends to buy 
what they need to feed, house and clothe their children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
be sharing my time with the member for Vancouver Kingsway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak to the budget 
brought down this week.  It is the Liberal government's sixth 
budget since it was first elected to office in 1993.  We have 
not seen two balanced budgets in a row since the 1950s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the 1997 election campaign for a look at the 
Liberal Party's election platform.  We set out to do what we are 
doing today and what we will continue to do in future budgets 
during our term of office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the surpluses, we said that 50% would go towards social 
and economic programs; 25% towards tax relief; and 25% towards 
paying down the national debt.  That is what we have done in the 
last two budgets and that is what we will go on doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is not happy with our budgets?  The opposition parties who, 
unfortunately, will never be satisfied with what the government 
does.  This is perhaps a weakness in our system.  The opposition 
parties always have to be unhappy.  They can never say they are 
satisfied with the government's achievements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to be too critical of the opposition parties, for 
that is the nature of our system, but there are also special 
interest groups that are dissatisfied with the budget.  There is 
the accountants' association, which says we should put more 
money into paying down the debt.  Bay Street says there should 
be more tax relief.  Doctors' associations in Ontario say we 
should have put more money into health care.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes to show that this is really a balanced budget. When we 
are criticized from all sides by special interest groups, I 
think it means that we in the government have done a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another group that is not pleased with the budget is the 
separatist government in Quebec. They have misgivings about the 
changes made to the method used to calculate the Canada social 
transfer. However, what they fail to mention is that, in the 
next three weeks, Quebec will be receiving $1.4 billion in 
equalization payments. 
With social transfer and equalization payments combined, Quebec, 
which accounts for 24% of the Canadian population, will be 
receiving 29% of all federal transfers. Some injustice. Some 
humiliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister pointed out yesterday in Montreal and 
again today in the House, this $1,4 billion payment will enable 
the PQ government to balance its budget. But then again, that 
too will be blamed on the federal government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I have to confess that I am biased.  I believe the 
government is doing a terrific job. So rather than hearing it 
from a biased individual, I will quote from today's editorial in 
the <I>Orillia Packet and Times</I> in my riding, a Hollinger 
owned newspaper, not necessarily given to being friendly to the 
Liberal Party: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That's the most striking element in Tuesday's budget 
announcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paul Martin's second straight balanced budget—something not 
seen by Canadians since the early 1950s—seems to be a hybrid of 
political thought.  It could even be used to demonstrate that, 
despite its flaws, Canada's political system is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has the distinction of being balanced at the centre 
of the political spectrum.  Its influences are obvious: the 
frugality and fiscal responsibility preached by Conservatives and 
Reform are balanced with strong social conscience represented in 
significant increases in health care funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right is represented again in the small tax relief presented 
to Canadians. It acknowledges that Canadians are struggling under 
a heavy tax load, but it does so with a trickle, rather than a 
gusher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe this is a responsible, moderate budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not solve every pressing issue on the spot.  But that is 
the stuff of political fiction.  Problems as complex as those 
faced by the federal government will not be solved overnight. But 
they can be solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is hope sewn into the lining of this budget. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That speaks volumes on how this budget was conceived and how it 
is perceived in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue I will touch on is the question of the reaction of 
the provincial government in Ontario.  The Harris reformatories 
will be saying because of the funds being put back into health 
care in this budget, it is an admission by the federal government 
that the difficulties in the health care system were caused by 
cuts in transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Ontario electorate will not be fooled by that 
rhetoric.  I believe the Ontario electorate will be able to 
understand the figures.  They will know that for the next year 
the cuts in transfers prior to this budget from the federal 
government to the province of Ontario were in the order of $831 
million.  They will also know that the Harris reformatory tax 
cuts amounted to $4.8 billion. If we divide the responsibility 
for any difficulties that may be being experienced in Ontario 
health care, the apportionment can be easily struck at 
one-seventh responsibility for the federal government cuts and 
six-sevenths responsibility for the Harris tax cuts. 
Those are the priorities of the Harris reformatory government and 
that is how it chose to use the resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that the electorate will be deceived.  Nor do I 
believe that the electorate will pay any attention to Premier 
Harris when he makes comments like what I read in the newspaper 
today.  He was referring to the Harris-Martin tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no comparison between the way this government under our 
finance minister dealt with the issue of tax cuts with the 
deficit and the havoc that the Harris government, the reformatory 
government, has imposed on Ontario by allowing the massive tax 
cuts before it was in a position to balance its budget.  There is 
no question that this will be taken into account by the Ontario 
electorate in the upcoming provincial election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, it appears evident to me that this budget will be 
widely accepted by Canadians and so far it has been widely 
accepted by Canadians.  I congratulate the government for once 
again bringing in a balanced budget with a significant surplus 
and properly applying that surplus in a balanced fashion.

want to ask the hon. member who makes many references to the 
Harris reformatories if they have anything in common with the 
Liberal suppositories that we have been hearing about since 
budget day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not believe that

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the speech by our colleague and I think he 
has not grasped certain elements of the political situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, can he admit that, since 1993, funding has been cut by 
$33 billion? Even though the provinces were counting on this 
amount to balance their budgets and provide public services, 
they never received this $33 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked as if happiness was the absence of misfortune. 
I would like to say that we cannot operate on that basis in a 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question I would like him to answer is this: Does he 
recognize that his government has acted indelicately, in a way 
that is inconsistent with the spirit of federalism in which two 
governments should respect each other's jurisdictions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, can he stand in his place and tell me where it says in 
the Constitution Act of 1867 or 1982 that the federal government 
is authorized to intervene in health care?  Would he be prepared 
to put his seat on the line on the constitutional jurisdiction 
of his government to intervene in the area of health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some $80 billion will be spent on health, whereas the federal 
government has no business there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our colleague wants to help out his neighbour, there are 
areas where the federal government can act. 
Liberal members are like one long film we might call <I>The Silence 
of the Lambs</I>: always agreeing with what the government does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of employment insurance, the government could improve 
the situation of the unemployed.  With the banks, it could pass 
legislation on community reinvestment.  But it did not— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> I suggest our backbencher remain calm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member if he could tell us where it says in 
the Constitution that this government is entitled to intervene 
in health care— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> —and I wish the backbenchers were a little more 
critical of their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B> Madam Speaker, first, we pointed out three 
or four years ago that the social transfer formula was not fair 
and that changes were needed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we notified all the provincial governments. As for the 
issue of federal government jurisdiction in health care, it was 
clear in the health agreement signed by the first ministers two 
or three weeks ago.  It was made clear that the government was 
prepared to invest in this area and to transfer the money to the 
provinces with no strings attached and without interfering in 
provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for research, this is a federal-provincial jurisdiction. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on February 16 the finance minister presented the 1999 budget. 
The budget is fiscally responsible and it invests in Canada's 
social priorities.  It provides tax cuts and health care funding. 
The budget is good news for my constituents of Vancouver 
Kingsway and for all Canadians. Today I would like to address 
three aspects of the budget that will increase our standard of 
living and enhance our quality of life: health care, research and 
development, and tax relief for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is the first priority of this budget.  As a member 
of the finance committee I have heard from many Canadians that 
more resources should be devoted to health care.  This is also a 
key issue in my riding.  This year's budget has answered this 
demand.  It has been called the health care budget because it 
greatly increases federal government support for health care. An 
additional $11.5 billion will be transferred to the provinces 
through the Canada health and social transfer over the next five 
years.  In addition to the CHST enhancement, the 1999 budget 
allocates $1.4 billion over the remainder of the fiscal year and 
in the next three fiscal years. Those funds will improve access 
to quality health care information and increased support for 
research and innovation in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second important aspect of this budget is research and 
development funding.  While the government is strengthening the 
health care system, it is also working to expand and integrate 
research in health care.  Our government recognizes that 
innovative ideas are essential to maintaining a successful and 
competitive economy.  Medical research can ensure the highest 
quality of health care for Canadians now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget provides significant increases in funding to the 
Canadian Foundation for Innovation for biotechnology research and 
development, to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research 
Council of Canada, to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research 
Council of Canada and to the National Research Council.  There 
will be increased support for the successful network of centres 
of excellence, technology partnerships Canada and the Canadian 
Space Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third important aspect of the budget is tax relief.  It is 
because our government has acted responsibly in recent years that 
we are in a position to implement tax reduction measures. 
Last year tax measures for low and middle income Canadians were 
introduced.  Now we have begun to offer broad based tax relief to 
all Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every Canadian who pays taxes will get a tax cut this year and 
600,000 Canadians will not have to pay any income tax at all. 
Important initiatives include the phasing out of the 3% surtax on 
personal income, increased benefits to middle income families and 
increased child benefits to two million modest and low income 
families.  The basic personal exemption has also been increased 
to $7,131.  For the first time since 1965 nothing has been 
borrowed to pay for the tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I do not have the time to discuss other elements of the 
budget in detail, I would like to mention several important 
areas.  Highlights include support for learning opportunities and 
employment, broadening the child tax benefit and continued debt 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to report that this budget will have a great impact 
on the province of British Columbia.  That is where I come from. 
It will add $270 million a year during the next five years to 
B.C.'s provincial revenues in addition to tax breaks to 
individual British Columbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cap on B.C.'s share of transfer payments has been lifted. 
For many years B.C. was one of the three provinces getting a 
lower per capita share than other provinces.  Now the finance 
minister has lifted the cap so that over the next three years all 
provinces will receive the same amount on a per capita basis. 
Over five years it means that B.C. will get an additional $1.4 
billion plus $471 million for health care. This is tremendous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax breaks will result in B.C. taxpayers sending $200 million 
less to Ottawa in 1999.  Even B.C.'s finance minister called this 
budget good news. It is great news for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an MP from Vancouver Kingsway and a member of the finance 
committee I am proud of the budget our government has delivered. 
It will ensure that Canada maintains a strong economy and invests 
strategically in key economic and social priorities. Finally, it 
provides tax relief for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Minister of Finance, the Prime Minister and 
all my colleagues for the thoughtful and well planned budget for 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did 
listen to my hon. colleague, but she kept repeating what the 
finance minister had said. The members opposite are parrots. And 
the Liberal members from Quebec even applauded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand my hon. colleague. She is from British Columbia 
and everyone there got something. The people of this very 
wealthy province are now even wealthier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must tell my colleagues from Quebec who were applauding that I 
cannot understand them. They are servile—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel:</B> My question to the hon. member is this: Why is 
it that, three or four days before the Minister of Finance 
brought down his budget, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, whom I had invited to New Richmond, did not show 
up? There were about 800 workers and unemployed people— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> He is afraid of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel:</B> —who, in the spring, will have to do without 
benefits for two whole months. There will be no food for their 
children. The hon. member boasts about the fact that those who 
earn $250,000 or more will see their taxes cut by 3%, thus 
saving $8,000 a year. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps I should reply to 
the member in Chinese because today is Chinese New Year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we all know that Canada has been very good to Quebec. 
You always gain more than B.C.  Even now with this budget we gave 
you much more and we never complain.

other through the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address the member from 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget missed the boat in an essential area.  The 
government does not listen very often to anybody from any other 
political party.  But I would like it to listen to independent 
reviews that are taking place right now on Canada's productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are these reviews saying?  This budget fails because it 
fails to address the central issue of Canada's failing 
productivity.  Why is Canada's productivity failing? Our tax 
structure is too high and companies do not have the ability to 
invest in themselves.  We cannot compete with our brothers and 
sisters to the south because our tax structure is too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member bring to the attention of the finance minister 
the fact that the government's budget failed because it did not 
adjust the egregious tax structure we have in Canada that is 
choking off the private sector— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Vancouver Kingsway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the good point.  Yes, we would like to increase our productivity. 
That is one of our recommendations in the report of the finance 
committee.  We do focus on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research and development is what we will address.  We have given 
$800 million to the centre of innovation.  This year we are 
giving an additional $200 million to the centre.  That will 
create many jobs.   We will have more resources to encourage 
productivity, to have more research and development for Canada. 
In the meantime this will prevent brain drain.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with colleagues, as will most of the Reform 
members from here on today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad to stand up today to talk about this budget.  It is 
sad because it is such a failure.  It is sad because it is a 
missed opportunity.  It is sad because of the fact that what 
could have been done and what should have been done was not done. 
As we have said over and over, as result Canadians will be paying 
more and getting less in all instances.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not talk a lot about getting less because some of my 
colleagues have covered that material very well and I do not want 
to repeat it.  However, I do want to emphasize that we are 
getting less particularly in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 when the government took power, and ever since then, it 
has been proclaiming from the house tops that it is the saviour 
of health care in Canada.  They are empty words.  We need to 
judge people by their actions and not by their words.  Every 
Canadian knows that since the Liberals took power five years ago 
our health care system has deteriorated and deteriorated big 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some instances of individuals not being able to 
get the treatment they need in Canada.  They are forced to take 
their money to the United States in order to get the health care 
they need.  Thankfully those who do are able to pay for it.  The 
government, by failing to continue a health care system which was 
built on good principles and by reducing the amount of funding to 
health care, has literally destroyed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the House a personal story.  It is rather close 
to my heart these days since it is only a little more than a week 
ago that we had my aunt's funeral.  She was an older lady, a very 
gentle but fastidious person.  When she had a stroke she went to 
the hospital.  What happened when she was in a public hospital? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, she was very fastidious but when she had to leave her 
bed for personal reasons she would ring the buzzer.  Because of 
her stroke she was not able to help herself.  No one came so she 
rang again and still no one came.  Finally she tried to get out 
of bed herself and landed on the floor in a heap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That happened not once, not twice, not three times but four 
times.  The family could not always be there.  They all lived a 
distance away from where she was.  Eventually they too practised 
the two tier health care system the government has provided. They 
took her out of the public hospital and moved her into a private 
extended care centre run by a religious group where she got good, 
loving attentive care and people looked after her. Fortunately 
she was able to allocate some of her pension money and the family 
helped as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened to our health care system when people who need 
it push the buzzer and no one comes because the funding for 
staffers has been cut?  This was not to be the topic of my speech 
today.  It was just by way of introduction to show that we are 
getting less.  In this particular case it hit very close to our 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the issues of debt and taxes.  Here again 
is a huge missed opportunity.  It is not just the Reformers who 
are saying this.  Many people are saying it. I am on the finance 
committee and we heard from a number of expert witnesses, 
ordinary people, a number of lobby groups and economists.  They 
came before before committee and testified.  It was a most 
intriguing session when we heard from some of the top economists 
of the country.  Their message was crystal clear: we need to 
reduce taxes.  How do we do that?  By having a plan for reducing 
the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes for recreational reading I read the <I>Fiscal 
Monitor</I>.  Not many people do that. 
I looked at the <I>Fiscal Monitor</I> to see what is happening to 
our debt.  I also looked at the budget the finance minister read 
the other day and I looked at our debt.  It is very distressing. 
This is what has caused the greatest break in our economy.  There 
is nothing that has reduced our productivity more than our 
burgeoning debt and the burgeoning taxes that are required to pay 
the interest on the debt.  Until this year we were paying around 
30 cents of every dollar collected in income tax simply on 
interest on the debt, much of it leaving the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to be in my usual jovial mood, I would now say that I 
want to congratulate the government.  I always do this in my 
speeches.  I always try to find at least one place where I can 
thank government members.  I would like to thank them for 
resisting the temptation to spend, spend, spend everything when 
the surpluses came in.  They are only spending about two-thirds 
of it now, but I would like to thank them for not spending 
everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have looked at the projections of the Minister of Finance and 
his department.   Many members first came here in 1993 and will 
realize that the 1993-94 budget referred to a debt of $508 
billion.  It grew to $545 billion and to $574 billion.  Then in 
one of those first year budgets the projections were $593 
billion, $610 billion and $619 billion.  Those were the 
projections unless the deficit could be beat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully the Liberal government was at the right place at the 
right time.  It lucked in and won the lottery.  If it had not 
been for the fact that there was a vigorous free enterprise 
economy in Ontario and a similar one in Alberta, there would not 
have been any growth to speak of and it would have been in deep 
trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of some forward looking provincial governments that 
were able to attract business to help industry, the economy grew 
and the debt did not grow as much.  What distresses me most is 
that the debt is now projected to be $579.7 billion.  What is it 
for subsequent years?  It is projected at $579.7 billion and 
$579.7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has absolutely no vision or plan to 
reduce the debt.  If we happen to have a surplus and do not need 
our contingency fund, he says that will go toward it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the Minister of Finance and the Liberal 
government are back loading and forward loading the surpluses we 
know exist.  In the same <I>Fiscal Monitor</I> I read that the 
surplus this year for the first three-quarters is $11.2 billion. 
That is the surplus as advertised by the finance department on 
the web.  Members can look it up themselves.  Yet they are 
projecting that the surplus this year will be around $3 billion. 
What are they doing?  They are forward loading and back loading. 
They are not dealing with the present reality.  As a result our 
debt will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember hearing an economist, I think it was at committee, 
say that the most positive economic signal that can be sent to 
our investors and our businesses would be a tangible, manageable 
plan for reducing the debt, which would reduce interest payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public debt charges are projected to go up.  Even though they 
are keeping the debt the same in their planning, every year the 
public debt charges go up.  It is in the document.  All members 
need to do is to look at the budget that was tabled in the House 
two days ago and there it is:  $40.9 billion, $41.4 billion, 
$42.5 billion and $43.3 billion.  That is what we will be paying 
in interest on our debt.  That is what is killing our economy. 
That is the missed opportunity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
do not know where to start.  Maybe I should focus on one aspect, 
and that is the debt. 
The member seems to want to talk about the debt.  He started off 
by dealing with the growth of the debt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will well know that when the government was formed in 
1993 it inherited a deficit scenario of some $42 billion.  That 
deficit had to be dealt with each and every year.  The annual 
deficits are added to the national debt.  Yes, it went up.  Yes, 
interest charges went up, but we had to deal with the deficit to 
stop the leakage.  Now we are getting surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that a particular economic publication indicated 
the surplus would be something like $7 billion.  That may very 
well be.  The member will well know there was a one time transfer 
on behalf of health of $3.5 billion which, based on consultations 
with the auditor general, will be expensed in the current year. 
That takes the projected $7 billion down to $3.5 billion, which 
is precisely what the government is projecting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member uses numbers from a month ago to somehow compare 
to the forecast as was outlined in the budget, does he not think 
that he should also take into account other charges against that 
surplus spending of the fiscal dividend which will be charged 
against the current year so that in fact what has happened is 
exactly what should have happened? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I agree that the numbers 
should accurately reflect the reality.  This is where the rub 
comes in.  What does the budget say?  What is the number that is 
being communicated by the Liberals?  What number are they using 
in terms of what they are putting into health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number is $11.5 billion.  We hear it all the time.  That is 
because the little number of $2 billion which they are actually 
putting in, in the coming year, is so small.  After cutting $20 
billion out of health care, how would the Canadian people accept 
that they would only put $2 billion in?  They got into their 
little corner and asked what they could do with this number. Like 
my leader said the other day, they just came up with a magic 
number to multiply it by.  They multiplied the number by five for 
the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an annual budget.  I do not mind them giving 
projections, but I think it is downright dishonest to say they 
are putting $11.5 billion into health care when in fact this year 
$3.5 billion is being put into the year before and $2 billion 
into the planned year.  Those are the actual numbers.  To say 
$11.5 billion in the face of that is just not accurately 
communicating to Canadians what the facts are. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I appreciated a comment of the hon. member and I wanted to touch 
on a similar theme.  He just alluded to the way the government 
announced the health care spending but did not mention very 
strongly that it was over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that Canadians are aware of the taxes they are 
paying.  With GST and EI and CPP there is some way for the public 
to be very much aware of that.  The one area I was hoping to 
see—and we actually discussed it in the prebudget debate in the 
House—was the fact that income tax brackets were not indexed to 
inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member is a man of high integrity and when he 
speaks it is from his heart.  The issue is that because they were 
not indexed Canadians are actually paying $10 billion more since 
they stopped indexing the personal income tax system or $692 per 
taxpayer.  This is a hidden tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing when people know the taxes they are paying and 
can react, but when they are hidden and buried in bracket creep 
that is particularly offensive to me.  It must be to Canadians 
when they find out about it.  How could they believe anything 
when they find out there is a hidden tax that is not up front, 
that is a big revenue increase for the government which they hear 
nothing about?

a very brief comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>   Very briefly, Madam Speaker, that is the 
point exactly.  Originally it was set up in such a way that 
people paid a certain proportion of their income in taxes. But 
that proportion has gone up because of inflation, yet it does not 
reflect it accurately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this government is giving is mediocre.  Again, it is using 
the figure $675 as an increase in the basic exemption, which 
actually is not used any more but that is what the government is 
calling it, when as a matter of fact $500 of that for most 
taxpayers was announced last year. It is $175 this year.  The 
government makes it look good when in fact it is pretty mediocre. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is great to rise today on behalf of my constituents 
and speak to the budget that was brought down on Tuesday.  For 
most of my constituents they are finding it a very muddled 
document that is not really quite sure what it wants to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is touted as the health care budget and we are waiting to see 
the proof of the pudding. This document claims to restore health 
care funding but in fact it hardly starts the process of putting 
back into place what existed before members opposite came to this 
place in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Canadians were piling extra billions of dollars into 
government coffers, waiting lines for health services went up by 
28%.  Members opposite like to blame the provincial governments. 
If the provincial governments were solely to blame, it still 
would not explain why federal expenditures on health have fallen 
from the promised 50% base line as outlined in the original 
Canada Health Act to the measly 11% that exists today. It does 
not explain why the much talked about five principles are in a 
shambles while this government did nothing but download to its 
provincial counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the portability when we see one government failing to 
fully reimburse another for treating its residents?  Where is the 
universality when the wealthy are put at the front of the queue 
or skip off to the United States to get their service, leaving 
180,000 Canadians waiting weeks and months for operations here in 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of this party find it ironic that Liberals have 
attempted to frighten Canadians with that bogeyman of a two 
tiered American style health system when in fact they have 
encouraged through their action or inaction the creation of this 
very thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem began in the first days of this government.  The 
present Prime Minister was elected in October 1993 and his 
finance minister brought down his first budget in 1994.  Since 
this was greeted with roaring disapproval, the Liberals decided 
on a new tack for 1995.  They would make the appearance of 
cutting the deficit their central theme.   What a good idea, one 
near and dear to everyone's heart, but not the way we would have 
pursued it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government started to see the economic recovery and decided 
to do two things: rake in the maximum amount Canadians could 
stand to give and download the responsibility of paying bills on 
to provincial governments.  That is a reality. The numbers are 
there for anybody to see.  I am gratified to see many 
commentators starting to say the things we have been saying for 
the past few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has never got its wild spending habits under 
control.  It has never admitted to the anchor that its high tax 
regime imposes on all Canadians.  It cannot get it through its 
collective head that Canadians want to be in charge of their own 
destiny.  Leave the money with them and let them decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government lays claim to a balanced budget because it pulls 
$42 billion more in revenues from the economy than it did in 
1993.  We are paying more while provinces, individuals and 
institutions are getting less.  Members opposite will say to look 
at the tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 3% surtax will be cut in half this year and eliminated in 
the year 2000.  Average taxpayers will see a few dollars per week 
from that one. The basic personal credit is up $340 over 1998 and 
will go up another $240 next year.  This translates into another 
couple of dollars per week for hardworking Canadians and that 
sounds really good.  It works out to about a cup of coffee a 
week. The reality of this cut is on average $79 a year.  We know 
the EI rate is going down a whopping 5%, from $2.70 per hundred 
dollars to $2.55. The CPP is certainly going to offset that with 
the increases we are seeing there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone was saying the EI rate should have gone down even more. 
Business is calling for it.  It is a tax on jobs.  But the 
finance minister has been banking that $7 billion a year surplus 
and the Liberals will have us believe that these nickel and dime 
returns should have us all thanking our lucky stars to get 
anything at all.  That is the reality again. This government 
would have us believe that their tuna fish ideas are seen as 
caviar by the peasants out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we add all this up, what do we get? As it turns out Canadians 
will pay $2 billion more in taxes while these little tidbits of 
so-called tax relief are phased in.  We pay more, we get less. We 
pay more CPP premiums with no guarantee that anything will exist 
in 20 years.  We still have bracket creep working its magic on 
our incomes while this government ignores outdated brackets and 
disincentives that have existed in our tax code for decades, 
especially for small business.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we get for this?  Do we get more health care?  Do we get 
more economic activity?  Do we get more national wealth?  No, we 
get more politics, the last thing we really need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago were treated to the spectacle of our government 
leaders trumpeting the creation of a social union deal.  Did this 
amazing document re-establish the primacy of the two levels of 
government in their respective spheres of jurisdiction as set out 
in our Constitution?  No. It put on display the arrogance of the 
Liberal government and the desperation that provincial 
politicians feel when they see billions of dollars up for grabs. 
They need it.  They have programs to run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no thought to leaving that money in the hands of the 
taxpayers, or to giving it back from where it originally came. 
These politicians traded away the right to spend the money and 
take the credit as if there were two kinds of taxpayers and 
government was all about the size of the program and not how good 
it is.  He who has the money makes the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the federal government not concentrate on what it is 
supposed to do?  The budget just released puts $175 million into 
DND.  That does not rebuild a single soldier's house, add a 
single soldier, sailor or pilot to the forces, nor does it buy a 
single piece of equipment.  The Canadian forces as we see them 
now are overcommitted.  They cannot train up to the proper 
standard without the proper equipment.  They cannot replace worn 
out equipment.  They have lost $7 billion from what previous 
governments told them to expect, and this administration has the 
nerve to give them this pitiful increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite will say to look at the wonderful job they do. 
That is the whole point.  Despite broken promises by this 
government and unfulfilled commitments, despite the downloading 
of responsibility, despite the fact this government does nothing 
but take while it asks for the moon, these hardworking Canadians 
get the job done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian taxpayer is in the same leaky boat.  We are so used 
to high taxes, hidden costs and government programs that are 
supposed to alleviate every problem under the sun, that I am 
afraid we are complacent about the antics of this government in 
this budget.  This budget repeats what we have seen in the last 
three.  The minister's projections are wrong.  He finds himself 
with more of Canadians' money than he even thought possible so he 
pumps up government spending.  The debt continues to fester, 
taxes continue to suppress our potential, a key element, and the 
Liberals continue to claim that they are being prudent, generous 
and compassionate.  They are none of these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, Canadians slowly became outraged as they saw 
finance minister after finance minister miss the mark on the 
deficit and charge them for it in increased taxes.  Now they are 
slowly becoming outraged that this finance minister misses the 
mark on spending and charges them for it.  It is not their 
imagination. It is being exposed everywhere.  The numbers are 
there.  They are documented very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think tanks, research institutions and economists are all asking 
where the surplus went.  They are all answering that the finance 
minister is hiding it from the Canadian people so he can pursue a 
political agenda of his own. For how long are Canadians going to 
accept this outrage?  For how long does this minister think he 
can make taxpayers pay more and receive less? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government has failed on health care.  It has taken 
out far more than it intends to put in.  It has failed to perform 
the federal role it is supposed to focus on.  And it is losing 
the trust of Canadians by manipulating the national books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few months we have heard a great deal about 
productivity but I do not see much about that from the Liberal 
spin doctors.  I do not suppose that is because it is another 
missed opportunity by this government. The Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business classed this budget as a missed opportunity. 
We have been losing ground on these issues for years.  This 
finance minister trots out the typical line that things are 
looking up and that adding a few dollars will address the 
situation.  Everything looks better after you have hit rock 
bottom which is where we seem to be headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has 
warned this government that Canada is failing, not rising upward 
on the issue of productivity.  These studies indicate that our 
tax burden is just too great.  The window dressing in this budget 
does nothing to solve that.  Again nothing for business, the 
engine of the economy, the job creator.  It says that the United 
States is surging ahead in this area with half the unemployment 
rate, but here we have the finance minister bragging about job 
creation.  Eighty per cent of those jobs are created by the small 
business sector, not by government programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our unemployment rate is twice that of the U.S.  Is that good 
enough?  Our standard of living is falling; disposable income 
continues to fall.  Why is this acceptable?  Why is being 17th in 
the world good enough?  It is not.  There is so much more that 
has to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the minister do about the small business deduction? 
Nothing.  It is still mired in 1980 values. What has he done 
about corporate taxes, payroll taxes, user fees?  Nothing in this 
budget. Where is the burden of personal income tax?  Among the 
highest in the world, and this budget does a little tinkering 
with it.  We pay more and get less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a government in this country that is committed to 
openness, accountability, freedom and wealth creation for 
everybody.  Instead we are stuck with a government that is 
obsessed with manipulation, social engineering and bureaucracy. I 
do not see anything productive about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I know 
the opposition is on a great theme here. I presume they cannot 
get too many ideas in their heads at one time as they keep 
repeating the same phraseology which is basically pay more, get 
less. There are two aspects of this, paying and getting.  In 
other words they believe that one simply pays for services and 
that is what one gets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they came to the House years ago they were concerned about 
the debt.  What they have said during the last two days is that 
we should forget about the debt, forget about the obligation to 
pay the debt.  They are happy to leave it for another generation 
of Canadians so let us just forget about it. We want to get every 
dollar into this that we put into it. It is services for every 
dollar that we put into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People watching this debate know if they have a mortgage on 
their house that some of that money and hopefully a lot of it 
every month is going to make principal payments on their debt. 
These payments meet their obligations.  Therefore their children 
will not have to live in that house and pay the mortgage which 
the parents have enjoyed. Those members are showing total 
irresponsibility by ignoring that aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talked about small business.  Does he realize 
that Canada taxes small businesses at the lowest rate of the G-7 
countries?  I guess he is not very happy to know this as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other members mentioned the CPP and called it a tax 
even though we all know it is a pension.  The federal government 
does not have its hands in it one way or the other.  It is money 
contributed by employers and employees for their pensions.  Once 
again those members would be happy to run away from, shirk their 
responsibilities, transfer that liability on to another 
generation and walk off with the gravy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do those members think they could get beyond the two little 
things in their minds, that is pay more, get less?  Could they 
deal with some of the substantive problems in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Madam Speaker, there was a lot verbiage 
but I am not sure there was too much meat. I remember an ad years 
ago with a little lady standing at a hamburger counter saying 
“Where is the beef?”  I guess that points to what the member 
was talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest problem we have in the country is underperformance. 
People are penalized to get out and make things happen.  We have 
a tremendous problem with brain drain.  There is a little bit of 
money in the budget to address that issue, but it is a 
significant problem.  Taxes are driving people out of this 
country.  We cannot bribe them to stay here.  They will gradually 
migrate to where there is more tax incentives and work 
incentives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a burgeoning underground economy. It is created by 
overtaxation.  People have to make a living, put bread and butter 
on the table for their families and they do it in any way they 
can.  If it means cheating Uncle Sam a little bit they are more 
than willing and prepared to do that. Many people said it was the 
GST that created the underground economy.  It is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My background is in construction and the whole premise of the 
underground economy is not the GST.  It is 7%. As a contractor I 
can pass that on and claim it back.  That is not the problem.  It 
is the income tax that I pay.  It is the income tax that the 
plumbers, electricians, concrete finishers, carpet layers pay. 
It is the heavy tax load on everything.  The not profit sensitive 
tax, a lot of them have become user fees and programs and things 
like that, drive the burgeoning underground economy.  That is not 
being addressed.  There must be fairness in the taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talked about the debt and the deficit.  We are 
paying $41 billion or $42 billion a year in interest on what has 
been a runaway debt. The prudent approach has added another $130 
billion to that debt in the last number of years.  Thank God we 
finally got our deficit under control, but it has been done by 
taxpayers; 70% of the deficit control was done on the backs of 
taxpayers.  They are looking for some sort of relief from this 
overburden.  They are looking to the government for some 
direction and leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is a small step in the right direction.  We need to 
take large strides.  We are going into a worldwide economy. 
Canada can be a leader.  We do not have to settle for 17th place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, just to 
conclude, paying Uncle Sam?  I do not think the member knows what 
country he is in, let alone much about our tax policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to engage in the debate and talk about what I 
think is maybe an unsung part of the budget which has to do with 
productivity. 
Some of the members across the way have touched on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually when we start talking about productivity a lot of people 
go to sleep, not least of which is the opposition.  But 
productivity basically means how efficiently we use inputs of 
production. I am trying not to sound like an economist but what I 
mean by that is labour and labour components either to make 
manufactured goods or to provide services.  We use labour, 
technology, capital, equipment and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The object of the exercise is to utilize those things more 
effectively and more efficiently.  That is to say how can we use 
less of a component of these goods to produce more and more 
services?  That is often what we call productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the labour movement often hear business people talking 
about productivity and they feel a bit threatened about losing 
their jobs.  But that is not what I am talking about at all.  How 
can labour, as one of those component factors, utilize its time 
more effectively and more efficiently? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this important?  It is important because Canada is 
definitely falling behind many of our major competitors, not the 
least of which is the United States.  I believe the Conference 
Board of Canada's recent report claimed that Canada's 
productivity lags behind our American counterparts by as much as 
20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important because it impacts our standard of living. The 
televisions we have, the furniture we use, the cars we drive are 
all factors of productivity statistics.  A lot of people believe 
that Canada is hiding its poor productivity rating behind its 
lower valued dollar vis-a-vis the United States.  In other words, 
if our dollar suddenly increased in value we would have some 
significant job losses and losses to our effective 
competitiveness in the world markets because this productivity 
number would suddenly become very important and very glaring to a 
lot of people as to how we have not been keeping up with some of 
our competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget addresses that issue.  It addresses that issue in 
some very fundamental ways. It does that by increasing our 
funding by about $1.8 billion.  These are some of the areas in 
which that money has gone, $200 million to the Canadian 
opportunities strategy and $55 million a year for biotechnology 
research and development. I do not have to tell a lot of people 
out there how important biological research is.  Canada has 
developed many products and we have done that, and I would not 
use the word assistance, but by governments and businesses 
working together to find common solutions to find new 
technologies where Canada can be very competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have increased funding of $75 million for what we call the 
granting councils, the National Research Council and the Medical 
Research Council.  We talk about medicare and funding. Members 
have been talking about giving the money back to the provinces, 
but this is another fundamental way in which the government is 
assisting with finding new technologies to solve some of our 
medical problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been a major leader in the world in discovering new 
technologies to find new drugs and other medical cures. I do not 
have to tell members we are well asserted as an incubation tank 
for that because our population is getting older, possibly more 
rapidly than in any of the G-7 countries.   We are very concerned 
about finding cures for some of our medical problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put $60 million into a three year program to develop 
smart demonstration projects.  This allows communities to find 
ways to use the information highway to more effectively utilize 
the resources they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my community I think of all the hospitals being wired 
together which would enable a resident in one hospital being able 
to wire information back and forth to another hospital some miles 
away so that a patient in one location could have access to the 
expert care they need.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of technologies that will make Canada a 
better place to live and help keep our brain power.  Some people 
say that Canada is a country full of great resources but our 
greatest resource is still the resource we have between our ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to be a part of a government that has provided 
some additional funding for these areas.  It provided $60 million 
for GeoConnections.  This is a mapping system to allow our 
communities to plug into each other and to understand their 
regions.  I do not have to tell the House that Canada is the 
second largest country in the world.  The knowledge of who we are 
and where we are is very important for us to be successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak a bit about some of the additional funding that has 
gone into the technologies partnership program.  There is an 
additional $150 million that has gone into the technologies 
partnership program.  Some of that money went into a company 
close to my riding called Cametoid.  This is a company that makes 
paint for the Challenger rockets that the United States is 
sending up.  This is a unique technology that was made possible 
by this government's providing the additional funding.  These are 
not grants.  They are not give away programs.  It leverages some 
of the risk capital that the company needs to take on some of 
these projects.  Some banks ask what they are going to give them 
for collateral.  Here we are selling products to the United 
States.  The company has about 20 direct jobs and 17 indirect 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was on the floor of the De Havilland plant when the minister 
was there to give the technology partnerships grant. That is 
money that is coming back to us.  It is paid back to us through a 
royalty payment system.  I talked to those workers and they said 
that manoeuvre saved 2,000 jobs in the city of Toronto.  That is 
a very positive way that we are increasing the knowledge base 
that exists in our country.  We are keeping Canadians employed 
and we are keeping them at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this a problem?  As I mentioned, the OECD has stated that 
even with solid improvements in Canada, it is likely that our 
country will slip below the average in the standard of living of 
the OECD countries by 2015. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1973 to 1995 the average annual rate of real domestic gross 
product increased in Canada.  It went up 2.6%.  Productivity went 
up 1%.  Canada's score sheet in some of these areas has not been 
as good as some of our neighbours. Labour productivity and growth 
averaged about 1% per year during the 1990s.  The average of the 
OECD countries is 4%.  Why is that?  Frankly, I do not know. Some 
of my colleagues will say it is because of our tax laws. That is 
not quite the case.  The business sector is somewhat responsible 
for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States the business community supports its 
university systems in the area of research and development.  That 
is not the case in Canada.  I am not saying we do not do any of 
that but our businesses only marginally support our university 
environments.  As a consequence, Canada's funding is heavily 
reliant on government grants to granting councils.  Another 
positive way which governments could make a contribution is to 
the networks of centres of excellence across the country which 
allow our scientists to communicate with one another, not in the 
lifestyles today but the lifestyles five or ten years down the 
road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes a long time for that kind of technology to seep through 
and be effective.  We have to find better ways for Canadians to 
use the technology that is available.  I am very proud to be a 
part of a government that has made a significant down payment on 
that reality. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from the Liberal Party for his 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask him some questions.  I do not think that some of 
the members across the way get it.  If the member is listening to 
the assertions put forth by independent think tanks not only 
within Canada but from around the world, they send one clear 
message. 
Canada is not competitive because our tax structure is choking 
the life blood out of our private sector.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, a family of two earners in the United States 
earns 42% more than the equivalent family in Canada.  That can be 
extrapolated to private sector companies.  How can companies 
compete in Canada with their counterparts in the United States if 
they are saddled with a tax structure that is at least a third 
higher than what they have to compete with south of the border? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The central failure our party is trying to impress on the 
government in this budget is that the government's budget has 
failed to address the issue of productivity because it has failed 
to address the issue of high taxes.  The member from Vancouver 
mentioned we want to be productive and therefore the government 
is investing in research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the issue.  If the private sector is given the money 
to invest in its companies it will invest in research and 
development.  The fact is it cannot because the tax structure is 
too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I ask the member from the Liberal government will he go to 
the finance minister and ask him to lower taxes substantially and 
do it as soon as possible.  Then our private sector would have a 
fighting chance to compete in the global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am sure the member 
was here during the budget speech but he seems to have missed the 
fact that there have been substantial tax reductions in the 
budget in some of the low income areas.  Also we have removed the 
3% surtax.  Why he does not understand this is beyond me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address the great model they always want to use, the 
United States.  That seems to be the only comparison.  It seems 
to be the whole world actually when they get into comparative 
economics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that in the numbers quoted some of those people 
in the United states pay the highest per capita rate for health 
care. Often it is not funded through their governmental system. 
They have higher crime rates and so forth too.  We do not quote 
those things.  We quote the taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the judicious hands on the lever of this government 
interest rates are lower.  Interest rates are lower in Canada 
than in the United States.  I do not know where the member has 
been if he does not think a major factor of productivity in any 
business is interest.  The reality is that Canada is still and 
continues to be an attractive place in which to do business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What about personal tax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  We are on the track of lowering 
personal income taxes and we have had a major down payment on 
that in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A combination of lower taxes and greater investment in research 
and technology is part of this program and I think that will do 
the job.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
was surprised to hear the member for Durham say that the budget 
contained all sorts of tax breaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who gets the biggest tax breaks?  I will tell you, Madam 
Speaker.  Those earning $250,000 and over.  Their tax bill will 
be reduced by $3,800.  As for those earning $30,000 to $70,000, 
the middle-income earners who have footed most of the bill for 
cleaning up the nation's finances, their tax break is between 
$50 and $300 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an insult.  I would suggest that the member for Durham 
really read the budget documents and quit being a doormat like 
his colleagues. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have taken a close 
look at the budget.  I know we have increased personal exemptions 
for all taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All taxpayers have shared in this tax reduction package and the 
3% starts at $65,000.  The hon. member talks about $200,000.  I 
suggest he check the tax rates.  If he does not have any 
constituents in all of Quebec who do not make over $65,000 I 
would be shocked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been across the board tax cuts and I am sorry he does 
not understand that.

Speaker, I paid careful attention to the budget debate on the 
monitor in my office and when I was in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mean to make light of interventions that colleagues 
make.  I know they are studied and I know they are very sincere 
but I often think of dark clouds looking for that silver lining 
so that they can avoid it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in essence is the substance of the debates that I have 
heard from the opposition side so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am especially struck by the desire to manipulate two contrary 
views, especially by one party opposite.  On the one hand, the 
critic for health turns around and says that there are two words 
to describe what the contributions are and they are “not 
enough”. Then his colleague over to his right—and I mean that 
figuratively as well as geographically—turns around and says 
that we did not cut enough taxes and we did not take out more 
from that spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what it is that they want to do, but I want to 
remind colleagues that the Canadian public has been telling all 
members of parliament on that side as well as on this side that 
its priorities for government spending, government activity and 
government involvement in the life of all Canadians has had to be 
involvement in a health care system, a health care system that is 
at least from the federal government's perspective, constrained 
by what it can do jurisdictionally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have asked all of us parliamentarians to look for 
solutions to ensure that the priorities of all Canadians, and 
again health is the number one priority of every man, woman and 
child in this country, be given the same status when we fulfil 
the most basic, the most important and the most significant 
functions of all parliamentarians in this House and that is to 
set a budget that establishes those priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have?  People are whining that we are spending too 
much and doing too much to meet the demands and needs of 
Canadians everywhere.  People have been saying that we have 
problems with our health system, notwithstanding the fact that in 
agreements with the provinces in the past we provided 
sustainable, predictable continuous funding.  We gave the 
provinces the authority to go ahead and do what they would in 
establishing health priorities through their administrations.  We 
moved back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding that, the Canadian government recognized that it 
had to do something more directly for Canadians. In collaboration 
with the provinces, it struck a deal a couple of weeks ago, a 
social union.  It is a reflection of the ability to work together 
with other jurisdictions.  To do what?  To meet the priorities of 
Canadians.  In what area?  In health.  What were they looking 
for?  Some said $2 billion would be more than enough to meet all 
the immediate needs.  But no, the Government of Canada and the 
finance minister said we would give $3.5 billion today to meet 
the urgent and critical needs in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the opposition say?  “Not enough. It didn't go to my 
province.  My province didn't get what it wanted”.  Guess what? 
Wake up.  The Canadian public got what it wanted, in fact it got 
more.  Not only did it take the $3.5 billion— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like you to inform the member that raising his 
voice does not make his story any more believable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  That is not a point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  The hon. member is absolutely correct. 
He has just proven that in politics one has to raise one's voice 
enough to wake the dead.  Stones must hear the good message.  I 
am glad that the stones opposite have also heard that the number 
is $3.5 billion today.  It is an additional $8 billion over the 
next five years.  That is much more than anybody had anticipated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet what have we heard?  The opposition said we took out $20 
billion.  That number was only $16 billion two weeks ago, and two 
weeks before that, it was only $6 billion. 
The amount of money that has been withdrawn has been growing 
exponentially as the opposition has seen the government meet the 
priorities of Canadians head on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government, through its finance minister, through 
its health minister, through the other cabinet colleagues, in 
co-operation with the provincial premiers of this vast nation has 
struck an agreement that would also ensure that those moneys 
would go directly to the citizenry.  None of this bureaucratic in 
between let us manipulate this ministry hideaway.  None of that 
sort of business.  The business of the health of Canadians was 
going to be met by every single province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that, they agreed that the federal government ought to 
spend and in fact is spending an additional $1.4 billion.  I 
cannot count that high but I can spell the number.  It is a lot 
more than a million, $1.4 billion directly in health outcomes. 
What are they?  This is what the opposition is lamenting.  That 
is why I say it seems like this dark cloud is avoiding the silver 
lining.  For health, research and development in the basic 
sciences, $550 million.  Whether they choose to appreciate that 
or not, there is not a person in the basic science research and 
development community who does not think that this exceeds their 
wildest dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We are losing them because of high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  It exceeds their wildest dreams.  Wake 
up. Look at the numbers.  Call the universities.  Call the 
doctors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite should ask their own physicians face to face if 
they are doing something with $550 million additional moneys for 
health and they will tell them yes.  Ask them if this is money 
well spent and they will tell them yes. And if they then ask them 
shall we cut more taxes, they will say no. Why?  Because the 
money that we spend this way collectively brings us greater 
results.  Greater results where?  In meeting the priorities of 
all Canadians, all men, women and children of all ages from all 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to meet the priorities of Canadians everywhere, 
not only do we do this, but we take a look at the information 
system.  That is at the base of making evidence based decisions 
which will lead to better administrative systems in health, which 
will lead to better outcomes, which will lead to more research, 
which will lead to services that will produce the healthy society 
Canadians demand, need and want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to spend $328 million in that area, and the 
opposition asks “Why?  It might infringe on somebody else's 
jurisdiction”.  Wake up.  The people in the other jurisdiction 
found out two weeks ago and said they wanted us to do this, they 
needed us to do this and in fact they demanded that we do it. Did 
we meet their demands?  Of course we met their demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations everywhere have been at a disadvantage.  All 
members on this side of the House recognize that.  Some members 
on the other side are willing to admit that maybe a problem 
exists.  But our cabinet reacted to reality and said yes there 
are problems, let us address them.  How can we do it?  We have 
already put a mechanism in place.  Can we put the money there? 
Shall we find it?  How much do we find?  How much did the Prime 
Minister and cabinet find?  What did the health minister look 
for?  He looked for and saw $190 million over three years to 
ensure that we meet the health needs of all aboriginal 
communities.  The opposition said no, we should not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand those people any more, I really do not. They 
say that there are other issues.  There are other issues and the 
government has been looking, it has been researching and it has 
been listening.  That is a good word. Some hon. members might 
look up.  It has been listening to the Canadian public. It says 
we need to spend an additional $287 million for prenatal 
nutrition programs, for food safety, for environmental safety, 
for rural health and for diabetes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all colleagues in this place, is that money well spent or 
not?

establish fiscal responsibility and give them in return complete 
control over a budget that involved health and give them the 
opportunity to administer those funds as they see fit?  Should I 
take pride in the fact that my government is capable of meeting 
the priorities of Canadians by working with provincial 
governments of all political stripes?  The member might be

<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, in January the Cape Breton Development Corporation 
was abandoned by the federal government after three decades of 
lives lost, lives invested and communities dedicated to doing 
what Cape Bretoners have done for centuries, mine the rich coal 
beds that reach beneath our island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In war and peace coal fed our nation and it was recognized when 
Devco was created by a Liberal government that the nation owed 
something to these people who had given their lives.  It was 
recognized that they deserved dignity and a graceful transition 
from an industry that was gradually and inevitably declining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a Liberal government could dedicate 30 years to closing an 
industry and still, at the end of those three decades, find 
itself in the same position as when it started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 we still see dependent communities, massive liabilities 
and a new generation that was promised it had a future 
underground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in those 30 years?  What happened to the billions 
of dollars the Liberals talk about when they say why Devco must 
be sold?  It went to their friends.  Instead of trading miners 
for new jobs, instead of helping the economy adjust to new 
challenges, the government helped its friends get rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some examples. Devco, a mining company, imported sheep.  Cape 
Bretoners joked that maybe Devco would now start to make steel 
wool with the help of scrap from the Sydney steel plant.  This is 
economic development Liberal style, $250,000 into Liberal 
pockets. 
A cabinet minister built a pile of rocks three feet high around 
the University College of Cape Breton; $400,000 into Liberal 
pockets.  Economic development Liberal style.

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last year, weeks before Devco's sale was announced and when 
it was clear that the end was near, Devco's management bought $11 
million worth of new equipment, new equipment needed for long 
term development that management knew would never happen. That 
money came from the $41 million given the corporation so it could 
meet payroll until the end of March of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does a corporation that cannot pay its workers buy new and 
unnecessary equipment?  Only a corporation being run into the 
ground by those paid to preserve it. Hundreds of miners were laid 
off in 1998 while dozens of managers were hired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reality that Cape Bretoners have lived with for 
decades, the impression of incompetence that reflects on all of 
us but which is in fact a reflection of the incompetence of 
management, of this Liberal government, because Cape Breton coal, 
despite all the claims, has made money.  For every dollar 
invested it put five back.  If we look at Devco's mining 
operations and remove the workers compensation and environmental 
liabilities, we see a profitable business, a business that will 
now be passed to a private firm to extract private profit. 
Managed mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a company sells off the part of its business that makes 
money and keeps the part that loses money that is economic 
development Liberal style. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there is money to be made in Cape Breton.  On December 
17 a prominent Liberal registered an environmental cleaning 
company and has hired a lobbyist, a gentleman well known to the 
government and to the people of Cape Breton.  Of course it would 
be unfair for me to begrudge the former minister of health some 
work.  God knows we need jobs in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these examples I am sure members can appreciate the 
frustration Cape Bretoners feel about the way Devco has been run 
and now the way it is being closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not thrilled after more than a year of extending 
invitations that the Minister of Natural Resources decided to 
make two trips to Cape Breton in January, two trips a few hours 
each.  That is all he felt Cape Breton was worth. That is what he 
thinks about nearly 2,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, in the weeks since the announcement, we see the latest 
chapter in the Liberals' attempt to blame anyone but themselves 
for this economic nightmare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government telling Cape Bretoners that it does not make 
decisions based on economics? 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat 
Board, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, in response to this question I 
would like to input the following additional information the 
member may not necessarily be aware of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last October the chairman of the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation came to Ottawa to inform the Minister of Natural 
Resources that Devco would indeed require $41 million in 
additional funding to operate just until March 31, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at that time it was also apparent that this new 
injection of funds into the corporation would not necessarily 
resolve all its difficulties.  It was clear that the government's 
goal of commercial viability, set for Devco in 1996, was out of 
reach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This meant that the federal government had to review its long 
term position on Devco and set a new direction.  As part of that 
review the Minister of Natural Resources asked Devco to look at 
different options for its mining operations and discussions were 
undertaken with the stakeholders to obtain their views on a new 
direction for the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many community leaders, Nova Scotia Power Inc., Devco's senior 
management and board, the Premier of Nova Scotia and Devco's 
unions provided input into the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 11, 1999 the minister accompanied by Senator Al 
Graham and Senator Sister Peggy Butts visited Cape Breton and had 
a day long meeting with the community and unions.  These meetings 
were very important to discuss a process for determining a new 
direction for Devco and I understand that the hon. members from 
Bras D'Or and Sydney—Victoria also participated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again on January 28, 1999 the minister went to Cape Breton and 
personally addressed the miners and the community to announce the 
government's final decision.  The Minister of Natural Resources 
believed it was important that he make the announcement directly 
to those affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has approved $111 million in funding for the 
human resources strategy which includes $60 million in pensions, 
$46 million in severances, $5 million—

time has expired.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, last week I 
rose in the House on several occasions. 
I provided the Minister of National Revenue with information with 
respect to a consortium of environmentalists in British Columbia. 
I provided him with a document and I asked him why these 
organizations were continuing to receive charitable status, in 
other words a tax holiday, particularly in light of the document 
that had come into our hands.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the document outlines about a dozen environmental 
groups, many of them Canadian, that are involved in a strategy 
which amounts to nothing more than an attack on mining in British 
Columbia, and more specifically mining in my riding of Skeena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is aware of the participants.  Some of them are the 
Sierra Club, the Sierra Legal Defence Fund and the Suzuki 
Foundation.  There is a list of them.  At least some of these 
organizations are getting charitable tax status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, and this is outlined in the document of which 
I have a copy here, they are accepting huge contributions from 
wealthy American corporate trusts and family trusts, hundreds of 
thousands of dollars from American corporate and families trusts 
in a paid campaign to attack a mine proposal in northwest British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Redfern Resources has a proposal called the Tulsequah Chief 
Mine.  It was actually an operating mine many years ago.  It has 
been dormant and the company wants to reopen it.  It went through 
a 3.5 year rigorous environmental review in which the federal and 
provincial governments and all their various appropriate line 
ministries participated.  The state of Alaska participated in it. 
Last year, at the end of that process, the Premier of British 
Columbia publicly stated that the mine was to get approval to go 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environmentalists have shifted gears.  They do not want the 
project approved.  They do not care about the facts.  They do not 
care about the fact that there was an environmental review done. 
They do not care about the science.  They do not care about 
truth.  They do not care about balance.  Above all, they do not 
care about people, particularly the people in my riding who are 
counting on that mine as an economic development opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have joined forces with Alaska Governor Tony Knowles in 
pressing for this project to be reviewed at the International 
Joint Commission.  Furthermore, the same Alaska Governor Tony 
Knowles is an environmentalist and wants the project halted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is the same governor whose rapacious actions on Pacific 
salmon have devastated many coastal communities in my riding and 
have hurt recreational and commercial fishermen.  Commercial 
fisherman on the north coast are devastated as are commercial 
sport fishing operations.  Virtually all commercial sport fishing 
operations were shut down last year.  Aboriginal fishermen, 
aboriginal people who are fishing for food, ceremonial and 
commercial purposes, have been dramatically prejudiced by the 
actions of the same governor whom the environmentalists want to 
join in lockstep to shut down this mining opportunity in 
northwest British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear these organizations may be getting charitable tax 
status.  I have given the minister the names of all the 
organizations and asked him to provide me with that information, 
but I am aware that some of them are getting charitable tax 
status.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to respond on behalf of the Minister 
of National Revenue this evening to this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Skeena is requesting that the charitable status 
of the Sierra Legal Defence Fund Society, the David Suzuki 
Foundation and the B.C. Spaces for Nature Society be revoked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has stated that a leaked document reveals that a 
number of Canadian environmental organizations including these 
three registered charities are accepting contributions from 
American corporate and family trusts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also stated the documents show that these charities are 
counting on these funds to finance a smear campaign and 
manipulate share prices of a Canadian company, Redfern Resources 
Ltd., to scare off investors and kill a mining project, as he has 
alluded to, in northern British Columbia, resulting in lost jobs 
and investments in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are indeed very serious allegations that could result in 
severe consequences for these charities, even though it has not 
yet been conclusively established that these charities have done 
anything wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has provided, as he said, the documents to Revenue 
Canada.  I can confirm that the Sierra Legal Defence Fund 
Society, the David Suzuki Foundation and the B.C. Spaces for 
Nature Society are indeed registered charities under the Income 
Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, under the confidentiality provisions of the same Income 
Tax Act, I cannot discuss the affairs of these charities or 
indeed any actions the department may take in dealing with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charitable sector should be an asset for all Canadians, and 
parliament has recognized this by providing through our tax 
system important financial support.  To be registered as 
charities they must have charitable purposes and we will ensure 
that these are carried out properly in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.05 p.m.)
