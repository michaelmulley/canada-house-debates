	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should abolish the Senate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to open 
House proceedings this morning on the motion in which I call on 
the government to abolish the Senate.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to thank all members of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for allowing this 
motion to be put to a vote, because I think it is important for the 
House to have an opportunity to deal with this significant matter.
<P>
	Why do I want the Senate to be abolished? The reason I moved 
this motion is that I realized that, throughout Quebec in particular, 
the Senate symbolizes in a way the ineffectiveness and inefficiency 
of Parliament. A case in point, which is a caricature because it does 
not concern all the senators, is when we saw some of them doze off 
on television during the throne speech.
<P>
	That incident made me think about the following question: Why 
do we still need today a second House like the Senate, an unelected 
House? The senators were never elected by the people to carry out 
this function; they were appointed on the Prime Minister's 
recommendation. Senators are often appointed as a political 
reward, because they helped run a political party so it could win an 
election, or because they will work on an election campaign in the 
future.
<P>
	I can give you two examples: Céline Hervieux-Payette was 
defeated as a Liberal candidate before being appointed to the 
Senate; she is now co-chair of the Liberal Party of Canada's 
organization for the next election campaign. There is also Mr. 
Nolin, who plays more or less the same role for the Conservative 
Party of Canada.
<P>
	Although they were not elected, these people sit in a House with 
the same responsibilities as the House of Commons. Let us not 
forget that after a bill passes third reading here in this House, it is 
sent to the Senate, which goes through the same stages. This is a 
form of duplication. We saw in the Pearson airport case-and the 
Liberals were the first ones to be affected as a government; I think 
this will make them think about how relevant this motion is-how 
the bill was stalled in the Senate for several months. The reality we 
are facing is that elected parliamentarians who have passed a bill 
are now paralysed in their work by an unelected House. This, I 
think, is unacceptable in this day and age, on the eve of the 21st 
century.
<P>
	The Senate's existence was understandable when the Canadian 
Confederation was created, because we wanted an equivalent to the 
British House of Lords. It was said at the time that the people 
sitting in the Commons might not have had all the intellectual 
capacities necessary. That kind of thinking was prevalent at the 
time, and all the problems had to be given due consideration. It was 
therefore decided to institute a kind of patriarchal entity, a House 
capable of seeing to it that things are done properly. But times have 
changed.
<P>
	Today, members of Parliament have all the capabilities required 
to do their jobs; they have different opinions they are entitled to 
voice. They have researchers working for them and people 
lobbying them. Really, the Senate is no longer useful.
<P>
	The other theoretical function of the Senate was that of 
representing the various regions of Canada. I have a teaser for you 
and all members of this place for that matter. Who can identify the 
senator responsible for his or her riding? Who can give me the 
designation of the Senate division or district represented by their 
senator?
<P>
	I have asked the people of my riding time and time again and no 
one could tell me the name of the senator representing us or the 
designation of the division. We are part of the Grandville division 
and we are represented by Senator John Lynch-Staunton; he is 
certainly a very fine man. This goes to show that the Senate has not 
fulfilled this regional representation mandate because nowhere in 
Canada is a region associated with a senator in particular. And the 
reason for this is surely the fact that senators are not elected. There 
is also the appointment process. Often, senators to be were selected 
or appointed even before knowing what division they  would be 
representing. There was also a requirement for holding property. 
We have seen cases where, on the eve of their appointment, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3286"> 3286 </A></B>
<P>
individuals rushed out to by a property to meet this statutory 
requirement. But the Senate no longer meets the objective inthis regard.
<P>
	Another aspect seems very important to me today. Our 
constituents are asking us to cut the fat in government spending. 
They are asking us to look for areas where there are unnecessary 
expenditures being made. The government took a stringent 
measure in reforming the unemployment insurance program. Just 
to save a couple hundred or thousand dollars here and there, 
legislation was passed that gets down to the nitty-gritty, checking 
up on recipients to ensure they do everything by the book, all under 
this very complex act basically designed to hunt down abusers. But 
at the very same time, we have here a House, the Senate, with an 
annual budget of $43 million; that is a consideraable amount for an 
unelected Chamber.
<P>
	And that is not counting expenses attributable to the senators' 
activities and associated costs. This amount covers wages, staff 
compensation and travelling expenses in general. Should we not 
eliminate the Senate, instead of targeting unemployment insurance 
beneficiaries? This would generate savings of $43 million. This is 
an expenditure that recurs year after year. The amount of $43 
million is the actual budget. However, when senators delay the 
passing of a bill for six months or a year, this also generates major 
costs and it has a very harmful effect on the actions taken by the 
government and by Parliament.
<P>
	We should modernize things somewhat. Eliminating the Senate 
would be one way of doing it. In this respect, the federal 
government is lagging behind. For example, it was almost 30 years 
ago that Quebec's National Assembly, then called the Legislative 
Assembly, eliminated its legislative council, which was more or 
less the provincial equivalent of the Senate.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	I can assure you that things are not going any worse. People do 
not call to say that they miss legislative councillors. I do not think 
there would be any more problems if we did the same with 
senators.
<P>
	Why is that institution such an anachronism? It may be that, at 
the turn of the century, there were more complex issues requiring 
an expertise that elected representatives did not always have. 
Today, a support system has been developed for MPs and it 
includes all the functions necessary to that end.
<P>
	A debate in the Senate does not shed new light on a bill. The 
legislation goes through all the stages in the House: introduction, 
followed by first, second and third readings, as well as 
consideration in committee. Let us not forget that consideration in 
committee did not exist 10 or 15 years ago. Since then, this stage 
has become a  very important part of the process. Committee 
members consider bills clause by clause; they have expertise.
<P>
	The Library of Parliament provides non partisan support and 
research services. It is very easy to get information on issues of 
interest. Nowadays, members of Parliament are very well equipped 
to give thorough consideration to legislation.
<P>
	There is no longer a need to rely on outsiders whose mandate is 
unclear. We do not really know whether senators represent the 
interests of lobbyists or those of the public. That is not always 
clear. There are some rather ambiguous connections, and, since 
they are not elected, senators have a great deal of room to 
manoeuver. They do not have to take any account at all of what 
they have been told by their fellow citizens in the positions they 
adopt.
<P>
	As members of this House, we are only too aware of this. When 
there is a controversial bill, a situation that is more difficult to 
analyse, we are approached by lobbyists, but also by our 
constituents. Imagine how differently you would do things if all 
you had to take into account in reaching a decision were lobbies. In 
the end, what we have is a sort of outmoded 19th century 
democracy, one that does not correspond to our needs today in the 
information era. What we need above all is people well attuned to 
their communities, something the senators certainly are not.
<P>
	Earlier, I mentioned the $43 million budget. This is a lot of 
money. Freeing up this amount would still not solve the problem of 
the Canadian deficit, but it would be an important symbolic 
gesture. When we ask the public to do their part and accept cuts, we 
are asked all the time: ``Are you guys in Parliament doing your 
part? Are you doing what is necessary so that the best possible 
decisions are taken at the least cost?''
<P>
	The Senate is a flagrant example of the sort of area where we 
could make an important symbolic gesture in the vote following 
this debate. This would not exclude a debate at a later date on the 
advisability of having a second House in Canada. What form would 
this House take? Should it be a House whose seats are distributed 
by region, or should there be no regional representation at all? This 
debate can take place later on.
<P>
	I think there are speakers who are going to raise these points in 
the debate today, but that is not the real focus of the debate. These 
are significant considerations, but it is important to realize that the 
motion is concerned only with the abolition of an archaic 
institution no longer meeting any need. Agreeing to this motion 
does not preclude another subsequent debate on a motion proposing 
a different solution. That is a debate on another scale, with 
constitutional ramifications. It will be up to the House and the 
different political parties to defend their points of view in the 
debate over the coming weeks, the coming months, and probably 
up until the  next 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3287"> 3287 </A></B>
<P>
election campaign. There may be differing positions on the 
relevance of a second House.
<P>
	But today the purpose of the motion is to identify clearly the 
importance of making such a gesture, of sending a message to the 
public that we think that senators, with their present mandate, are 
no longer needed.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	We no longer have any need of a chamber of this type, because 
the mandate is totally met by the House of Commons. We have 
MPs capable of performing its duties and this also represents an 
opportunity to help solve Canada's financial problems. I refer to all 
of the costs relating to the work of the senators.
<P>
	In this connection, I would refer you to the 1991 auditor 
general's report in which he made 27 recommendations for 
corrections to certain practices of the Senate. We have no way of 
knowing if those corrections were made, for last week the 
government operations committee was told by the Senate, giving 
rise to an interesting motion by the Reform Party: ``We do not have 
to be answerable to the House of Commons. As a chamber, we, like 
the House of Commons, have only to answer to the Governor 
General. We do not have to account to you for the $43 million''.
<P>
	In my opinion, that on its own is a provocation and ought to lead 
Parliament, the House of Commons, to adopt the motion I am 
proposing, for it seems to me that we ought to have had the 
opportunity to find out in the House the implications of the auditor 
general's recommendations, and to analyze in committee whether 
they had indeed corrected the improper practices. There were a 
number of significant charges against the senators, whose overall 
policy was that they could spend like there was no tomorrow 
whenever anything was needed.
<P>
	Reference was made to messenger services, travel services, 
documentation services. In a number of aspects, the Senate is still 
living high off the hog while the rest of us in Parliament are having 
many items questioned by the board of internal economy in order 
to ensure that funds are being properly spent. The desire to 
economize is not found in the Senate.
<P>
	How could the Senate be abolished? With the way the motion is 
presented we are not saying that the Senate is to be abolished the 
day after a vote here, rather we are giving the government the 
mandate to see that job is done. I think a number of these people are 
ready for a golden handshake. Starting with conditions that are 
acceptable here, we would work it so that within perhaps a year or 
two the matter would be settled and the other House would 
disappear on its own.
<P>
	Those senators still with a taste for politics could simply be 
invited to come back into the real political arena, that is the next 
election campaign, where they could face the electorate. They will 
be able to judge  whether they can convince their fellow Canadians 
that the positions they defend in the Senate are relevant.
<P>
	The quality of parliamentary debate arises from the fact that, 
during election campaigns, elected officials have to confront the 
needs of the population on the campaign trail. Let us remember that 
we have been here two and a half years and that we must be careful 
not to live in a parliamentary bubble and to return and visit the 
people. Basically that is why elections are held. Every four years or 
so we do a check to see whether what we have done meets the 
expectations of the people. This is the basis of democracy. I do not 
think we need outdated institutions today, particularly costly 
institutions like the Senate.
<P>
	If the House were to pass this motion, I would feel I had 
contributed significantly to the quality of democratic life and to 
ensuring that the Canadian system, as we know it, is as functional 
as it can be and that it will permit better management of the public 
sector and better response to the requests of our fellow Canadians.
<P>
	One of the Bloc's prime mandates, to defend Quebec's interests, 
includes this notion. You may be sure that the abolition of the 
Senate is a matter of almost total consensus in Quebec. We never 
felt there that the Senate satisfactorily represented us and we do not 
want more governments either. We want to eliminate one level of 
government.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	So we can safely say that throughout Quebec, when we look at 
the list of senators and their designations, few people know that 
Victoria, De Salaberry and Mille Isles are represented by senators 
or can give the names of the corresponding senators. So no one in 
Quebec would be sorry about the abolition of that House.
<P>
	We would make the House of Commons accountable by giving it 
the ultimate power of decision. There would be no second level of 
decision. The decisions affecting the federal Parliament would only 
be made here.
<P>
	Once the debate on this motion is over, I hope enough members 
will vote for it so we can take the significant action of giving 
Canada even better democratic tools and strengthening the House 
of Commons' powers, while at the same time doing something that 
is very significant these days by saving the money we would no 
longer have to spend on the Senate.
<P>
	That is why I ask every member of this House to consider this 
motion individually. It is not a matter of toeing the party line but of 
determining if the Senate is still useful to Canada, if it makes a 
contribution, or if things would not run more smoothly without the 
Senate and their negative public image. This might help raise 
people's level of satisfaction with the work of their elected 
representatives.
<P>
	In conclusion, I hope that, after the vote, all of us can in a way go 
down in history by abolishing an unelected  House and allowing the 
government and the Canadian Parliament to act in accordance with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3288"> 3288 </A></B>
<P>
the mandates given by the people, and by taking the symbolic 
action of cutting some unnecessary spending in Canada. In my 
opinion, the most significant way to do so with regard to Canada's 
current institutions is to abolish the Senate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, Motion No. 
221, brought forward by the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, proposes that in the opinion of the 
House the government should abolish the Senate.
<P>
	I am somewhat puzzled by the timing of the motion. Only a few 
weeks ago the hon. Leader of the Opposition was accusing the 
government of wasting its time and energy on issues not related to 
the concerns of citizens. Today we are asked to debate a motion for 
which there is little evidence, if any, indicating that Canadians wish 
to reopen this debate at this time.
<P>
	Therefore, I do not see how such a radical reform could be 
contemplated without public participation. Various groups will 
argue that other issues are more pressing and should take 
precedence over the abolition of the Senate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The areas of real concern for Canadians are economic growth, 
job creation, fairness, social justice, collective security and 
national reconciliation. This was made very clear in the Quebec 
referendum last October.
<P>
	While the opposition party is putting forward such a proposal at 
the most inappropriate of times, we, on this side of the House, are 
concentrating on fulfilling our commitments. We have undertaken 
to build on our achievements and to focus on priorities such as 
employment, economic growth, the safety of Canadians and the 
renewal of the federation to strengthen national unity.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To achieve these goals the government has put forward a plan of 
action set out in the speech from the throne. The government 
intends to honour each commitment it made to the Canadian people 
in order to make our country work more efficiently and more 
harmoniously. It is obvious that the Bloc Quebecois has no interest 
in working for national unity and seeing our country work for the 
betterment of all its citizens, including Quebecers.
<P>
	The motion brought forward today by the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup clearly demonstrates that building 
on the existing strengths of Canada and trying to find positive 
answers to concrete problems is not a priority for that party.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague is well aware, there are four main areas in 
addition to other reforms to the working of government that are 
central to the government's plan of action and to national unity. 
The government intends to stick to its agenda for change as 
proposed in the throne speech. The upcoming first ministers' 
meeting will be an important opportunity to consider the priority 
issues with which Canadians want us to deal. Let me reiterate that 
the abolishing of the Senate is not a priority for Canadians.
<P>
	Let me summarize for the benefit of the hon. member from the 
opposition the initiatives on which the government intends to focus 
and on which we will build at the first ministers' meeting.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First, the federal government has voluntarily limited its spending 
power in areas of provincial jurisdiction. We have announced that 
we have no intention of creating cofunded programs in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction without the provinces' co-operation.
<P>
	This is something the provinces had been requesting for a long 
time. It is the first time in the history of our country that the federal 
government has limited its spending power outside the formal 
setting of constitutional negotiations. Our government is also 
responding to a need clearly expressed by our provincial partners.
<P>
	Second, the government has undertaken to find new ways of 
co-operating with the provinces to maintain, regarding social 
programs, national standards with no strings attached and the 
guarantee not to implement them unilaterally. Once again, we will 
be acting on the basis of mutual consent. By operating this way, we 
will be fulfilling our obligation to maintain solidarity while at the 
same time respecting the provinces' autonomy.
<P>
	Third, we will reduce duplication and overlap by withdrawing 
from areas where other stakeholders, be it the provinces, the 
municipalities, private corporations or non governmental 
organizations, are better able to take on the responsibility.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Again, this is an issue it has been working on with the provinces 
and this is why the federal government will withdraw from 
activities that are more appropriately the responsibility of the 
provinces, municipalities and other stakeholders.
<P>
	The announcement made last Thursday by the hon. Minister of 
Human Resources Development is a concrete example of a priority 
issue to which the government was committed and which was 
delivered to the satisfaction of all parties involved. The minister 
sent all provinces and territories a labour market proposal offering 
them responsibility for all active employment measures funded 
through the employment insurance fund.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3289"> 3289 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The provinces will be able to have their own employment 
programs including wage subsidies, income supplements, job 
creation partnerships as well as labour services like employment 
counselling and job placement. This is an example of practical and 
flexible federalism at work.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	We are acting on our commitment of solidarity with the 
unemployed from coast to coast, while at the same time respecting 
the principle of local autonomy, whereby each province can 
develop local programs to meet local needs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, the federal government is committed to exercising a 
leadership role to strengthen Canada's economic union, promoting 
greater labour mobility and interprovincial free trade and, with the 
support of the provinces, building stronger institutions such as a 
single Canadian securities commission. These initiatives and other 
reforms are practical incremental changes that will enable us to 
make our federation more harmonious, more efficient, more 
adapted to the challenges we face in the 21st century.
<P>
	Again, the first ministers meeting will be an important 
opportunity to consider ways to clarify the roles of government and 
to better promote our social and economic union. The government 
recognizes the need to take action to restore public confidence in 
institutions by getting government right.
<P>
	Getting government right means modernizing federal programs 
and services to meet the needs of Canadians today and in the future. 
It means clarifying federal roles and responsibilities. It means 
strengthening the economy and economic union. It means 
enhancing social solidarity. It means pooling national resources to 
achieve common goals efficiently and effectively. It means 
protecting and promoting Canadian values and identity while 
celebrating Canada's diversity.
<P>
	This is what Canadians want their governments to achieve by 
working together. Therefore the motion we are debating today is 
one that does not reflect the concerns of ordinary Canadians. 
Besides, the motion brought forward by the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup does not take into consideration 
the fact that for many Canadians the federal decision making 
process does not sufficiently take into account regional diversity 
and needs.
<P>
	We know that regional representation is the basic structure of the 
Senate. Abolishing the Senate would not resolve the issue of 
regional representation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We could debate the Senate issue for days and weeks without 
ever reaching a consensus. Again, this is the  wrong time to raise 
this issue. Canadians have other concerns and priorities. As 
members of this House, we are responsible for seeing that their 
needs are met. That is why I think this motion should be voted 
down.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased today to be speaking on the Bloc motion which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should abolish the Senate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If we were to ask Canadians how they feel about the Senate we 
would get a very widely supported response that it is not worth 
keeping the Senate as it is and it should be abolished. The Reform 
approach is to change the Senate substantially to make it work 
better rather than just to abolish the current Senate and leave 
nothing to fill the void.
<P>
	We have proposed over the years since becoming a party in 1987 
that Canada needs a triple E Senate. A triple E Senate is one which 
is elected by the people, is effective enough to stop legislation 
which is unfair to one region or another, and has an equal number 
of senators from each province. I will talk about this later.
<P>
	The motion which calls for the abolition of the Senate and 
proposes nothing to replace it really shows the approach the Bloc 
has taken to building our country. It has chosen the approach that 
the Senate should be abolished rather than trying to fix it, to make 
it work better, to make it fill a real need this country has. In terms 
of the country as a whole, the Bloc has taken the approach that it is 
better to tear it apart than to take the time and effort to fix it and 
make it work better.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	We need a much more positive approach in this House if this 
country is going to survive. However, the party which has 
presented this motion does not want Canada to exist as it is. It 
wants Quebec to become a separate country. The Bloc is quite 
content to tear down rather than to fix.
<P>
	Before I get into what the Reform Party has proposed on this 
issue, I will talk about what the Liberals have said. The Liberals 
have said quite a bit over the years in terms of fixing the Senate. 
I believe it was at a party policy convention in 1991 that the 
Liberals debated the concept of a triple E Senate. I do not know 
what happened to the motion that was debated and, I believe, 
passed at that convention. It certainly has not been acted on, 
which is very sad.
<P>
	More recently the Prime Minister commented on the Senate. On 
September 24, 1991 the Prime Minister said: ``The regions of 
Canada need to be more involved in decision making and policy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3290"> 3290 </A></B>
<P>
making at the national level. To meet the hopes and dreams of those 
who live in the west and in the Atlantic, a reformed Senate is 
essential. It  must be a Senate which is elected, effective and 
equitable''.
<P>
	Jumping ahead to May 9, 1996, what did the Prime Minister say? 
It is quite a different thing when Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said 
that Alberta want to hold an election to elect its senator. Alberta 
already elected Stan Waters back in 1989. Stan Waters, by the way, 
was a Reform senator. When Premier Klein said that Alberta 
wanted to elect another senator, what was the Prime Minister's 
reaction? On May 9, 1996 the Prime Minister said: ``I will name a 
senator who I will choose and who will represent my party in the 
House of Commons''. That is a quote from the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's story changed considerably from 1991 to 
1996. He stood in the way of the province of Alberta electing a 
senator to the Senate, something which Albertans have demanded. 
There was a very large turnout for the election of Stan Waters. 
Albertans care about this very much. They thought that electing 
senators was a start toward getting the triple E Senate which they 
want.
<P>
	I guess what the Prime Minister says nowadays on a lot of issues 
is inconsistent. On September 10, 1993 the Prime Minister said: 
``There will not be a promise that I will make in the campaign that I 
will not keep''. He said that during the election campaign. On May 
3, 1996 he said: ``Sometimes in the course of a mandate you are 
faced with a situation where you cannot deliver. You have to have 
some flexibility because acts of God come in the administration 
and no politician can see everything happening''. His story seems 
to change from time to time.
<P>
	I would also like to quote the member for Kingston and the 
Islands. Last month when speaking about the election of Stan 
Waters he said: ``I do not recall any look of shame on the Prime 
Minister's face when he appointed this particular Reform hack to 
the Senate. He won a popularity contest in Alberta. It was a fraud 
run by the Government of Alberta''. This is a quote from the 
member for Kingston and the Islands, the former House leader for 
the Liberal Party. That is what he thinks of the Alberta election of 
Stan Waters, an event Albertans took pride in. It was so important 
to Albertans yet he speaks of that event in those terms. It is 
shameful to Albertans and most Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Changing the present Senate must happen. This move is widely 
supported by Canadians. They want in its place a body that will 
help to deal with the problem of legislation which may be unfair to 
one region of the country passing through this House. I have heard 
Bloc members say on many occasions that they have been treated 
unfairly in legislation which has passed through this House.
<P>
	I would think that the Bloc of all political parties would be 
demanding a triple E Senate so its regional interests would be 
protected, so that no legislation could pass through this House of 
Commons that would be unfair to Quebec. That would be so 
important yet Bloc members talk about abolishing the Senate. They 
have not taken a constructive approach.
<P>
	As recently as last week, Reformers debated a motion which 
would have made the Senate much more accountable to Canadians. 
It was a very important motion which was, as usual, shot down by 
the House.
<P>
	In the blue book, the Reform policy book which we update at 
every assembly and have since our 1988 policy conference, the first 
principle declares the equality of Canadians and provinces, that 
they should be treated equally under the law. The second principle 
states: ``We affirm the need to establish a triple E Senate in the 
Parliament of Canada, that is to say, a Senate which is elected by 
the people with equal representation from each province, and 
which will be fully effective in safeguarding regional interests''.
<P>
	There have been many attempts to improve the Senate in this 
House. There was a bill by the member for Kootenay East to have 
an elected Senate. There was a motion by the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam to have a triple E senate. All of them have 
been shot down by the House. They are changes which would be so 
important to Canadians and to Albertans, but we are not going to 
get these changes, or we have not so far.
<P>
	We have to take the approach that we are going to improve the 
Senate by making a triple E Senate. Until that happens a first step 
which we have laid out in our 20/20 national unity proposals is to 
elect a Senate.
<P>
	I would like to amend the motion. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That private member's motion M-221 be amended by adding immediately 
after the word ``Senate'' the following: ``in its present form''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The motion then would read: ``That, in the opinion of this House, 
the government should abolish the Senate in its present form''.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The motion is 
in order.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to take part in the debate on Motion M-221 moved by 
my colleague and friend, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, and dealing with the abolition of 
the Senate.
<P>
	For quite a number of years now, this issue has been surfacing 
regularly. Consequently, the government, and in fact all the 
members of this House, must give greater consideration to a 
situation which, over the years, has tarnished the reputation of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3291"> 3291 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian politics, and  particularly the credibility of our role as 
parliamentarians.
<P>
	In this context, the government should consider an in depth 
reform of federal parliamentarian institutions, so as to make them 
more effective and better adjusted to modern reality.
<P>
	I am fully aware of the Senate's role in the traditional British 
parliamentary system and of its historic contribution. However, we 
are faced with a serious dilemma. On the one hand, the current 
economic context does not allow us to maintain a symbolic 
institution whose costs are in excess of $65 million a year and 
whose effectiveness is rather dubious.
<P>
	On the other hand, as we approach the 21st century, it is clear 
that the governmental and legislative structures have not managed 
to modernize themselves. In fact, this archaic institution plays a 
role quite remote from its original raison d'être. Instead of 
protecting the public from the excessive ideologies of elected 
representatives, the Senate is now an instrument used to delay 
legislation on a purely partisan basis. In this regard, I wish to 
remind the House of the position held by the current government 
when it formed the official opposition.
<P>
	At the time, the Liberal Party was open to a Senate reform. Now, 
it has a totally different attitude. The Liberal government does not 
seem to give the same priority to such changes, because it now 
controls this parliamentary structure, taking advantage of the 
situation. The most blatant example of this is undoubtedly the 
appointment of Mrs. Shirley Maheu to the Senate to make room for 
the new member for Saint-Laurent-Cartierville in a by-election 
last winter. The government thus made sure it had one more voice 
in favour in the lengthy legislative process, in addition to 
legitimizing the hasty appointment of the President of the Queen's 
Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs.
<P>
	However, the contemptibly partisan political scheming behind 
these appointments pales in comparison to the image the public has 
of the Senate. Before preparing this speech, I took the time to 
consult with some of my constituents in order to find out just how 
they perceived the Senate, and especially what their concerns were.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	In this connection, I would like to tell you how the upper House 
has dropped in the opinion of the people in my riding of Frontenac. 
The first image to come to people's minds is undoubtedly that of 
the senators lulled fast asleep by speeches that we would have 
thought were very interesting and compellingly delivered.
<P>
	Ask anyone what their boss would think if they fell asleep on the 
job, and what would happen. The lineups would be even longer at 
the employment centres. Yet, as citizens and taxpayers, we tolerate 
a totally intolerable  situation. It gives new meaning to the 
expression ``asleep at the switch''.
<P>
	In another vein, I suggested to my constituents that they write to 
their senator, as they do regularly to their federal MP. They all 
seemed interested, but nobody knew to whom they should send 
their letter. Of all the constituents I met with, no one could say 
which senator represented, if I could put it that way, the Frontenac 
area.
<P>
	At best, a few could name a few members of the upper House, 
including Senator Hébert, Senator Jean-Louis Roux and Senator 
Gérald Beaudoin. But these individuals were known to the public 
before they even became senators. And there is worse. No one 
could give the name of our Senate division, leading me to conclude 
that, in addition to being useless, the Senate is not well known.
<P>
	On a more theoretical note, the reason for which the Senate was 
created no longer obtains. As I mentioned at the beginning of my 
speech, the Senate originated out of a certain concern regarding the 
representatives of the people. The Senate was to provide a 
legislative alternative to the incompetence and excesses of 
members. But history has shown us that this aspect of 
parliamentary life has largely improved and that legislation 
introduced by the House of Commons responds satisfactorily to the 
expectations and needs of the public, and respects its interests.
<P>
	The House of Commons, like the National Assembly of Quebec 
and all legislative assemblies of Canada, is a sovereign and 
democratically elected assembly. Why, then, hang on to an 
outmoded institution whose costly operation does nothing but slow 
down the operation of Parliament, and adds to taxpayers' 
dissatisfaction with how politicians are running the country?
<P>
	My colleague representing the Liberal government spoke earlier 
about the primary goal of his party, aside from creating jobs and 
putting its fiscal house in order. Here are $65 million it could save 
year after year, and it is afraid to lift its little finger today and make 
it happen. Of course it will do nothing, given the appointments just 
made by its leader.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	I see Sharon Carstairs. She was his friend, his ally in the fight 
against the Meech Lake accord. He appointed her for the next 23 
years, at an annual salary of $64,000 and all the benefits that go 
with it. He appointed her for the next 23 years, until the year 2017. 
It is shocking. The same goes for Céline Hervieux-Payette.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak on this motion.
<P>
	I am rather confused by the priorities set by the Bloc Quebecois 
and its vision of the priorities of all Canadians, including 
Quebecers, in introducing the  motion today. I can hardly believe 
there is serious indication that there is any interest among 
Quebecers in 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3292"> 3292 </A></B>
<P>
pursuing a divisive interest like Senate abolition at this time in the 
country's history.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What is more, in connection with what the member who has just 
spoken has said, he knows very well that the Parti Quebecois in 
power in Quebec has no intention whatsoever of pursuing such a 
motion, since to do so would require that party and the Quebec 
National Assembly affirm the Canadian Constitution. Is that 
likely?
<P>
	Perhaps, under the circumstances, it would be a good idea to 
accept abolition of the Senate. That would be the price to pay to 
gain Quebec's total endorsement of the Canadian Constitution. But 
I can tell you straight that, here in this House, the Bloc members 
are all perfectly aware that the Government of Quebec has no 
intention of following suit. Under those circumstances, then, the 
motion we have before us is a waste of time for the House, and does 
not show the respect of the institutions the hon. members claim it 
does.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore, there is no guarantee that other provinces would 
approve of these changes. For example, smaller provinces like 
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, which together represent only 6 
per cent of the national population but which hold 19 per cent of the 
Senate seats, would gain nothing from its abolition.
<P>
	Canadians have told us there are more pressing priorities which 
must first be addressed. In addition to economic concerns, as my 
colleague from Simcoe North noted earlier, national reconciliation 
is one of the fundamental priorities the government is committed to 
achieving.
<P>
	I remind my hon. colleague that in the referendum of October 
30, 1995 Quebecers chose to stay in Canada. At that time the Prime 
Minister acknowledged that Quebecers also indicated they wanted 
change. Thus renewal is the priority of Quebecers, of all Canadians 
and of the government.
<P>
	To this end the Prime Minister was quick to lead us on the road to 
reconciliation by introducing in the House of Commons a 
resolution recognizing Quebec as a distinct society, a resolution the 
Bloc Quebecois refused to support.
<P>
	The Prime Minister also extended a veto to Quebec and initiated 
changes that would make it possible to bring government services 
and the decision making process closer to citizens in accordance 
with the wishes of Canadians across the country.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has acknowledged that Canadians 
throughout the country want to see the federation modernized, 
adapted to today's economic realities and to  the needs of all 
citizens. That is the vocation of the government. That is not in any 
way the purpose of the resolution we are debating today.
<P>
	The government understands the desires of Quebecers and of all 
Canadians for change and has made this central to its mission. 
Among other things, we are committed to establishing clear lines 
of responsibility between different levels of government, 
eliminating unnecessary duplication, ensuring the viability of our 
social safety net and reducing barriers to internal trade.
<P>
	The government has also limited its spending power. As set out 
in the speech from the throne, the government will not use its 
spending power to create new shared cost programs in areas of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction without the consent of a majority 
of the provinces. Any new program will be designed so that 
non-participating provinces will be compensated, provided they 
establish equivalent or comparable initiatives. This is the first time 
any federal government has undertaken to formally restrict the use 
of its spending power outside constitutional regulations.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I note that you are informing me that my time 
is drawing to a close. I understand that this debate will be resumed 
when this motion next comes up and I will be able to complete my 
remarks at that time.
<P>

	The House resumed from May 31 consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bonnie Hickey (St. John's East, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Mississauga 
West.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you are going to hear a lot of factual and 
statistical information today concerning educational reform in 
Newfoundland. You are going to hear a lot of ``what ifs'' and theory 
about how this may or may not affect other bilateral terms of union 
of the other nine provinces and territories of our nation.
<P>
	What you will not hear today is the voice of one group of 
Canadians who are the most affected by this constitutional 
amendment, the Newfoundland children, of which I am a mother of 
two. I speak from the heart when I say the status quo is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Let me give a brief background on Newfoundland's 
denominational education system. It dates back to the 1700s when 
the Church of England's missionaries founded one of the first 
schools in Bonavista to administer to both the religious and 
educational needs of that town.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3293"> 3293 </A></B>
<P>
	In the mid-1800s this system was entrenched through the 
educational act which further divided funds between the Roman 
Catholics and the Protestant school boards. It is this system that 
still exists today and was enshrined in the terms of union in 1949 
when Newfoundland elected to be the 10th province of Canada.
<P>
	For some time now Newfoundlanders have realized that the 
system cannot continue under its current form. With the province 
groaning under the pressing weight of a $6 billion debt, changes to 
the system are essential. The people of Newfoundland have always 
believed in a better future for their children.
<P>
	Consider the title of the 1992 report of the royal commission of 
inquiry into the delivery of education in Newfoundland and 
Labrador, ``Our Children, Our Future''. I call on my colleagues in 
this chamber to remember these four words ``our children, our 
future'' as we debate this resolution in the House today.
<P>
	The proposed changes will enable the province to improve 
educational opportunities for our students, to bring in new 
technologies and to update curriculum. At present the province of 
Newfoundland spends the highest proportion of its total resources 
on education, more than most other provinces.
<P>
	A greater amount of this funding than should be necessary is 
being used to provide for the cost of maintaining four separate 
school systems and 27 individual school boards for a provincial 
population equivalent to that of the city of Calgary, Alberta.
<P>
	Savings of up to $25 million a year will be realized from the 
administrative changes, student transportation efficiencies and 
school consolidation which will result from the education reform 
process. The proposed reform will provide an opportunity to 
redirect these savings into the classroom level and benefit our 
students.
<P>
	As it exists today, a number of students miss out on the valuable 
skills and courses that will prepare them to enter the workforce. In 
today's technical, computerized world I have heard stories of 
students who have literally flipped a coin to decide which sciences 
to study because the school did not have enough money to offer a 
full range of courses. Yet there was a whole other identical system 
in the same community.
<P>
	Instead of having one comprehensive system that allows 
students to avail themselves with every opportunity to study a 
broad range of sciences, the students lose out in a system of 
duplication and inefficiency.
<P>
	With finances stretched to the limit, school boards are often 
unable to provide the basic necessities. There are schools in the 
province today with no cafeterias and no proper janitorial services. 
In these schools, students are missing out on meals and they are 
getting sick from the general lack of cleanliness.
<P>
	Is this a system that adequately prepares our students to meet the 
changing face of the Canadian labour market? No, it is not. It puts 
the Newfoundland youth at a disadvantage to their counterparts in 
other provinces.
<P>
	With the closure of the fishery and a dwindling population, a 
good education is the key to ensuring our children have a bright 
future and not one of unemployment and dependency.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	In addition to my personal experience with the Newfoundland 
school system, I am currently part of a team that is travelling across 
the country coast to coast with the ministerial task force on youth. 
We are consulting directly with young Canadians, youth service 
agencies, private and public sectors, schools and other concerned 
Canadians about the needs of young people, their expectations and 
their aspirations. We are looking at the issues of school to work 
transition, labour market entry and perceived and real barriers to 
entering the job market.
<P>
	Everywhere I go and especially at my town hall session in St. 
John's on May 11, which I might add has been the largest town hall 
session to date, I hear of the real need for schools to make changes 
to reflect the changing needs of the Canadian labour force.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne the Liberal government made a 
promise to create a better future for our children and young 
Canadians. This statement was made because it realizes that one of 
the greatest challenges facing our country is ensuring that our 
children obtain the skills and knowledge they need to compete in 
the fast changing, highly competitive world.
<P>
	To meet this challenge we have to ensure children have access to 
quality and excellence in education. By passing this resolution we 
will ensure that the people of Newfoundland and Labrador have the 
tools necessary to meet the challenges and to ensure the future of 
our children.
<P>
	For those who are concerned that the Newfoundland government 
is taking control from the churches in the province, this is simply 
false. The proposed amendment does not abolish or undermine 
denominational education in this province. Rather, current rights 
are being updated to effect the needs of today's students and at the 
same time allowing for a more efficient administration and 
delivery of educational services in the province of Newfoundland. 
The modifications further allow schools to maintain religious 
education, activities and observances.
<P>
	The majority of Newfoundlanders voted in favour of these 
changes on September 5, 1995. Of those who chose to vote, 54 per 
cent voted in favour of the government's proposal despite the fact 
that the churches launched a vigorous campaign designed to 
encourage people to vote against the plan. The Newfoundland 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3294"> 3294 </A></B>
<P>
government did not  stage a campaign, yet it won a clear majority 
in support of its position.
<P>
	As to the claim that this referendum is imposing the will of the 
majority on to the rights of the minorities in the province, the 
denominations affected by the changes in the education system 
comprise 95 per cent of Newfoundland's population, hardly a 
minority. I would further argue with those who would say that their 
education in a currently uni-denominational school will be 
destroyed. This is just not so either. There are provisions in the 
current proposal to ensure, where numbers warrant, those schools 
will be allowed to continue their as uni-denominational.
<P>
	Now that I have addressed the many concerns of the resolution I 
want to address the concerns of some of my colleagues who are 
concerned about the process that brought the debate into this 
Chamber. Some argue that this is being pushed through. This is 
completely false. It has been an issue for a long time. Because it 
only affects the province of Newfoundland perhaps it was not a 
priority for some MPs, especially given the amount of legislation 
that passes through this Chamber. It has always been a priority for 
me and for my children.
<P>
	I say this to those MPs who would vote against this resolution 
because of the concerns over the so-called process: Do not 
trivialize the future of my children for a bureaucratic mentality. Put 
yourself in my children's shoes and do not take away their chance 
for a better future.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want my sons and the children of Newfoundland 
to have every opportunity available to embrace the future, to keep 
up with the changing labour force requirements and in doing so, to 
become contributors to the Canadian economy. Amidst all the 
debate on the constitutional, legal and political theories, let us not 
lose sight of what is really at stake here, Newfoundland's future, its 
children.
<P>
	I ask all hon. members to look above the power struggles of the 
church and state and the political positioning and as parents, which 
the vast majority of us in this Chamber are, ask themselves: Would 
I want my child to lose out in a system that is based on duplication 
of services or would I want my child to have every opportunity 
available to get a well-rounded education? If hon. members believe 
in the future of my children and all those of Newfoundland, then 
they should not base their opinion on the what, ifs and maybes. 
They should base their conclusion on the greatest natural resources 
that Newfoundland has to offer this country: our children. Never 
lose sight of them in this debate.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Ind. Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this 
debate. I would like to make one point and then ask the member for 
St. John's East a question.
<P>
	First, the member talked about it in her speech, as did the 
premier of Newfoundland in his press conference last week. He 
talked about the illiteracy rate in Newfoundland as being 
something of great concern. He talked about the difficulty the 
system was having and the embarrassment of the highest illiteracy 
rate in the country.
<P>
	I found the comment very strange because I read from the red 
book of the premier of Newfoundland. ``Since Confederation we 
have made tremendous progress in education. Newfoundlanders 
and Labradorians have built an educational system in which we can 
all have pride. Our university participation rates are higher than the 
national average. If the present trend continues, Newfoundland and 
Labrador will soon have education levels equal to the best in the 
country''.
<P>
	As someone who believes in encouraging and funding national 
standards, that is a positive sign. I just wanted to make that 
comment because it conflicts with some of the comments that have 
been made which tend to denigrate the current education system 
that exists in Newfoundland.
<P>
	In the speech by the member for St. John's East, she talked about 
the notion that the educational system would remain the same 
where numbers warrant. On Friday the Minister of Justice made the 
same comment, that the uni-denominational schools may be 
created where numbers warrant and where the parents choose that 
for their children.
<P>
	The resolution before the House does not state ``where numbers 
warrant''. Would the member consider, seeing as it was in her 
speech and also stated by the Minister of Justice, amending this 
resolution to add ``where numbers warrant''?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hickey:</B> Madam Speaker, I have not considered that as an 
amendment. I think the amendment we are making to justify giving 
our children a better education in Newfoundland is probably all 
that we have time to deal with.
<P>
	The children of Newfoundland do not have a voice here today, 
but they would rather be given every opportunity possible to be 
better citizens rather than debating whether or not this or that 
amendment should be taken care of. The Term 17 amendment is all 
that we need to deal with. It will give our children a better 
education, a better future and a better life as Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, this is 
probably more of a statement than a question.
<P>
	I listened with interest to my colleague from St. John's East. A 
lot of questions have been troubling me and through her speech and 
the comments she has made, as a resident of Newfoundland, as a 
member of Parliament and as a person who has two sons within the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3295"> 3295 </A></B>
<P>
Newfoundland school system, she speaks quite clearly  when she 
says she supports the will of the majority of the people of 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	Two things that have been troubling me have really been 
answered in this little book. One of the questions in the book is: 
Why is the federal government involved in this matter? It is 
answered here quite clearly. The other question is: Can these 
reforms be made without a constitutional amendment? I would 
encourage anyone who is watching to phone our offices and ask for 
a copy of this little book. It contains questions and answers which 
may clear up all the questions in our mind.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as members know, I rarely speak in the House of 
Commons. However, this issue is of extraordinary importance to 
me. I have spent my life in education. I am a Roman Catholic. I am 
a former secondary school teacher and I formerly chaired the 
largest board in Canada. Most of all, I spent 21 years being a 
parent.
<P>
	It is important to let my constituents know why I am supporting 
wholeheartedly the government's resolution to amend term 17 in 
the 1949 agreement between Canada and its youngest province, 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	Newfoundland and Labrador has decided it wants to modernize 
its educational system, bringing it closer to those enjoyed by all the 
other provinces and territories in Canada.
<P>
	As an educator, I understand its desperate wish to be sure its 
education system has value. Newfoundland and Labrador spends 
the highest amount of money per capita of any province in Canada 
with the poorest results. It has the highest dropout rates, the highest 
rates of illiteracy and the lowest standardized test scores in math, 
science and English. With seasonal employment in the fisheries in 
deep trouble, math, science and English are skills essential to 
Newfoundland's prosperity and to the prosperity of the entire 
country.
<P>
	I would like to show some comparative statistics to my own 
riding. In Mississauga West the average family income is 
practically $65,000 a year. In Newfoundland it is $40,000. The 
average unemployment in my riding is 7 per cent. In 
Newfoundland it is over 30 per cent. I have 18 per cent of my 
population with university degrees. In Newfoundland it is less than 
5 per cent.
<P>
	Canada has a generous spirit. We have redistributed wealth in the 
good times and we equally share in the bad. Newfoundland and 
Labrador will soon be enduring part of a $1.5 billion cut in transfer 
payments. Every remaining tax dollar, both local and federal, must 
be put to good use.
<P>
	Newfoundland and Labrador is not a poor cousin that must 
continue to live on the generosity of others. It must be allowed to 
be a full and independent partner in  Confederation, a viable as well 
as a beautiful part of this country.
<P>
	Education, preparation for the world of tomorrow, is the basis for 
a modern and successful Newfoundland. A system that has not 
matured since 1949 does not respond to the needs of today's 
students.
<P>
	Newfoundland and Labrador has asked the permission of its 
voters, first through a referendum, then through a recent provincial 
election and now through their political leaders of all parties in the 
provincial House. Last year all party leaders unanimously agreed to 
ask us to amend their terms of union. Last week this request was 
unanimously supported by every MHA of every party in their 
House.
<P>
	In 1949 term 17 of Newfoundland's terms of union enshrined a 
fully denominational religious education system resulting in a very 
large number of small schools administered by 27 boards. There 
are 110,456 students in 446 schools governed by 27 school boards 
with a budget of $525 million. I chaired a board with almost the 
same number of students that covered three municipalities. The 
smallest, Caledon, has only 7,000 students who would have 
remained frozen in time, one-room schoolhouses and miles of 
weary travel every day.
<P>
	They chose to join the Peel board for all the benefits one 
efficiently run system could provide, special education, vocational 
training and French immersion. These are only dreams in 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	When I became a trustee in 1985, I represented Ontario at a 
national conference. The Newfoundland trustees were then 
wrestling their their 27 boards, negotiating for a better way. Now 
11 years and a 1992 royal commission report later, they are no 
further ahead. The time for negotiation is over.
<P>
	Some have suggested a constitutional amendment is not 
necessary. However, even if an agreement to change the education 
system could be reached between all denominations and the 
provincial government, any such agreement could be challenged in 
a constitutional challenge on the basis that it violates term 17.
<P>
	This is why an amendment is essential at this time. All schools 
are denominational in Newfoundland. No one denomination 
dominates. It is a collection of minorities. What of those who do 
not belong to a formal religion or to a religion that is not one of the 
chosen ones? Does a Jewish child convert to Catholicism? Does a 
Muslim immigrant have to convert to the Pentecostal faith? How 
do we protect the freedoms of the real minorities, the 5 per cent of 
Newfoundland students who do not conform to one of the 
recognized religions?
<P>
	In the proposed new system churches will still play a significant 
role in the instruction of students; instruction rather than planning, 
teaching rather than tyranny.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3296"> 3296 </A></B>
<P>
	The people of Newfoundland and Labrador have a right to 
jurisdiction over education. They have a right to a freedom from 
religion as well as freedom of religion. Every tax dollar paid to 
publicly supported schools must be squeezed and manipulated to 
its maximum benefit. No longer will a dollar paid to upgrade a 
Catholic school be multiplied by 27 for unneeded repairs to those 
of other denominations.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	In Ontario over the last ten years two out of every three 
construction dollars have been put into the separate system because 
that is where the need was greatest.
<P>
	Funds will now be distributed in Newfoundland according to 
need rather than denomination. Some say French language or 
aboriginal rights will be affected. They will not. These are charter 
rights for all Canadians and will be maintained. Some say this is 
the thin edge of the wedge and that other provinces will follow suit, 
possibly eliminating Catholic schools in Ontario.
<P>
	Ontario does not have the same terms of agreement. It does not 
have the same terms that allow such change. Denominational rights 
are protected in the case of the four founding provinces by the 
Constitution and by different terms of union. In addition, education 
is exclusively under provincial jurisdiction in Ontario.
<P>
	The people of Newfoundland and Labrador should have 
province-wide control of their education system, just as we have. 
They should have the right to create ten interdenominational boards 
where 27 currently exist. Where numbers warrant, separate schools 
will continue to exist for individual denominations. Boundaries, 
capital funding, transportation and other purely administrative 
matters will be controlled by a duly elected provincial legislature.
<P>
	In summary, Newfoundland and Labrador has debated this issue 
for many years without coming to a negotiated agreement. Its 
children are suffering. Its spends the most to achieve the least. It is 
our poorest province. Control over education is a provincial right. 
Quality education is the right of every Canadian child.
<P>
	We cannot allow unwarranted fear of what may happen to blind 
us to what is already happening. The children of Newfoundland and 
Labrador of every religion desperately need our support before 
truly effective change will happen. No tiny six-year-old should ride 
for hours on a bus past three or four schools to go to the school 
which will accept her. All children of Newfoundland should be able 
to go to their nearest school and receive a quality education.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Ind. Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the way the member for Mississauga West 
denigrated the Newfoundland school system is beyond belief.
<P>
	I have some comments from the former minister of education for 
Newfoundland, Mr. Chris Decker, on a report on education in 
Canada regarding Newfoundland's educational system:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The percentage of the population attaining less than 8 years of schooling has 
decreased from 24 per cent in 1976, compared to the then Canadian average of 
9.5 per cent, to 5.6 per cent, slightly more than the Canadian average of 3.8 per 
cent in 1991. That is an improvement of 18.4 per cent for Newfoundland 
compared to an improvement of 8.4 per cent for Canada as a whole.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The numbers of students not graduating from high school in Newfoundland 
have decreased from 66 per cent in 1976 to 49.9 per cent in 1991. The Canadian 
average went from 56 per cent to 43 per cent during the same period. The 
numbers for Newfoundland are much better now than in 1991, the last year 
statistically compared to Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Students in Newfoundland perform just as well as students in most other 
provinces and the Canadian average; results of testing of 16-year olds in reading 
and writing, school achievement indicators project, 1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are painting the Newfoundland educational system like it is 
some archaic operation. That is not the case. It does not exist. Let 
us deal with the real reason we are amending this fundamental 
piece of Confederation. It is an economic deal. We are doing this to 
save $11 million or $12 million. That is the bottom line.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I have real problems with approaching a motion like this which 
is so important. As the member from Ontario asked in her remarks, 
will this affect Ontario? This could affect Ontario. We have had 
some of the best constitutional lawyers in the land say that. I want 
to be on record as saying I do not think we should just rubber stamp 
this.
<P>
	The House has always been the protector of minority rights. This 
is a Chamber in which we are to be looking out for the 
disadvantaged, not the advantaged. In this case we are really 
missing an opportunity to be what the Chamber is supposed to be, 
the guardian of minority rights.
<P>
	The member mentioned the system would stay the same where 
numbers warranted. I asked the member for St. John's East if she 
would support putting into the resolution the phrase ``where 
numbers warranted''. The Minister of Justice has stated it, the 
premier of Newfoundland stated it in his press conference last 
week, but it is not in this resolution.
<P>
	I propose we amend this motion by doing a very simple thing 
which could bring all of us together, that the system would stay the 
same where numbers warranted, which is what the member said in 
her speech. Would the member support that addition to the 
resolution in the form of an amendment?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Parrish:</B> Madam Speaker, it is nice to see my former 
colleague from Broadview-Greenwood has not lost his touch. His 
spellbinding ability still exists. His ability to conjure up statistics 
at will is still very good.
<P>
	I did not denigrate the residents of Newfoundland, nor did I-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, on a 
point of order, the member for Mississauga West made a statement 
that was not accurate. She accused me of conjuring up statistics at 
will when I quoted directly from the minister of education for 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Resuming 
questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Parrish:</B> Madam Speaker, I am sorry if I said they were 
conjured. As we all know, when one has spent a lot of time in 
academia one can always find the right statistics to suit the 
argument.
<P>
	As far as an amending formula or amending this motion, it has 
been my experience in the House, which is not as broad or as deep 
as that of the member opposite, that whenever people cannot fight 
the intent of a motion logically they start amending it to destroy its 
intent, to confuse, to obfuscate.
<P>
	I do not believe our position in the House should be to amend 
anything that goes on in Newfoundland. I believe we should pass 
this. We should leave it to Newfoundland to construct its own 
system, just as we have in Ontario. It is not our business because 
we are very afraid that someone may look at changing the system in 
Ontario. I would love to see the member opposite sit back quietly if 
someone from Newfoundland were to suggest how to change the 
system in Ontario.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to say how pleased I am to speak 
today on a matter as interesting as the one we are now addressing. 
For the fourth time in its history, a legislative assembly, this time 
the legislature of Newfoundland and Labrador, has adopted a 
resolution asking the federal Parliament to amend the Constitution 
under section 43 of that Constitution.
<P>
	This section allows the federal government to amend any 
provision of the Constitution which applies to one or more of the 
provinces, in this case Newfoundland and Labrador. According to 
section 43, any such amendment may be made by adoption of 
resolutions of the House of Commons and Senate and of the 
legislative assembly of each province to which the amendment 
applies.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	In 1987, this House adopted a resolution to place the Pentecostal 
schools of Newfoundland on the same footing as the seven 
denominations recognized by the 1949 agreement, as well as to 
ensure their funding. This  was the first constitutional amendment 
made under the section of concern to us today, section 43.
<P>
	The second was to guarantee the linguistic equality of French 
and English in New Brunswick. That was in 1993. The same year, 
there was another constitutional amendment to permit the 
construction of an interprovincial bridge between Prince Edward 
Island and New Brunswick. I would point out that, in this vote, 
which involved approving the construction of a bridge, the Bloc 
Quebecois voted in favour, because we felt, and continue to feel, 
that this is the best long term solution in economic terms.
<P>
	Today, therefore, the members of this House are preparing to 
pass a resolution that will lead to a new constitutional change, and I 
shall spare you the reading of the text. I would, however, mention 
that the aim of the Newfoundland legislature is to rationalize the 
province's education system to permit savings to be made. The aim 
is to put an end to denominational schools so as to cut the number 
of school boards-everywhere these days there is talk about 
downsizing the school boards, even in Quebec-in order to set up a 
new multidenominational school board, which will be more 
efficient and less costly, it is claimed.
<P>
	This proposed education reform is based on the 
recommendations of the Newfoundland royal commission of 
inquiry into education, which published its report in 1992. The 
major obstacle faced by the Newfoundland government arises from 
the fact that denominational schools were guaranteed by term 17 of 
the Terms of Union establishing Newfoundland's entry into Canada 
in 1949, which is an integral part of the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	At first glance, there does not appear to be a problem, because 
the Government of Newfoundland could simply have passed a 
resolution to amend term 17 of the constitutional agreement of 
1949 and then simply have it passed by this House. This time, 
however, the provincial legislature wanted to hold a referendum 
first to consult the people of Newfoundland before passing its 
resolution.
<P>
	The referendum question asked Newfoundlanders whether they 
would allow the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador to 
introduce a resolution calling for the amendment of term 17 of the 
Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada. It must be pointed 
out that there was no obligation to hold a referendum to amend this 
term, since the amending formula in section 43 of the Constitution 
requires only that a resolution be passed by the Newfoundland 
legislature, the House of Commons and the Senate in such cases.
<P>
	Yet, the Government of Newfoundland felt it had to hold a 
referendum in order to consult the population beforehand, thus 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3298"> 3298 </A></B>
<P>
showing great respect for democracy. As we well know, referenda 
were not so widely used 30 years ago but today, with all the 
countries in the world  joining large consortiums in Europe, Asia 
and North America, we will see more and more of them.
<P>
	In this referendum, which, by the way, is the consultation 
mechanism par excellence and is now gaining popularity around 
the world, the people of Newfoundland expressed their desire to 
amend the extent to which and the way the various religious 
denominations get involved in the administration of the education 
system. They endorsed the government proposal by a 54 per cent 
majority, which is not that much. Only 52 per cent of all the people 
exercised their right to vote.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	This referendum was held on September 5, 1995. In the 
following months, the Prime Minister of Canada said in response to 
the Newfoundland premier's formal request that he intended to 
table for adoption the text of the constitutional resolution in 
February 1996. In his letter to his provincial counterpart, the Prime 
Minister gives no indication whether he agrees with the referendum 
result; he simply accepts it and says he will table the resolution in 
the House.
<P>
	In his response, the Prime Minister of Canada showed clearly 
that he accepts the result of a referendum in which 52 per cent of all 
registered voters participated and in which 54 per cent of the 
ballots cast is an acceptable majority. The parallel with the 
referendum situation in Quebec is impossible to ignore.
<P>
	Although the issue of Quebec sovereignty is much more 
important and has a greater impact than today's constitutional 
amendment, that fact is that the Prime Minister has established a 
precedent by accepting the results of the referendum held in 
Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said in this House on several occasions-I 
will not quote from <I>Hansard</I> but I think everyone remembers the 
various times he said this-that a result of 50 per cent plus one in a 
referendum on Quebec sovereignty was not enough. He said a 
result of 50 per cent plus one was not an acceptable majority in the 
case of a Quebec referendum. Today, the same Prime Minister 
recognizes the results of a referendum in which only 54 per cent 
voted for a constitutional amendment and only 52 per cent of 
registered voters participated. We all know that voter participation 
in the Quebec referendum was slightly higher. It actually was over 
90 per cent.
<P>
	Are we to conclude from this that, for the Prime Minister, a 
referendum in which only 52 per cent of registered voters have 
exercised their right to vote is good enough anywhere in Canada 
except in Quebec, where 90 per cent of the population participated 
in the referendum and are about to do so again soon? Are we also to 
conclude that, for the Prime Minister, a referendum held across a 
province where a majority  voted yes, with 54 per cent, this is good 
enough, except in Quebec of course, where 54 per cent is just not 
good enough? In his mind, according to the figures quoted or 
hinted at by friends of the regime and business people, it would 
take a 65 per cent vote, perhaps as high as 70 per cent, it is not 
clear, for a yes victory in a Quebec referendum to be recognized.
<P>
	This makes us realize how totally inconsistent the Prime 
Minister of Canada and his government are. A referendum is a 
democratic public consultation process, and the cornerstone of 
democracy is precisely the 50 per cent plus one rule. It is the 
majority of the population making a choice.
<P>
	In the information papers we have received, one of which I 
believe is from the Department of Justice, there are striking 
similarities there. Question 4 states: ``Why do church and 
government leaders in Newfoundland and Labrador not settle this 
issue without constitutional amendments being necessary?'' The 
paper in favour of passing the resolution reads: ``Having negotiated 
intensively for three years, the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador was unsuccessful in obtaining the consent required to 
implement the necessary changes. In addition, a further attempt by 
the Newfoundland and Labrador education minister to negotiate an 
agreement also failed and did not produce an agreement on key 
reforms''.
<P>
	In Quebec, we have been trying for 30 years and we are still 
waiting. So far, every attempt to reach an agreement has failed.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	The document submitted to us by the Department of Justice also 
included the question: ``Why are these changes necessary?'' The 
answer given is that the current system must be changed, because it 
creates a complex administrative structure generating overlap and 
inefficiencies.
<P>
	What difference is there with the Bloc Quebecois? The 
document states that the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador has come to the conclusion that eliminating these costly 
inefficiencies and freeing up resources to introduce other 
operational changes is the best way to improve its education 
system. Eliminating costly inefficiencies is, of course, exactly what 
Quebec and the Bloc Quebecois are asking for.
<P>
	Shortly before I rose to discuss this issue, the House was 
debating the very real possibility of conducting an in-depth review 
of the Senate's role, and even of considering abolishing it, given 
the current situation. This suggestion has nothing to do with the 
quality of the men and women who sit in the Senate. Rather, it is 
based on the fact that this institution is an anachronism in our 
system. It prevents it from functioning well and it is also costly for 
nothing. The figure of $65 million per year was mentioned.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3299"> 3299 </A></B>
<P>
	So, Newfoundland wishes to make some changes to its system 
to improve its situation. This is exactly what Quebec seeks to do, 
albeit on another scale.
<P>
	The document also states that ``it is those affected by the changes 
that approved them''. This is in reference to the people who voted 
in the referendum held in Newfoundland. So, according to the 
Department of Justice, when a referendum will be held on 
Quebec's sovereignty, those affected, namely Quebecers, will have 
the right to express their views, because they will be the ones 
affected by the outcome.
<P>
	Further on in the same Department of Justice document, in 
response to Question No. 9, the following is asked: ``Did the 
government of Newfoundland and Labrador act arbitrarily?'' 
Response: ``On February 22, 1996, the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador received a majority mandate with the 
campaign promise to reform the denominationally-based school 
system''. Here again, we note the similarity with Quebec. Let me 
just remind the Liberal MPs, in case they have forgotten, which I 
doubt, that the Parti Quebecois received a majority mandate with 
the campaign promise of holding a referendum on the sovereignty 
of Quebec.
<P>
	Another point catches my attention as well. Here we are 
speaking of a constitutional amendment which might impact upon 
other provinces. Yet the Liberal government, the government in 
this House, did not ask to choose the wording for the referendum 
question. It was drafted solely by the Government of 
Newfoundland, with no participation whatsoever by the federal 
government or any other provincial governments. Odd, because in 
the case of Quebec the federal government absolutely insists on 
taking part in preparations for the wording of the question. Yet that 
question, as will be seen later, will be asked of Quebecers by 
Quebecers. As in Quebec, however, the proponents of the no side in 
Newfoundland are unanimous in criticizing the question, as we 
have seen in the press reports, for being ambiguous, not explicit 
enough. But no attention was paid to that. The question was asked 
by the people of Newfoundland, it was answered by the people of 
Newfoundland, and the federal government did not get involved in 
drafting the question, whereas it did indicate that it might do so for 
Quebec.
<P>
	In this connection, we have listed a few questions that were not 
raised about the recent Newfoundland referendum, yet are being 
raised in the case of Quebec. I will run through a few of them 
quickly, since I think I have only four or five minutes left.
<P>
	A lot has been said on the question of a simple majority. The 
Prime Minister has intimated a number of times in the House, as I 
said earlier, that a simple majority might not be enough to ensure 
Quebec's sovereignty. In July 1948-and my colleague from 
Berthier-Montcalm has looked into this much more deeply than 
I-barely 52 per cent of Newfoundland  electors agreed to join the 
Canadian federation in a referendum, and this was the second 
referendum in a few months, with the first one being held on June 
3, 1948. So, the results of the first one were not accepted.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	In the case of the second referendum, which passed with 52 per 
cent, 48 per cent of Newfoundlanders voted no, not wanting to join 
with Canada. It was not this figure that was taken into account, but 
rather the vote of the democratic majority, and Newfoundland 
joined Confederation.
<P>
	Since referenda will be used increasingly, we will see 
internationally that the results of referenda committing peoples' 
future will be ever closer. The law of the majority will never 
change. In November 1994, 52 per cent of Swedes voted to join the 
European Union; although 48 per cent voted against, the rule of the 
majority prevailed. Two weeks later, Norway voted against joining 
by 52 per cent; 48 per cent of Norwegians were in favour, but the 
law of the majority prevailed.
<P>
	The rule of a simple majority in a referendum is universal, 
because it is the only democratic and practicable rule. When a 
society says ``one person, one vote'', it does not mean ``one person, 
two thirds of a vote'' or ``one person, a vote and a third''. 
Everyone's vote is equal. This is why a referendum is based on a 
majority.
<P>
	When Quebec joined the federation, there was neither a 
referendum nor an election. Quebec joined the federation by 
parliamentary vote. In the first Quebec referendum on sovereignty 
in 1980, and in the referendum on the Charlottetown accord, the 
federalists participated in the campaign without ever imposing any 
conditions regarding a majority of more than 50 per cent, because 
until then they were confident they would win. But, as soon as 
things start heating up, they want to change the rules of the game. 
In Quebec, like everywhere else, winning a referendum requires a 
simple majority, that is to say, 50 per cent plus one vote.
<P>
	I have noted on several occasions that our friends in the Reform 
Party have, through their leader, taken a clear stand on this issue. I 
am convinced others have taken the same position, although I have 
been unable to read the reports in other newspapers, I did read his 
statement that:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``A 50 per cent plus one vote for independence is sufficient for 
Quebec to leave Confederation, according to the Reform leader, but 
the terms and conditions would have to be subject to a referendum 
in the rest of Canada''. I agree with that. ``I do not know of any 
other threshold than 50 per cent plus one''. That is what went on

	There is also Don MacPherson, who wrote in a recent article in 
the <I>Gazette</I>:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I hate to test his legendary modesty but I am forced to admit 
that my good friend Bernard Landry''-I do not know if it is true 
that he is friends with Bernard Landry-``is right again. Landry, 
who is vice-premier in the Parizeau government''-so this goes 
back a few months-``says a simple majority is good enough to 
decide a referendum on sovereignty. The vice-premier could have 
also pointed out that it was good enough for federalists in the 1992 
Quebec referendum on the Charlottetown constitutional accord. 
What is sauce for the federalist goose is sauce for the sovereignist 
gander''. He ended by saying: ``And by current world standards of 
democracy, a yes vote in the referendum would give a Quebec 
declaration of independence impeccable legitimacy''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This does not mean it would be easy, but it would be legal. We 
could repeat some of the other arguments that were never made 
again in relation to what is happening elsewhere in Canada. There 
is no dispute about the Newfoundland referendum, which was only 
won by a few points and in which only about half the population 
voted. But they are already starting to set the rules for the next 
referendum in Quebec.
<P>
	They are now addressing the issue of borders and minorities. 
They are telling us the borders of Quebec might change, that 
minorities may not want to stay within these borders, that the 
territory may be partitioned, who knows. Yet, Canada as a country 
has recognized many countries in the world-I will name a 
few-with the borders they had before. Canada has recognized the 
two sovereign countries that resulted from the partition of 
Czechoslovakia: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Ottawa was one 
of the first capitals to recognize Ukraine's independence in 1991, 
and that of the Baltic states, as we remember. In the case of the 
Baltic states, which became sovereign through democratic means, I 
think Canada was the first country to recognize their independence 
and all their borders. Yet, the fact that all those countries have 
significant minorities does not take anything away from the results 
of a democratic referendum.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	As for the resolution proposed by the legislature of 
Newfoundland and Labrador, I will support it because the people 
have expressed in a provincial referendum their desire to amend the 
extent to which and the way religious denominations get involved 
in the administration of the education system. I, however, would 
like to point out one thing, namely that the federal government 
seems to feel there are two kinds of  democracy in this country: one 
for Canada and one for Quebec.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Ind. Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies 
has brought up a very important point of which every member of 
the House should be aware. It has to do with the precedent which is 
being set and the way the Bloc sees this precedent in terms of its 
next referendum. The member just said that in the next referendum 
if 50 per cent plus one decide to leave Canada, then how can there 
be one rule for Quebec and a different rule for Newfoundland? I 
believe that was the basic point which he made.
<P>
	Since 1980 I have watched the premier of Newfoundland work in 
the House of Commons and work for Canada, not just domestically 
but internationally. I do not think there would be a person in the 
House who would deny the fact that the premier of Newfoundland 
is probably the best communicator Canada has had in years in 
terms of putting our presence, our spirit and our sovereignty on the 
front burner. He has been out there. His tactics have at times been 
borderline genius when it comes to communications. However, his 
tactics on this resolution are going to create a problem for us in the 
House and in the country which we have not thought through. 
Fifty-four per cent in the referendum at this time is establishing a 
benchmark. We all know what the polls are saying in Quebec and 
they are much more than 54 per cent.
<P>
	It is important for all of us to realize that this Chamber is 
essentially being used as a rubber stamp for a constitutional 
amendment. A few years ago when we were talking about this issue 
a senator claimed that these rights and these systems are part of the 
arc of Confederation. Today we are simply going to rubber stamp 
the request.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies put us all on 
notice in his speech just a few minutes ago when he asked how, on a 
referendum, there can be one rule for Newfoundland and a different 
one for Quebec. I hope when members think about supporting this 
resolution tonight they will think of the long term consequences.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Madam Speaker, those were mostly comments 
that my hon. colleague and neighbour-seeing that we have 
adjacent offices in the West Block-made. First, he said that the 
premier of Newfoundland was certainly the best communicator in 
Canada; we, on this side, have always called him Captain Canada, 
and this was not meant to be derogatory in any way. We do agree 
that, as a communicator, the premier of Newfoundland has 
spearheaded practically everything that was done in  Canada. That 
is probably also one of the reasons why he got elected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3301"> 3301 </A></B>
<P>
	My hon. colleague commented on my calling the attention of the 
House to the fact that Newfoundland had just set a precedent, but I 
was just making a connection between the case of Newfoundland, 
where a 54 per cent result is readily recognized in this House, and 
Quebec, where the application of democratic rules is being 
questioned.
<P>
	I think that what my hon. colleague is saying it that we are 
setting a precedent by passing this here. The precedent has already 
been set anyway. It was set at the international level, at 
Charlottetown, when the results were not questioned, because the 
50 per cent plus one rule came into play. They were not questioned 
with respect to Meech, the 1980 referendum or any other 
referendum until now.
<P>
	I sincerely believe the Prime Minister of this country is right 
when he says the basic problem and the first thing we should do, 
not myself personally, but those of my constituents who still 
believe this is possible-yes, some still do-would be to try to 
persuade Quebecers they must remain a part of Canada. Under 
those circumstances, a referendum would not be any problem.
<P>
	Needless to say I have my doubts. I have been concerned with 
politics for 30 years-not actively involved but at least watching 
what is happening on the political scene-and in the past 30 years, 
we have never succeeded in having Quebec's minimum demands 
recognized. The only way out for us is to hold a referendum on 
sovereignty and we will win this referendum.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, with the greatest of respect, I disagree most emphatically 
with the member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies and the member 
for Broadview-Greenwood, who both assert that this whole 
debate today has to do with referenda. In my opinion, and in the 
opinion of many experts in legal matters who know far better than I 
do, it has nothing to do with referenda.
<P>
	The legislative assembly of a province has sought a 
constitutional change which it is perfectly entitled to do. If for 
example the assembly in either of the provinces of Quebec or 
Alberta had a situation on which it was unanimously agreed a 
constitutional change was wanted, I would expect that the province 
would take the request for the change to the federal government. 
That is exactly as it should be.
<P>
	When that request arises in this House, I would expect as is 
going to be the case today, the Parliament of Canada would decide 
on that request in a free vote. When there is a vote in this Chamber 
on a constitutional issue, as we have in the case with Newfoundland 
today, or any other  province that may bring a constitutional issue 
before the House, it should be a free vote so the people of Canada 
shall speak on the issue and decide.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Madam Speaker, in fact, the Government of 
Newfoundland did not have to consult the people. It simply wanted 
to increase the legitimacy of its position in an apparently extremely 
contentious debate. That is why a referendum was held, and why 
the issue is taken up in the House, but there was no need for that in 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	We will support the motion for two reasons. First, because a 
democratic referendum to that end was successful, and second, 
because we met with the premier of Newfoundland, whom we 
admire a great deal and who gave us a minimum of guarantees that 
minority rights would be respected.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the primary responsibility of the Parliament of Canada is not to 
concern itself with the reform of the Newfoundland and Labrador 
education system. Rather, the fundamental responsibility of the 
Parliament of Canada is to safeguard and protect the existing terms 
of the Canadian Constitution and to protect the enshrined rights of 
minorities as presently set forth in the existing Constitution. This is 
not merely a Newfoundland and Labrador issue; this is a Canadian 
issue affecting Canada as a nation.
<P>
	The adoption of this resolution to amend term 17 by the 
Parliament of Canada will have far reaching, detrimental 
consequences for the nation, the Canadian people as a whole. 
Therefore I do not support this resolution.
<P>
	This resolution is not properly before this honourable House. 
Procedurally the Parliament of Canada is relying on section 43 of 
the Constitution Act, 1982 to provide for an amendment to the 
Constitution of Canada in relation to any provision that applies to 
one or more but not all provinces; in this case one province. Section 
43 provides that such an amendment can be made bilaterally, 
between the province affected and the Parliament of Canada, 
through resolutions passed respectively by the provincial 
legislature, by Parliament, by both the House of Commons and the 
Senate.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice in his address to the House of Commons 
on May 31, 1996 gave an example of a bilateral change involving 
the fixed link with Prince Edward Island which required a change 
in terms of its union with the federation. With the greatest respect 
to the Minister of Justice, there is absolutely no comparison 
between the fixed link and the rights of minorities in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3302"> 3302 </A></B>
<P>
	Procedurally Parliament is in error to entertain a section 43 
resolution because the issue before the House does not merely 
affect Newfoundland and Labrador. It affects all of Canada. It 
affects every Canadian. It goes to the very heart of the basic, 
fundamental constitutional rights and freedoms set forth in the 
Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	When a province and Parliament can bilaterally act pursuant to 
section 43 to substantially modify without consent the minority 
rights of the Canadian people, we have to be more than concerned. 
In this instance the consent of the religious denominations has not 
been obtained. To act without this consent is inexcusable and 
unjustifiable.
<P>
	To appease the provincial conscience a referendum was held in 
which 52.5 per cent of the eligible voters voted; 54.9 per cent voted 
in favour, 44.9 per cent voted no, and 422 ballots were rejected.
<P>
	Although the referendum is not a prerequisite to a section 43 
resolution it should be noted that the express consent of the 
religious denominations must and should be obtained. The 
constitutional rights of the denominations cannot be waived by the 
mere passing of a resolution by the Newfoundland government. 
Therefore unless and until the express consent of all religious 
denominations are obtained this section 43 resolution is 
procedurally and substantively not properly before Parliament.
<P>
	In any event, section 43 cannot be read in isolation of section 93 
of the Constitution Act. Section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867 
confers on provincial legislatures the exclusive power to make laws 
in relation to education. Section 93 restricts provincial power to 
make laws in relation to education by adding four qualifying 
sections. Subsection 1 specifically provides that nothing in any 
such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with 
respect to denominational schools which any class of persons has 
by law in the province at the time of union.
<P>
	Section 93 read in conjunction with section 43 makes it clear that 
this is not merely a Newfoundland and Labrador issue. This is an 
issue that affects every province, every Canadian, every religious 
denomination, every parent in Canada. It affects every minority 
right with respect to religion, education and language rights.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	This section 43 resolution is not properly before the House. In 
any event, the substantive purpose and effect of this resolution is to 
undermine the existing and inherent rights of the church, the 
religious denominations' right to govern and to teach values 
consistent with the fundamental teachings of their respective 
religious denominations.
<P>
	The effect of the proposed amended term 17 will be to permit the 
Government of Newfoundland to enact  legislation which, as itself 
concedes, would prejudicially affect the existing constitutional 
rights of the religious denominations and minority classes of 
persons and thus violate term 17 as it stands.
<P>
	The effect of that legislation will be to effectively dismantle the 
existing denominational school system in Newfoundland. The 
proposed amendment to term 17 will eliminate constitutionally 
protected rights held by religious denominations, and this will be 
done without their consent.
<P>
	The initiative to amend the Constitution and thus to take away 
their minority rights was taken without agreement. It was also 
taken notwithstanding former Premier Wells' statement in the 
House of Assembly on March 12, 1993, when he said just before 
announcing an election: ``Mr. Speaker, in response to the church 
leaders' concerns that implementing certain recommendations of 
the royal commission report would jeopardize their traditional 
rights, government has assured the leaders that it is not seeking 
change to the Constitution that would remove the constitutionally 
protected rights of classes of people specifically provided for''.
<P>
	However, present day events show that commitment was not 
kept. In light of this, this honourable House has a grave 
responsibility to protect, defend and safeguard the constitutional 
rights of our denominational schools and the rights of all minorities 
in Canada.
<P>
	The House should be alerted to the words of the justice minister 
on May 31 with respect to the future section 43 resolutions: ``We 
shall make up our minds on the facts of those cases if and when 
they arise. If they do not meet the standards which we think are 
appropriate we can decline to give our support''.
<P>
	I ask the honourable House should we leave the constitutional 
minority rights of Canadians in the hands of the politicians of the 
day to set the standards and to decide to change the inherent 
constitutional rights of the Canadian people at their political whim? 
I think not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, amending the Constitution of 
Canada is always very serious business and is to be approached by 
the House with the diligence and careful study it deserves, whether 
the amendment affects the entire country or only one province.
<P>
	The resolution before the House relates only to one province. 
More specifically, the proposed amendment repeals term 17 of the 
terms of union of Newfoundland with Canada and substitutes for it 
certain changes as defined in the schedule called ``Amendment to 
the Constitution of Canada'' tabled by the Minister of Justice. It 
first appeared in the Order Paper and Notice Paper on Thursday, 
May 30.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3303"> 3303 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	At this juncture it is useful to remind us that Canada's 
Constitution since 1867 has made it clear that education lies within 
the legislative authority of the provinces, whether they were the 
original founding provinces of our Confederation or joined later.
<P>
	When Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949 the clause in the 
terms of union dealing with education stated that the 
Newfoundland legislature will not have authority to make laws 
prejudicially affecting any right or privilege of denominational 
schools as they existed at the time of the province's entry into 
Confederation.
<P>
	Today the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has a 
publicly funded school system, the governance and operation of 
which is in the hands of seven denominations, Anglican, 
Pentecostal, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, Salvation Army, Seven 
Day Adventists and the United Church.
<P>
	In other words, there must be denominational involvement in 
decisions affecting the composition of the school boards, the 
establishment and closure of schools, the hiring of teachers, the 
establishment of school district boundaries and the distribution of 
public funds. The current education system has therefore produced 
a large number of small schools offering close proximity to each 
other. School children are bused to their own denominational 
schools elsewhere even though there are schools in their own 
neighbourhoods or communities.
<P>
	The need for administrative changes in the school system for 
efficiency in transportation of students and for consolidation of 
schools has been evident for quite some time. In March 1992 the 
government established royal commission released its report 
entitled ``Our Children: Our Future'' which recommended 
fundamental changes to Newfoundland's education system. Term 
17 requires denominational consent for changes in the province's 
education system unless amendment to Canada's Constitution as 
envisioned in the motion before us is passed.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has a duty to study and respond to 
the resolution on this issue as passed unanimously by the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador. Members of the 
Canadian Parliament have the obligation to diligently study all 
sides of the issue. On a free vote I support the government 
resolution as tabled by the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has 
documented that it first tried to achieve consensus with the 
religious denominations in the province to attain the necessary 
educational reform without constitutional amendment. The first 
meeting of the provincial government and church leaders happened 
in November 1992. Attempts to reach a consensus were pursued by 
way of exchange of letters and joint meetings on many occasions, 
as recently as April of this year. At one time private mediation was 
tried. Although a framework agreement was reached recently, and 
this is welcomed, it is the most recent position of the provincial 
government that such an agreement is tenuous and could be 
withdrawn by any party to the agreement or challenged in court by 
any citizen.
<P>
	On the other hand, opponents to the proposed amendment to 
term 17 feel the framework agreement should be allowed and given 
a chance to work. They argue substantial reform of the province's 
educational system can be achieved without amending the 
Constitution. They further argue that repeal of term 17 would 
endanger denominational rights to education in Newfoundland and 
could set a precedent that threatens the same and other minority 
rights across Canada.
<P>
	This is the nub of the issue as seen by the opposition. I believe 
the opposition is honest and sincere. It has received opinions from 
its legal advisers that Newfoundland legislation adopting the 
proposals outlined in the document ``Framework for School Board 
Consolidation'' would not be found by the courts to be in violation 
of term 17 of the present terms of union, that amendment to term 
17 would create a risk to denominational school guarantees in other 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	These are the fears of those who oppose the resolution. They are 
sincere in their beliefs. I would like to assure them if I could that 
they have nothing to fear.
<P>
	While the Government of Newfoundland will have greater 
administrative control, the denominational feature of the 
province's educational system is protected. In fact, 
uni-denominational schools will be established for individual 
denominations where requested by parents and where student 
numbers warrant.
<P>
	The denominations will retain control over the religious aspects 
of schooling but a reduced number of interdenominational school 
boards will be established for greater efficiency in the system. To 
this latter recommendation, there is no dispute. There is no debate. 
Both sides on the issue agree.
<P>
	The Newfoundland referendum on the issue, although not 
required for the process of constitutional amendment, was 
conducted by the Newfoundland government to gauge the 
sentiments of her citizens. Fifty per cent voted in favour of change. 
True, only 52 per cent of eligible voters cast their ballots but this I 
submit is a statement in itself.
<P>
	Although the Newfoundland government used a referendum, the 
proposed constitutional amendment will not give support to 
Quebec separatists. Their agenda is to weaken and break Canadian 
Confederation. Quite the contrary, the amendment before us now is 
to strengthen the educational system in Newfoundland and to 
ensure co-operative federalism works at its best.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3304"> 3304 </A></B>
<P>
	I should also emphasize that religious rights are not being 
fundamentally changed, only administrative rights. I agree with 
the Minister of Justice that minority language rights, aboriginal 
rights and other minority rights in and beyond Newfoundland, 
throughout Canada, are not in jeopardy.
<P>
	The amendment to Term 17 does not create a precedent in the 
future for the situation in Newfoundland is unique. Future requests 
for constitutional amendments from any province will be judged as 
the present one is, solely on the merits of the facts.
<P>
	I honestly believe that minority rights of any kind are not in 
danger. I am proud to tell the House that even long before I entered 
this hallowed Chamber, I participated actively in defence of French 
language rights in Manitoba when they were threatened in the early 
1980s.
<P>
	I have continued to advocate equity for all, for equal 
opportunities for people with disabilities, visible minorities, First 
Nations people and for women, for equity in our society. I will not 
stand idly by if minority rights are ever in peril.
<P>
	We shall not fear to be proud of our national shared values, 
heritage and traditions. We shall not fail to be proud of our 
Confederation's eminent standing in the world community. We 
shall not fear of our trust in each other as citizens of Canada. We 
shall not fear change when change promises a bright future for our 
children, our youth and our country. We shall not fear to face the 
coming 21st century with confidence, secure in our history, 
generosity and integrity as a people.
<P>
	Amending Term 17 is an appeal to our confidence and 
understanding as Canadians. It is a message that Confederation 
works. It is a message that our democracy is vibrant. It is a message 
that when we secure a bright future for one of our provinces, 
Newfoundland, its educational system, we secure a bright future 
for across Canada.
<P>
	The people of Newfoundland determined their future when their 
province entered Confederation in 1949. The people of 
Newfoundland today would like to determine their future in 
Canada as Canada enters the 21st century. Let us pass this 
resolution now before us, for greater certainty of the future of all of 
us.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Ind. Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the member stated in his eloquent address that 
there was a provision that uni-denominational schools may be 
created where numbers warrant and where the parents choose that 
for their children. The Minister of Justice made that same 
statement when he gave his address to the Chamber last Friday. 
That statement is not reflected in the constitutional amendment.
<P>
	The member spoke about this in his speech. Would he support an 
amendment to the current resolution that would include ``where 
numbers warrant''?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for his kind words. The will of the Newfoundland 
government to establish denominational schools for school 
children where the numbers warrant is within the legislative 
authority of the province. The federal government should not 
intrude on that legislative authority.
<P>
	The issue before us is a process where we will give the 
Government of Newfoundland the authority to proceed, consulting 
with her people from time to time. It is known that the numbers that 
will warrant today may not be the same numbers that will warrant 
tomorrow. Communities change.
<P>
	I was on a school board. I know at one time the number 36 would 
warrant and later on the number 17 would warrant. If we fix the 
number today we will imprison the possibility of change in the 
future and the possibility of the Newfoundland government to see 
the present, whatever the present is, and adjust to the particular 
moment for the greater benefit of her citizens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, if I 
understood the member correctly, he is saying that the current 
protection which exists in the Constitution for denominational 
schools is part of the ark of Confederation. Is he now saying that it 
is time for the national Chamber, the Government of Canada, the 
protector of enshrined rights such as these to walk away? Is that 
what the member is saying?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Madam Speaker, far from it. The Government 
of Canada has made it very clear that when minority rights are in 
danger it is ready to stand up and protect those rights.
<P>
	The resolution that is before us is to make it clear and respond 
positively to the request of one provincial government. It is a part 
of our fabric and a part of our Confederation. Of course certain 
rights will be limited in one way. Of course there will be no 
denominational school for one school child. However, we cannot 
use that specific example because what is at stake here is 
reasonableness and understanding. I believe that the people of 
Newfoundland have spoken by saying that they would like to 
reform the educational system for the greater good of their school 
children for today and tomorrow.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this debate to say a few words on a 
issue that is dear to my heart. By way of parading my credentials, I 
should inform the House that before coming here I was actively 
involved in education. I was a school principal and a school 
superintendent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3305"> 3305 </A></B>
<P>
	During the 1969 reorganization of education in the province 
which permitted the coming together of the integrated group, the 
Presbyterian, Salvation Army, Anglican and United, I was the 
president of the provincial teachers' organization and in that 
capacity I was actively involved in the negotiations which 
culminated in the 1969 Newfoundland schools act. Therefore, I 
have some familiarity with the issues which are at play here.
<P>
	I should also tell the House that in the Newfoundland 
referendum last September I voted no. It is not that I am opposed to 
reform of the educational process, I voted no because I had some 
concerns about how the question was put. I felt that it ought to have 
been put to each of the seven classes which would be affected by 
the change so we would know whether each of the classes, by 
majority, had opted to give up their rights pursuant to Term 17. 
That was not done and that was my reason for voting no.
<P>
	I am very supportive of the need for educational reform. I could 
tell the House many horror stories on the subject from personal, 
firsthand experience, which points to the urgency of what the 
Newfoundland government is trying to do in reforming the 
education system.
<P>
	Quite apart from the current economic bind in which every 
government finds itself, even in earlier times we saw some 
horrendous wastes of money in the name of denominational 
education. There were cases in which if one denomination received 
money for school construction, a constitutional obligation required 
the government to give a proportionate amount to the other 
denominations, whether they had a need for it or not. 
Newfoundland, in particular, could not afford that kind of 
duplication of expenditures.
<P>
	As I only have 10 minutes I want to stay as close as I can to the 
issue which we are debating today.
<P>
	I have had much correspondence on this issue from people 
throughout the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. I have 
heard the concerns of the many in Newfoundland who are opposed 
to the constitutional change. These concerns are based on the 
premise that the proposed change is a backward step, is a move 
away from a Christian education system. Those concerns, I believe, 
are honestly held. I not only respect them, I happen to be in 
complete sympathy with those concerns.
<P>
	Unfortunately, those concerns have been fueled and reinforced 
by misinformation and rhetoric in the province that the provincial 
government's real agenda is the creation of a God-less, secularized 
school system. I do not share that view. A fair reading of the 
amendment before us today will show that the church's role in 
education will continue and will be constitutionally protected.
<P>
	The issue here is who will run the schools. That is really the only 
issue in so far as Newfoundland is  concerned. I respect that some 
of my colleagues have other concerns about minority rights, 
language rights and aboriginal rights, which are matters that the 
Minister of Justice has addressed. I will stay with the issue that I 
know best as it relates to Newfoundland.
<P>
	I repeat that the issue, in my view, is who will run the schools. I 
thought the United Church of Newfoundland, one of the affected 
classes in so far as this amendment is concerned, put it very well a 
couple of weeks ago, on May 17, in a new release which read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have frequently and formally indicated our willingness to relinquish all 
administrative control of education in favour of a system in which the churches 
would retain solely the right to provide for religious education, activities and 
observances.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	This is a statement from the United Church but I think it could be 
echoed by some of the other denominations involved in this 
endeavour. That statement puts it very well.
<P>
	This exercise is not about secularizing the system. Indeed on 
reading the amendment it is very clear on that particular point that 
all seven churches will continue to have rights and will be able to 
exercise those rights. To that extent the amendment is once again 
enshrining and continuing the constitutional protection afforded 
those churches in 1949 when Newfoundland joined Canada.
<P>
	The real issue is who will run the schools. I have always believed 
that when we are spending public money whether it be on 
education, health, road construction or whatever, there ought to be 
a system of direct accountability to the people who pay the bills. It 
is the people of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador who 
pay the education bills, not the churches. The people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador pay the bills.
<P>
	I do not have to explain the system of accountability. We have 
the same system. We are part of the British parliamentary system as 
is Newfoundland. The system is simple: A group of people is 
elected; a government is formed; it brings in a budget and it has to 
get that budget sustained in the House of assembly of that province. 
Part of that budget is the education expenditure, how the money 
will be disbursed to improve the education in that province.
<P>
	Given our tradition in this House, and in Newfoundland as well, 
it is absolutely axiomatic that the people who pay the piper should 
call the tune. The electors of the province ought to have the final 
say as to the disbursement of funds for education. That is what the 
amendment is all about. It takes the governance, the running of the 
schools, out of the hands of the churches as provided in the current 
term 17 prior to the proposed amendment. It takes the governance 
out of the hands of the churches and puts it into the hands of 
government. I believe that is where it belongs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3306"> 3306 </A></B>
<P>
	I made reference earlier that I could tell some horror stories on 
this issue. Most of them would have to do with that particular 
issue, that when it came down to a government wanting to exercise 
its judgment and accountability to the people on issues relating 
to education expenditure in Newfoundland, its hands were always 
tied because there was a constitutional provision which prevented 
it from doing that.
<P>
	This amendment will do two things, both of which are positive. 
It will put the governance of Newfoundland schools into the hands 
of the elected which is where it belongs in the first place. I could go 
through a long history lesson going back to 1723 when the churches 
established the first schools and why it did not evolve that way. In 
the late 1880s when it was enshrined in legislation the die was cast. 
The evolution had been such that no politicians worth their salt 
would rush in and change what was a working system.
<P>
	The system has not been working as well in recent times. I only 
have 10 minutes. If I had two or three hours I could spend a fair 
amount of it talking about the contribution the churches have made 
to education in Newfoundland. That is not what this debate is 
about. This issue does not have anything to do with railroading or 
denigrating the churches. That is not the issue.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	I am a product of that system. The precursor of the integrated 
system in Newfoundland was the so-called amalgamated system. 
My elementary years were spent in the amalgamated system. My 
final year of high school was in the Salvation Army system. I 
taught and was a principal in a Salvation Army school. I was a 
principal in an amalgamated school and in a new integrated school. 
In terms of education and career, I am a product of that system. I 
could wax long and hard about the contribution the system has 
made.
<P>
	That brings me to my second point. This amendment does two 
things. It puts the governance of the schools into the hands of the 
government, the people of the province, which is where it belongs. 
The other is it continues the church involvement, which has made 
such a marvellous contribution to education and the enshrinement 
and promotion of values in Newfoundland over two and one-half 
centuries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Ind. Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to listen to my friend from 
Burin-St. George's. I want to seek clarification of a remark he 
made, that the person who pays the piper calls the tune. In other 
words, if I understood the member correctly, it was to let the 
legislators call the shots on how the schools will be run.
<P>
	If the member was speaking in terms of efficiency, school 
construction so that there is no duplication, creating a central 
construction authority for maximizing economic efficiencies, I do 
not have any problem with  that. I was not sure if he was suggesting 
that the values in a Catholic or Christian education would be 
something he would relegate to the person who signs the cheques. I 
have always held the view that there is a different ambience 
between a Catholic education and a public education.
<P>
	Perhaps the member could elaborate on that. I was beginning to 
think he was suggesting that legislators basically call the program 
for all forms of education in the province of Newfoundland. I was 
not sure if that is exactly what he meant.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from 
Broadview-Greenwood for his question. I have to say to him that 
I liked it better when he was here over my left shoulder and I could 
consult with him more often, however, I am happy to see him in the 
House.
<P>
	I do not think the member disagrees with my phrase that who 
pays the piper should call the tune, that is to say the taxpayers, not 
the legislators. The legislators are only there on behalf of the 
people of Newfoundland. When I mentioned the person paying the 
piper, I meant the people of the province, the electorate, generally. 
They have spoken on the issue. They spoke in a referendum on it. 
They spoke in the February 22 election. Mr. Tobin made it clear in 
his platform that he would proceed with educational reform. There 
is no question about the province as a whole.
<P>
	If the member wants to know if I am being politically safe on 
this one, a majority of the people in my riding voted in the 
referendum for this change. Quite apart from that, I did not get into 
what was politically safe. In my speech I got into what I felt was 
the right thing to do.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	To respond more directly to the hon. member's question, under 
this system, under the proposed amendment, what has happened in 
Newfoundland for two and one-half centuries will continue. There 
will be a partnership on the program issue. Some of the program 
content does not have much requirement in terms of value systems. 
I am not sure how one can teach math with a religious bias, for 
example. The churches have always had and will continue to have 
under this amendment a partnership role with the legislature, with 
the Government of Newfoundland in terms of program which is 
pretty clear in the amendment. It says so very clearly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
during the course of this debate a number of concerns have been 
raised about the proposed amendment to term 17 which this House 
is considering. Although it would be possible to speak about the 
benefits of the reforms proposed by the Government of 
Newfoundland, as many of my colleagues have done, I will take 
this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3307"> 3307 </A></B>
<P>
opportunity to briefly address some of the  concerns that have been 
voiced about proceeding with the resolution.
<P>
	One of the concerns that has been raised is that this House is 
merely acting as a rubber stamp regarding the request of the 
Government of Newfoundland to adopt this resolution. It is very 
important to note this is not the case. Several of my colleagues 
have already noted that the proposed amendment to term 17 is 
needed to allow the Government of Newfoundland to modernize its 
educational system and to eliminate costly duplications that 
currently exist. For this reason the Newfoundland House of 
Assembly adopted its own resolution to amend term 17 of the terms 
of union on October 31, 1995.
<P>
	Because this is an amendment to the Constitution of Canada, 
Newfoundland cannot act alone in this matter. Section 43 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982 requires that amendments of this sort, those 
that relate to constitutional provisions that apply to one or more but 
not all provinces can only be made where both the relevant 
provincial legislatures and the Parliament of Canada authorize such 
amendments. In the present case this means that even though the 
Newfoundland House of Assembly has already passed its own 
resolution authorizing this amendment, this House must also adopt 
a resolution authorizing the Governor General to issue a 
proclamation under the Great Seal of Canada.
<P>
	Even though the Government of Newfoundland has requested 
that we adopt this resolution, it is important to note that this House 
does not play the role of a rubber stamp during this process. 
Instead, it is the role and indeed the responsibility of this House 
and each member of it to carefully consider the proposed 
amendments and form an independent judgment before deciding 
whether to authorize a resolution approving it.
<P>
	In this instance the government has carefully examined the 
proposed amendment on its merits and is satisfied that the changes 
sought by the Newfoundland House of Assembly should go 
forward. The factors that were taken into account by the federal 
government when forming this judgment were eloquently set forth 
by the Minister of Justice when he introduced this resolution in the 
first place.
<P>
	Another concern that has been raised is that the proposed 
amendment to term 17 will mean the end of religious education in 
Newfoundland. Again it is very important to note this is not the 
case. It becomes clear from a reading of the proposed amendment 
that religious education will remain an important feature of the 
school system in Newfoundland and that the churches will continue 
to play an important role in the school system there.
<P>
	I will briefly review the amendment to show that it makes 
provision for the continuance of religious education, activities and 
observances. Paragraph (a) of the proposed amendment, which 
provides that all publicly funded schools shall be denominational 
schools,  provides that all the denominational classes that now have 
rights under term 17 shall continue to have the right to provide for 
religious education, activities and observances for the children of 
that class.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	In essence this means that under the new system children of 
different denominations who live in the same neighbourhood 
would all attend the same neighbourhood school instead of 
different denominational schools. However, pursuant to paragraph 
(a) the denominational classes that currently have rights under term 
17 will continue to have the right to provide for the religious 
education, activities and observances for the children of that class 
who attend these interdenominational neighbourhood schools.
<P>
	In addition to these interdenominational schools in which 
religious education and activities will continue, paragraph (b)(i) of 
the amendment reserves the right to publicly funded 
unidenominational schools. These unidenominational schools will 
be established and maintained for each denomination whose 
members currently have rights under the present term 17, subject to 
provincial legislation uniformly applicable to all schools.
<P>
	Further, paragraph (c) of the proposed amendment specifically 
provides that where a unidenominational school is permitted the 
class of persons it serves shall continue to have the right to provide 
for religious education activities and observances. In addition they 
shall have the right to direct the teaching of aspects of the 
curriculum reflecting a religious belief, student admission policy 
and the assignment and dismissal of teachers in that school.
<P>
	Paragraph (e) of the proposed amendment provides that 
denominations will still have the right to participate in school 
management. For example, this paragraph gives denominational 
classes with rights the right to elect in total not less than two-thirds 
of the members of a school board, with this total to be 
proportionately divided among classes in each school board's 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	It is clear, therefore, the amendment does not do away with 
religious education in the classroom. Religious education will 
remain a significant feature of the Newfoundland school system.
<P>
	Another concern has been raised that the proposed amendment to 
term 17 is a case in which minority rights are being taken away by 
the majority. Once again, this is not the case. As the Minister of 
Justice has already indicated, this is not an instance in which 
minority rights are being adversely affected by the majority.
<P>
	In this respect it is important to understand that there is no 
majority denomination in Newfoundland. Instead, term 17 
constitutionally entrenches denominational rights for seven 
different denominations. Thus, unlike every other province, all 
publicly funded schools in  Newfoundland are denominational. As 
a result term 17 is unlike constitutional provisions relating to 
education for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3308"> 3308 </A></B>
<P>
the other provinces, for term 17 guarantees rights to several 
different minority groups which together comprise over 95 per cent 
of the province's population.
<P>
	In short, unlike the other provinces, there is no majority 
denomination in Newfoundland. This means each of the seven 
denominations is affected equally by the proposed change and no 
minorities are being singled out for discriminatory treatment. This 
is an important factor which distinguishes Newfoundland from 
other provinces and must be taken into account when considering 
the proposed amendment.
<P>
	Another concern is the proposed amendment to term 17 will 
diminish minority rights in other provinces or set a legal precedent 
for the removal of such rights. Once again, it is important to note 
this is not so. To begin with, the amendments will apply only in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. This means the amendment will not 
affect rights in other province whether they are official language 
minority rights or denominational school rights.
<P>
	For example, French language, minority language education 
rights are protected by section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms, and nothing in this amendment will diminish that 
protection. Furthermore, the proposed amendment does not in any 
way affect the constitutionally protected rights of aboriginal 
peoples. Aboriginal and treaty rights are constitutionally protected 
by section 25 of the charter and section 35 of the Constitution Act, 
1982. Nothing in this amendment will diminish that protection.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The government takes both its role and its responsibilities in the 
constitutional amending process very seriously. The government 
has carefully considered the proposed amendment and has decided 
that on its merits it deserves to be adopted by the House.
<P>
	As a result, I encourage members of the House to join with me in 
voting in favour of this resolution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the Bloc Quebecois supports the motion in regard to the 
referendum held in Newfoundland because a majority of 
Newfoundlanders voted in favour of this change. Also because the 
motion does not violate the rights of minorities, since a majority of 
Newfoundlanders voted on an issue concerning all religious 
denominations that have schools in the province. What this means 
essentially is that a majority of people have given themselves the 
right to make changes in the education system that will benefit 
Newfoundland, since the province will save some $7 million by 
having only one school system instead of four, and by having only 
four school boards, instead of 27.
<P>
	As regards religious rights, the hon. member for Central Nova 
rightly pointed out that the rights of religious denominations will 
not be violated, on the contrary. Following the change made 
through term 17, religious denominations will be able to exercise 
their religious rights in any school, the only difference being that 
the schools will be multiconfessional, instead of having religious 
groups controlling them.
<P>
	I personally feel that the control of schools by the Church is a 
thing of the past. It is time for schools to be under secular control, 
thus allowing the various religious communities to fulfil their role 
and teach religion.
<P>
	In this regard the proposed change to the motion concerning 
schools in Newfoundland is a good one. Some members alluded to 
section 93 of the Canadian constitution, which is supposed to 
protect denominational rights throughout the country.
<P>
	Let me do a brief historical outline. Madam Speaker, section 93 
was not complied with by your province. In New Brunswick, all 
French speaking schools were abolished in 1871, because the 
province had not complied with section 93, a situation which was 
corrected almost a century later. The same happened in most 
Canadian provinces, including Manitoba and Ontario. At the turn 
of the century, not complying with section 93 was the way used to 
abolish the rights of the French speaking minority.
<P>
	Today, when we talk about the Canadian Constitution, we are 
told: ``We respect the Constitution, we respect section 93''. This 
was not always the case.
<P>
	What hurts about this motion is that Newfoundland again is not 
complying with the Canadian constitution. This time it is not in 
regard to section 93, but section 23 of the 1982 charter. This is a 
very recent provision; it dates back only 14 years. Newfoundland is 
among those Canadian provinces that do not comply with the 
Constitution, which is supposed to be the supreme law of a 
bilingual Canada.
<P>
	Newfoundland is among the four provinces that, to this day, do 
not comply with this modern charter, along with Ontario, Nova 
Scotia and British Columbia.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Section 23 of the Canadian charter of rights is of the utmost 
importance, and even essential. It is essential to the bilingual 
dimension of Canada, because the whole future of French speaking 
and Acadian minorities in Canada rests on section 23, which 
guarantees French speaking minorities in Canada a legal right to 
control their own schools. I repeat that four provinces in Canada 
still do not comply with this section of the Canadian Constitution, 
Newfoundland being one of them.
<P>
	Obviously, this is not directly linked to term 17 before us today. 
Section 23 of the charter is quite distinct, but the fact of the matter 
is they are related. When one  considers term 17, one wonders 
about Mr. Tobin, the premier of Newfoundland, also known as 
Captain Canada. Is he going to abide by the Canadian Constitution 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3309"> 3309 </A></B>
<P>
and grant French speaking citizens of his province the right and the 
power to control their school boards. This is a matter for concern, 
because in the past Newfoundland did notre really demonstrate a 
great deal of good faith in this matter. British Columbia and a few 
other provinces are no better.
<P>
	The charter was enacted in 1982. A judgment by the Supreme 
Court of Alberta has clarified section 23. It said that French 
speaking minorities in Canada have the right to control their school 
boards. An appeal was made to the Supreme Court of Canada, the 
highest court in the land. In 1990, the Supreme Court confirmed 
that, under section 23, French speaking Canadians have the right to 
manage their own schools.
<P>
	But not a word was heard from Newfoundland. This is an 
opportunity for Brian Tobin, Captain Canada, to grant French 
speaking citizens in his province the right to control their own 
schools, which he has not done yet. I will explain later that the past 
is probably an indication of what the future holds. The same thing 
happened with his predecessor, Mr. Wells, who made all kinds of 
promises but never delivered.
<P>
	The worst of it all is that the Prime Minister, who claims to be 
the champion of French speaking Canadians' rights, did not say a 
word about this issue. He did not say to Brian Tobin: ``Listen, 
Brian, let us make a deal. I will enact term 17, but you are going to 
comply with section 23 of the Constitution''. This is the 
responsibility of the Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, you have ten minutes remaining. 
If you wish, you may continue after question period, but as it will 
soon be 2.00 p.m., we will now proceed to members' statements.

	It seems a little odd that even a separatist government in Quebec

allowed trade barriers to build which cost Canadians between $6 
billion and $10 billion a year when the Canadian Constitution 
clearly states that it is the obligation of the federal government to 
make sure this does not happen.
<P>

same as it was last year, stop the cuts to health and social programs.
<P>
	In 1991 Statistics Canada reported that federal spending on 
social programs accounted for only 6 per cent of the federal debt. 
Tax breaks to profitable corporations and high interest rate policies

	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
a long time provincial governments have been requesting greater 
responsibility in labour market development. The government has 
now responded.
<P>
	Last week it sent the provinces and territories a proposal that 
offers them responsibility for active employment measures funded 
through the employment insurance account. It offers them the 
opportunity to deliver measures such as wage subsidies, income 
supplements and partnerships for job creation, and the chance to 
provide labour market services such as screening for employment 
programs and employment counselling.
<P>
	About $2 billion worth of programs and services have been put 
on the table. Canadians will benefit from the new labour market 
arrangements because they will more closely reflect local and 
regional labour needs and will eliminate unnecessary duplication 
between governments.

	<B>Mrs. Bonnie Hickey (St. John's East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, June 
1 to 9 is National Safe Boating Week in Canada. Boating and other 
water activities are fun and exciting but are very dangerous. Every 
year over 200 Canadians lose their lives in boating incidents and 
more than 50 per cent of all search and rescue incidents involve 
pleasure craft.
<P>
	This week the Canadian Safe Boating Council, in partnership 
with local supporters and the Canadian Coast Guard, is taking the 
safe boating message to communities across the country. This 
year's theme is to warn the dangers of ``drinking and boating'' and 
the failure to wear life jackets. It is alarming that over 40 per cent 
of power boat drowning victims have a blood alcohol level above 
the legal limit and that in over 90 per cent of all boating deaths, life 
jackets are not worn.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	Drinking and boating is just as illegal as drinking and driving. 
Yet the trend to have alcohol on board continues. Each and every 
boater has a responsibility to enrol in a safe boating course, check 
the motor, ensure a full tank of gas and, most important, to have 
enough life jackets on board and to stay sober.
<P>
	This message is clear. Take the time to boat safe. Make boating a 
fun and enjoyable pastime for all.

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are fed up with the Young Offenders Act and its failure 
to deal with young criminals, and the Reform Party has been 
listening.
<P>
	It is the Reform Party's policy to refer 16 and 17-year-olds to 
adult court, to lower the age of those who could be charged to 10 
years, and to publish the names of those who are convicted. We 
also believe that parents should be held responsible when it is 
proven that they contributed to the young offender's actions.
<P>
	Reform's planned amendments have the support of thousands of 
Canadians, including the attorney general of Ontario.
<P>
	If the Minister of Justice had accepted Reform's policy when we 
urged him to do so, an 11-year old suspected rapist in Toronto could

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Human Resources Development made his 
proposal for reorganizing the manpower sector public last week.
<P>
	Negotiations will be conducted with the provincial governments 
to reach agreements reflecting the aims of the various Canadian 
provinces. The minister also confirmed that a number of 
departments in the federal government are involved in the area of 
manpower training.
<P>
	Could the minister confirm that the training programs 
administered by departments other than his own will be included in 
his negotiations with the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, clearly the aim of the 
Government of Canada is to ensure arrangements are made to 
ensure these programs are managed effectively and by those in the 
best position to do so.
<P>
	I would like to assure the hon. Leader of the Opposition that we 
fully intend to act on the proposal we made to the provinces 
whereby the Government of Canada would co-operate in every way 
possible with the provinces, as the provinces wish. However, I have 
no doubt that, once discussions are underway, there will be little 
that is not on the table in the context of the question raised by the 
hon. Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would ask the minister if he is prepared to table in this 
House a list of all the training programs the federal government 
currently administers that come under other departments and that 
will likely be under negotiation or discussion with the provincial 
governments.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are in fact trying to identify 
throughout the operations of the Government of Canada items that 
would be of interest in discussions with the provinces, however, I 
must tell you we have to be careful. The mandate of the Minister of 
Human Resources Development is limited. I do not want to walk on 
my colleagues' toes, but we will try to do our level best to be sure 
to meet our commitment to show once again that Canadian 
federalism is flexible and that it works.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like the minister to table this list, in any case. We 
would be interested in reading it, because we know there are a huge 
number of programs, which require our attention.
<P>
	Would the minister tell us, by way of example, whether the 
proposed $315 million he announced this spring to help young 
people find jobs will be included in the negotiations between 
Ottawa and the provinces wanting it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously, we want to continue 
to ensure that young people and others affected by the operations of 
my department will continue to receive the services they need 
during this transition period.
<P>
	Obviously, for this year, at least in the next few months, we will 
have to continue to manage these programs. Clearly, however, we 
are prepared to put on the table all the items we proposed and were 
prepared to negotiate with the provinces, depending on the point in 
time negotiations are concluded and on the content of the 
agreements.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
who tells us that he will do everything in his power to ensure that 
all the programs are subject to negotiation. I would like to tell him 
that we will see to it. We will see to it that he does not step on his 
colleagues' toes and that his actions are not interpreted in such a 
manner.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	If everything is subject to negotiation, can the minister confirm 
that the Council for Canadian Unity, which is currently managing 
the Experience Canada program, will no longer be responsible for 
this training program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to guess as to what 
the outcome of all these negotiations will be. However, with regard 
to the Experience Canada program, we do have other partners, 
including some major stakeholders from the private sector.
<P>
	For now, we expect to remain responsible for the management of 
these programs. As I told the Leader of the Opposition, if 
agreements are reached with some provinces that accept everything 
we have to offer at the negotiation table, we will, of course, respect 
those agreements.
<P>
	I am convinced that, in some cases, in some provinces, for 
whatever reason, maybe because they do not have the network or 
the resources needed to deliver these programs, we will still want 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3314"> 3314 </A></B>
<P>
the private sector or other  organizations to get involved, including 
the Council for Canadian Unity.
<P>
	I want to stress the fact that, for the provinces that have the 
capacity or the willingness to take on responsibility for the 
management of these kinds of programs, then, of course, the 
programs will be managed pursuant to the agreement reached 
during the bilateral negotiations.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, another 
issue worth following.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that, upon the completion of these 
negotiations, which do not need to last three years, some youth 
training programs will end up with no funding?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
</B><B>Development, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker, but I can tell the House that, 
in many cases, the money will come from the employment 
insurance account. The consolidated fund is used to finance other 
programs. Also, many of the programs are implemented for a 
specific length of time, whether it is one, two or three years. That is 
certainly the case for some of the youth programs that, even before 
we released our proposal last week, had a deadline.
<P>
	We will not change our minds at this point and say that we will 
extend them. If, for some reason, we have to transfer to the 
provinces some of the funds already provided for in the estimates 
or the budget, then we will certainly be ready to negotiate these 
payments.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
questions are for the justice minister.
<P>
	Ontario is introducing legislation holding parents financially 
responsible for crimes committed by their children. It also wants 
the federal government to act on its recommendation of 
prosecuting children under 12 for violent crimes. Canadians, I 
believe, think this is a good idea. It has been part of Reform Party 
policy for years.
<P>
	I guess what we really need to know is where the justice minister 
stands on such ideas. Will he change the Young Offenders Act so 
parents are held financially responsible for their children's actions 
and young offenders under 12 are held legally responsible for 
violent crimes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I consider it my first obligation to 
show sufficient respect for the procedures of the House and its 
committees to await the report of the Standing Committee on 
Justice.
<P>
	This week the committee is holding hearings in Toronto. It is 
before that committee that the ministers of the Ontario government 
have expressed the position summarized by my hon. friend.
<P>
	I have asked the committee to report back this year with 
recommendations on changes to the Young Offenders Act, 
including the age of those persons caught by the act, including the 
range of penalties and including the broader question as to whether 
the Young Offenders Act represents the best approach to juvenile 
justice. I have asked the committee to take an open minded and 
comprehensive look at the whole system. Out of respect for the 
committee and its work, we will listen to those recommendations, 
we will act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has been in place now for three years. It will be well 
into year four by the time action, if any, does come.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	People in Toronto are wondering how much more consultation 
there will be. They already know that four out of ten robberies last 
year were committed by juveniles, double what it was ten short 
years ago. It looks like the Ontario government is taking action 
fast, not slow like this government.
<P>
	Does the justice minister agree with the attorney general of 
Ontario that if 16-year-olds can drive, if they can get married, if 
they can have families and if they have the moral capacity to 
understand the consequences of their actions they should be held 
much more accountable when they go wrong?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask the hon. member to approach 
with caution the proclamations made by ministers in Ontario. They 
are doing what they do best, talking tough about crime and pointing 
the finger at another level of government.
<P>
	The reality is if the Government of Ontario had followed through 
on the provincial obligations under the administration of the Young 
Offenders Act it would be working a lot better than it is today.
<P>
	In so far as the hon. member's question is concerned with respect 
to the age of those to whom the act applies, I will await the 
recommendations of the committee. I have asked it to look at the 
evidence, not the rhetoric, not the politicians. I have asked it to 
look at the evidence and come back with recommendations on what 
ages the act should apply to. I have already told the House we will 
pay attention to those recommendations.
<P>
	I want the hon. member to recall that it is this minister of this 
government who, in Bill C-37, proposed changes to the Young 
Offenders Act which would mean that 16 and 17-year-olds who are 
charged with crimes of most  serious violence would be tried in 
adult court. Those members voted against the changes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3315"> 3315 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
reality of the situation with regard to the Young Offenders Act is 
the government has done diddly squat in three years about it. Not 
only are youth crimes increasing, they are getting much more 
violent in nature. What worries Canadians is that kids are getting 
tougher and tougher and the law makers in Ottawa are getting 
softer and softer.
<P>
	I recently watched two young offenders in a courtroom laughing 
at the judge and at the victims. It is no wonder; the Young 
Offenders Act is woefully lacking.
<P>
	Since we all know younger kids look to older kids for their cues 
in life, will the justice minister tell us what specifically he intends 
to do to send a message to those under the age of 12, who are 
kicking sand in the justice minister's face, that the government will 
not be bullied and that it will be tough on those kids?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understood the hon. member to 
say the government has done nothing about young offenders. I 
believe the hon. member did not complete his sentence. Surely 
what he meant to say is that we have done nothing about the Young 
Offenders Act that he has supported.
<P>
	In Bill C-37 we made important changes to the Young Offenders 
Act which strengthened it, particularly in relation to violent crime. 
It will stand on the record of Parliament for the people of Canada to 
remember in the next election that the party opposite did not 
support those measures.
<P>
	In so far as those under 12 are concerned, I have asked the 
committee expressly to look at that issue. I have given it a variety 
of models to consider. I have asked it to consult, to listen to the 
experts, to look at the evidence and to come back with 
recommendations.
<P>
	In so far as the safety of the public is concerned, the hon. 
member, like so many of his colleagues from day to day, seems to 
think we can make the streets safer or solve the problems of violent 
crime simply by amending words in a statute sitting on a shelf in a 
room somewhere in Ottawa. If we are to do anything about crime 
we have to follow the strategy the government has in place which is 
not only to have a strong criminal law but to follow through on 
crime prevention.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The Canada employment centres restructuring plan involves 
incomprehensible decisions. Such is the case for Granby, 
Trois-Rivières, the Gaspé Peninsula, and others.
<P>
	In light of the fact that the federal government has just tabled its 
proposals in the area of manpower, will the minister not recognize 
that it would be wiser to suspend the relocation of employment 
centres pending the negotiation of an agreement with Quebec since 
it could likely result in a reorganization of services?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, there are always decisions that 
are difficult to make. As the member knows, the Canadian 
government still intends to pay employment insurance benefits to 
the beneficiaries of that program in the years to come.
<P>
	However, we have also made a commitment in the budget and 
said repeatedly that we had to be efficient and try to do things in the 
most intelligent way possible. That is not easy. There are always 
people who are unhappy when we have to relocate offices or to 
downsize, but, in the end, the important thing is that we must be 
able to provide services to our clients in all the regions, and we are 
confident that it is always the case.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, here is 
my supplementary.
<P>
	Beyond all these artificial arguments that he may put forward, 
will the minister not admit that the basic principles of good 
management require that he put this reorganization on hold since 
employment centres will eventually fall under the jurisdiction of 
the Quebec government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, one of the concepts we have 
found very attractive in the discussions we have had for months and 
even years is the single window concept, a way to work together in 
co-operation.
<P>
	We do not intend to impose anything on the Government of 
Quebec regarding the way it would want to manage the aspects of 
the employment insurance program that would fall under its 
jurisdiction. However, I am also convinced that, in this same spirit 
of co-operation, the Quebec government would not want to impose 
anything on us with regard to our part of the program.

people involved, look at the record and make a report. I have 
already said I will put that report before Parliament. Third, the last 
thing in the world anybody in justice wants to do is jeopardize the 
three revocation cases before the court. We have already asked the 
court not to stay them, notwithstanding anything that may have 
happened in this matter because there is no connection between the 
two. That matter has been argued and is under reserve in the federal 
court.

he puts his position and at least adhere to what is already on the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
clearly the justice minister thinks he can distance himself from Ted 
Thompson. He thinks he can duck his responsibility for judicial 
tampering, and that is not good enough. Either the justice minister 
was not aware of Thompson's activities, in which case he is 
incompetent or has lost control of his ministry, or the minister has a 
vested interest in not being aware-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I as the hon. member to put his question 
forthwith.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, why is the minister disguising the 
glaring truth that Thompson's interference with a judge must have 
been made with the consent of the justice minister?
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no amount of emotive language, no 
accusatory tone and no misstatement of the facts will be sufficient 
to overcome the simple facts of this matter.
<P>
	The simple facts which confront the hon. member are these. Mr. 
Ted Thompson went to see the chief justice. He followed up with 
correspondence to which the chief justice responded. That 
correspondence was put into the hands of counsel for the three 
parties in the revocation  cases as soon as it came to the notice of 
the officials of the justice department. A motion was then brought 
before the court. That motion resulted in an argument and judgment 
has been reserved.
<P>
	In the meantime I have taken steps through the appointment of a 
third party with an impeccable reputation to look at the facts and 
make a report which I will put before the House.
<P>
	Those are the facts and the hon. member should pay attention to 
those facts before holding forth here for narrow partisan purposes.

Speaker, the new premier of British Columbia, Glen Clark, clearly 
indicated that he is strongly opposed to the GST harmonization 
agreement between the Canadian government and the maritime 
provinces. Consequently, British Columbia joins with Quebec, 
Ontario and Alberta to oppose this partisan political agreement.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance finally recognize that his GST 
harmonization project, including the payment of almost $1 billion 
in political compensation to the maritime provinces, is 
unacceptable to a majority of Canadians, as was indicated to him 
by the premiers of the four most densely populated provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member is well aware, the compensation is paid to the 
Atlantic Provinces for a transition period, which will expire four 
years from now. It is shared among these provinces and is part of a 
basic overhaul of the way these regional economies will manage 
the future.

implementing megaprojects or making politics the way things were

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr.

Canada rejected it out of hand.

for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	For weeks now the minister has been denying he was cutting the 
B.C. salmon fleet in half so that he could reallocated fish to natives. 
Now we know the truth.
<P>
	Yesterday while a commercial fleet remained tied up the 
minister allowed a native only commercial fishery to begin in the 
Alberni Canal. Why has the minister consistently denied cutting 
the fleet to free up fish for natives when this is precisely what 
happened this weekend?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is incredible the hon. member would put a question 
like that to the House.
<P>
	The salmon revitalization plan was addressed to revitalize the 
commercial fishing industry in British Columbia, and it is doing 
exactly that. We do not have the final figures yet.
<P>
	With regard to the aboriginal fishery, there is no intent 
whatsoever to do anything with the Pacific salmon revitalization 
plan other than to revitalize the industry. Any other motive the hon. 
member or his party would want to attribute to it I think is totally 
wrong and despicable.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the intent of the 
minister's actions is quite clear. What is also clear is that on May 
17 the minister's own department said there were not enough fish 
for commercial harvest in the Alberni inlet. Two weeks later there 
are enough fish for 14 days of almost continuous native fishing.
<P>
	B.C. fishermen have long suspected that the minister does not 
give a hoot about them or the fish. Now they can be sure of it. Why 
are the livelihoods of B.C. fishermen and the very fish they rely on 
being sacrificed to make way for an expanded native only fishery?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, what is clear to this House is that the hon. member is 
trying to cloud the issues with total irrelevancies and with 
statements that really do not stand the test at all of what is going on.
<P>
	His suggestion that this government would put forward a plan to 
favour one sector of the fishery over the other flies in the face of 
the facts. Despite his party's intonations, we have two honourable 
gentleman who have a lot of credibility in the industry who are 
looking into the allocation, intersectoral and intrasectoral.
<P>

<P>
	Last Friday, when replying to questions to the government about 
the concentration of ownership of the newspapers, the Secretary of 
State for the Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec 
simply used the Competition Act as an excuse to justify the 
government's inaction.
<P>
	Given that one corporation could take over almost 70 per cent of 
all newspapers in Canada, what is the Minister of Industry planning 
to do to ensure some balance between financial interests and the 
right to public information?

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the

Speaker, this is a strange formulation for a question. While the hon. 
member suggests that the answer provided on Friday was hiding 
behind the Competition Act, I would suggest to her it is the 
Competition Act within which we would find our powers and our 
ability to act, if it were so desired.
<P>
	The balance she suggests, which indeed may be one in favour of 
which she can argue, is not a balance which is found within the 
Competition Act itself. If she reads the law itself she will find that 
the Competition Act, based on the decisions of the courts, deals 
with the economic interests and the concentration of ownership as 
it would impact on competition, within the framework of the 
business of newspaper publishing in this case.
<P>
	Content itself is not a factor which the director of investigation 
research in the competition bureau is capable of considering.

<P>
	Under what authority does the hon. member suggest we should 
act? I suggest to her there is no authority in the Competition Act for 
us to consider the implications with respect to editorial content or 
journalistic opinion arising from this transaction. There are issues 
related to economic concentration and the director will look at 
those.
<P>
	Does she really think governments should decide whether or not

not only in the province of Quebec but across the country.
<P>

comes forward. We will be in a position to move one way, 
positively or negatively, with regard to the regulation.
<P>
	Let it be clear that there is no banning of any raw milk cheese 
products in the province of Quebec or elsewhere in the country. 
This is a regulation which has been gazetted. Meaningful

initiates or conducts such investigations. However, it does have

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today is the first day of a special week for all Canadians. 
This is a time when we are asked to reflect upon and take action to 
prevent the accidents in the workplace which are still claiming too 
many victims.
<P>
	For the tenth consecutive year, we are celebrating Canadian 
Occupational Health and Safety Week, the theme for which this 
year is ``Training-Target Zero Accidents''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The issue of safety and health of millions of workers in our 
country is of primary importance. Is it acceptable that each year 
some 700 people lose their lives at work? Should we accept that 
nearly 800,000 persons are injured or mutilated as a result of 
accidents that occur in their workplace?
<P>
	Should we not be shocked to learn that 15 million working days 
are lost as a result of accidents? Should we accept that the Canadian 
economy supports as much as $10 billion compensation for such 
accidents?
<P>
	These figures trouble me deeply. Beyond those cold statistics, 
there is much suffering, the suffering of persons who are sick or 
injured, the suffering of their families, the terrible grief of the 
families that have lost a loved one in tragic circumstances.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	This concerns me very directly. My responsibilities include the 
safety and health of nearly one million Canadian workers, one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3322"> 3322 </A></B>
<P>
million Canadian men and women. It is my responsibility to ensure 
acts and  regulations governing employees under federal 
jurisdiction are respected. I intend to do everything in my power to 
make sure they are.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, these rules alone cannot guarantee workplace safety. 
At most, they provide a framework. The solution can be found in 
two words: training and information. The situation will improve 
only if each worker, each employer assumes his or her own 
responsibilities in this regard.
<P>
	In addition, I know that my officials put time and energy into 
providing assistance and information to people in their workplaces. 
They also provide a great deal of training aimed at eliminating the 
causes of accidents. Moreover, I know that their provincial 
colleagues do the same.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is not enough. It will never be enough. I repeat, 
occupational health and safety are ultimately the responsibility of 
each person who has a role to play in the workplace. That includes 
all members of Parliament.
<P>
	It is impossible to ensure constantly that a worker wears his hard 
hat or protective eye wear if he is not aware of the importance of 
doing so. It is impossible to force employers to personally and 
constantly oversee the safety of their employees. Employers and 
employees must accomplish this task together. They can be given 
information, trained and brought back into line, but it will never be 
possible for any government organization to do everything in this 
regard.
<P>
	The jobs of many employees are threatened and they sometimes 
take unnecessary risks for fear of losing their job. What a paradox.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Employers, for their part, are facing increasingly fierce 
competition. They fall prey to the temptation to Ignore safety rules, 
in order to speed up the work and save money. This is human, but 
still unacceptable regardless of the economic environment.
<P>
	I know that, like me, the hon. members of this House cannot help 
but be moved by the scope of this drama that is being played out in 
our workplaces. One in fifteen workers is injured each year. On 
average, there are two occupational accidents every minute. We 
must do all we can to improve this sad record.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank you, as well as my colleagues, for 
the role they will be playing this week and all year round in saving 
lives and preventing accidents so that our workers can be safe in 
their workplaces.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
invite my colleagues to reflect on the tragic situation of so many 
workers whose life totally changed one day, when they had an 
accident in the workplace or they  learned they were permanently 
and irrevocably affected by a work-related illness.
<P>
	How many people have experienced real dramas, not only in 
personal physical and moral suffering, but also in suffering because 
of the divisions this may have caused afterwards in their family, 
over and above the impoverishment and the battles fought, often 
with the system? Yes, we must state firmly that accidents in the 
workplace and industrial illnesses must be vigorously fought.
<P>
	History has shown us that only legislation could effectively give 
the basic framework, but this legislation does not reach all workers.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	There are not enough inspectors and businesses may not know 
how very quickly an accident can happen or how much a gas, heat 
and stress can cause irreversible damage to many people.
<P>
	Experience has shown the only effective way to fight the effects 
of laxness is to give the workers themselves, in co-operation with 
businesses, the instruments needed to control their own workplace. 
This then implies they have the means to know if their workplace is 
bad for their health, something we do not talk about enough, and 
also the means to change what is dangerous in the workplace.
<P>
	Having long worked in this area, I have trouble accepting that 
responsibility is being put on the workers. I think that, over the 
years, tribunals and courts have been clear about businesses' 
responsibility. When a business hires someone to ask him to do a 
job it benefits from, its responsibility is involved. It seems to me 
the duty of all members of the House is to ensure the responsibility 
applies not only after an accident or an illness, but it must be 
understood prevention is an obligation.
<P>
	This year's motto is training. I hope training will promote 
prevention among workers as well as within the work organization.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to invite the government, which has the 
necessary means, to use its political leadership to remind 
businesses of their responsibilities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
of all the weeks recognized for specific causes and issues, this is 
one of the more important ones. It is a privilege to respond to the 
minister's statement.
<P>
	Occupational health and safety is an issue in which we are all 
involved. Every year, as the minister has clearly identified, about 
800,000 Canadians are involved in job related accidents which 
result in many work days lost, money not earned, families in 
trouble and personal trauma experienced by the individual.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3323"> 3323 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Labour asks is it reasonable the Canadian 
economy support as much as $10 billion in compensation for these 
accidents. The simple answer is it is not reasonable.
<P>
	In these post-recession days business cannot afford to replace or 
do without experienced employees who are sidelined because of 
accidents. The effect on families, the effect on friends and the 
effect on relationships has already been indicated. It is very 
significant.
<P>
	Parliament and provincial legislatures can pass all the laws they 
want on occupational health and safety, but employers and 
employees must ensure they are followed, like every other law. 
With increasing competitiveness and technological advances in the 
knowledge based society we are faced with new and ever changing 
conditions and previously unheard of hazards. Every industry and 
every workplace has its own seen and unseen obstacles as a 
consequences. The onus has to be on each one of us, owners, 
managers, supervisors and workers, to look out for ourselves and 
also for our colleagues.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	The theme of the 1996 Occupational Health and Safety Week is 
``Training-Target Zero Accidents''. That is a great target and it is 
one we should strive for. To achieve this, labour and management 
have to work together to educate employees on the safe use of 
equipment and the potential risks and dangers of misuse or neglect 
of safety precautions.
<P>
	I must draw to the attention of the House that it is not simply a 
matter of training, it is not simply a matter of education, it is not 
simply a matter of information. Three things need to happen to help 
change people's behaviour. First, they need to know what the issue 
is. Second, they need to understand the issue. And third, they must 
accept it. That acceptance often requires a change in attitude.
<P>
	When the attitude is ``I am responsible for my own safety'', and 
the manager takes the responsibility for his or her safety and that of 
fellow workers, only then will behaviour actually change.
<P>
	I would like to put this adage to the House: Let us have the 
attitude of ``I am responsible'' and recognize that an ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure.

Insurance Act.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill would amend the Unemployment 
Insurance Act to allow a group of workers, hairdressers, the ability 
to become self-employed under conditions other than full 
ownership of a hairdressing establishment.
<P>
	Under the current system, hairdressers who rent chairs and who 
normally would be considered self-employed are not allowed to 
withdraw from the unemployment insurance system like other 
self-employed individuals. This requires them to submit 
considerable sums of money to a system that does not serve their 
needs. Further, many individuals do not have the capital to set up a 
hairdressing establishment but would rather work for themselves 
on a smaller scale.

<P>

without the major constraints put exclusively on this category of 
workers by the current UI regulations.

definition of self-employment so that the current law would better 
serve the needs of this group of Canadian workers.

to limit the national debt of Canada which, as you know, has been

programs.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am reintroducing a bill that was part of 
the last session of this Parliament.
<P>
	This bill is primarily designed to improve the effectiveness of 
government by requesting that all programs be evaluated on a 
periodic basis of every seven to ten years based on four 
fundamental criteria.
<P>
	What exactly is the program designed to do? How well is the 
program delivering what it was designed to do? Is it doing it 
efficiently? Is there a better way to achieve the same results? 
Programs that spend over $250 million would be required to be 
approved by the Auditor General of Canada.
<P>
	The bill is designed to improve the efficiency of government. I 
hope that since program evaluation has been demonstrated to save 
all kinds of money, we would have all-party support of this bill.

breached and I may have to raise the matter in another form if the 
question is not answered forthwith.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is important for the House to recognize 
it is not a simple matter of asking one person to get information and 
have it delivered or deposited. If it were that simple the question 
would have been answered a long time ago.
<P>
	The member well knows this matter is very complicated. It is a 
very pervasive question which is being asked. Frankly, it is a matter 
of dollars and civil service responsibility in terms of allocating 
time to get the information.
<P>
	The member should respect that issue. We are doing to very best 
we can.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wish to inform the House 
that because of the ministerial statement Government Orders will 
be extended by 14 minutes.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to reiterate, as I was seing before oral  question period, that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3327"> 3327 </A></B>
<P>
the Bloc Quebecois does not oppose the motion. We feel that 
several aspects of the proposed change concerning schools in 
Newfoundland are acceptable. We view it as reasonable. The 
majority expressed itself through a referendum and the motion 
does not interfere with the rights of members of denominations, 
who can teach religion in schools. There are also practical 
considerations, in the sense that the province will save money and 
streamline its school board structure.
<P>
	However, we feel that the Government of Canada, the Prime 
Minister of Canada and the premier of Newfoundland, Brian Tobin, 
are not fulfilling their obligations under section 23 of the 1982 
charter.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	While the motion on term 17 does not violate section 23, both 
provisions deal with the right to manage schools. Some members 
rose to say that they do not support term 17 simply because 
minority rights will be violated. I remind this House that the rights 
of French speaking minorities in Newfoundland are currently being 
violated, because, for 14 years now, the province has not been 
complying with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
Section 23 is not complied with in Newfoundland.
<P>
	That is precisely the problem. This charter is forever being 
dragged in to show how respectful Canada is of minorities, how it 
has one of the best charters in the world, and how Canada is, in 
addition, bilingual. The problem is that it is not being implemented 
in all the provinces. Furthermore, four provinces in Canada do not 
respect the Canadian Constitution, and we are talking about the 
supreme law of Canada. Four provinces are not respecting the 
provisions of section 23 of the charter: British Columbia, Ontario, 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.
<P>
	This change, the motion to amend term 17, gives Brian Tobin, 
the premier of Newfoundland, a golden opportunity to bring the 
province in line with the charter. Section 23 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms gives francophone minorities 
living outside Quebec, in Canada, the right to manage their own 
school boards. This is guaranteed in the charter. Furthermore, there 
have even been two Supreme Court decisions confirming this right, 
in 1988, and in 1990. There was the Supreme Court decision in the 
Mahé case, indicating clearly that the francophone minority in 
every province of Canada had the right to manage its own schools.
<P>
	In Newfoundland, once again, the charter is not being respected. 
Francophones still do not have the right to manage their own 
schools. On the contrary, in Newfoundland, the rights of the 
francophone minority are being completely disregarded.
<P>
	I will explain to you what has happened. Mr. Tobin is saying that 
he will respect the rights of francophones, but  we know very well 
this is so much hot air. His predecessor, Clyde Wells, was no 
different. When they saw that Newfoundland was not respecting 
their rights, members of the francophone minority filed a 
complaint with the Newfoundland Supreme Court to right the 
situation. Mr. Wells told them: ``No, withdraw your complaint to 
the Newfoundland Supreme Court and I will give you the power to 
manage your own schools''. After the association of francophones 
withdrew its complaint, no more was heard of the promises made 
by Mr. Wells.
<P>
	We are in the same situation today, exactly the same situation. 
History repeats itself. It looks like Mr. Tobin is indeed telling us 
that he will protect the rights of francophone minorities in 
Newfoundland, but is putting nothing in writing, is not making any 
black and white commitments. These words will disappear into the 
ether, there is no doubt. All indications are that Mr. Tobin will not 
honour this promise.
<P>
	That is the Prime Minister's role in this country, he who is 
supposedly responsible for making sure the Constitution of Canada 
is respected. This would have been the ideal opportunity for doing 
so. He could have said, ``Brian, old boy, we will reach a deal. We 
will pass your little motion, so that you can reorganize the school 
boards in Newfoundland, but then, in exchange, you will agree to 
respect section 23 of the charter''.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	That, precisely, was the responsibility of the Prime Minister of 
Canada, the man who claims to champion francophone rights in 
Canada. By the way, he has done nothing. Moreover, in a letter to 
the premier of Newfoundland, which I could quote to you, he 
makes no reference to the fact that Newfoundland does not respect 
section 23 of the charter. I see this as unfortunate and serious. 
Minority rights in Canada have been ignored for a long time, and 
here we have one more example, in Newfoundland.
<P>
	The people of Newfoundland and the francophone association in 
that province are entitled to administer their own school boards, 
and Newfoundland has denied them that right. In 1988, they went 
before the Newfoundland Supreme Court to ensure that their rights 
were respected. They obtained an agreement, rather a promise, 
from Mr. Wells that he would respect the charter, but that did not 
happen.
<P>
	Now today, Mr. Tobin is holding up the possibility of ensuring 
the charter is respected. Whether it is or not remains to be seen. 
After Mr. Wells' promise to the association of Newfoundland and 
Labrador francophones to see that their right to administer their 
own schools would be respected, Mr. Wells instead set up the 
Normand commission. This commission confirmed, not 
surprisingly, that francophones in Newfoundland were indeed 
entitled to manage their own schools. That was the finding of the 
Normand commission.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3328"> 3328 </A></B>
<P>
	The Newfoundland government managed to keep the Normand 
report out of the hands of the association of Newfoundland and 
Labrador francophones for two and a half years. It took two and 
a half years for the association to even have access to the Normand 
report, which said that francophones had the right to manage their 
own schools.
<P>
	Newfoundland does not treat its francophones with the greatest 
respect. This problem is a Canadian problem because, although 
Canada claims to respect its minorities and to be sensitive to their 
rights, even today there are still four provinces that do not abide by 
the terms of the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	Newfoundland could have seized this opportunity to protect 
these rights. Especially since, on the one hand, Captain Canada 
himself is afraid to make a commitment to protect minority rights 
and, on the other hand, the champion of francophone rights in 
Canada, the Prime Minister, cannot make a commitment either. He 
could have done so easily in this case. It would have been so easy.
<P>
	Why did he not do so? Why did Brian Tobin not make a 
commitment to protect the rights of francophones so they can 
manage their own schools? Because he has no intention of doing 
so. There is no political will in Newfoundland to do so.
<P>
	Why did the Prime Minister not make a commitment either? 
Why did he not force Brian Tobin to clearly promise to protect the 
rights of francophones in Newfoundland? Because this government 
does not have the political will either to protect the rights of 
francophones.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	This political will is disappearing over time, not only in 
Newfoundland but in all the other provinces as we can see. Just last 
weekend, we learned that this federal government has cut by almost 
two thirds the funding for Ontario's francophone associations.
<P>
	I could give you several other examples that clearly show they 
are no longer trying to defend the rights of francophones. This 
government is showing once again that it lacks the backbone to 
enforce the terms of the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bonnie Hickey (St. John's East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
advise the member opposite of a letter written to the Leader of the 
Opposition from the minister of education for Newfoundland 
which suggests they have no problem with sitting down to discuss 
this with the francophone society of Newfoundland and that the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador is more than willing 
to give every tool necessary to help the francophone association of 
Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
comment. The problem is there has not been any formal 
engagement on the part of Mr. Brian Tobin, the premier of 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	Unfortunately when one reads the press releases one has the 
eerie feeling that what Mr. Tobin is preparing is what other 
provinces have done in the past. Instead of providing them with 
control of their school system Mr. Tobin, like other premiers in 
Canada, will provide the system with a what is called conseil 
consultatif in French. It would be like a seat on the school board 
which would provide the francophones the opportunity to listen in 
but gives them absolutely no power. It looks good.
<P>
	That is what is being done in B.C, in Ontario, in Nova Scotia: 
``We will give them all kinds of latitude and consultative power''. 
It comes down to a big zero plus zero in terms of real power.
<P>
	Furthermore, it is very far from respecting the Constitution. 
Article XXIII of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
which is supposed to be the supreme law of the land, clearly 
specifies they have the right to control their school systems. There 
have been supreme court judgements reaffirming that fact. That is 
where Mr. Tobin has not formally engaged himself and we doubt he 
will do anything.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Trust him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> We have to trust him, of course. My claim is not 
so much with Mr. Tobin as it is with the Prime Minister. He should 
have made some formal agreement with Mr. Tobin. We have to 
trust him too. Even if the Prime Minister had made promises in that 
respect, his promises are not always kept, as we know.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hickey:</B> Mr. Speaker, with the permission of the House I 
would like to send my colleague opposite a copy of the letter 
written by the department of education to the Leader of the 
Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a copy of that letter. I 
believe it was sent by the minister of education in Newfoundland, 
Roger Grimes.
<P>
	Actually it is unfortunate. All the requests made and the work the 
association of parents in Newfoundland has done to have their 
rights respected were never even received by Mr. Tobin. They 
never got to his door. They got a very flat response from the 
minister of education, which the association says is a lot of hot air.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in this debate on 
the motion we have been requested to adopt in this place, as well as 
in the other place, to make it possible for the province of 
Newfoundland to obtain a constitutional amendment giving it the 
authority to reform its public education system, in which districts 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3329"> 3329 </A></B>
<P>
are defined on the basis of school denomination, and to  ensure that 
the educational system is organized along different lines.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	As we know, the existing system, which has in fact been in place 
since Newfoundland entered Confederation in 1949, is protected 
under term 17 of the agreement setting the terms under which 
Newfoundland joined the Canadian Confederation.
<P>
	In 1982, certain constitutional amendments were 
made-incidentally, Quebec did not support these amendments 
and, as a result, was excluded from the Canadian Constitution, 
although the Constitution applies in Quebec as well as anywhere in 
Canada. As provided in section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982, 
amendments to the Constitution may be made, where authorized by 
the House of Commons, the Upper House and the legislative 
assembly of a province when the amendments in question apply to 
a very specific territory, namely a province.
<P>
	This provision of the Constitution Act, 1982, has been used a 
few times since. Section 43 was used in 1987 to recognize 
Pentecostal schools in Newfoundland and again, in 1993, when 
New Brunswick became officially bilingual, that is to say a 
province recognizing linguistic equality between French and 
English. This was all done under this section, section 43 of the 
Constitution Act. Finally, more recently, it was used when a 
constitutional amendment was needed to make it possible to build 
this bridge that will soon, within a year, link Prince Edward Island 
to New Brunswick. The provision was used three time in all to 
amend the Constitution.
<P>
	As I said, the motion before us arises from a decision made by 
the Government of Newfoundland to change its denominational 
system. How did the Government of Newfoundland come to this 
decision? First, following a long internal debate as we see in other 
provinces, particularly Quebec, on this specific issue. This debate 
allowed all those concerned to express their views and lasted 
months and even years in Newfoundland.
<P>
	It ended on September 5, 1995, when the population made the 
final decision, by way of a referendum. Even though only 52 per 
cent of eligible voters took part in the referendum, a clear majority 
of 54 per cent supported the proposed changes to the 
denominational system.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	So, on October 31, Newfoundland's legislative assembly 
acknowledged the public's wish, as expressed in a democratic 
referendum, and took action to follow up on that decision. Later, 
the Prime Minister of Canada recognized, of course, the 
referendum result and agreed to put this motion on the House's 
agenda for the current session, so that the issue would be settled 
once and for all when the House and the Senate adopt it.
<P>
	I want to take the 15 minutes or so that I have left to stress 
important aspects in this exercise, namely the  recognition of the 
will expressed by the public, and the obligation, for a democracy, 
to follow up on that will. I dare say that, in the eyes of the 
international community, a referendum is recognized as the most 
democratic tool, since all the citizens of a territory are asked to 
express their views on a very specific issue, following a debate in 
which all the parties were able to present their arguments. In other 
words, a referendum is the ultimate poll, since everyone can 
express his or her view.
<P>
	A referendum does not always carry the same weight for the 
Liberal government currently in office in Ottawa, as we saw during 
the last referendum held in Quebec. During the campaign, the 
Prime Minister of Canada repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of 
the Quebec referendum and said he would not recognize the result, 
should the yes side win by a slim margin.
<P>
	We know what the final verdict was: 49.6 per cent of Quebecers 
voted yes and 50.4 per cent voted no at the last referendum, and 
that outcome was not only recognized by the sovereignist 
government in Quebec, but was also recognized and fully respected 
by each and every sovereignist and resident of the province of 
Quebec. What it means is that Quebec remains a part of the 
Canadian federation, even if it was excluded from the Constitution 
in 1982, following well-known events, that is the unilateral 
patriation of the Constitution.
<P>
	As I said before, the Prime Minister implied that any decision 
Quebecers make does not have the same significance if it goes 
against his wishes. I find such an argument, such a statement 
particularly outrageous. It means that they will respect the 
democratic rules if and only if the outcome of a democratic process 
goes along with their wishes. I think that is the kind of arguments 
most dictators on this planet use. No dictator is against a 
referendum, as long as he wins it.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	These people are true democrats, as long as the dice are loaded 
and they are sure of the results. I find it a bit peculiar to hear these 
arguments, which were taken up for the most part by the individual 
who is responsible, at the governmental level, for ensuring that 
changes or negotiations are undertaken to improve, if that is at all 
possible, the Constitution of Canada, so that it meets the 
expectations of all Quebecers. That individual, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, in a comment about the motion now 
before the House, stated that referenda do not all have the same 
significance.
<P>
	I would like to quote-and I think this is an exact quote-a 
report in Tuesday May 28's <I>Le Devoir </I>in reaction to the words of a 
sovereignist spokesperson who had said: ``The Newfoundlanders 
spoke clearly. A majority of Newfoundlanders have demanded that 
the Constitution be amended in response to their aspirations for the 
organization of their school system''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3330"> 3330 </A></B>
<P>
	We sovereignists say, and rightly so I believe, that if this was 
good enough for a decision made in Newfoundland, and was the 
case when Newfoundland entered Confederation as well, it is 
certainly so for Quebecers when they want to determine their 
future. It seems to me that the same principle applies in both cases. 
There cannot be one democratic principle for Newfoundland, and 
another for Quebec. That is completely unacceptable.
<P>
	But not for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. The 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has been quoted as saying 
during a media scrum: ``The principle is that, the more serious a 
decision and the more it impacts upon future generations, the more 
strictly the rules of democracy must be applied''.
<P>
	My understanding of this statement as I read it is that the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is saying that the 
Newfoundlanders' decision was on a mere detail. Yet remodelling 
the denominational school system seems to me to impact on future 
generations since we are speaking of today's children and our 
children's children. It would seem to mean that he considers 
modifying the school system in a province, Newfoundland in this 
case, a mere detail.
<P>
	So some rules of democracy can be a bit looser. Can we consider 
the debate of Newfoundlanders, which lasted months, years, to be a 
waste of time, according to the evaluation of the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs? I think this is rather offensive. It treats 
with disdain people who reached a decision through democratic 
process.
<P>
	The minister went on to say, in the same article, in the same 
statement: ``There is a world of difference between modernizing an 
education system and dismantling a country''. I think the basis of 
this discussion reveals the importance of such action. I do not think 
we can tell Newfoundlanders that the whole issue of their debate 
was not as important as the potential debate in Quebec over its 
constitutional future.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	I would like to give a few examples and I would like to hear the 
opinion of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs on the 
Maastricht treaty, a highly complex treaty ratified by all the 
countries in the European Community.
<P>
	The people in these countries had to vote on this treaty, which 
had-still has and will continue have for generations to 
come-major consequences on their lives, because it significantly 
changed the way their countries worked.
<P>
	All the countries or almost-not all, but a good majority-held a 
referendum. I will give you two examples. In Sweden, 52 per cent 
of the population supported Sweden's entry into the European 
common market. In France, 50.9 per cent voted in favour of a 
significant change, a major change.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs might think 
otherwise, but when one refers to the debates which took place in 
those countries on the Maastricht treaty, one realizes that the 
decision to be taken had far reaching consequences.
<P>
	In the case of Sweden and France, where the population was 
nearly equally divided, opponents did not ask that those who did 
not support the Maastricht treaty be excluded from it. On the 
contrary, in these countries, it is understood that the democratic 
rule is 50 per cent plus 1.
<P>
	I will give as a last example the recent elections in Israel where, 
for all intents and purposes, the prime minister was elected by 
referendum since there was a vote by universal suffrage; the whole 
population was called to choose the prime minister. In this 
particular case, I would like you to remember this, 50.4 per cent of 
the Israeli population voted in favour of a change of prime minister 
against 49.6 per cent, which is the same results as in Quebec, last 
October.
<P>
	If one follows international events and knows what 
consequences this election might have in Israel, one might think 
that there is food for thought for the voters, especially in view of 
the very important consequences of their vote on their future. And, 
in spite of it all, the outgoing prime minister, Mr. Peres, accepted 
the results as the good democrat he is, conceded defeat and agreed 
to recognize the new prime minister.
<P>
	I say all this to show that you cannot have double standards, even 
if that is what the Liberal government, and especially the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs, have in mind. In a democracy, you 
cannot have double standards. The rule of democracy is 50 per cent 
plus 1 for any referendum. On two separate occasions, Quebecers 
have respected the results of decisions which were contrary to the 
hopes of sovereignists.
<P>
	We cannot discredit a decision or discount its importance when it 
results from a democratic process. That is why I will support 
Motion No. 5 concerning Newfoundland, which is before us today.
<P>
	I hope our colleagues, from the Liberal Party in particular, will 
show some consistency. When Quebecers vote in favour of 
Quebec's sovereignty, whatever the result might be, if it represents 
a democratic decision, I hope they will abide by it.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this House for my first speech after 
undergoing open-heart surgery. I hope to go on for at least 10 
minutes.
<P>
	I have great concerns about this bill, which would amend the 
Constitution at the request of the Newfoundland government, 
which held a referendum on the issue of educational rights and how 
the school system  in that province should work. I have serious 
concerns about th impact on minorities, be they Catholics,
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3331"> 3331 </A></B>
<P>
francophones or Quebec anglophones, or even on other religions 
such as the Jewish faith.
<P>
	We are also talking about separation and process, but I will go 
back to separation. Since the beginning of the debate, Bloc 
members have been making a lot of noise with their hands and feet, 
saying this is what democratic process is all about. We are quite 
familiar with the Bloc Quebecois' platform.
<P>
	Let us talk about the referendum process. In 1949, 
Newfoundland wanted to join Canada and struck an agreement 
whereby religious denominations had the right to manage their own 
schools. That is why the people of Newfoundland voted in favour 
of joining Confederation.
<P>
	Now, nearly 50 years later, the federal Parliament is being asked 
to amend the Constitution to accommodate Newfoundland. I see a 
problem in that only 52 per cent of all the people in Newfoundland 
voted in the referendum that was held in that province late last 
summer. Yes, 54 per cent voted in favour of the question asked in 
the referendum, that is to say, 25 per cent of all the people in 
Newfoundland were in favour of the question asked in the 
referendum.
<P>
	What does this referendum tell us? If we look at the question, as 
an English language newspaper said: ``This was a loaded 
question''. A member of the third opposition party also told me: 
``This was a fuzzy question''. An article in the <I>Toronto Star</I> says 
this:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Newfoundlanders were asked whether or not they supported 
reform of the denominational educational system, and this was won 
by a narrow margin''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Obviously, when people are asked if this, that or the other should 
be changed, they always want us to go ahead and constantly make 
adjustments to suit the demands and meet the needs of the people.
<P>
	I find the question rather suspicious. It is not clear, not distinct, 
as my colleagues opposite would say. Are we in favour of 
reforming the school system? Of course. School systems keep 
being changed, always for the better. But in this case, it would not 
be for the better. In this case, the purpose of the change would be to 
reduce, if not to abolish, but mainly to reduce the involvement of 
minorities in the management of their school system.
<P>
	Just recently, someone told me: ``Are you not in favour of public 
school boards, Mr. Bellemare?'' I replied that I was of course in 
favour of public systems. As a teacher, I was involved with Ottawa 
public school boards for 30 years. So, I do believe in the system. 
My own children attended high school in the public system after 
attending elementary school in the Catholic system.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	I do believe in both systems. I believe in several educational 
systems. What matters is the choice that parents and children make.
<P>
	As regards the specific question I was asked about the 
establishment of public school boards, as I said before, I just 
recently learned that a public school system already exists in 
Newfoundland. It is referred to under the designation of integrated 
schools. They do not use the same terminology as we do in Ontario. 
We say public system, they say integrated system. I am now 
apprised of the fact that 56 per cent of schools in Newfoundland are 
in fact integrated schools, while 37 per cent are Roman Catholic 
and 7 per cent Pentecostal.
<P>
	What is the point in amending the Constitution to establish 
integrated schools, or public schools, if such schools already exist? 
I would like Newfoundland, the Government of Newfoundland to 
tell me why public hearings were never held to give 
Newfoundlanders the opportunity to make representations. Why 
were the stakeholders not invited to appear before parliamentary 
committees to make presentations? Why was the bill in question 
introduced during the summer, when Newfoundlanders are at the 
cottage, at work or out fishing, and voted on at the end of the 
summer?
<P>
	As could be expected, public participation was low. A small 
majority voted in favour of the referendum bill. Bloc members are 
thrilled, they who have been telling us for a while now how they 
will be voting. They will vote in favour, not out of concern for 
minorities, given that they could not care less about minorities. 
Bloc members do not care about francophones living outside 
Quebec. They do not care about the anglophone minority in their 
own province, and I say province, not country.
<P>
	The Bloc tells us, and I quote: ``When 52, 51 or 54 per cent of 
Quebecers decide in a democratic referendum held according to the 
rules adopted by Quebec's national assembly to become sovereign, 
we hope that the Canadian Parliament will show the same generous 
and democratic disposition toward Quebec as it is now showing 
toward Newfoundland''.
<P>
	Of course Bloc members support this bill. Another Bloc member 
said: ``In other words, the Government of Newfoundland had its 
political decision confirmed through a referendum, and this is 
sacred for the Bloc Quebecois''.
<P>
	Of course the Bloc Quebecois agrees with the amendments 
affecting minorities in Newfoundland. As for Reform Party 
members, most of them will be in favour of respecting the result of 
the referendum, because reformers believe in referenda. Their 
member for Nanaimo-Cowichan even recently asked that a 
referendum be held to abolish bilingualism in Canada. Fortunately, 
the Canadian government and the House voted against the 
proposal.

	In Ontario, at the beginning of the century, regulation 17 
abolished the teaching of French in the province. For decades, 
Franco-Ontarians had to fight tooth and nail to build schools and 
to teach in French, in spite of the Ontario law. Regulation 17 was 
finally and, quietly, abolished in the thirties.
<P>
	I say there is a danger that, in supporting or proposing a 
constitutional change to accommodate the Government of 
Newfoundland, the federal government may violate minority 
rights.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	There are risks for minorities living outside Quebec, such as 
francophones in Ontario and elsewhere. There are risks in certain 
western provinces, where some rednecks are totally anti-French 
and would be happy to see us assimilated and disappear from the 
Canadian map. This really concerns me and this is why I will vote 
against this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I presented seven petitions a few moments ago from 8,900 
people. A few of the petitions were from schools. Some of these 
petitions came from outside my riding. A student wrote: ``We 
decided to send it to you, Mr. Baker, because you are the oldest 
member of the House of Commons''. Perhaps the student meant the 
most senior member from Newfoundland, not the oldest member. 
There are some members here who are older than I am.
<P>
	The reason I decided to say a few words is because there have 
been erroneous statements made in and outside the Chamber 
regarding the Newfoundland school system. I picked up the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> this morning and what does a columnist say? People from 
Newfoundland who are listening to this are going to roll on floor in 
laughter.
<P>
	He said: ``Newfoundland is the only place in North America 
without a public school system. The hallowed Terms of Union with 
Canada in 1949 requires the province to do for one of those seven 
denominations, build a new school for example, whatever it does 
for another. Even Anglicans like Clyde Wells and his kids who 
have no Anglican school nearby have been forced either go on a 
waiting list for admission to a religious school not of their faith, or 
to suffer a three-hour bus ride to find an Anglican school''. I see a 
Newfoundlander in the gallery laughing right now.
<P>
	The fact is that there is no such thing in Gander, Newfoundland, 
where I come from. There are four schools, yes, but they cover 
everybody. There is no Roman Catholic school, there is no 
Pentecostal school, no Seventh Day Adventist school, no Anglican 
school, no Salvation Army school. There is just one school system.
<P>
	There is the elementary school, second school, high school and a 
collegiate. But there is one school with no denomination in Gander, 
Newfoundland. Over the years things have changed in 
Newfoundland. Where it was not economical or the numbers did 
not warrant, things changed. Integration took place.
<P>
	The integrated school, which is similar to public schools in 
Ontario, would have everybody who is not Roman Catholic, 
Pentecostal or Seventh Day Adventist. But that cannot be said 
either. Children could go to a Roman Catholic school if they 
wanted to. If they went into St. John's, the capital, they would find, 
I think, two Seventh Day Adventist schools. The Seventh Day 
Adventist total enrolment for all of the Newfoundland and 
Labrador is 203 students. Members of the House talk about what an 
expense the Seventh Day Adventist school is. Yes, it has 203 
students. There are two Seventh Day Adventist schools. There are 
Roman Catholic schools. They would be integrated schools. There 
would be a Pentecostal school. There would also be a French 
school.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	A Seven Day Adventist bus comes from Conception Bay south. 
Taking that bus would be Pentecostals, Roman Catholics and those 
students attending what they call the French school. The entire 
school is French immersion. Most of our schools have just French 
immersion classes in them. In other words, only French is spoken 
all the way up to grade 12. We are pretty modern in Newfoundland. 
We are up to date in Newfoundland.
<P>
	They talk about discrimination. I am a Liberal member. I get 
only 10 minutes to speak and the Bloc opposite gets 30 minutes. 
Twenty minutes for the opposition members. We are limited to 10. 
I have to watch the clock.
<P>
	What really infuriated me was listening to members of 
Parliament making two statements. One statement was regarding 
the quality of education in Newfoundland. The remark was made 
that if you have grade 12 in Newfoundland, according to a certain 
standard, you really only have a grade 8 standard in Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. 
Peric</B><B>:</B> 
What an insult.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Yes, what an insult. The other statement was that we 
have to be careful because our money is going to Newfoundland to 
pay for these things. It has to be spent wisely.
<P>
	In Newfoundland our students get as good or better an education 
than in any other province in Canada. When someone goes to the 
University of Ottawa or Carleton University and sees first-year 
university students there from Newfoundland, what do those 
students have? Only grade 8? Is that the standard of enrolment? Of 
course not. Students that come from Newfoundland are usually put 
ahead in the province of Ontario when they do the entrance exams.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3333"> 3333 </A></B>
<P>
	The fact of the matter is yes, it is an expensive system in 
Newfoundland. One of the main reasons is that we have more 
degreed teachers per capita than any province in Canada. Why? 
Way back at the beginning of the 1960s, the Government of 
Newfoundland decided to give students free tuition and salaries to 
go to university to become teachers. It gave $600 to boot as a 
person entered university to increase their qualifications to become 
teachers so there are teachers today in Newfoundland with masters 
degrees, and PhDs are common. Every second teacher has two and 
three degrees, the highest number of degreed teachers in this 
nation. That is reality in the province of Newfoundland. We get a 
solid education.
<P>
	The other reason of sending money to Newfoundland really 
infuriated me. It is good that they are sending money to 
Newfoundland. It is good that they are supporting Cornwall too, 
with Domtar, and Trail, British Columbia, northern Quebec and îles 
de la Madeleine. It is good that they are supporting those people 
who claim that they are sending money to Newfoundland through 
their tax system. Why? Those are the people who make this country 
rich. Those are the producers. When it is seen on a scale, 
Newfoundland and Labrador contributes more to the economy of 
this nation per capita in exports than any other province in Canada.
<P>
	A member of Parliament stands up and says: ``We are sending 
money to them now for their education. We have to be careful how 
they spend it''. They should be thanking everybody for having 
Newfoundland for doing what Newfoundland does best, that is, we 
produce. We produce over $1 billion worth of electricity for export. 
We have our paper mills, our fish plants and all of those primary 
producers who keep this nation going. They keep the member of 
Parliament who made that statement in a position where that 
member of Parliament can go to a plush office in a big, fancy car 
and live pretty well. We have heard the fallacies and the misleading 
statements.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	I notice that my 10 minutes are up and I have not said what I 
really wanted to say. The Speaker is going to call me to order.
<P>
	I suppose the student put it the best way the other day when he 
gave me a petition to present to the House. Of course when 
somebody gives a member of Parliament a petition, whether or not 
the member agrees with the petition, the member of Parliament 
should present it to the Chamber. The member of Parliament has a 
duty to do that.
<P>
	The student made a wonderful speech when he gave me the 
petition. He quoted from a document which was written when we 
joined Canada and then he quoted from what we call the Ode to 
Newfoundland. He pointed out that the Constitution of this country 
should be something that is pretty solid. A constitution is supposed 
to be the real framework of a country. He noted that eight years ago 
when the Tories were in power members of Parliament on both 
sides of the House stood in this Chamber to amend the Constitution 
of Canada to include the Pentecostals in education. They were 
given equal rights.
<P>
	The student said: ``Now the Parliament of Canada eight years 
later is going to take away those rights''. His final words were from 
the Ode to Newfoundland. I do not blame him for what he said. The 
verse in the Ode to Newfoundland is: ``God guard thee, God guard 
thee, God guard thee Newfoundland''. He included the words: 
``because the House of Commons certainly will not''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Ind. Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it was refreshing for us to hear a member from 
Newfoundland who talked so positively about the quality of 
education in the province. That is the information we have been 
receiving as well. When we hear from other members of the House 
about the disastrous state of the educational system in 
Newfoundland, we wonder where they are coming from.
<P>
	As a Toronto member of Parliament, none of my constituents are 
urging me to pass this amendment to save $10 million or $12 
million in the province of Newfoundland. In fact, many of my 
constituents in the city of Toronto feel that the precedent which is 
being set here could one day create a debate in our province which 
would make it very difficult for us to protect the educational 
system in Ontario.
<P>
	The people of Newfoundland should not think we are so fiscally 
obsessed that for the sake of $10 million or $12 million we want the 
current system changed to the point where it requires a radical 
constitutional amendment. We are much more concerned about 
minority rights which has always been the heart and soul of the 
Liberal Party. One of the reasons the Prime Minister became the 
leader of the Liberal Party was that he was a champion of 
defending minority rights. The member from Newfoundland 
should know there are many constituents in Ontario who feel that 
for the sake of $10 million or $12 million we should not pass this 
amendment.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	To the member from Halifax, there is absolutely no comparison 
between Bill C-33 and a constitutional amendment such as this. 
There is absolutely no comparison and the member knows that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3334"> 3334 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Mr. Speaker, to get to the core of what the hon. 
member talked about, it is about money. Perhaps that is what is 
behind practically every action of provincial governments and 
federal governments these days, that is, to cut, cut, cut. The money 
is not there according to the Department of Finance and Treasury 
Board.
<P>
	We went through a very terrible period in Newfoundland in the 
last two months. In my riding two trade schools closed, Springdale 
and Lewisporte, which are vocational schools, community 
colleges. There was a government announcement that first year 
university education is no longer offered in the three locations in 
my riding where it was formerly offered.
<P>
	Last week there were announcements that school buses would no 
longer be provided to bring children home for lunch unless the 
parents paid for it. Some may ask what is wrong with that. To me 
there is a lot wrong with it. It is okay for my kids. If people saw my 
kids going along in the school bus on a stormy day, they would 
know we could pay the $200. But the children of the poor will be 
trudging along through the snow because their parents cannot pay 
the fee.
<P>
	Many things have taken place that should never have taken place 
as far as education is concerned. Health care and education are two 
things we should preserve. This government or any other 
government should not be slashing as is being done right across 
Canada today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> That concludes the period of 
questions and comments to the hon. member's intervention.
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House 
that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is 
as follows: the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce-Terrorism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I live on the 
other side of the country and the issue today, as the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood suggested, is not one on which I have had 
many calls. However, it is an issue of utmost importance to all 
Canadians for a variety of reasons which I will get into later on.
<P>
	The issue before us is not an issue of quality of education. In my 
view education is not served well by taking decision making away 
from parents and moving it into 10 large school boards. That issue 
is also an issue of cost. Never in my 25-year career of teaching 
school did I ever see a school district reduce its cost through 
centralization and increasing the size of school boards. The exact 
opposite happened. As school boards were  formed and increased in 
size, the cost increased at the same time.
<P>
	The issue today is about the constitutionally guaranteed right to 
religious schools. It is also about the process of change, in fact the 
referendum which I will talk about in a few minutes.
<P>
	First I will address the issue of the constitutional guarantee. The 
act which brought Newfoundland into the Canadian Confederation 
contains certain paragraphs which deal with education:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In and for the province of Newfoundland, the legislature shall have exclusive 
authority to make laws in relation to education, but the legislature will not have 
authority to make laws prejudicially affecting any right or privilege with respect 
to denominational schools, common (amalgamated) schools, or denominational 
colleges, that any class or classes of persons have by law in Newfoundland at the 
date of union, and out of public funds of the province of Newfoundland, 
provided for education.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	The act is saying that the people of Newfoundland have a 
guaranteed right to these religious schools and that guaranteed 
right cannot be taken away from them by a mere act of the 
legislature. In other words the people were to be protected against 
the vagaries of the majority in the legislature. In my view that 
guarantee is being violated.
<P>
	In Newfoundland 37 per cent of the population is Roman 
Catholic and 7 per cent is Pentecostal. In the referendum in all 16 
electoral districts where Roman Catholics or Pentecostals were in 
the majority, they voted no to the changes. The changes then were 
foisted upon those people by the majority, which is the very point 
that the constitutional amendment which brought Newfoundland 
into Confederation was trying to protect them against.
<P>
	With regard to the referendum the first issue we must look at is 
the question. The question was: Do you support revising term 17 in 
the manner proposed by the government to enable reform of the 
denominational education system, yes or no? That is not a clear 
question. It is the same fuzzy type of question all of us worried 
about and were concerned about in the recently concluded 
referendum in Quebec. What we said then was that when a question 
is put to the people, the question should be clear and should be 
easily understood by all and the effect of voting either yea or nay 
on that question should be clear beyond any question.
<P>
	That is not the case in this question. The question itself is mushy. 
It talks about revising term 17. What does term 17 mean? It means 
a variety of things to a variety of people. That in itself concerns me. 
It talks about ``in the manner proposed by the government''. Again, 
that is not a clear statement of intent. It says also ``to enable 
reform''. That in itself encourages someone to say yes. It talks 
about reforming the education system. In that regard it can be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3335"> 3335 </A></B>
<P>
suggested that it talks about improving  the education system. Who 
is not for improving or for reforming the education system? That is 
a real violation of an obligation of the government to put a clear 
question to the people.
<P>
	If we vote in favour of this motion, what we are saying is that the 
next time there is an election in Quebec if the question put is not 
clear, if the intent of that question is not clear, if it is not of the 
utmost clarity to the people on what it is they are voting for, we 
have nothing to say. We will simply have to stand on the sidelines 
and watch that event unfold.
<P>
	Other concerns about the referendum process were that the 
House of Assembly was adjourned for the months that the issue 
was before the people. The issue was not debated in the House of 
Assembly which is something one has to regret. When issues are 
put before the people, the people deserve to have those issues 
debated by their members in the House of Assembly in order to 
clarify the outstanding questions and issues.
<P>
	Allowing the interim between the announcement of the 
referendum and the actual date of the referendum to happen over 
the summer months limited the effect of the debate. The schools 
were closed. Everybody knows that schools, especially on a 
referendum issue like this one, are places where people would 
focus and would look for clarification of the issues. That did not 
happen.
<P>
	This whole referendum process was fundamentally flawed. The 
question was carefully crafted to imply falsely that amendment of 
the Constitution was necessary in order for reform to occur as a 
matter of law. That simply was not the case.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I have more than a passing interest on the issue of referendum 
and whatnot. It is an issue which I studied as a masters student at 
university and is one on which I spend a considerable amount of 
time studying and reviewing. In all manner of ways I find that the 
referendum question was flawed, as was the process by which it 
was put to the people. It is going to lead to serious problems in the 
future for us as a nation when we deal with referendums put 
forward in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	Another issue worth noting is that when this referendum result 
was placed before members in the House of Assembly, 31 members 
voted in favour and 20 members voted against. All 14 cabinet 
ministers were required to vote in support of the resolution 
regardless of where their constituents stood on the issue. There 
again the way the issue was put before the house of representatives, 
the way the question was put and the fact that the vote was forced, 
is opposite to everything my party stands for. It is completely 
unacceptable that there would be a vote which required cabinet 
solidarity on an issue such as this one. People should have been 
required  to support the wishes of their constituents on this most 
critical issue.
<P>
	Another point is most worthy of consideration. I will read from a 
letter written by the Most Reverend James H. MacDonald, 
Archbishop of St. John's:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is of crucial importance to recognize that the denominational rights which 
are intended to remain under the framework agreement will under the proposed 
term 17 have no constitutional guarantee of protection, but will be subject to 
provincial legislation which can be changed by an arbitrary decision of any 
future government of our province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is exactly the situation we have in British Columbia. 
Denominational schools in British Columbia have no constitutional 
guarantees. They exist merely at the whim of the provincial 
government. They receive partial funding, again only at the whim 
of the provincial government. However, those schools are the 
schools of choice by parents. That has to be a key issue: Whose 
children are we educating, the government's or the parents'? The 
answer is obvious. Children belong to their parents. It should be the 
parents' right to choose the type of education system they wish. It 
should also be their right to choose a denominational system if they 
wish. The obligation should fall to the government to fund that 
system the same as it does for everyone else.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the question before us in some ways is 
much more than simply a question of the right for denominational 
schools to exist, although that question is of paramount 
importance. It has the side issue of the future of this country and 
the type of question we would require to be put in a referendum in 
Quebec on separation. We cannot vote on this issue without 
seriously considering the implications of our vote.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
colleague from Delta started off on the right foot, when he began 
his speech by saying that education must be the responsibility of 
the provinces. We, in Quebec, consider that education is indeed a 
matter for the provinces.
<P>
	However, this is not the issue we have to debate here today, and 
that is where the hon. member went wrong. He said that the 
referendum held on September 5, in Newfoundland, was simply not 
legitimate and for several reasons. First, there was the question. 
Was the question clear? Was the question easily understood by 
everybody? Was the referendum held at an appropriate time? Was 
September 5 convenient?
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	He came up with several reasons why it was not convenient. So, 
his position has drawn him a bit closer to the Liberal member for 
St. Boniface, who stated the same thing. There is never a good time 
to hold a referendum.
<P>
	Did both sides have the same financial resources at their 
disposal? That was one of the questions he asked. In  his speech, he 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3336"> 3336 </A></B>
<P>
constantly questioned the legitimacy of referenda, wherever it is 
held, here, in another province, or abroad.
<P>
	My question is the following: What does my hon. colleague need 
to recognize the outcome of a referendum, when in the past, in 
1980 and again in 1992, the federalists always said and indicated 
that an absolute majority was enough and that they would react 
accordingly? Why is it that, along the way, when we do not like the 
outcome of a referendum, we want to change the rules. Is that what 
the hon. member intends to do?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins</B> Mr. Speaker, any referendum question must be a 
clear question. The respondent must understand without question 
the implications of his response. That was not the case. I have 
serious reservations about those kinds of questions. I do not think 
we want to establish a practice where we are prepared to put to a 
referendum a variety of questions unless we are certain that people 
clearly understand what it is they are being asked to vote on. I 
repeat, that was not the case in this instance.
<P>
	The hon. member raised the issue of what percentage is 
necessary. It has become the practice that 50 per cent plus one 
carries the day. I am concerned about a motion for a constitutional 
change where 50 per cent plus one is the norm. Currently we 
require the approval of seven provinces as well as the federal 
government to make a constitutional change. I am not convinced 
that a two-thirds majority for serious changes would not be helpful. 
It is not an issue which either the hon. member or I have any 
control over, but I see it as a valuable direction for us to pursue.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bonnie Hickey (St. John's East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
remind my colleague from the Reform Party that in the last 
provincial election in Newfoundland and Labrador 36 out of 52 
seats were won with a yes answer for reform. Reform to 
Newfoundland means to educate our children, to give them a better 
education or as good an education as everybody else in Canada. 
Thirty-six is a large number for yes.
<P>
	The question on term 17 means exactly what it says and that is to 
reform our education system, to make it better and to make us 
equal to everybody else in Canada. Whatever way he feels the 
question is read, I would like him to suggest another question. I 
cannot see it being any clearer than what it already is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question itself had a number of 
flaws. In this instance the government asked: Do you support 
revising term 17 in the manner proposed by the government? That 
is not a clear question. The intent of the changes should be clearly 
stated. This simply does not do it and I have a problem with that.
<P>
	As far as the reference to the quality of education in 
Newfoundland, the member for Gander-Grand Falls just 
concluded that in his view the quality of education available in 
Newfoundland was every bit on par with the quality of education in 
the rest of the country. I have no reason to question that.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The administrative costs of education are always a problem. I 
will say that by reducing the number of school boards to 10 large 
boards in very short order it will be found that it is not going to 
allow a reduction in the cost of education. The experience 
elsewhere in the country has been exactly the opposite. These large 
boards tend to create a need for specialists in various fields and 
before we know it the school board office has more people sitting 
in it than the largest school in the district.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in listening to 
the member for Delta, when he talked about the amalgamation of 
school boards he may have been speaking in a British Columbia 
context as opposed to a Newfoundland context. The idea that in any 
of the small Atlantic provinces the vast numbers he thinks are 
being dealt with is a little unusual to those of us who come from 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	When he talks about 50 per cent plus one, I wonder if he 
understands that the referendum in Newfoundland was actually 55 
to 45, which is a fairly substantial 10 point difference.
<P>
	I am not being tongue in cheek here, but I wonder if the hon. 
member really does know about the Newfoundland school system 
and the divergence in the level of schooling of the two ridings of 
Grander-Grand Falls and St. John's East. Does he understand how 
great a divergence that might be in the province of Newfoundland? 
Does he know any of these things?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly do not pretend to be an 
expert on the education system in Newfoundland. However I did 
teach school and I do understand the school system. Having taught 
for 25 years, I have an understanding of what can happen.
<P>
	The key issue here is not the quality of education. The member 
for Gander-Grand Falls made that point quite clearly. The issue 
here is the way the referendum was conducted. A fuzzy question 
cannot be allowed in a referendum. We just went through that in 
Quebec. We are dealing with the same issue here, where a question 
is not self-contained and leaves itself open to wide interpretation. It 
is a flaw in the process. For that reason the motion should not be 
supported.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to address the motion today. In doing so I want to 
address what the motion is and is not.
<P>
	Let me explain why I rise to address the issue, an issue which in 
my opinion for the most part is a Newfoundland issue. It is an issue 
that the Parliament of Canada should  take seriously. Parliament 
however should not override the will of the province unless there 
are some compelling reasons to do so. It must keep in mind that the 
matter was referred to Parliament after being the subject of a 
referendum in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador as well 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3337"> 3337 </A></B>
<P>
as the subject of a unanimous vote of the Newfoundland House of 
Assembly. The referendum was not a legal requirement, but was 
conducted to gauge the wishes of the people. Also it was a major 
issue in the recent Newfoundland provincial election.
<P>
	I represent a Nova Scotia riding but my roots are in 
Newfoundland. I was born there and completed my high school 
education there. I returned after university to teach in a small rural 
community before returning to Nova Scotia to complete my law 
degree. I attended both the integrated system of four denominations 
and I attended the Catholic system. I taught in the integrated 
system in the community of St. David's in rural Newfoundland. 
Just a few minutes away, in another small community, there was 
another all-grade school run by another denominational school 
board.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	I am aware circumstances have changed since I attended school 
in Newfoundland and since I taught there some 26 years ago. 
However, many of the same inefficiencies created by term 17 still 
exist. The same divisiveness created by term 17 still exists. The 
same power struggle that has been ongoing in Newfoundland and 
Labrador for generations still exists.
<P>
	I have heard it said by those who oppose the changes to term 17 
that we are moving too fast, that we should slow down the process, 
that we should send this matter back to be reconsidered by the 
province. To those people I say no. With respect, this debate has 
gone on far too long. It is not a debate which commenced in 1995 
with the provincial referendum; it is a debate which has been going 
on for years, in fact for generations.
<P>
	For many of us who took part in this debate over the years, our 
concern is the amendments have not gone far enough. However, I 
am convinced that perhaps all that could be achieved has been 
achieved at this time and that we should move forward to pass this 
amendment.
<P>
	The answer is not further delay. The answer is action now to 
begin the process of reforming the Newfoundland and Labrador 
school system. It is time we put this matter behind us.
<P>
	Let me address what this legislation does not do. As other 
members have pointed out, lobbying on both sides has been intense 
and, like so many issues in the House, much of the information that 
has been circulated on both sides of the issue does not contain all of 
the relevant facts. In particular, the information about the quality of 
education in Newfoundland is unfortunate. Much of what we have 
heard is not true. In my view it is not the issue.
<P>
	The hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls expressed this point 
much better than I could, but I agree with him on the point of the 
quality of education in Newfoundland. However, the debate should 
not be focused on that issue. We are talking about efficiencies, we 
are talking about the cost and we are talking about other issues. I go 
on the record as agreeing with the hon. member for Gander-Grand 
Falls with respect to that issue.
<P>
	This amendment does not mean the end of denominational 
schools in Newfoundland and Labrador. This amendment does not 
abolish or extinguish denominational education in Newfoundland 
and Labrador. The new term 17 clearly states that subject to certain 
provisions all schools established, maintained and operated with 
public funds shall be denominational schools, and any class of 
persons having rights under term 17, as it read on January 1, 1995, 
shall continue to have the right to provide religious education, 
activities and observations for the children of that class in those 
schools. The bottom line is the amendment provides for the right to 
maintain religious education activities and observations in the 
schools.
<P>
	The qualification contained in section 17(b) states that any 
provincial legislation dealing with the establishment or continued 
operation of schools must be uniformly applicable to all schools, 
both interdenominational and unidenominational schools. In other 
words, the power to the legislature is qualified.
<P>
	The revised term 17 gives the Newfoundland legislature much 
greater control over such matters as school board boundaries, 
capital funding, school consolidation, student transportation and 
other administrative matters. The amendment removes some of the 
power from the churches and gives it to the duly elected 
representatives of the people. This debate is about power. More 
than that, it is about efficiencies, it is about reform and it is about 
better serving the interests of the students of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.
<P>
	I will speak about some of the things the amendment does not 
do. The amendment is not about adversely affecting or 
extinguishing minority rights in the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador. It is fair say this is an issue we all take very seriously. If 
there were, in the drafting of the new term 17, an indication that 
minority rights were being extinguished, I am sure the amendment 
would not have the level of support it presently has. It is my 
considered opinion this amendment is not a situation in which 
minority rights are being adversely affected or taken away by a 
majority.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	As previously stated in the House, there is no single 
denomination that dominates numerically. In this instance each of 
the seven main denominations is affected equally by the proposed 
changes. After the amendment has passed, if that is the final result, 
there  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3338"> 3338 </A></B>
<P>
will still be denominational schools in Newfoundland and Labrador 
and they will be entrenched in the new term 17.
<P>
	It has been suggested by some that by adopting this motion the 
House may be setting a dangerous precedent for future use. For that 
reason we must clearly state this amendment and this process is 
clearly set out in section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982.
<P>
	It is one of a number of procedures set out for amending the 
Constitution, each with differing degrees of difficulty. Under 
section 43 it is an issue between the national government and the 
provincial government and is limited to the case where a province 
approaches the federal Parliament for a bilateral change affecting 
that province only.
<P>
	By Parliament's agreeing to the request of the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador, we will not be binding future 
Parliaments to automatically agree to future requests under the 
same section. We certainly would not be binding future 
Parliaments to agree to any requests made under other amending 
sections of the Constitution.
<P>
	It warrants re-emphasizing at this time that any amendment 
made under section 43 will in no way threaten minority language or 
aboriginal rights, which cannot be changed bilaterally and which 
are entrenched and protected by other sections of the Constitution.
<P>
	We know there have been strong opinions expressed on both 
sides of this issue, from inside the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador and from without. These views have been expressed 
within our own caucus and this matter will be proceeding on the 
basis of a free vote.
<P>
	I acknowledge the views of both sides of the issue are genuine 
and deeply felt opinions. I do not want to suggest those who have 
opinion contrary to mine are wrong, but I wish to say to them we 
must put this matter behind us because it is in no one's best interest 
to see our communities and our families and our friends divided on 
the question of religion.
<P>
	We must put this public debate behind us and move to pass what 
is at best a reasonable compromise between those with differing 
views. The changes are needed, the process has been fair and the 
cause is right. I will therefore be supporting the motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I compliment 
my colleague, the hon. member for South Shore, on his very lucid 
and erudite comments on this matter.
<P>
	I compliment him particularly on his comments with regard to 
the protection of minority rights and what proposition 17 does not 
do. It bears repeating. The hon. member and I have a long history in 
fighting to protect minority rights. In both our support for this 
proposition there is an acknowledgement that neither one of us  
would support this if we felt minority rights were in any way under 
attack.
<P>
	With regard to religious education, it might come as a horrible 
warning for some of the people who are against the amendment to 
know that I am a product of Catholic religious education from age 5 
until I graduated with an honours degree in English literature at the 
age of 22. Be careful, gentlemen from the Reform Party, you may 
get in more trouble.
<P>
	That may account in some ways for the fact that I do speak very 
strongly for minority rights. Nonetheless, I want to put a specific 
question to my colleague from the South Shore.
<P>
	The hon. member for Delta spoke a few minutes ago a fuzzy 
question. I ask the hon. member for South Shore, a practising 
lawyer, what he thinks about the following question, whether he 
thinks it is at all fuzzy, as a practising lawyer, as a former 
schoolteacher, as someone born in Newfoundland.
<P>
	Does he support revising term 17 in the manner proposed by the 
government to enable reform of the denominational, educational 
system, yes or no? As it was put to the people of Newfoundland, I 
ask the hon. member for South Shore if he thinks this is a fuzzy 
question.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Mr. Speaker, with that preamble I dare not say I find 
the question fuzzy.
<P>
	I raised this question with myself. I raised it with the people in 
Newfoundland whom I called to discuss this issue. I read the 
question. I read the debate that took place in the House of 
Assembly in Newfoundland. I read the speeches of the premier at 
the time. I read the speech of the leader of the opposition at the 
time, Lynn Verge. It is an issue I took very seriously.
<P>
	If I thought for a moment the people of Newfoundland did not 
understand for what they were voting I would have some concerns 
in supporting this motion. There is no doubt in my mind, having 
reviewed the question, having reviewed the debates, having 
discussed the issue with residents. I am not saying we will not find 
an individual who may have been confused. I am not saying we will 
not find individuals who will say they did not realize this or that 
was part of the issue. On balance, I am happy with the question and 
I am happy with the result.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we share one unanimous concern and position on this 
side of the House regarding the amendment to term 17 it is that 
Newfoundland's educational system fully deserves to be 
modernized and reformed to make it more efficient and more 
responsive to a changing world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3339"> 3339 </A></B>
<P>
	However, if many of us on this side of the House have 
reservations about the amendment, some with very  strong 
reservations, it is not regarding the need for reform but the process 
used to achieve the worthy objective of reform.
<P>
	The Government of Newfoundland holds that a constitutional 
amendment is essential to achieve reform. However, eminent 
experts are convinced the required reforms are quite possible 
within the present framework of term 17.
<P>
	A framework agreement is already near reality. As recently as 
April 24, 1996, a mere five weeks ago, Newfoundland's education 
minister, Mr. Grimes, spoke thus of the framework agreement: ``I 
am confident this framework agreement will allow us, working 
with stakeholders, to assist in the planning, to move forward in an 
efficient and reasonable manner and be consistent with the 
objectives government set out prior to the referendum''.
<P>
	Today, only five weeks after, the Government of Newfoundland 
would have us believe no agreement is possible and were one to 
happen it would be challengeable in court. Learned constitutional 
expert Colin Irving disagrees firmly with this presumption.
<P>
	My strong objection to the present term 17 amendment relates to 
its real and potential effects on minority rights. Certain 
constitutional experts of high repute and credibility hold that in 
transferring to the legislative powers of the Newfoundland 
government certain prerogatives now enjoyed by specific parties 
by constitutional right, these rights and prerogatives are thereby 
diluted and left to the discretion and vagaries of any majority 
government of a provincial parliament.
<P>
	Reform, no matter how praiseworthy, must never happen at the 
expense of acquired rights. If any rights are diminished then the 
reform is flawed in its very essence. The Government of 
Newfoundland, as indeed our own federal government, holds there 
is no consequence or relation to comparable minority rights under 
the Constitution. I beg very respectfully to differ.
<P>
	Take the example of Quebec's religious educational 
commissions now protected under section 93 of the Constitution. It 
certainly would be one thing to amend this provision to implement 
linguistic boards-today in Quebec there is a consensus around 
linguistic boards-by enshrining these linguistic boards with 
equivalent protection within a constitutional amendment. It would 
be quite another thing to delegate any of the existing protections 
and safeguards now held under section 93 of the Constitution to the 
National Assembly of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	The important warning and caution expressed by Professor 
Patrick Monahan of Osgoode Hall Law School should not be taken 
lightly. I will quote: ``The amendment of Term 17 would create a 
risk to denominational school guarantees in other provinces that 
did not hitherto exist''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Such an important question should not be the subject of a 
two-day summary debate in this House. It should be the subject of a 
full debate and a thorough examination, which is certainly the case 
for any measure before any legislature in Canada.
<P>
	We must also take into account the fact that the referendum in 
Newfoundland was held at the end of the summer and that those 
opposing the issue did not have the necessary funding and 
infrastructure to argue their case. It was the big government 
machine supported by public funds on one side against the 
volunteers who were doing their best to fight a vague question that 
read as follows, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Do you support revising Term 17 in the manner proposed by 
the government to enable the reform of the denominational 
education system, yes or no?'' I know lawyers might find it very 
straightforward but I know a lot of ordinary Newfoundlanders who 
feel differently about it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Newfoundland government claimed it did not have to hold a 
referendum. However, having decided to do so, it had to give equal 
opportunity to its opponents, to ask a clear question and to avoid 
holding the referendum during the summer months. The result was 
a poor turnout of only 52 per cent of voters, 54 per cent of whom 
voted in favour of the government position, representing only 28 p. 
100 of the total number of eligible voters in Newfoundland.
<P>
	It is certainly not the most convincing exercise in democracy, 
especially when you consider what is at stake here, namely a 
constitutional amendment affecting minority rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Minority rights are our most precious cause. As a Liberal, I 
consider them paramount within the exercise of my mandate as a 
parliamentarian. There is no more sacred trust. No one can predict 
how the future will unfold. Of course it is always possible that my 
fears and concerns may prove completely unfounded. I hope so.
<P>
	However, if there should be the slightest risk that minority rights 
in this case may be impaired or that of other minorities be affected 
by creating a precedent, then the course of wisdom and equity 
becomes one of extreme care and caution.
<P>
	Having informed myself as faithfully and intelligently as I can 
on both sides of the issue, I am convinced the amendment as 
presently framed and worded has a real and potential impact on 
minority rights.
<P>
	As a committed Liberal, I cannot in all conscience support it and 
I intend to vote against it. Although I am  convinced the 
amendment will pass handily, with the Bloc and others voting for 
it, I keep hoping that before it is sanctioned, the voice of caution 
will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3340"> 3340 </A></B>
<P>
heard and there will be further debate and rethinking along the way 
so that a wiser solution may emerge.
<P>
	When minority rights exist and are involved, the precautionary 
principle should always and must always apply. When minority 
rights exist and are involved, wisdom and equity tell us loudly and 
clearly that we should make haste very slowly. May care, equity, 
wisdom and patience prevail in the end. The cause of minority 
rights deserves no less.
<P>
	Finally, I remind the House of the eloquent warning of a famous 
United States jurist, Ramsey Clark, who said some 20 years ago: 
``A right is not what someone gives you, it is what no one can take 
from you''. I can hear the voices of many of the groups affected by 
this amendment of Term 17 asking members of this House: What 
right have you, have us, have we, to be taking our rights, their 
rights away from us, from them? This in my view is a subtle 
question.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
would like to say that I find it amusing to have to defend an 
argument coming from the former fisheries minister, Mr. Tobin, 
because when he sat across from me we did not always see eye to 
eye.
<P>
	For that matter, I also find it amusing to be comparing my ideas 
or my view of Canadian democracy, or the democracy of each of 
the provinces, with a representative of the Liberal Party. He made a 
great point of saying that, as a good Liberal, he believed in 
democracy. But how is it that, when something does not suit 
members across the way, they always say that people took 
advantage of timing. They said the former premier held the 
referendum during the summer. The member also said that the 
question they used was vague. Why, then, did 54 per cent of the 
population of Newfoundland vote in favour? Someone must have 
understood something somewhere.
<P>
	All that aside, if the people of the province of Newfoundland 
asked themselves the question they wanted to ask-because we 
must not forget that it was, after all, the people of the province of 
Newfoundland who elected the premier of Newfoundland and the 
government of that province as being capable of governing them, 
of administering what concerned them-I believe that the present 
premier has everything he needs, just as his predecessor did, to be 
able to administer and to continue to do so as the public wishes.
<P>
	What I would like to ask is this: Would the member across the 
way not agree that once a province says that it has consulted its 
people, that it has agreed that democracy requires that Ottawa be 
asked to respect and implement the decision, it is wrong to question 
the validity of the referendum, to call into question the exercise of 
democracy in that province? I think it is insulting to the people of 
Newfoundland. They are mature enough to say what they want.
<P>
	What they are telling us is this: Let us implement what the 
referendum, the consultation of the public, told us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln: </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to start with a correction. 
I do think like a Liberal, but we are a democratic party here, one 
that is totally open minded. I have other colleagues, for instance 
my colleague stting to my left and my colleague sitting behind me, 
who think quite differently from me.
<P>
	In this party we respect each other, we are free to think as we 
wish. There is a free vote. Some will vote yea, some nay. That, to 
me, is democracy. I do not speak for all Liberals, I speak for myself 
alone, as a Liberal. I totally respect the views of my colleagues who 
think differently. That is what makes this party great.
<P>
	Second, on the question of 54 per cent of Newfoundlanders 
supporting the referendum, you are not too good at calculating. The 
majority is 54 per cent of voters. The percentage of 
Newfoundlanders who voted was 52. Taking fifty-four percent of 
fifty-two gives you 28 per cent of Newfoundlanders who voted in 
favour of this referendum. You have to admit, 28 per cent is a pretty 
small minority.
<P>
	I have no objections to the fact that there was a referendum. All 
that I am saying is that it is up to the Parliament of Canada to judge 
this question, under the Constitution. This is no longer the question 
of the Newfoundland legislature. Tody it is the Parliament of 
Canada which is discussing this, not the Newfoundland legislature.
<P>
	As a member of the Parliament of Canada, I must examine the 
entire issue, and I conclude that I do not consider it normal that the 
acquired rights of certain minorities be transferred from 
constitutional protection, from Parliament to a provincial 
legislature, whether it be the legislature of Newfoundland, Ontario 
or elsewhere, because at that point, the rights protected by the 
Constitution are watered down.
<P>
	That is my point of view. In fact, as I have said, I am 100 per cent 
in favour of the formation of school boards by language in Quebec. 
But I would not like to see the language protection found today in 
section 93 of the Constitution transferred completely to a 
provincial legislature, whether the party in power there is Liberal, 
PQ or any other party.
<P>
	That is my position and I am sticking firmly to it, but at the same 
time I respect the point of view of everyone else, including the Bloc 
Quebecois, and their right to vote in favour, for their own reasons.
<P>
<B></B>

<B><A NAME="3341"> 3341 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today on this amendment, because the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador have made their desire known, and I 
put it this way because I read it this way. I read it in the referendum 
question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On September 5 the people of Newfoundland and Labrador will 
be asked to vote on the following question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	No doubt Newfoundland's long transition from British colony to 
self-government, even if it was off by itself, forged qualities 
permitting Newfoundlanders to be described as a people. This 
people voted in a referendum to make this request. They therefore 
decided politically that they wanted the provisions of the 
referendum question put to them to apply in the future.
<P>
	While I am delighted to speak to this question to defend the 
political will of the people of Newfoundland, I would also like to 
point out that the Bloc Quebecois invited the Government of 
Newfoundland to use the occasion of the revision of its education 
legislation to, and I quote the letter our leader, Michel Gauthier, 
sent to the premier of Newfoundland. He said: ``The Government 
of Newfoundland should use the occasion of the revision of its 
legislation on education to ensure the francophones there have total 
control over their schools, both legislatively and administratively''.
<P>
	I would add that history, which I have been a student of at other 
times, the history of Quebec and Canada reveals that, in fact, the 
francophone minority, which Daniel Johnson senior called ``the 
French Canadian nation outside Quebec'', has always suffered the 
fate chosen for it by the government of the province in question. In 
fact, and I will look at this point in the time remaining, section 93 
originally intended to protect the protestant anglophone minority in 
Quebec, was cited on many occasions to protect francophone 
minorities. Nothing ever came of it, however. The bottom line is 
the pressure that may be brought to bear on each of the provinces.
<P>
	This is why we took this opportunity to ask the premier to give 
Newfoundland francophones full control over their schools.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that section 93 itself has a curious 
history. In 1866, while the Parliament of Canada was studying the 
bill to be recommended to London, Alexander Tilloch Galt, a 
member of the National Assembly for the Eastern Townships asked 
a francophone member there to introduce an amendment to protect 
the protestant minority in Lower Canada.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	When members saw that, they proposed a subamendment that 
francophone minorities in Upper  Canada be protected, too. May I 
remind you that, at the time, there were 165,000 Protestants in 
Lower Canada and 285,000 Catholics in Upper Canada, not all of 
them francophones, but 285,000 nonetheless. When the 
subamendment was tabled, Alexander Tilloch Galt, a member of 
Parliament, withdrew his amendment rather than see it applied to 
the Catholics of Canada West, most of whom were francophones.
<P>
	So how did we end up with section 93? Simply because 
Alexander Tilloch Galt was among the members of Parliament sent 
to Her Majesty to prepare what would become the British North 
America Act, and when Canadians saw this act, they found section 
93.
<P>
	Section 93 brings back the spirit of the amendment Galt wanted 
passed. It provides guarantees that the rights and privileges enjoyed 
by denominational schools at the time of the union will be 
maintained. Should these rights been infringed upon, an appeal 
may be made to the governor general, who can recommend a piece 
of legislation. If the province refuses, the Government of Canada 
may pass remedial laws. In fact, this section was invoked quite 
often to protect not English Canadians in Quebec but French 
Canadian Catholics outside Quebec and, may I remind you, used 
repeatedly and persistently without success.
<P>
	Let us look at the various cases, starting with the New Brunswick 
schools in 1871. By cutting all subsidies to separate schools, the 
New Brunswick legislature was forcing less fortunate Acadians to 
either accept double taxation or shut down their schools, under 
penalty of seizure. History has it that the superintendent 
responsible for enforcing the law was known to be, if not a fanatic, 
at least an extremist.
<P>
	Acadians, who had taken a stand for Confederation, against the 
Protestant majority, which, may I remind you, was in 
opposition-so much so that they had to be called to order by 
London-were convinced they would be successful in their appeal 
to the federal government concerning the application of section 93.
<P>
	Did Cartier not promote the Constitution, saying that the 
protection offered under the said section extended to all minorities? 
Imagine their surprise when Sir John A. MacDonald handed down 
his verdict, saying that New Brunswick's law was undeniably 
constitutional and that he had no cause or right to disallow it.
<P>
	Naturally, Quebecers took issue with this decision. On that 
occasion, historians became aware of Acadians again. The people's 
feelings were so inflamed that Sir George Étienne Cartier, the great 
Sir George Étienne Cartier, ran into trouble in the August 1871 
election, eventually being defeated.
<P>
	Without getting into details, suffice it to say that, to resolve this 
issue, Mgr. Taché had considered getting Louis Riel elected and 
then having him give his seat to George Étienne Cartier so that he 
could settle the matter  of the Metis as well as that of the separate 
schools in New Brunswick. This goes to show that this issue of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3342"> 3342 </A></B>
<P>
schools and their relation to the Constitution has always been a 
source of tensions in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	In 1895, the issue of schools in Manitoba again profoundly 
troubled French Canadians who accounted for half of the 
population of Manitoba, in 1870, and for close to a third, in 1890. 
In 1895, the government decided to abolish the French catholic 
school system, claiming once again that it was too costly. To 
Quebec's utter surprise, the compromise arrived at by Laurier, the 
first French Canadian Prime Minister, compelled French Canadians 
in Manitoba to levy a second tax on themselves to pay for their own 
school system.
<P>
	Imagine the indignation and the rebellion of English speaking 
Protestants if Quebec had even given a thought to doing the same 
for their own schools, even though they were not as numerous as 
French Canadians in Manitoba and, I might add, generally richer.
<P>
	In 1915-1915, it rings a bell, does it not?-Ontario passed 
regulation 17 essentially banning the teaching of French in schools. 
French speaking Catholics did not get any support from English 
speaking Catholics. This debate was extremely upsetting for 
Quebec, just at the time when the issue of the conscription of young 
people to serve overseas was stirring up a huge controversy in the 
population. I believe that English Canada does not know to what 
extent the issue of regulation 17 started the ball rolling towards 
Quebec voting against the government on conscription.
<P>
	The great French Canadians who, at that time, were defending 
Quebec, namely Henri Bourassa and Armand Lavergne, were 
linking both causes, and Armand Lavergne was one of the heroes in 
this fight. I will just read a quote from one of the speeches he gave 
in this House: ``If we must fight for our freedom, we must stay 
here. I am saying, and I do not care where my comments are 
repeated, that any French Canadian who enlists is not doing his 
duty-''
<P>
	That means that there was a link between the right to French 
schools and the teaching of French and the defense of freedom. It is 
that simple.
<P>
	Laurier, torn between Canadians and <I>Canadiens</I>, resorted to 
appealing to Canadians' sense of fairness with regard to enlisting: 
``If I ask that English be taught to the young people of my race, are 
you going to deny them that they also learn their 
forefathers'language? This is all I am asking, nothing more''. But it 
was too much.
<P>
	Prime Minister Borden, pushed into influencing the Ontario 
premier by French Canadian bishops, was told that ``any 
government giving in to French-Canadians would be thrown out of 
office within 24 hours''. The federal government passed the 
compulsory military service legislation during the summer of 
1917, against the  advice of Laurier, then Leader of the Opposition, 
and in spite of the agitation in Quebec. What was the result? You 
know what happened. In December 1917, there was an election, 
Borden was elected by a majority, but all of Quebec, except for 
three English ridings in Montreal, voted massively against him.
<P>
	For the first time, a government was elected without the 
participation of the French-Canadians. Quebec was highly 
criticized in English Canada, but New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
Prince Edward Island had also voted against the conscription party. 
It is in this context that J.N. Francoeur, whom certain hon. 
members do not know perhaps, presented his resolution.
<P>
	On January 17, 1918, J.N. Francoeur tabled a motion in the 
Quebec provincial legislature which raised quite a storm and which 
he withdrew on January 23, after having obtained results he 
considered satisfactory, given the circumstances; the motion 
stated: ``That this House thinks the province of Quebec would 
accept the abrogation of the 1867 covenant if other provinces were 
to consider it is an obstacle to the union, the progress and the 
development of Canada''.
<P>
	Why bring back these facts? I could go on and on. Because what 
happened afterwards, the Official Languages Act, and the charter 
later on, did not succeed in giving the federal government the 
power to ``protect'' minorities.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	History will show us that, even with the adoption of the charter, 
Catholic francophones who want to manage their schools will have 
to go to the Supreme Court. Basically, we take the opportunity 
given by this debate where we support the people of Newfoundland 
to remind them they are the only ones who can make a difference.
<P>
	We must remember that, when the Official Languages Act was 
passed, assimilation had wrought havoc, but since the act was 
passed and since the charter, assimilation has been increasing, in 
some cases, at an increasingly accelerated pace, as we learned 
recently from Statistics Canada.
<P>
	In the case of Newfoundland, it seems important to us for 
Premier Tobin to say clearly he will give francophones control over 
their schools and, while we respect the will of the people, we really 
think, hope, and wish that Newfoundlanders will take their 
responsibility, as Quebec did, and protect their minority.
<P>
	I think it must be recognized it is not the Constitution that 
protects English Canadians in Montreal and in the whole of the 
province of Quebec, but indeed Quebec's own charter, Bill 101, 
which recognizes rights that francophones are far from enjoying 
elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with some interest and was not sure whether  the member 
of the Bloc Quebecois was really speaking in support of the 
province and the people of Newfoundland. Often in this place 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3343"> 3343 </A></B>
<P>
members of the Official Opposition have shown very little 
sensitivity to the rest of the country.
<P>
	I will be brief in my question because I do not want to lose it in 
rhetoric. The issue for the Bloc Quebecois concerns the 
referendum. The Bloc and the hon. member know fair well that 
only 52 per cent of eligible Newfoundland voters turned out to 
vote. Of those who voted approximately 55 per cent or 28 per cent 
of the population voted in favour of the referendum question.
<P>
	Would the member care to admit to the House that the situation 
in Newfoundland in which a small minority of the population voted 
in favour of the question would be used by the Bloc Quebecois, by 
Lucien Bouchard and by the Parti Quebecois to support their 
contention that 50 per cent plus one of the voters who actually 
turned out to vote would be enough for Quebec to separate from 
Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I expected a question on the 
referendum, but not one phrased like this. It goes without saying 
that the Bloc Quebecois supports this referendum. It is in this 
House that I heard for the first time some say that it is not 
representative. Yet, the generally recognized rules of democracy 
were complied with. I did not hear anyone say it was a disgrace. 
When 52 per cent of the population votes and comes to a majority 
decision, you cannot say the referendum is not valid.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	In Quebec, as I recall, 94 per cent of eligible voters did vote. We 
are convinced that, in the next referendum, the same proportion of 
people will vote. We do not want to invoke this fact, this is not the 
reality to which we are used when it comes to the issue of 
sovereignty.
<P>
	As regards this issue, in Quebec, we have always strongly 
supported a democratic exercise involving the population. 
Obviously, we cannot compare the results of the referendum held in 
Quebec with those on the restructuring of the school system in 
Newfoundland, because the latter issue may seem less important to 
the general population. We cannot force people to vote.
<P>
	When the majority expresses its views and wins, we do not see 
why we should not recognize such a result. You may think the 
result was close, but just remember the extremely narrow margins 
in Europe regarding the Maastricht treaty. Decisions affecting 
major nations with a lot at stake were taken, based on differences as 
small as 0.05 or 0.06 per cent.
<P>
	We cannot question the results of this referendum, whereby the 
Government of Newfoundland seeks to be the sole and only 
government involved. I do not say this out of fear that the next 
referendum in Quebec might not draw a large percentage of voters.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleague from Mercier on her excellent 
speech. I listened to it with great attention.
<P>
	I noted that the speech dealt obliquely but nevertheless very 
really with the question of distinct society. Implicit in everything 
the member said was the recognition, at least I felt so, that the 
people of Newfoundland are a distinct society in terms of their 
traditions, their culture, their educational system and their religion.
<P>
	I was very much encouraged by the expression of support and 
confidence in the people of Newfoundland by the member. It is 
entirely appropriate in a question dealing with religion and 
education that she and the Bloc Quebecois support the premise a 
distinct society, whether defined by language or region of the 
country, has a right to have its need for self-determination heard 
and decided upon by the House.
<P>
	I take great encouragement in this point. I am the first one to 
agree that Quebec represents a distinct society and that 
Newfoundland is a distinct society as well.
<P>
	I ask the member to comment on the desire of the people of 
Newfoundland. Their national assembly through their provincial 
parliament, I point out to the member, voted unanimously to take 
this matter to the federal Parliament. It is not just a matter of a 
referendum. Indeed I think the referendum is a secondary issue 
here. It is a matter of the rights of a distinct society to have desires 
for change or for the status quo expressed by its government to the 
Parliament of Canada when the desires become constitutional 
issues. Consequently it is right and proper for Newfoundland to do 
it.
<P>
	I would be very interested in the views of the member.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps we could come back to the 
status of Newfoundland another time. Newfoundland was for a 
long time a distinct British colony. It is in 1949 only that its 
inhabitants finally decided to join Canada. I think this gave them a 
strong sense of belonging, something I can attest to. I have often 
been pleased to see that politics is as important for 
Newfoundlanders as it is for Quebecers. So I am told, when 
Newfoundlanders meet on Sunday mornings, discussions are as 
lively as they are in Quebec. So much for the first part of the 
question.
<P>
	I also know that Newfoundland, through its premier, strongly 
opposed the recognition of Quebec's distinct society, while the 
Newfoundland government is not seeking the recognition of its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3344"> 3344 </A></B>
<P>
own distinct society. On the contrary, the people of Newfoundland 
have tried very  hard since 1949 to define themselves as Canadians 
and to even assume the leadership of this Canadian nation in which 
Quebecers do not feel at home.
<P>
	Our history being different, if we support this motion it is 
because we are told that the people of Newfoundland voted for it as 
only they can do so. We ask them to take care of French speaking 
Catholics because provinces are ultimately the ones who can give 
French speaking Catholics a minimum of tools to slow down 
assimilation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak on this issue. There are three points that I wish to point 
out: first, the substance of the motion now before us; second, the 
issue of precedent; and third, the rights of francophones of 
Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On the matter of substance, what is before us is a request from 
the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador to amend the 
terms of the union, section 17, to have a greater say in the 
administration and governance of the school system in the 
province.
<P>
	I admit to a certain amount of sympathy for that. For instance, in 
the Ottawa-Carleton area which is essentially more populous than 
Newfoundland we have six school boards. Very often we hear 
people in the community griping about there being too many and so 
forth. Newfoundland which has a lesser population than the 
Ottawa-Carleton area has 27 school boards. One can imagine 
certain elements of administrative costs the government would 
perhaps want to better control. On that basis there is a certain 
amount of sympathy among the people of Ottawa-Vanier.
<P>
	The notion of trying to reduce the number of school boards 
seems to have some merit. From the arguments we have heard and 
the facts in this case, even the representatives of the various 
denominations that have control of the school boards have 
negotiated with the government to arrive at a different situation.
<P>
	I have been advised there was certainly a willingness on the part 
of the various representatives of the denominations to come to 
terms with what the government wanted to do. On the basis of the 
willingness to move it would indicate a need to do so. On the basis 
of the substance, therefore, I would be hard pressed to say there is 
no merit.
<P>
	The simple fact is that the government was elected and this was 
at the forefront of its campaign. It has the approval of an 
overwhelming and perhaps even unanimous majority of members 
of the legislative assembly. The fact that it is supported by all party 
leaders would indicate a certain amount of willingness to move in 
that direction and to modernize the school system in 
Newfoundland.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	On that basis I have to admit a certain amount of sympathy for 
the request.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As far as the question of precedent is concerned and the fact that 
a precedent could jeopardize the linguistic rights of minorities 
elsewhere in the country, I must say the answer to such a question 
is a firm no.
<P>
	The bilateral constitutional amendment that Newfoundland is 
asking us is possible pursuant to section 43 of the Constitution of 
Canada and does not affect in any way section 23 of the charter, 
which protects the rights of linguistic minorities. The amendment 
deals only with the situation of Newfoundland and gives the 
government the right to administer the school system. The right of 
church groups to operate schools is maintained.
<P>
	As for affecting the rights of linguistic minorities elsewhere, that 
would require the application of the amending formula we know, 
which requires seven provinces totalling 50 per cent of the 
population, as well as the application of the regional veto rule we 
imposed on ourselves and the agreement of the Government of 
Canada, which is not easy to obtain when it is to reduce minority 
rights. I can hardly imagine a situation or circumstances that could 
lead to such a change. And I am not alone to think so.
<P>
	I would like to quote the Minister of Justice who said in this 
House: ``The instance we have before us is profoundly different 
from what would arise with a proposal to change minority language 
or native education rights''. The minister made that declaration 
after consulting many experts. That is not to be taken lightly.
<P>
	I would also like to quote a text sent to the Department of Justice 
by the respected company McCarthy Tétrault. It was signed by Ian 
Benny. Here is what it said in English:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In our opinion there is no realistic possibility that use of section 43 by 
Newfoundland and Canada to enact a proposed constitutional amendment 
would have legal implications for minority rights in any other province or under 
the charter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Given these opinions, I would say that the rights of minorities in 
other provinces, particulary the rights of francophone minorities, 
are not threatened by the adoption of the resolution under 
consideration.
<P>
	I would now like to speak about the rights of francophones in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. At the present time, there is no 
francophone school board, despite sections 16 and 23 of the 
charter. This situation led, earlier this year, to a court challenge on 
the part of six individuals, the Fédération des parents francophones 
de Terre-Neuve et du Labrador, and the Fédération  francophone de 
Terre-Neuve et du Labrador against the Government of 
Newfoundland and that province's education minister. Since this 
case is now before the courts, I will refrain from commenting on it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3345"> 3345 </A></B>
<P>
	I will not, however, refrain from commenting on the fact that 14 
years after the passage of the charter of rights and freedoms in 
1982, there is still such a situation in Newfoundland. I was very 
encouraged by the remarks of the premier of Newfoundland, the 
hon. Brian Tobin. I would like to quote from an article that 
appeared in <I>Le Droit</I> on May 30 or 31. The article quotes Mr. Tobin 
as saying: ``Once the constitutional amendment required by 
Newfoundland has been passed, we will be able to make provision 
for a school board serving the francophone community of 
Newfoundland and Labrador''.
<P>
	A little further on, Mr. Tobin continues: ``I am prepared to see 
that the francophone minority of the province of Newfoundland 
and Labrador is given the means to manage in the province''. Let us 
therefore hope that the situation will be corrected before the 
fifteenth anniversary of the charter if this amendment is passed 
today.
<P>
	I would also like to add that last weekend I took part in the 
annual meeting of ACFO, the Association canadienne-française de 
l'Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	It is very interesting to note that the topic was not raised, even 
though the meeting took place on the eve of today's debate. I, 
however, took the opportunity to discuss the issue with a number of 
people who were there, and, on the whole, those I spoke with 
seemed to be in favour of the resolution before us.
<P>
	In conclusion, in light of what I have said about the substance, 
about the fear of setting a precedent, especially with respect to 
linguistic minority rights across the country, and on the strength of 
the argument advanced by the premier of Newfoundland, Brian 
Tobin, I would indicate that, in the vote later this evening, I will be 
supporting the resolution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened attentively to what my colleague has had to say. As you 
know, we in the Bloc Quebecois are rather concerned about 
francophone minorities.
<P>
	The hon. member has spoken reassuringly, and I trust that the 
government of Premier Tobin will take his words into 
consideration, and that the Bloc's concerns about this minority will 
be lessened as a result, when the time comes to effect the reform. 
School reform is a provincial responsibility.
<P>
	Despite his support of the project, the hon. member has not 
mentioned the referendum held in that province. That is what I 
want him to tell me. I would have liked to find out what my hon. 
colleague considers a democratic  majority in a parliamentary 
regime such as ours. Normally, a democratic majority is a plurality, 
that is 50 per cent plus one. Is my colleague questioning the 
legitimacy of the public consultation held by the Government of 
Newfoundland last September 5?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague is quite right. I did not 
raise the matter of the referendum, because, in my opinion, it has 
no place in this debate.
<P>
	What counts is what the Government of Newfoundland wants, 
the amending formula before us. The current Government of 
Newfoundland was elected with a platform that included this bill, 
this reform of the education system and bilateral amendment. They 
received a majority mandate. The fact that this support was 
reinforced by the other members of the Newfoundland legislature 
augurs well and that, given the amending formula chosen, ought to 
be enough.
<P>
	I understand my colleague tried to trip me up, to make me say 
things I did not want to. Unfortunately, he will have to try again, 
because it will not work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Cape Breton-The Sydneys, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me this evening to speak on the 
motion. It is an extremely important issue. I think we could say that 
about all constitutional amendments. This one has evoked a lot of 
interest and a certain amount of controversy.
<P>
	We are talking about term 17 and change thereto. In the 
Constitution Act, 1867 section 93 relegates education to the 
provinces but it does so with the proviso that we respect the 
denominational rights in the school systems and also the religious 
views.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	What we are doing here we are doing under section 43 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982. Where there is a bilateral interest where 
one or more provinces, but not all, wishes to make a change 
relating only to that province or provinces, the amendments have to 
be dealt with by the provinces affected and the federal government.
<P>
	In this case we have one province affected, Newfoundland. What 
we require is a resolution in the legislative assembly of 
Newfoundland, which we have. We also require, because the other 
party is the federal government, a motion through the Senate and 
the House of Commons of the Government of Canada. This is what 
we are doing at the present time, dealing with the resolution in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	We have to look at this very carefully. It has been said the 
resolution is a rubber stamp as far as the federal government is 
concerned. That is not true. It has been said this affects only 
Newfoundland and Newfoundlanders should be the ones to 
judge whether this part of the Constitution should be changed. 
That is not true.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3346"> 3346 </A></B>
<P>
	Newfoundland is a province of Canada. As such there is an 
interest of all Canadians in what takes place in Newfoundland. If 
it were just a rubber stamp, why would the federal government 
even be involved? Why not allow the legislative assembly to pass 
its resolution and then have it acknowledged by the House of 
Commons and the Senate? That is not the case. The federal 
government, through the House of Commons and the Senate, is 
asked to consider this resolution, which we are doing very 
carefully.
<P>
	There has also been a lot said about minority rights, that there is 
an infringement here of minority rights if we go ahead and pass this 
resolution. That is not true. There is an infringement on minority 
rights now as the matter stands in Newfoundland. The school 
system in Newfoundland is run by seven religious denominations. 
There are four separate school boards. Four of the denominations 
are in one school board, the integrated school board, and three 
other denominations have their own school boards.
<P>
	Here we have a province with a population the size of the city of 
Calgary spread over an infinitely wider area, with a tremendously 
large rural area, with an incredibly high unemployment rate and a 
low per capita income. We have four school boards, none of which 
is controlled by the province of Newfoundland. Where the minority 
rights are being infringed on now is that these seven religious 
denominations represent only 95 per cent of the population. 
Therefore 5 per cent of the population of Newfoundland does not 
have any school board representing its interests.
<P>
	It has been said this will affect minority language rights in 
Canada. That is not the case. Minority language rights are protected 
by section 23 of the charter of rights and freedoms. We have been 
told that if we pass this it will affect aboriginal rights. That is not 
true either. Aboriginal rights are protected by section 91.24 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867, section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 
and section 25 of the charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	We have been told that if we pass this, religious institutions in 
other provinces will be affected and their rights forfeited. That will 
not happen because this is a stand alone resolution affecting 
Newfoundland. Section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867 was put 
there to represent the four founding provinces of Canada. Each 
province that came in had its own arrangement and locked in. 
When Newfoundland came into Confederation in 1949 it wanted to 
have denominational rights entrenched in the Constitution. Now it 
wants that changed. That is not an unreasonable request, nor is it a 
request which will be unconstitutional.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	The Constitution represents the rights of the Canadian people. It 
also represents the powers of the federal and provincial 
governments. Section 91 talks about federal rights. Section 92 talks 
about provincial rights. Section 93  talks about education as a 
provincial right. What we are talking about is who is to have 
jurisdiction over education.
<P>
	Right now in the province of Newfoundland there are four school 
boards controlled by religious denominations, not by the province 
of Newfoundland. The province of Newfoundland pays the bills. 
The teachers are hired by the school boards. They decide what 
schools are to be built. They decide the curriculum.
<P>
	The province of Newfoundland does not have a constitutional 
power in its own province. The schools are controlled by religious 
institutions. How can we say the province of Newfoundland cannot 
make an amendment which would enhance the power it has been 
granted under the Constitution? It does not make sense.
<P>
	Not only that, there has to be accountability in education. Every 
province has a difficult time trying to get the departments of 
education to provide a level of education which is suitable, 
particularly to the parents, and which will be of benefit to the 
students. In this case there is no accountability. It is not that the 
churches do not listen to the people, but they are not accountable 
through the election process as are the provincial governments. The 
provincial government has to be held accountable for the education 
system in the province of Newfoundland. The only way it can be 
held accountable is if it makes some decisions and has some 
control.
<P>
	The province of Newfoundland has said it is not doing away with 
denominational education. There will be interdenominational 
schools and there will be unidenominational schools where the 
parents and the populations justify.
<P>
	The churches will still have a role in the curriculum. They will 
have a majority representation on the school boards. It is just that 
the school boards are to be reduced from 27 to 10.
<P>
	We are talking about a province which has lost 35,000 jobs in the 
fishery. What are these families doing with their children? They 
have to rely on a good school system. It is the future for their 
children. They cannot afford to send their children to private 
schools. It is vital the school system represent the hopes and 
aspirations of the people who are not able to work. They are 
looking for a future for themselves and for their children. 
Education is the future for the young people of Newfoundland. If 
there is to be a future, the province of Newfoundland has to be 
accountable. That is what this resolution is about.
<P>
	We want to pass this resolution. We want the province of 
Newfoundland to abide by what it has promised the churches, that 
they will be involved. It has tried since the royal commission of 
1992 to reach an agreement. They were not able to reach an 
agreement, and so this is the only way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3347"> 3347 </A></B>
<P>
	People say why not pass a resolution in the legislative assembly. 
If we do that we are open to an action on the Constitution. The 
Constitution will still say the denominational school system is in 
place and that the churches are supreme in education in 
Newfoundland. That is why we have to change the Constitution. 
It is a very reasonable request and I support it.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, again, I 
have to congratulate my hon. colleague for his first comments, 
when he put us on the track by saying that such a resolution should 
not be passed blindly and that every step needed should be taken to 
debate it. So, today, the debate held in Newfoundland is now in this 
House and everyone wishing to take part can do so. This is a 
principle I recognize and I am proud to tell him that I liked his 
comment.
<P>
	However, he avoided a basic issue, that is the recognition of the 
referendum held in Newfoundland on September 5. That is 
important. It is okay to talk about a school system and about 
minority rights, but it is out of the question to talk about a basic 
principle such as the recognition and the legitimacy of a 
referendum held according to the rules of democracy. Therefore, I 
ask my hon. colleague why so many members in his caucus are 
trampling on such a fundamental right, the recognition of a 
referendum held by citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is not about referenda. This is 
about education. It is about providing a suitable level of quality of 
education for the students in Newfoundland.
<P>
	There was no requirement for a referendum. The Government of 
Newfoundland called a referendum because it wanted to show it 
was serious about having good faith in this matter. I cannot really 
talk about a referendum because a referendum was not something 
called for, it was really not part of the process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member has made a very good presentation of the facts 
concerning the condition of the educational system in 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	This situation was created in 1949 when Newfoundland joined 
Confederation. It is not a problem that has occurred in the past year 
or in the past five or ten years-the member is nodding in 
agreement-but it is a problem which has been around for some 
time and has to be dealt with.
<P>
	I believe my facts are correct. Could the member enlighten me 
why in 1987 Newfoundland added two more boards to the already 
25 boards when it had this problem? Why did it make it worse 
rather than dealing with it? The problem must have existed in 1987. 
There must be an explanation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a mystery why two other 
boards were added, but it was a political decision. In hindsight, not 
all political decisions are what we would do at the present time.
<P>
	There are 27 boards in a province with a population of 
approximately 600,000 people. In rural areas having a school bus 
driving for miles until it reaches the denominational school of 
choice for a student is not in the best interests of providing the best 
level of education.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the major decisions are not made by the 
Government of Newfoundland which as government must be held 
accountable. Not only that but for every dollar put into a 
denominational school in one of the 27 school boards, the 
equivalent of that dollar has to be put into every other 
denominational school in that jurisdiction. If the roof leaks at one 
of the school boards, the other three school boards in the district get 
the same amount of money even though they do not need it. They 
put it in a bank account where it accumulates interest. The province 
has not been able to keep tabs on where this money goes or how it 
is spent. The situation is completely out of control. The accent has 
to be put back on giving the young people in Newfoundland the 
best education that they possibly can get for the dollar that the 
Newfoundland government can give them.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Ind. Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this debate.
<P>
	I would like to begin by going back to the very first piece of 
campaign literature that I put out in my riding, even before I was 
elected. At that time the constitutional debate that was evolving in 
the country was centred around the Meech Lake accord.
<P>
	The then leader of our party, Mr. John Turner, and I had a 
meeting about the riding of Broadview-Greenwood which had 
been NDP for some 25 years. I asked his permission to seek the 
Liberal nomination in that riding. I said: ``Mr. Turner, there is one 
issue that I would really like to make central in my campaign''. It 
had to do with the Meech Lake accord. I said that I would like his 
permission to campaign on the fact that the Meech Lake accord was 
flawed and needed amending and I wanted that to be a central part 
of the reason why I would knock on doors and seek that riding.
<P>
	Mr. Turner was very generous in his response. There was a 
nomination meeting which I won and I then began my campaign in 
Broadview-Greenwood. Just the other day I was handed that very 
first piece of literature which I put into the riding. The masthead of 
it states: ``Why I want to be your member of Parliament'' and 
underneath, which the person brought to my attention, I said: ``I 
believe in a strong national government, one that protects  minority 
rights and is sensitive to regional concerns. I am opposed to the 
Meech Lake accord because I believe that in its current form 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3348"> 3348 </A></B>
<P>
Meech Lake weakens the national government's ability to manage 
these concerns''.
<P>
	When this issue was put before us in January and we learned that 
we were going to be asked to debate this issue in the House of 
Commons, I immediately started seeking the advice and counsel of 
people far more learned than I in this whole area of constitutional 
law. I found out that there were some concerns with this 
amendment. Not only was there the question of minority rights but 
there was the question of the precedent that was going to be 
established through this process which could or might have an 
adverse effect in the future in other provinces of our country.
<P>
	Over the last few years the train of decentralization has been 
going very fast through this House of Commons. We have been 
dismantling, offloading, passing on responsibilities to provincial 
governments at a rate that I do not think many of us would have 
imagined possible.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	I speak as someone who has always believed that the national 
government should have the capacity to act in the national interest 
and should have the instruments to maintain that capacity. Many of 
these instruments are being changed dramatically and slowly but 
surely, in my judgment, we are becoming nothing more than a 
glorified think tank. We are giving away instruments which I 
certainly do not believe is going to serve us well in the long run as 
we try to hold the country together.
<P>
	No one in the House would argue that the status quo should be 
maintained when it comes to modernizing and reforming the 
educational system in Newfoundland. Nobody is talking about 
dictating or interfering with how that provincial jurisdiction 
manages education.
<P>
	A framework agreement was put in place to which the province 
had agreed in principal. When progress is being made and a 
framework agreement is in place, I wonder why the need for a 
constitutional amendment.
<P>
	I think of the progress that was made on the framework 
agreement. In spite of that there is this drive to put this through 
Parliament in almost one day. I wonder if members are studying 
and looking at the detail enough. I cannot for the life of me 
understand why, in the interests of giving everybody a comfort 
level, not just in the province of Newfoundland but other 
provinces, we do not take the time in committee to do that, 
especially when we know that we are setting a very dangerous 
precedent here.
<P>
	One of the things the Minister of Justice said in his speech on 
Friday was:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador has also tabled 
draft legislation by which it would be provided that unidenominational schools 
may be created where  numbers warrant and where the parents choose that for their 
children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have heard the same statement today from many members 
supporting this resolution. I have asked in the debate if members 
would support an amendment to the resolution that is now before 
the House that would reflect in specific terms those very words. It 
is with that in mind that I would like to move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended in the schedule entitled ``Amendment to the 
Constitution of Canada'':</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) by adding the words ``where numbers warrant'' immediately before the 
word ``any'' in paragraph (b)(i);</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) by adding the words ``determine and'' immediately following the words 
``observances and to'' in paragraph (c).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to put that amendment forward.
<P>
	In summary, I believe in the spirit of compromise. Many 
members in the House today have stated that there is a spirit of 
compromise. I am hoping that the government would see that and if 
it chose to support the amendment then it would go a long way in 
alleviating those minority rights that so many of us are concerned 
about.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment put forward 
by the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood is in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, by way of 
clarification on the amendment, the member would add the words 
``where numbers warrant''. Which body would decide if the 
numbers were sufficient? Would it be a school board, a church or 
the provincial legislature?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
following the exact resolution that has been tabled here today. It 
specifically enshrines the words the Minister of Justice used in his 
speech on Friday. It gives further definition to (b)(i). That further 
definition is exactly what the Minister of Justice stated in his 
speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I compliment my friend and colleague from 
Broadview-Greenwood on his very eloquent speech and for his 
well thought out amendment to the motion which will be voted on 
sometime this evening.
<P>
	As the issue was being discussed over the past 10 days, we heard 
from many quarters the results of changing the Constitution of 
Canada. The Constitution has been debated for many reasons for 
many years.
<P>
	We are changing an article of the Constitution. In the debate over 
the past 10 days we have heard that this will open the floodgates for 
constitutional change as it affects not only the province which was 
the last to enter Confederation, but Canada's many provinces 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3349"> 3349 </A></B>
<P>
particularly those in the west. They will have the opportunity for  
constitutional change such as the one before the House today.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	My friend has some knowledge in this area. Would he mind 
explaining to the House the potential for opening the floodgates 
with respect to this change and how it affects future changes to the 
Constitution of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for his generous remarks. I am not a constitutional expert 
so I do not want in any way to lead anyone to believe that my 
remarks are based on some deep constitutional study or thought.
<P>
	My concern has to do with the preoccupation in this Chamber 
and in other chambers across the land that the fiscal framework is 
the guideline for anything and everything. I have always believed 
that Canada's value system is something which is central to this 
Chamber. We are the legislative Chamber that is supposed to 
ensure that national standards are maintained, not just in education 
but also in health. National standards should be our driving force. I 
am concerned that as we compartmentalize and decentralize this 
country we are going to lose a lot of the thrust that has bound us 
together.
<P>
	When our forefathers started putting this country together, very 
little of it made any economic sense. We defied economic logic, 
brought this country together and made it work. My concern is that 
if all of a sudden, in the name of our preoccupation with the deficit 
and debt, we end up squeezing some of the more disadvantaged 
regions, which by the way exist in every province, and we lose 
sense of what pulled us together and the assets which have helped 
to make this country great, then before we know it there is going to 
be very little holding us together.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay: </B>No, it is a Liberal who spoke, now it is his turn.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the members. As my colleague 
has just pointed out, the member for Broadview-Greenwood 
spoke as an independent, not as a Liberal. In this case, we go 
around each time. It is now the turn of a member from the 
government side.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has 
been a very interesting debate with regard to the constitutional 
amendment which was tabled in the House on Friday, May 31 by 
the hon. Minister of Justice and Attorney General for Canada.
<P>
	This issue has been discussed among governments, school 
boards and members of Parliament for some time now. One of the 
things I found about this issue is that many different dimensions 
and many themes have evolved. A lot of those really depend on 
what point of  view one is taking. In listening to the argument, in 
looking at the research and in looking at the information that was 
received by all members of Parliament, a number of questions 
came to my attention just by looking at some of the basic facts.
<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
	I understand that a referendum was not necessary in 
Newfoundland. This particular amendment under section 43 of the 
Constitution Act does not require a referendum, but rather a 
bilateral change as a result of the will of the legislature of 
Newfoundland and concurrence or agreement by the federal 
government pursuant to section 43. However, a referendum was 
taken and that alone raises a question for me. Why was there a 
referendum? If it was not necessary, why did the Newfoundland 
government of the day decide that a referendum had to be held? It 
is an interesting question.
<P>
	We could carry this aspect of the referendum a bit further. We are 
wondering why Newfoundland held a referendum. Then we look at 
the fact that the referendum was called during the summertime, a 
time when people across Canada tune out politics and other 
matters. And why is it that the Government of Newfoundland did 
not campaign during the referendum campaign? The vote was held 
on September 5, 1995. These are the questions I have and I hope all 
hon. members will find the answers before they cast their votes 
tonight.
<P>
	There was a referendum which was not necessary. It was held at 
a time when people were tuned out. The government did not 
campaign for the referendum. However, every member who spoke 
in this place in favour of the term 17 amendment said how critical it 
was, how crucial it was for the poor kids in Newfoundland.
<P>
	I do not think we could find a person in this place who would 
argue against fixing Newfoundland's education system. We could 
ask for unanimous consent at this moment and get it. I am 
absolutely certain of that. The issue is not whether we should help 
the province of Newfoundland fix its education system, it is more 
than that. I am not exactly sure of all the details, but there is more 
to this. If we asked the people of Newfoundland today whether they 
wanted to fix the education system, 100 per cent would say yes.
<P>
	That begs another question which must be answered: Why did 45 
per cent of the people vote against fixing the education system? 
Only 52 per cent of the eligible voters turned out to vote on this 
very important issue. One hundred per cent of the people should 
have voted for it because it is so critical, yet only 52 per cent of the 
people turned out to vote. Of those who voted, only 54 per cent 
actually voted in favour of the resolution. Forty-five per cent were 
against it. I do not know what the answer to the question is. Why is 
it that such a large number of the people in Newfoundland whose 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3350"> 3350 </A></B>
<P>
education system is in a terrible situation voted against something 
which  obviously would have fixed it? There must be more to this.
<P>
	Newfoundland entered Confederation in 1949. As part of the 
terms of joining the union, its present system was established. 
There are presently many school boards and denominational rights. 
In fact, others have often said that all of these denominations 
represent 95 per cent of the people in Newfoundland and it could 
not possibly be some majority trying to do something to the 
minority denominations, that it must be something else.
<P>
	The problem started in 1949. There was no public school system. 
There were entrenched minority rights on a denominational basis. 
They were earned. There was a quid pro quo. They gave up 
something to have this and the other party gave up something to 
have this. That is the essence of negotiation. That is why they have 
a lengthy debate about the terms of union of Newfoundland.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	Some would say this is not an issue of minority rights. That is 
not true. in 1987, after so many years under the system, the 
Government of Newfoundland in its wisdom, having assessed its 
whole situation since 1949 right through to 1987, saw this terrible 
problem. What did it do? It came to Parliament and said it wants a 
constitutional amendment and it wants to add two more school 
boards, it wants to make the problem worse.
<P>
	It raises another question with me. If people have a problem with 
a school board system, why would they ask for changes to even add 
more school boards? It does not make sense.
<P>
	There must be an answer to this question. The issue of this 95 per 
cent of the people of Newfoundland as represented by the seven 
denominational groups is a very good trick in politics. It is 
intellectual dishonesty but it is a trick because it is using numbers 
to say something to make people think it is such a big number, it 
must be true. If people list all the denominations in the world, 
obviously they will add up to being the majority of the population 
of the world.
<P>
	In this case we have seven denominations with various boards 
associated with them, some 27. It is not so much that these 
denominations add up to 95 per cent. It is how those denominations 
voted as a block or as a group and who voted for and who voted 
against.
<P>
	There is a minority rights issue here. Ask anybody who knows 
anything about the situation that occurred during that referendum 
and they will say very clearly it was the Catholics and the 
Pentecostals who predominantly voted against term 17.
<P>
	The rest of them, as a block, consolidated their efforts. Those 
individual minorities became a majority of 55 per cent. As a result 
of that referendum, which was not  necessary, they made a decision 
affecting primarily the Roman Catholic church and the Pentecostal 
church.
<P>
	This is a clear example of a minority right acquired under the 
terms of union with Newfoundland when Newfoundland entered 
Confederation. That minority right is lost. The majority took it 
away.
<P>
	I looked at many of the letters. I have another question for all 
members. Can anybody explain to me why in late March and April 
a framework agreement was moving forward to address all these 
problems without the federal government, without the legislators?
<P>
	It was school boards and churches and government officials 
working together. We have all kinds of examples of the 
commission and the various other things. These things were 
moving along and then something happened.
<P>
	Once we had things in place that over a few months would have 
resolved most of the substantive issues related to the educational 
problems in Newfoundland something else happened. It was an 
election. It was a premier who had made some commitments, who 
had done something and said something and had a plan in place and 
we had an election. I do not know what the arrangements were. I do 
not know what the deals were. There are more considerations here 
than education.
<P>
	What happens to the assets of the various denomination groups 
that lost the referendum, that will lose their denominations rights. 
They own the buildings. They do not own the land. What can they 
do with them?
<P>
	Those are real problems to deal with. Were the people of 
Newfoundland, when they were asked to consider to vote in that 
referendum, given all the facts and figures? Were they told about 
the minority rights situation? Were they told about the 
constitutional implications? Were they asked about the future of 
minority rights as they relate to education, language and other 
aspects which they negotiated for? They were not.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	I asked the member to please help me answer the question. Why 
did 45 per cent of the people who voted vote against this? The 
member, who is supporting term 17, said it was ignorance.
<P>
	It is not ignorance. We must understand why 45 per cent of the 
people voted against term 17. It is a principle the Liberal Party has 
stood for time and time again through its history, fighting on behalf 
of minority rights. It is why I am a Liberal. I am here fighting for 
minority rights.
<P>
	Term 17 to me is not an education issue. I will do whatever I can 
and I know all members in this place will do what they can to make 
sure Newfoundland's education system is rectified properly. 
However, I do not want to see decisions made for fiscal expediency. 
That is what it really comes down to. We can put out a budget and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3351"> 3351 </A></B>
<P>
save $25 million. Let us just grab control of the  situation and 
placate this and we could have a public school system.
<P>
	The issues raised have been interesting, but they do not go to the 
heart of it. We need the political will and integrity to deal with the 
real issues, the real points of debate, minority rights. For all of 
these reasons and all the questions and concerns I have, I cannot 
support the constitutional amendment to term 17.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I start by making absolutely clear that I am not opposed to 
educational reform in Newfoundland. I also want to make it 
absolutely clear this is not a debate between those who support 
educational reform in Newfoundland and those who oppose it.
<P>
	To me this is a debate on how the federal government should 
respond to a request for an amendment from a province under 
article 43 of the Constitution, especially when that request deals 
with removing entrenched rights from the Constitution. That is the 
issue.
<P>
	I fully support measures to modernize Newfoundland's school 
system to make it more efficient and financially cost effective. 
There is no way I would support the status quo in Newfoundland, 
nor do I carry any brief for religious schools.
<P>
	I have very serious concerns with the substance of the motion 
and I have very serious concern with the process by which we are 
dealing with the motion.
<P>
	This is a serious constitutional amendment which removes 
certain entrenched rights. Yet we are dealing with it in two days. 
This motion was tabled in the House last Thursday, only four days 
ago. The debate started on a Friday, a short day when most 
members are on their way home to their constituencies. It has 
resumed today and we are to vote tonight; only two days on an 
important constitutional amendment which could have 
implications for other provinces.
<P>
	Let us compare this with our ordinary legislative procedure. On 
an ordinary bill dealing with mundane matters we have two 
debates, one on second reading and one on third reading, and we 
have committee hearings. The reason there is a committee hearing 
is to give an opportunity to those who oppose and to those who 
support the bill to put their views before parliamentarians where 
they can be asked hard, tough questions and cross-examined. By 
doing that through those hearings we sift out the truth with respect 
to certain questions. My colleague who just spoke posed several 
questions which need clarification.
<P>
	After all these years why do we have to proceed with this 
important motion in just two days without public hearings? I 
approached the table with the attempt to amend this motion to have 
public hearings on it for two weeks and then report back to the 
House on June 17, which would still give us a chance to pass it 
before the House adjourned. However, I was told that such an 
amendment would not be in order.
<P>
<B>(1855 )</B>
<P>
	We have been asked to vote on this tonight with many questions 
unanswered. The government might say there are no hearings on 
this because this is a motion, not bill. However, we have seen in the 
House occasions when there have been committee hearings on 
motions, including constitutional motions. I was on the committee 
that dealt with the motions dealing with the Meech and 
Charlottetown accords. Those were more comprehensive but 
nevertheless they were motions dealing with constitutional matters.
<P>
	I will now deal with the argument made by some that since the 
Newfoundland government has decided to request this amendment 
we should simply grant it and not interfere. In other words, we 
should act as a rubber stamp.
<P>
	That article 43 of the amendment formula requires the consent of 
both the federal and provincial Parliaments indicates we are not 
simply to act as a rubber stamp. Of course we must give weight to 
the debate and decision in Newfoundland, but we have an 
obligation to inquire whether all is in order, whether the entrenched 
rights are being given up by consent and to what extent there was 
agreement. Precedents are set in these matters and we have to 
ensure no oppressive precedents are being set or initiated in this 
decision.
<P>
	I raise some of my concerns with respect to this motion. If we 
had committee hearings on this matter it is possible these concerns 
could have been dealt with there. My first concern is with respect to 
the referendum. I know it was not necessary in accordance with 
article 43 that there be a referendum. All that was required was a 
resolution of the Newfoundland House of Assembly. However, the 
Government of Newfoundland decided to have a referendum and is 
now using the results of that referendum to support this 
amendment.
<P>
	However, we have to recognize that only 52 per cent of the 
electorate showed up for that referendum. It was held during the 
summertime. The proposal received only a 54 per cent approval. 
That means less than 30 per cent of the electorate in Newfoundland 
supports the proposal.
<P>
	It is also stated the referendum question was not clear, to which I 
think there is some truth. Some Newfoundlanders have told me 
they did not know whether they were voting simply on the reform 
of the system or for a constitutional amendment. Many who agreed 
to a reform of the system did not agree to give up their rights 
constitutionally.
<P>
	Unlike in Quebec, there was no referendum act, no provision for 
yes and no committees, no organization of the no and no funding of 
the no in an organized way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3352"> 3352 </A></B>
<P>
	All these questions lead me to believe there is a need for 
concern. Maybe there are answers to those concerns. That is why 
we should have public hearings through a parliamentary 
committee.
<P>
	The next point that raises concern is the framework agreement. 
Opponents to this provision have told us a framework agreement 
has been negotiated which deals with all the major faults in the 
Newfoundland school system and it has been agreed to by all the 
churches, including the Catholic and Pentecostal. That agreement 
reduces the number of boards from 27 to 10 and deals with other 
matters. They say these changes can be implemented by ordinary 
legislation and that a constitutional amendment is not necessary.
<P>
	There are different opinions on this. The Newfoundland 
government says it cannot do it without a constitutional 
amendment. Others, including eminent constitutional lawyers, say 
it can. Again, this is the sort of issue I would have been pleased to 
deal with in a parliamentary committee with committee hearings.
<P>
	My third concern is the Newfoundland government says that 
even if it were to legislate this framework agreement and even 
though the churches have officially agreed to it by resolution, it 
still could be challenged in the courts by individual church people 
and so on. That is correct. Anybody with money can go to court and 
challenge something. However, at a meeting I attended the other 
day where there was a very prominent constitutional lawyer 
present, he said that while one can challenge it, there is very little 
chance the courts would overturn such a piece of legislation to 
change, improve and modernize the Newfoundland school system. 
There is very little chance of success in challenging that in the 
courts. Again it is an issue that could be clarified by hearings in 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	My fourth concern is with respect to the proposed amended term 
17. The Government of Newfoundland said in statements that the 
proposed amended term 17 protects rights to minority religious 
schools and that religious schools will remain where numbers 
warrant. I should point out that nowhere in the proposed new term 
17, which is part of the resolution of this motion, are the words 
``when numbers warrant'' present.
<P>
	My colleague has introduced an amendment to put those words 
in the resolution but they are not in the resolution tabled by the 
Newfoundland government.
<P>
	The words that are of concern to people opposing this are in 
subsection (b) which say that religious schools will continue: 
``subject to provincial legislation that is uniformly applicable to all 
schools''. In other words, it is not a guarantee. It is subject to 
legislation in the assembly of Newfoundland. It does not seem to 
guarantee anything. Again that is an issue which could be clarified 
in committee.
<P>
	We are also told by eminent legal counsel that the Government 
of Newfoundland could have established real public schools before 
now had it wanted to do so. It does not need an amendment to the 
Constitution.
<P>
	A very important court decision in 1926 said that any province, 
because they control education, can establish parallel systems of 
public education in their provinces if they want to. It is the same 
with respect to French language schools. Under the present 
Constitution the province of Newfoundland could establish French 
language schools if it wanted to. It does not need this amendment.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to repeat that my objection to this motion is 
the process, and the implications for similar motions from other 
provinces. I am not opposed to the modernization and reform of the 
Newfoundland school system. I am fully supportive but why could 
we not have a limited period of public hearings? Why could we not 
have at least two weeks of public hearings until June 17 where both 
sides could have been heard?
<P>
	I ask the government to respect Parliament, and to adjourn this 
debate for two weeks, hold public hearings and return this motion 
to the House on June 17.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am amazed at what I am hearing.
<P>
	The Liberals, while in opposition, time and time again berated 
the then government for putting time limitation on bills and 
motions. They become the government and now members stand up 
and say this is a catastrophe, an affront to democracy. Two days to 
put a bill through this House. Time limitation out the door. Terrible.
<P>
	The government called time allocated twice on Bill C-33, the 
gay rights legislation. It shut off hearings, even in committee. 
Where were these members then? Why does it come to the floor of 
the House when it suits them?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should apologize. 
He should look at the record. I voted against time allocation on 
several occasions. I spoke against it on several occasions. If he 
wants the references I will send them to him.
<P>
	I agree with him that we use time allocation and closure too 
much and I have said that before. I voted against it before when it 
was a serious matter and I will do so again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate hearing that explanation from the 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
<P>
	The government House leader assured this Parliament shortly 
after the election that this government would use time allocation 
and closure far less frequently than the previous Mulroney 
administration did.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3353"> 3353 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1905 )</B>
<P>
	However, the government has used time allocation and closure 
more than the Mulroney government. Maybe the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce is not the culprit, but members will support 
it when it suits them and when it does not suit them they will 
support it. That is wrong.
<P>
	Why does the member not suggest that the government-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have supported time allocation 
too. I believe that when the debate is being abused by the 
opposition it should be used. I would agree that sometimes we use 
time allocation too quickly, but in this case time allocation has not 
been applied.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to answer the question 
which was put by the hon. member. I guess they are not interested 
in my answer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at last, it is my turn to speak. We have heard about every 
kind of statement that could possibly be made and it is obvious that 
members present things the way it suits them. For example, it was 
said that there was a referendum but that the participation was not 
high enough, it was summer time and so on and so forth. Yes, there 
was a referendum. Democracy was respected since everybody was 
allowed to vote.
<P>
	Now, if only 52 per cent of eligible voters did vote, it means that 
only 52 per cent were interested enough to vote on that issue, 
nothing more. A referendum must not be judged according to the 
number of people who vote. Was the referendum a democratic 
process? Yes, if all conditions were respected, if everything that is 
possible was done to have everybody on the list of voters, if all the 
polls were in place and if they were manned with sufficient staff to 
enable people to vote. That is what democracy is. It is not about the 
number of people having voted. With a 94 per cent participation, 
the referendum in Quebec was no more or less important than this 
one. It has nothing to do with it. What is important is the people 
who do vote, nothing else. What is important is that the people who 
want to vote are able to do so.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I forgot to advise you that, from now on, Bloc 
members will share their 20-minute periods between them.
<P>
	I heard the member for Carleton-Gloucester who spoke this 
afternoon. I am very happy to see that he is back on his feet, but I 
think the Chair should check the blues to see exactly what the 
member said. He tried to go after everyone and insulted all the 
members of this  House. The words he used in the House cannot 
even be repeated. I think what is also important to see is an attempt 
toclaim that protection is being sought for minority rights. But I 
say to someone who protected minority rights, our colleague who 
became an independent member has added an amendment saying: 
``where numbers warrant''. So, he has just limited the minority 
rights of francophones.
<P>
	What has been debated in the House for a few hours is the 
attempt to protect religion. Let us talk clearly about what we want 
to protect, that is, religious rights in Newfoundland. Simply put, we 
have no business in Newfoundland affairs. Section 43 that says 
how the Constitution may be amended.
<P>
	In this section, the process for amending the Constitution is 
outlined. The Newfoundland legislature expressed its opinion 
twice: once by a majority and, in all parties, there were members 
opposed to the motion, and recently, by an unanimous vote. The 
premier was accompanied by the opposition leader and the leader 
of the third party when he came to do his lobbying. Was there better 
lobbying in Canada recently? Usually lobbyists hide. The premier 
gave press conferences. He brought all his people with him. Why? 
Because he finds it extremely important for his province to be able 
to manage its education system. We have no business in there. He 
has met the terms of section 43.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	This afternoon, the member for Carleton-Gloucester said that 
there had been no consultation. There was a royal commission 
which issued its report and recommendations in 1992. As we know 
the churches are usually on the conservative side, and when the 
government tried in 1992 to negotiate with church leaders and see 
how they were going to implement the recommendations, these 
leaders decided not to take part in the modernization of the system 
in Newfoundland. The government then changed its mind and 
decided to request an amendment under section 43. Moreover, it 
added a referendum.
<P>
	I believe, as the justice minister himself was saying, that we 
must make an informed decision, and I do hope that the Holy Spirit 
will be at work until we vote, because some members need more 
help than others in this respect.
<P>
	If we look at the situation, we understand that since 1723, when 
schools were first established in Newfoundland, they have always 
been run by churches. It is obvious that in 1996, 250 years later, 
churches will have to make a decision, either to withdraw-this 
reminds me that when we, in Quebec, asked the council-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The legislative council.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> The legislative council. We got rid of it such a 
long time ago that I even forgot how it was called.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3354"> 3354 </A></B>
<P>
	When we applied to the legislative council to change our 
education system, we were told that would lead to total decadence. 
We wanted our own education department and all the rest. There 
has not been an increase in problems since then, but we can now 
carry out reforms and can keep the system up to date and change 
it anytime we want things to progress.
<P>
	Since 1723, churches have been in charge of schools, but each 
Church brings its own people to its own school. This afternoon, one 
Newfoundland member made a great speech explaining clearly that 
in his province, where the population is equal to that of Calgary and 
the territory is quite large, the system can no longer afford a 
situation where there are six schools in one municipality because 
there are six different religions and that the province wants to make 
some changes.
<P>
	I think we have to push aside all pettiness. We must not meddle 
in Newfoundland's affairs except to check whatever comes under 
our own jurisdiction. In my view, our jurisdiction is about two 
things. There is, first of all, section 43. Did Newfoundland abide by 
section 43? Yes. Section 43 states that we can amend the 
Constitution if the amendment applies to one province only.
<P>
	If some people fear that Quebec will use that precedent to deny 
rights to English-Canadians, they should not lose any sleep over 
that because the anglophones' rights are protected by the Quebec 
charter. The charter would have to be modified in Quebec City, not 
here, before we could hurt the English-Canadians in Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore, we would not ask Ottawa's permission to do so, we 
would do it directly in Quebec and accept the consequences of such 
a measure. You can sleep like logs all over Canada tonight and not 
worry, because the rights of anglophones are well protected in 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Better than anywhere else.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Better than anywhere else. That was another of 
those derogatory remarks by the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester who attacked the way Quebec deals with 
minority rights. I already said in this House that if French speaking 
Canadians outside Quebec were treated as well as anglophones are 
treated in Quebec, we would not have the problems we have right 
now.
<P>
	There is one thing, regrettably, which I feel is worth mentioning. 
Of course, the Bloc gave its support to Mr. Tobin when he came 
here. But we gave it with a slight reservation concerning the rights 
that are really threatened, those of French speaking 
Newfoundlanders.
<P>
	I have here the draft of a bill the Newfoundland government 
introduced on January 3, 1996. I certainly hope the final version 
will be more explicit concerning the protection of minority rights.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	I also have a copy of the documents concerning the legal action 
French speaking Newfoundlanders are taking before the Supreme 
Court of Newfoundland because their provincial government is not 
complying with section 23 of the charter. That is where the real 
problem is. Good intentions are there, apparently, but we are 
anxious to see how it will really turn out and through which means 
the rights of francophones will be protected.
<P>
	The province wants to create a school board that would include a 
three-member committee in charge of the French schools, the 
French language committee. The mandate of these three members 
is set out in clause 3, which includes six subclauses. It says that, 
within the curriculum established by the government, francophones 
will be able to make decisions regarding the aspects of the program 
that affect their language and their culture. It is a bit difficult to 
accept. How can you meet the needs of the francophone culture in 
an anglophone environment? They are limited to the curriculum 
established by the government.
<P>
	Another difficulty is the hiring of personnel that will have to be 
recommended by board members before the three francophones 
can approve them. We will support the resolution but not the 
amendment put forward by our colleague, and we hope 
Newfoundland will do whatever it takes to protect the rights of the 
francophone minority.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, near 
the end of her speech the member talked about Premier Tobin of 
Newfoundland coming to speak to the Bloc and to explain the 
situation. I am sure the member and all other members would agree 
that the Government of Newfoundland has conducted an 
extraordinary lobby of members of Parliament for support for this 
amendment.
<P>
	Would the member care to speculate or hazard a guess as to why 
the Newfoundland government did not participate or campaign 
during the referendum?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. Speaker, only 
the Newfoundland government can answer the question as to why it 
did not campaign during the referendum. I do not even know what 
referendum the member is referring to. There were quite a few of 
them in Canada. Which one is he referring to? If it is the last one, 
Mr. Tobin took an active part in the Quebec referendum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, following 
the example of my colleague, I would like to take part in this 
debate. We know that on September 5 of last year, the province of 
Newfoundland held a  referendum, and that this consultation dealt 
with the reorganization of the school system in that province. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3355"> 3355 </A></B>
<P>
Fifty-two per cent of the population voted in favour of the 
government's proposal.
<P>
	The consultation was carried out in an entirely legitimate 
manner. However, in order for it to be implemented, an amendment 
by the House of Commons is essential. We must therefore amend a 
section of the Constitution.
<P>
	For the province of Newfoundland, going ahead with the reform 
approved in this referendum will mean important changes to the 
system. In discussions, this government relied on a number of 
arguments, including the one that the existing system has led to a 
proliferation of small schools, often located very close to one 
another, and having very complex administrative structures.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	The issue of denomination also came up in this connection. 
However, with respect to the issue we are debating today, because 
everything concerning education comes under provincial 
jurisdiction, we need not concern ourselves with the actual manner 
of implementation.
<P>
	We should concentrate, I think, on how things were done during 
this referendum. The Government of Newfoundland submitted this 
question to the population. The latter responded to the question, 
and we know the results. It is therefore entirely legitimate for 
Newfoundland to expect the federal government to agree to amend 
its Constitution so that this plan can go ahead.
<P>
	Of course, many of the Liberal MPs who have spoken today, and 
on Friday as well, have refused to acknowledge that this 
referendum has any legitimacy. I am thinking, for instance, of the 
hon. member for St. Boniface, who has made a great song and 
dance about the question not being the right one. There are always 
questions about what is the right one. When will someone finally 
ask the right question, regardless of what referendum it is?
<P>
	It is the outcome which determines whether a question is good or 
bad. He interprets it as bad because it did not meet his expectations. 
If the Newfoundlanders had voted differently, the question would 
have been the right one, in his opinion. He has also referred to the 
fact that the financial outlay of the two camps was not equal, and so 
on, the same story over and over, and the same story that repeats 
itself when Quebec is asking questions about its future.
<P>
	Of course, we know that the federal government has already 
recognized, in 1948 for example, that 52.3 per cent of the 
population of Newfoundland had said yes to joining Confederation. 
Why then today would we claim, as the hon. member for St. 
Boniface has said, that this figure is not sufficient? He will reply 
that not enough people voted.
<P>
	So when, do you think, can we satisfy these people? It is very 
difficult. We might as well say no other referendum should ever be 
held again. We might as well say: ``Let us allow the courts to 
decide our future for us. Let us allow the House of Commons to 
adopt whatever it wants, and not to take public consultation into 
consideration''.
<P>
	As a Quebecer, I must wonder a few things about this motion. 
Last September 5, for example, did the Prime Minister, or his 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, or some MP in his group 
describe the question as the right one? Did they analyze it? Did 
they put it under a microscope? No. In the course of discussions, 
we have not looked at the question. Today, we are to consider the 
matter and then vote on an outcome. Now, however, is the time to 
analyze it. I think it is a bit late to do an analysis.
<P>
	Did the Prime Minister of Canada tell Newfoundlanders whether 
he considered the question legitimate or not? No. He did not raise a 
finger over it. There was no mention of it either in any debate in 
this House. The 52 per cent was accepted.
<P>
	Today, however, the figures are being questioned. Of course, 
when it involves Quebec, does this country called the finest in the 
world have a double standard-and I think we have to ask the 
question? I think so. When a province besides Quebec is involved, 
a double standard is acceptable.
<P>
	Quebecers of all stripes, with a few exceptions perhaps, agree 
that they alone may decide their future.
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	Of course, we know the leader of the Liberal Party in Quebec. He 
is probably the exception to the rule, because, recently, he voted 
against Quebecers' right to decide their own future. Will a rule be 
made because he said these things? I think not.
<P>
	On a number of occasions, the current Prime Minister also said 
he would see about the question put to Quebecers at the next 
referendum. Did he write the question for Newfoundland's 
referendum on September 5. We are entitled to ask ourselves. They 
want to take a stand when Quebec is concerned, but do they do the 
same thing for other provinces?
<P>
	In the words of the Prime Minister, what is the acceptable 
majority? With only 52 per cent of registered voters in 
Newfoundland exercising their right, the resulting majority was 
enough for the province to consider the referendum legitimate.
<P>
	In Quebec, 94 or 95 per cent of the population voted, and a 
favourable outcome would not have been accepted. One thing is 
sure, when Quebecers say yes to a sovereign Quebec, we will have 
to remember that a majority there has always been simply 50 per 
cent plus 1. We will not let a minority decide our future.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Ind. Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the member's remarks and his 
concern concern about double standards. I would like to address 
that point.
<P>
	Earlier this evening I put forth an amendment in the House 
which was accepted and will be voted on later this evening. 
Essentially the amendment puts into the (b) amendment we are 
debating the exact words from the mouth of the Minister of Justice 
on Friday and the premier of Newfoundland in his press conference 
last week.
<P>
	Where numbers warrant we would be providing the same test for 
the establishment of denominated schools in conformity with 
section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which 
also reflects the express intention of the Government of 
Newfoundland. In other words, these matters can be settled by an 
objective test either by agreement or by the courts.
<P>
	Will the member and all members of the Bloc, for that matter, 
support the amendment where numbers warrant? It establishes the 
same condition or the same opportunity that would be afforded to 
minority rights related to French schools in Newfoundland which 
the premier of Newfoundland verbalized when he had his private 
meeting with members of the Bloc. Will they support the 
amendment before the House this evening?
<P>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion: </B>Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois' position is very 
clear. First of all, we gave our support to the motion tabled by the 
Government of Newfoundland, because we want to respect the 
referendum. The people have expressed their opinion and we 
respect the majority. However, we have some concern about 
minority rights.
<P>
	That was brought to the attention of the Government of 
Newfoundland. It was told that minority rights should be further 
protected when it proceeds with its reform. But it is up to 
Newfoundland to make this school reform. That is up to the 
provinces. But we are asking Newfoundland to respect minority 
rights. However, the amendment proposed by my colleague brings 
absolutely nothing to the debate. It brings absolutely nothing, 
except that he is simply trying to make political hay for himself, at 
the expense of the people of Newfoundland.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Ind. Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member was the one who referred to a double 
standard. Why will he not support an amendment that, when put 
into the body of this constitutional amendment, will give not only 
denominational schools but also the French minority in 
Newfoundland an enshrined position?
<P>
	Why does the Bloc run away from something being enshrined in 
a constitutional amendment when it is right before the members?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion: </B>No, Mr. Speaker, once again, to be very very clear, 
of course, Quebec will not intrude in the decisions Newfoundland 
will have to make.
<P>
	We will not intrude in these decisions, because it is for the 
province to make its decisions. What we are asking is for minority 
rights to be totally protected.
<P>
	You never took into account the law of the majority when you 
were on the other side, my dear colleague.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to speak about the implications of amending Canada's Constitution 
at the request of Newfoundland's legislature.
<P>
	I would like to thank the Prime Minister for allowing a free vote 
on this vital issue. I respect that most of my colleagues from this 
side of the House do not see this resolution as I do.
<P>
	In my view, this initiative has implications for all Canadians. 
The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has initiated this 
proposed amendment in order to improve the quality of education 
in the province by maximizing the effectiveness of the use of 
taxpayers' dollars. This is a goal we all respect.
<P>
	This issue also has deep implications regarding the rights of 
minorities. There is no question that education is a matter of 
provincial jurisdiction. Education was just as much a matter of 
provincial jurisdiction in 1949 as it is today. Nonetheless it was 
included in the Constitution at the time.
<P>
	Changing the Constitution is very much a part of federal 
jurisdiction and respect for the rights of minorities is one of the 
federal government's responsibilities. What we are talking and 
voting about today is not just education, but changing the 
Constitution and not just any provision in the Constitution.
<P>
	The constitutional provision securing the preservation of 
educational rights for religious minorities was a very specific and 
important condition with Newfoundland and Labrador joining 
Confederation. Entrenching educational rights was the underlying 
basis under which many voted in favour of joining Canada. It is not 
a provision that should be lightly cast aside.
<P>
	As elected parliamentarians, we have respect for the people's 
will. When the people of a province indicate their desire through 
their provincial legislature or a referendum, what is the 
responsibility of the Parliament of Canada?
<P>
	Some would argue that to vote against a change that has been 
approved in a referendum and by a provincial  legislature impedes 
the will of the majority. Sometimes a constitution requires it. 
Indeed, the purpose of a constitution is to circumscribe the ability 
of a majority to impose its will.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3357"> 3357 </A></B>
<P>
	Due to the Constitution, my parents who are immigrants to this 
country, have the same rights as my children who are eighth 
generation Canadians. Their rights are not determined by the will 
of a government when it suits them.
<P>
	The Constitution of Canada clearly states the conscience of our 
nation. Each individual's rights and freedoms are clearly spelled 
out. It is not something that is easily constructed and it should not 
be something that is easily changed.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	Some would say that the provision we are discussing tonight 
affects only Newfoundland and Labrador. Since a majority of that 
province's legislators and its electors support it, it should be 
approved. One of the prime purposes of a Constitution is to secure 
the rights of minorities. The rights of minorities in any part of the 
country are important to Canadians in all parts of the country.
<P>
	That is why this is not just a question of law. It is a question of 
fairness. Legally Parliament has the right, with the legislature of 
Newfoundland and Labrador, to implement this change. But 
fairness demands that we seek to maintain the respect for 
minorities that was the basis for Newfoundland and Labrador 
joining Confederation and the basis for all Canadians choosing to 
be part of this country.
<P>
	When we are dealing with minority rights it is difficult to say we 
are not diminishing those rights when we change them over their 
objections. If we were to ask the minorities and they agreed to 
relinquish their enshrined rights, then that is another consideration.
<P>
	This is not the case today in Newfoundland. It is easy to see why. 
The impact on religious minorities can be considerable. In 
Newfoundland, the Protestant population is more than 51 per cent. 
Other groups are less likely, based on their numbers, to warrant a 
school in their community. Busing will not necessarily be provided 
to the school of the parents' choice. The parents of Roman Catholic 
or Pentecostal or Seventh Day Adventists children may be left with 
a stark choice: send their children to an interdenominational school 
or pay to send them to a unidenominational school out of town. 
How then do we maintain respect for minority rights when some 
may be able to afford to do this and others may not?
<P>
	While making this possible for the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador to pursue the educational policies it 
believes are right for the people that province, the answer I believe 
can be found in the statement issued April 18, 1996 by the 
province's minister of education,  Roger Grimes. In it he stated that 
``a framework agreement has been reached after extensive 
discussions between department officials and denominational 
educational councils to consolidate 27 boards into 10 and to 
establish a single provincial construction board''.
<P>
	This statement, issued just six weeks ago, stated that the 
agreement in principle would allow the new school year to 
commence with reforms in place. The government had complete 
authority over all matters, and has, relating to curriculum, sex 
materials, number of teachers, funding, teacher education, 
performance standards and so on.
<P>
	I recommend that the Newfoundland government go back and 
start with this agreement in principle and build on the progress that 
has been made.
<P>
	It is important for all members to consider what will happen 
when other premiers request that we proceed with amendments. 
Will the same principle apply? Or will we recognize here and now 
that a majority must respect the rights of the minority, referenda 
notwithstanding?
<P>
	I believe a Constitution is where Canadians, regardless if they 
are part of a majority or a minority, can feel safe that the rule of law 
and their constitutional rights will be respected. Regarding 
reforming or modernizing the school system in Newfoundland, 
everyone agrees. Could this reform not be achieved without a 
constitutional amendment? It is ironic that the concerns of those 
who help complete Canada in 1949 are being ignored.
<P>
	As the minister stated that the involvement of churches in 
making administrative and economic decisions in the education 
system of Newfoundland have been a matter of controversy for 
generations, I agree. This also was the case before the terms of 
union were signed in 1949. Precisely for this reason were these 
rights enshrined in the British North America Act of 1867. It was 
based on the understanding that Parliament would guarantee that 
the legislature would not change the terms at its convenience.
<P>
	Given that it took two referenda to bring Newfoundland and 
Labrador into Confederation with 51 per cent of the vote, it is 
obvious how important this guarantee was. Now the discussions 
between the Newfoundland department of education and all 
denominational groups have resulted in a solid framework for 
reform, including the establishment, as I said earlier, of the interim 
school boards in preparation for the consolidation of school boards 
from 27 to 10, a single construction board and a single busing 
system ready to be implemented for September 1, 1996.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	If it is a question of someone challenging this agreement, we 
could send it to the Supreme Court and ask it for an immediate 
ruling to see what the consequences of this move would be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3358"> 3358 </A></B>
<P>
	These agreements provide the basis for reforming the school 
system while respecting the rights of minorities. We should 
demonstrate a decent respect for the resolution passed by the 
provincial legislature, but Parliament's role is not simply to act 
as a rubber stamp. It is our responsibility to form an independent 
judgment.
<P>
	We are at a crossroads in our history. Last October a premier 
tried to impugn a group of Canadians who did not agree with him. 
He blamed them for the loss and repudiation of what he saw as his 
divine right. That is not what Canada is about. We cannot take 
lightly our Constitution which dictates our rule of law and we 
cannot ignore the rights of minorities. That is one of the reasons we 
have a Constitution.
<P>
	It is important that we send out a clear and concise message that 
the Canadian government is consistent in its dealings and that the 
integrity of the Canadian Constitution is not questioned.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bonnie Hickey (St. John's East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
comment concerns the rights of minorities under the Constitution 
and the proposed amendment that the resolution will impose the 
will of the majority on the minority.
<P>
	The resolution affects 95 per cent of the population. There is no 
effect on minorities. All children in Newfoundland will benefit 
from this resolution. It is fair for all those affected. Fairness is the 
overall goal in this resolution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ianno:</B> Mr. Speaker, I respect the hon. member who is from 
Newfoundland. I know she has often supplied wise counsel.
<P>
	When we are talking about minority and majority we have a 
breakdown in which 51.7 per cent of interdenominational schools 
are Anglican, Salvation Army and Presbyterian. They are working 
together and have been for years. The Catholic population is 37 per 
cent and constitute 41.5 per cent of the student population. The 
Pentecostal population is 7.1 per cent and constitute 7.3 per cent of 
the student population, and 0.1 per cent of the population are 
Seventh Day Adventists.
<P>
	If the numbers are added up, 44 per cent of Newfoundland's 
population negotiated in 1949 to ensure that the majority would not 
in any way change the agreement. After years-some have said 
since 1700-the same education system has existed. However, the 
concern, the reason for the negotiated settlement on why 
Newfoundland would come into Confederation impinged on the 
agreement and the ability for this right that minorities would not 
lose their rights within the educational system.
<P>
	Taking that into account, it is 95 per cent taking in seven 
educational systems. However, the minority, the three of them are 
voting against it. What we have here is the opportunity to work 
with the minority, to get its  agreement. We have a framework 
already. If it agrees to the change, we will send that agreement to 
the Supreme Court to ensure it cannot be cast aside if the minority 
agrees to it. At that point we have a very solid foundation to reform 
the education system to ensure that our children in Newfoundland 
do much better than anywhere else in the country.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	Some $600 million is the budget for the school system in 
Newfoundland and the savings proposed by this amendment is $25 
million. With the framework set forth, the single busing, the 
construction board and the consolidation from 27 to 10 school 
boards will easily save $15 million. We are talking about a 
difference of $10 million.
<P>
	On that basis it is well worth spending money to ensure minority 
rights are maintained.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Trinity-Spadina has very nicely laid out some 
facts that the House as a whole did not realize very clearly for some 
time.
<P>
	We have been told often that the seven denominations represent 
95 per cent of the population of Newfoundland and therefore we 
cannot have a minority issue.
<P>
	The member for Trinity-Spadina indicated-and I want him to 
confirm it again-what really happened during the referendum. 
Not only did 52 per cent of the eligible voters turn out to vote. The 
Government of Newfoundland, which has been lobbying so 
aggressively today, did not work during the referendum to secure 
support.
<P>
	In fact we have a cluster of denominations that have pooled or 
consolidated their support and outvoted three of the denominations. 
It is very important that we dispel the myth about 95 per cent, stop 
playing with numbers and get the truth.
<P>
	Perhaps the member for Trinity-Spadina can answer the 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ianno:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. I will try to 
answer it by talking about minority rights. As an individual I 
supported constitutional changes. I supported the Meech Lake and 
the Charlottetown accords. More recently in the House I supported 
distinct society and the veto. Because of minority rights I also 
supported something that was not in the Constitution, a human 
rights amendment, Bill C-33.
<P>
	It is consistent with what I said earlier to the hon. member. 
Whether a referendum or a legislature, if the majority is speaking, 
it has to be taken into account, especially when minority rights are 
enshrined in the Constitution of the land, to ensure that somehow or 
other minority rights are not left out of the equation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the discussion we are having today  brings testament 
to the fact that this is not a rubber stamping of the issue. It is a good 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3359"> 3359 </A></B>
<P>
and fair discussion on the merits of an issue. A lot of information is 
being brought forward.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned that within the concept of a 
framework agreement we would be able to resolve many of the 
issues we are discussing today.
<P>
	Would the hon. member acknowledge that currently there is no 
framework agreement, that the framework agreement was a 
proposed discussion paper and that unfortunately the parties did not 
come to a conclusion in those discussions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ianno:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess we have a framework that was 
agreed to by the minority, the Roman Catholic Church, the 
Pentecostal and the Seventh Day Adventists.
<P>
	As stated on April 24, 1996 by the minister of education, my 
understanding is that it is the beginning of a framework. 
Somewhere down the line the Anglican bishop withdrew his 
support, according to some of the advocates of this amendment.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	Nine or ten points have been agreed to, especially the parts 
concerning money. As I mentioned earlier, we are discussing a 
savings potential of $25 million which can go back into the 
educational system in Newfoundland to better educate our 
children. I agree with that.
<P>
	People refer to high illiteracy in Newfoundland. When we take 
into account a budget of $600 million and the reason for the high 
illiteracy referred to by some advocates, $25 million should have 
been spent long ago to ensure that illiteracy was not a concern.
<P>
	Recently the minister of education stated that the difference 
between Newfoundland and the rest of the country in terms of the 
educational system was really a myth in the minds of many. He also 
stated that in terms of the higher levels of education Newfoundland 
universities and colleges were doing extremely well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we know, 
on September 5, 1995, the Newfoundland government held a 
referendum on denominational schools in that province. These 
denominational schools are guaranteed under term 17 of the 
agreement signed by the Government of Canada and the 
Government of Newfoundland setting the terms and conditions for 
Newfoundland's entry into Confederation in 1949.
<P>
	I would first like to talk about the referendum. The referendum is 
a modern tool for activating democracy. It allows the people to 
settle important issues. The province of Newfoundland decided to 
hold a referendum and it won. Some of the members here in this 
House are challenging the figures and percentages involved.
<P>
	All the people of Newfoundland were invited to participate and 
to vote. Everyone knew about the referendum. People were free to 
vote or to abstain. Whatever their reasons for voting or for not 
voting, the referendum was held and it was won by the government, 
which is something we should not forget.
<P>
	The international standard for winning a referendum is 50 per 
cent plus one. Referenda are a modern tool used throughout the 
world. I think that people and governments-including the central 
government, to which I will come back later-should respect the 
decision made by the people of Newfoundland.
<P>
	When I was young and starting my studies at the Granby CEGEP, 
I learned one principle of the political system: vox populi vox dei, 
which means the voice of the people is the voice of God. I think 
that when governments and their leaders go to the people and the 
people decide, their decision must be respected. So the people have 
spoken.
<P>
	There are still two levels of government in Canada. We still have 
the federal government, which, because it feels superior, likes to 
tell the provinces what to do.
<P>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
	They have this big brother attitude of always trying to interfere, 
always having something to say about the decisions we make and, 
in this House, to demonstrate that, here, due process is followed, 
while in other Parliaments, well-
<P>
	Given that Newfoundland has met all the standards, I think all 
this Parliament has left to do is to assent by saying: ``Yes, we 
agree''.
<P>
	Federalists, at the federal level in particular, have this attitude of 
always wanting to pass judgment on what is going on elsewhere 
and claim to be more politically correct than the others. But it is not 
true. The various legislatures are acting, indeed taking some very 
important actions.
<P>
	Must I remind you that education comes under provincial 
jurisdiction and that the federal government has no right interfering 
with this jurisdiction?
<P>
	If, at this point in its history, Newfoundland has decided to 
amend its school legislation, I think that we should support this 
decision. We in the Bloc Quebecois have a concern however and 
this concern is about minorities. As you know, there are minorities 
in Newfoundland, and I would like to read you this brief excerpt 
from the letter written to Mr. Tobin by our leader, the Leader of the 
Official Opposition and member for Roberval:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, we are concerned about the inadequate school rights of 
Newfoundland's French speaking minority. Therefore, we strongly hope that </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3360"> 3360 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>your government will take the opportunity provided by the restructuring of the 
school legislation to give francophones in your province, through legislative and  
administrative means, full responsibility for the management of their schools.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think it is important at this stage to remind our friends in 
Newfoundland that they must have as much respect for their 
minorities in their province as we do for ours in Quebec. Must I 
remind this House of the fact that, in Quebec, the school system is 
organized on linguistic bases? There are therefore two school 
systems in Quebec. The minority has its own schools, which it 
controls and manages, including elementary schools, high schools, 
colleges, and two universities, one in Montreal and another outside 
of Montreal. It also controls English hospitals in the Montreal area.
<P>
	Quebec has always be a model for the rest of Canada in terms of 
respect for its minorities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To my English friends who are listening to us tonight and to 
members of the House I say that someday there will be a 
referendum in Quebec and we expect to win that referendum. There 
is a tradition of democracy in this country; it has always been a 
democracy.
<P>
	The Parliament of Quebec which is more than 205 years old, the 
oldest in Canada, has always shown the tradition of democracy. 
When the time comes, when we have our referendum and we win it, 
when we decide to finally become a partner, a good neighbour and 
a friend with the rest of Canada, I am sure we will be able to grow 
together side by side in harmony as Canadians and Quebecers 
because of the tradition of democracy in the country. When that day 
comes I am sure it will be the end of all the sterile discussion that 
has lasted for 30 years. Quebecers and Canadians have had enough. 
We will have our referendum, and when the time comes I am sure 
democracy in this land will prevail.
<P>
<B>(2000 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Ind. Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the member and I took him at his word when 
he said he was going to make sure that the letter from his leader to 
Mr. Tobin demanded that French minority rights be respected in the 
province of Newfoundland. That essentially is what my 
amendment is all about. It is asking that where the numbers warrant 
that those minority rights be respected.
<P>
	Does the Bloc member support the amendment to the 
constitutional amendment? It would ensure that the very words his 
leader put in his letter to the premier of Newfoundland are put into 
the constitutional amendment so that those minority rights not just 
in terms of the French language but also other minority rights are 
protected.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, the proposed amendment 
says ``where numbers warrant''. Without interfering in the 
jurisdiction of the Government of  Newfoundland, I say the change 
will result in savings to the province and there is no need for the 
qualification ``where numbers warrant''. Either you give rights to a 
minority, or you do not.
<P>
	When the francophone Fathers of Confederation, those 
representing Quebec, joined the federation, they were promised 
that the new territories would all be bilingual. As you know, the 
Upper and Lower Canada, as well as the other two 
provinces-three provinces took part in the discussions, but only 
two immediately joined Confederation; Prince Edward Island 
followed a little later-had had discussions to the effect that future 
provinces would be bilingual.
<P>
	Officials representing Lower Canada voted in favour of joining 
by a majority of just a few votes. No referendum was held at the 
time but, had one been held, Lower Canada would never have 
become part of Canada. We can only speculate about what might 
have been; the past is the past. I simply want to say that the 
francophone Fathers of Confederation literally got taken. Why? 
Because when new territories opened, they were supposed to be 
bilingual-given the mentality of the time, people believed what 
they were told. However, each and every one of the new provinces 
adopted special laws and abolished anything that was French. They 
gave francophones a hard time. In some regions of Canada, French 
speaking minorities have literally been fighting for their rights for 
125 or 130 years. They survive and they fight.
<P>
	If the Government of Newfoundland wants to show its good 
faith, it will protect its minorities. There is no need for a 
qualification such as ``where numbers warrant'' Either you protect 
minorities or you do not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak on the subject before us today, following the 
example of my colleagues, particularly my eloquent colleague, the 
member for Shefford, who is, to top it all, bilingual. I will admit I 
am a bit intimidated by his performance, but I will do my best.
<P>
	This motion was presented by the Minister of Justice. It deals 
with the future establishment of denominational schools in 
Newfoundland. The denominational system was guaranteed by 
term 17 of the agreement between the federal government and the 
government of Newfoundland, when Newfoundland entered 
Confederation.
<P>
<B>(2005)</B>
<P>
	In order to amend such a term, it is possible for a province to 
invoke section 43 of part V of the Constitution of Canada dealing 
with the rules for amending the Constitution. This is what 
Newfoundland did, by passing legislation in a particular context. 
This legislation was passed after consulting the public.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3361"> 3361 </A></B>
<P>
	This is where it departs somewhat from the short history of 
using section 43 of part V of the Constitution of Canada. It was 
the first time a government consulted the public to give weight 
to its action. Section 43 has been used on three other occasions 
in the recent past.
<P>
	In the case of Newfoundland, the results of this public 
consultation gave the following results: 52 per cent of the public 
turned out to vote and 54 per cent supported the government's 
action. According to what we are told, the Government of 
Newfoundland has a number of objectives in mind.
<P>
	First, it wants to rationalize the province's education system and 
thus save $17 million. Second, it would like to have a single 
education system, instead of four based on the recognized 
religions, the last on the list being the Pentecostal Church, which 
has already been the subject of a section 43 application. If it is 
successful, Newfoundland will have a single school system serving 
all denominations. Finally, it would like to reduce the number of 
school boards from 27 to 10, and make them multidenominational.
<P>
	Where this initiative is of definite interest to Quebecers is in the 
lessons to be drawn from the democratic basis of the process as a 
whole. The federal government, via its Prime Minister, 
immediately and apparently unhesitatingly recognized the 
referendum and its result, although the participation rate was only 
52 per cent, and support for the government's plan only 54 per cent.
<P>
	In the context of Quebec's and Canada's political evolution, this 
is, I believe, an action that speaks volumes, and one that is totally 
representative of the desire of the Prime Minister and the Liberal 
Party to recognize the democratic process of what went on in 
Newfoundland in connection with the denominational schools 
issue.
<P>
	You will understand that, as sovereignists, we are legitimately 
and spontaneously moved to transpose the debate held in 
Newfoundland, and the government's attitude toward it, to the next 
steps taken by the Government of Quebec and the people of Quebec 
concerning its desire-this time, we are convinced, a fulfilled 
desire-to finally cross the threshold to sovereignty. We are 
counting on the same spontaneity, the same logic, the same justice 
from the federal government in acknowledging the democratically 
expressed desire of the people of Quebec to finally be a sovereign 
people.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that, in this undertaking, the federal 
government did not in any way whatsoever, despite what it is now 
claiming, intervene in the wording of the question or in the 
procedure for acknowledging the results only provided there was 
such and such a percentage-there was none of that. The province 
of Newfoundland was allowed to consult its population and the 
democratic process was recognized. We ask no more than that. That 
is what democracy is.
<P>
	That is, after all, how a democratic tradition is built. It is by 
recognizing and recalling the highly democratic events of the past 
that the rules of the game that have to be respected are built up over 
time.
<P>
	In this regard, we have to give Newfoundland credit for doing 
what it did, for doing what it did in 1949, when once again it taught 
us something by consulting its people twice and ending up with 
52.3 per cent of the population of Newfoundland voting in favour 
in 1948-49 of joining ranks with Canada and of leaving the United 
Kingdom behind.
<P>
<B>(2010)</B>
<P>
	With the nevertheless close result of 52.3 per cent in favour, we 
can assume that some regions in Newfoundland voted against 
joining Canada. Was Newfoundland then divided up according to 
the regions that voted in favour and the ones that voted against? Or 
did they respect the will of the majority of Newfoundlanders to join 
Canada in 1949? They respected the whole of Newfoundland as so 
they should in a democracy, without all the present kerfuffle, 
particularly on the part of the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, who, with the least possible subtlety, is advocating the 
partition of Quebec the day after a vote in favour of sovereignty.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that there is in this debate 
something I find disappointing and aggravating, namely the 
reaction of Mr. Tobin, the premier of Newfoundland, who was a 
minister in Ottawa, a seasoned parliamentarian who was elected 
here when he was 25, and left to become premier at 40; he had 15 
good years here in Ottawa. He is quite able to understand Quebec's 
and Canada's problem. And yet, he stoops to such simplistic 
reactions as the one reported in <I>Le Devoir</I> of May 30.
<P>
	I will quote from an article by Jean Dion entitled ``Tobin elated 
by the Bloc's position'' which says: ``Brian Tobin believes that by 
supporting the constitutional amendment requested by 
Newfoundland, the Bloc Quebecois, and with it the sovereignist 
movement as a whole, proves that the rule of law must prevail in 
Canada under any circumstance. I believe that the leader of the 
opposition is stating his faith and confidence in Canadian laws, 
said Mr. Tobin, adding that it will now be difficult for those who 
say that the law is not important to prove it. If the law is relevant 
when Newfoundland requests an amendment, it must be equally 
relevant when any other province is seeking to amend its 
constitutional status''.
<P>
	Third quote: ``In this respect, he promised that Newfoundland 
would wholeheartedly support Quebec if it wanted similar changes. 
He even invited Mr. Bouchard to take full advantage of the 
amending formula which only requires bilateral agreements in 
certain cases, and of the nature of the federation to get the changes 
he wants within the federation''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3362"> 3362 </A></B>
<P>
	I am very disappointed by such comments, because they imply 
that, in order to abide by the rules, there must be rules. But, in 
the Canadian Constitution, there are no rules on how to secede. 
How do you expect us to respect the rules? And that explains the 
whole approach and the ridiculous debate which was launched by 
Mr. Bertrand and which is increasingly jeopardizing the 
government position, since the federal government has supported 
this approach.
<P>
	The people and the Government of Quebec are ready to abide by 
the rules, as long as there are some rules. Unfortunately, there are 
no existing rules, except for the rules of international law that will 
some day govern Quebec's accession to sovereignty.
<P>
	The second thing that irritates us is the lack of information, 
given Mr. Tobin's previous position on the problems between 
Canada and Quebec. We know that the debate has been going on for 
some thirty years now. My personal reference point is the 
Laurendeau-Dunton Commission which as early as 1963 concluded 
that there were two solitudes.
<P>
	We have someone here who has had ministerial or similar duties 
for 15 years in Ottawa and who still treats Quebec as just another 
province and completely disregards the fact that, when we talk 
about the people of Quebec and their demands, we talk about a 
nation, and more specifically one of the two founding nations of 
Canada.
<P>
	There is absolutely no comparison possible between a premier 
who so cavalierly shrugs off a democratic process and talks about 
bilateral agreements between Quebec and the federal government 
and the debate we, the sovereignists, have been holding for the last 
15 years, since we are talking about the survival of the French 
speaking nation of Quebec.
<P>
	Talking about administrative agreements with the almighty 
central government, especially when it is ruled by the Liberal 
Party-to whom all the institutions seem to belong, I could give 
you a lot of examples from my riding-and reducing Quebec's 
evolution towards its sovereignty to some mere bilateral 
agreements will not help to elevate this debate. We will use a 
democratic approach to ensure that Canadians and Quebecers 
realize how important this issue is and how important Quebec's 
impending sovereignty is.
<P>
<B>(2015)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
drew a parallel between the referendum in Newfoundland and past 
and potential future referendums in Quebec. He talked so much 
about the need to recognize the democratic rule and so on.
<P>
	If we vote down this motion tonight, that is the end of this 
motion; it is finished, it is dead, it is gone, it will not be revived.
<P>
	Since we have had two referenda already in the province of 
Quebec, both of which have failed, why will the member not 
respect the right of the majority that has already expressed its 
desire to remain within Canada? That has been the expression of 
the democratic will of the people in Quebec. Why do his party and 
he not accept that and continue on in the way they have been until 
they think they will get the opposite opinion?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for his question. It is precisely because we are democrats that we 
respect the two referendums that we went through in Quebec. We 
are democrats; we are here after being defeated. If the people had 
voted yes, we would not be here. We are here because the people 
voted no and we will continue a process that probably started right 
after the 1760 conquest.
<P>
	Quebecers have never accepted defeat. We are part of a great 
civilization, the French civilization, and we have never accepted 
defeat. We could give history lessons all day long if we wanted to. 
There have been many sovereignist movements in the history of 
Quebec, but they were never as well organized, as powerful as 
today's sovereignist movement, which first came to power in 
Quebec and then became the official opposition in the federal 
Parliament. This is unprecedented and shows the great progress 
made by the people of Quebec toward full emancipation. This 
should not be so difficult to understand.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bonnie Hickey (St. John's East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his speech this evening and recognize 
the use the Newfoundland government made of the process of 
consultation.
<P>
	Between 1990 and 1992 the Newfoundland royal commission 
received a total of 1,041 written and oral presentations, which 
represents 3,677 individuals and 384 groups. Consultation was 
widely spread in Newfoundland from corner to corner. I thank the 
hon. member for mentioning it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
comment. That is precisely why we readily support this bill, 
because it rests on an overwhelmingly and profoundly democratic 
basis. I do not know what more I could say. We are pleased with it 
and we hope and trust that the Government and the people of 
Canada will acknowledge and respect the same democratic process 
Quebecers, notably the sovereignists, are putting themselves 
through, because you must know that, as sovereignists, we could 
very well just use the same  traditional British parliamentary rules, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3363"> 3363 </A></B>
<P>
using Parliament to effect sovereignty at goodness knows what 
political price.
<P>
	We have accepted for many years now, as a rule, the need to have 
a public consultation process in which a majority of Quebecers will 
hopefully vote for sovereignty, but we are nevertheless accepting 
this rule for ourselves. It important to realize this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
the House today to give my support to the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador's wishes to amend term 17.
<P>
<B>(2020)</B>
<P>
	When Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949 the terms of 
union were very specific to that province. Term 17 guaranteed the 
rights and privileges of the religious school system as they existed 
in 1949. Today the Anglicans, Presbyterians, Roman Catholic, 
Salvation Army, Seven Day Adventists and United Church 
denominations hold the same rights they held in 1949.
<P>
	In 1987 these rights were also extended to Pentecostal 
denomination. Since that time Newfoundland's educational system 
has been organized along these lines and administered by 
individual churches or groups of churches. Today Newfoundland 
and Labrador has four separate education systems and 
administrations serving a population smaller than that of the city of 
Calgary, dispersed over several hundred small communities.
<P>
	The amendment to term 17 would permit the removal of costly 
inefficiencies and would free up resources which will inevitably 
lead to extensive improvements in Newfoundland and Labrador's 
future educational system.
<P>
	The province of Newfoundland and Labrador can no longer 
afford to continue with its current educational system, and unless 
its system is reformed the quality of education will continue to 
decline. The Newfoundland and Labrador school system has 
resulted in a large number of small inefficient schools. The 
following statistics have been quoted a number of times but they 
warrant repeating.
<P>
	The province has 27 overlapping school boards governed by four 
denominational groups or groups of denominations. Some students 
are bussed to a school of their denomination even if they live next 
door to a school of another denomination. In addition, 
Newfoundland and Labrador has the country's highest illiteracy 
rate and its students have significantly lower average scores on 
international and standardized testing despite the fact that a higher 
percentage of its total expenditures is spent on education than that 
of any other provinces.
<P>
	The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has decided 
removing cost inefficiencies and freeing up resources rather than 
spending additional money is the  most effective way to improve its 
education system and provide its students with an opportunity to 
compete on an equal footing with other Canadian students.
<P>
	Amendment to term 17 would permit the province to do this and 
will lead to extensive improvements in its future educational 
program. The reforms will streamline the present overlapping 
denominational school boards into 10 interdenominational boards. 
The role of the churches in operating school boards and schools 
will be reduced and many schools are expected to become 
interdenominational with all students having the right to attend.
<P>
	However, schools for specific religious denominations will 
continue to exist where they are requested by parents and where the 
number of students warrants doing this. Religious activities and 
education will continue to be a core element in the province's 
school system.
<P>
	In 1992 a royal commission concluded that the Newfoundland 
and Labrador school system was in need of reform and the 
government immediately entered into intense negotiations with the 
church leaders. These negotiations took place over a three-year 
period, after which time the government was unable to reach an 
agreement with church leaders. Recently a last ditch attempt by the 
province's minister of education on key elements of the 
educational system also failed.
<P>
	The government did not act arbitrarily in this matter, nor can it 
pass educational legislation under term 17 to diminish the 
educational rights held by churches.
<P>
	On September 5, 1995 the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador held a referendum on the proposed changes to term 17. 
The referendum question was clear and direct: ``Do you support 
revising term 17 in the manner proposed by the government to 
enable the reform of the denominational education system, yes or 
no?'' It was direct and not in any sense misleading.
<P>
	Despite the extensive campaign mounted by the no side and the 
government's policy of actively not campaigning, 
Newfoundlanders voted in favour of the proposed amendment by a 
margin of 54.83 per cent to 44.95 per cent.
<P>
	On October 31 the Newfoundland House of Assembly adopted a 
resolution which seeks to amend term 17 of the terms of union. The 
matter was brought into the House as a government measure with 
relaxed party discipline. There was support from all parties in the 
House and the resolution passed by a margin of 31 to 20. The 
Newfoundland and Labrador government is seeking to modernize 
its existing educational system to achieve better education for its 
students within its available financial means.
<P>
<B>(2025 )</B>
<P>
	At the same time it is determined to preserve the denominational 
character of the system. The government  does not intend to 
eliminate term 17 to abolish denominational education or to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3364"> 3364 </A></B>
<P>
extinguish the role of the churches in education. Single 
denominational schools can continue where the numbers warrant.
<P>
	Those who speak against term 17 attempt to cast it as an 
infringement on minority rights. This suggestion is preposterous. 
The rights provided for in term 17 are common to all 
denominations holding them, and those denominations collectively 
represent more than 95 per cent of the province.
<P>
	The proposed changes will affect all in precisely the same way. 
Those opposed to those changes argue each denomination is a 
minority. This is an argument that can be made about any 
constitutional or legislative change affecting several groups that 
were each less than 50 per cent of the population. The simple fact is 
the proposed change will affect the eight denominations making up 
95 per cent of the population in precisely the same way. The true 
minority, the remaining 5 per cent, will have its position slightly 
enhanced.
<P>
	By amending term 17 the government will neither abolish 
denominational education nor extinguish the role of the churches in 
education, as I have said before. The role of the churches will be 
modified to allow for the establishment of a more efficient system 
of interdenominational school boards while preserving a role for 
the churches in religious education, activities and observances.
<P>
	Also, the 5 per cent of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians who 
do not currently hold term 17 rights will actually see their rights 
enhanced under the new system. I repeat this because I think it is 
very important. This is because religious education for all groups 
may be provided in the interdenominational schools. In the present 
system if students do not belong to a religious group operating their 
schools, they have no rights to their own form of religious 
education. Students who do not wish to participate in a form of 
religious education will not be forced to do so and parents will be 
allowed to decide whether they want their children to participate in 
the program.
<P>
	Term 17 is unique to Newfoundland and Labrador and is a matter 
that both the Newfoundland and federal governments believe to be 
purely the concern of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
Changes to the school system in Newfoundland have no bearing on 
the status of denominational schools in other provinces because 
education falls under provincial jurisdiction and the majority of 
provinces have different constitutional provisions respecting 
denominational involvement in education. In each case the 
province entering Confederation decided on its respective 
denominational involvement. Newfoundland has ended up as the 
only province without a secular public system.
<P>
	As term 17 affects only the province of Newfoundland, it can be 
amended under section 43 of the Constitution  Act, 1982 which is 
used for amendments that apply to one or more but not all 
provinces. In such circumstances an amendment can be made when 
a resolution authorizing the amendment has been passed by the 
legislatures of the provinces or provinces affected and 
subsequently by the House of Commons and the Senate.
<P>
	The denominational rights in question in Newfoundland and 
Labrador have a different history and constitutional context than 
those in other provinces. There is no direct counterpart to term 17 
in any other province. Denominational rights are protected by 
section 93 of the Constitution of Canada and by individual terms of 
union in the remaining provinces. These arrangements are in no 
way altered or affected by the proposed changes to term 17. The 
situation in Newfoundland and Labrador with regard to 
denominational involvement in the school system differs 
significantly from the system that exists in any other province.
<P>
	For example, the province has the only exclusively 
denominational school system in the country. Furthermore, in no 
other province do churches have such a degree of control over 
matters relating to capital expenditures, school construction, the 
hiring of teachers and related matters.
<P>
	In the House of Assembly in Newfoundland and Labrador all 
political parties unanimously agreed to adopt the resolution. We in 
the House of Commons should respect the wishes of the people of 
that province.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have great respect for my hon. friend. Twice in her 
remarks she said that religious schools will continue under the new 
proposed term 17 where numbers warrant. I have before me the 
wording of the new term 17. Nowhere in it do I see the words 
``where numbers warrant''. Maybe I am not reading it correctly but 
I would appreciate it if she would tell me in what paragraphs the 
words she referred to are found.
<P>
<B>(2030)</B>
<P>
	On the other hand, I must say what I do see is that the 
continuation of religious schools will be in accordance with 
subparagraph (b) subject to provincial legislation that is applicable 
to all schools. That is quite a different thing.
<P>
	If I am wrong, I would appreciate her telling me where it says 
that religious schools will continue wherever numbers warrant.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I do not have the 
wording of the amendment in front of me. My understanding from 
a reading of it is that where numbers warrant, denominational 
schools will be permitted.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans,

with the letter from the Leader of the Opposition, the hon. member 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3365"> 3365 </A></B>
<P>
for Roberval, to the premier of Newfoundland, Brian Tobin, in 
particular where the Leader of the Opposition says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Your government proceeded by way of a referendum and a majority of voters 
supported the amendment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Bloc Quebecois has decided to support Newfoundland's decision, since 
it was made in compliance with recognized democratic rules.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like the hon. member to tell me if she will work within 
her caucus, so that it accepts the result of a democratic referendum 
on the sovereignty of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. member will agree 
with me that the question on the sovereignty of Quebec has no 
resemblance at all to the referendum question on the term 17 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with honour that I rise this evening to express my views on the 
constitutional amendment to term 17 of the Newfoundland and 
Labrador terms of union.
<P>
	I intend to support the amendment and I am happy to explain to 
my constituents of Elgin-Norfolk my reasoning. This has not 
been an easy decision. It has been a very difficult decision, one that 
I have studied very carefully and have taken very seriously.
<P>
	I do not think I was ever asked to be a rubber stamp and I have 
not been been a rubber stamp. I do not plan on being a rubber stamp 
tonight when we vote on this. I made this decision without 
experiencing any pressure from any of my colleagues or from the 
Prime Minister. I thank him for allowing a free vote on this issue.
<P>
	Let me explain my background because it is relevant to how I 
came to these conclusions. I was raised in the Catholic school 
system in Ontario. I spent 13 years there, including going to a 
Jesuit high school in Toronto. I learned a lot about Catholic values. 
My Catholic education has formed an important part of who I am 
today. It is because of those values that I made this decision 
seriously.
<P>
	To those who are worried that this will be the end of Catholic 
education in Ontario or across the country, I do not see it that way. 
In my own case the choice was important for me. I support the view 
that people should have choices as to which school they send their 
children. The key principle at work in making my decision was 
what was in the best interests of the Newfoundland school children.
<P>
	The Newfoundland school system by many reports which I 
accept as being factual is below the standards we have come to 
expect in Canada. I accept, after reviewing the material and also 
consulting with people who have been through the system, that the 
quality of education in  Newfoundland is not up to Canadian 
standards. Whether it is the high illiteracy rates or the poor testing 
on science exams, Newfoundland has a serious problem, one which 
it is trying to address in good faith.
<P>
	We are very quickly moving into a world where the divisions are 
not going to be so much between rich and poor, between resourced 
and non-resourced; rich and poor will break down between those 
who have knowledge and those who are ignorant. I cannot fight the 
battles of Ontario Catholic education or the battles of national unity 
on the backs of the children in Newfoundland.
<P>
	Those opposed to this amendment have raised a number of 
arguments which I take seriously. In some respects they are quite 
compelling.
<P>
<B>(2035 )</B>
<P>
	The first argument is that minority rights should not be abolished 
or amended simply at the will of the majority. If we look closer at 
the numbers, with only a 52 per cent turnout, 48 per cent of the 
people of Newfoundland by not voting demonstrated that at 
minimum they were ambivalent about the issue or at best, they 
consented with the government plan. Only 55 per cent of voters 
who did vote voted yes which I believe presents a real problem, but 
not a problem big enough to stall the vote.
<P>
	Of total eligible voters, 28 per cent voted in favour and 24 per 
cent voted against. For example, of the Catholic population in 
Newfoundland which represents approximately 35 per cent, the 
Catholic population was at least divided. There seems to be a real 
division about this issue and I am taking note of it.
<P>
	The next argument that people make is about precedent. Two 
arguments are at play here. One is that we are setting a precedent 
regarding how we are going to respond if there is another 
referendum in Quebec, what number we would respect and what 
number would we say is too low. The other precedent argument is 
that if we amend minority rights in Newfoundland then someone, 
perhaps Mike Harris, will try to do the same thing in Ontario.
<P>
	Let me deal first with the issue of national unity. I will go back to 
my main point. If members accept as I do that this is necessary for 
the advancement of the educational experience for Newfoundland 
school children, is it fair to fight the national unity issue on the 
backs of those children?
<P>
	As Canadians, we need to make a case for Canada clearly and 
simply. Quebecers, given a choice to vote on an honest question in 
a direct way will make a clear decision. We need to accommodate 
Quebec's need to be recognized as a distinct society and as a 
particular place and group of people who are different from the rest 
of Canada and have protection for their language and rights. We 
need to deal with that problem separate and distinct from the school 
issue in Newfoundland.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3366"> 3366 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me move to the next precedent issue that if we open up 
minority rights in Newfoundland we will be opening up minority 
rights in Ontario. I will again go back to my main point. Is it fair 
for me to try to protect the rights of my children to go to Catholic 
schools, whether it is St. Francis of Assisi in Orleans or St. 
Joseph's high school in St. Thomas, on the backs of the school 
children in Newfoundland? I think not. If we want to have Catholic 
education in Ontario, then we as Catholics should work to protect 
it, first by going to Catholic schools and then advocating 
politically or in other ways the value of that education.
<P>
	Another issue the opponents to the vote tonight raised is that 
there is a framework agreement. Let me say how frustrating it has 
been that both sides unfortunately have at times launched into what 
philosophers call an ad hominem argument where they merely 
attack the integrity of the other side rather than deal with the facts 
of the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> That is what you guys do all the time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> We do do it all the time but I find it frustrating 
because it is difficult to sort out. On one side people have said that 
Clyde Wells did not go into these negotiations in good faith. I do 
not know whether he did or not. On the other side, the premier for 
example has accused the Catholic church of being involved in a 
power struggle and not interested in the best interests of the school 
children.
<P>
	I am not able to come to any conclusion. I do not know these 
people particularly. However, if they are not in agreement today, I 
do not see any real indication that they can come to an agreement in 
the near future. I accept by the counsel of those people closer to the 
situation that they are not likely to come to an agreement. 
Therefore, I conclude that we need to bring the issue to a close.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Ind. Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member made comments about his experience with 
Catholic education at St. Jean de Brebeuf high school in Toronto, a 
great institution. The football teams were not that good but the 
academics were pretty good.
<P>
<B>(2040 )</B>
<P>
	The member talked about the inadequate education system in 
Newfoundland. I cannot understand where the member is getting 
his information. This is one factor which is leading him to the 
decision to support this amendment.
<P>
	I raised specific information from Premier Tobin's red book in 
the House earlier today. And we all know that those red books are 
only guidelines. I quote a statement from Premier Tobin's red book, 
the platform of the Liberal Party in the recent provincial election: 
``Since Confederation we have made tremendous progress in  
education. Newfoundlanders and Labradorians have built an 
educational system in which we can all have pride''.
<P>
	Then there is this from Chris Decker, former minister of 
education: ``The percentage of the population attaining less than 
eight years of schooling has decreased from 24 per cent in 1976 
compared to the then Canadian average of 9.5, to 5.6 per cent, 
slightly more than the Canadian average of 3.8 in 1991. That is an 
improvement of 18.4 per cent for Newfoundland compared to an 
improvement of 1.8 per cent for Canada as a whole. Students in 
Newfoundland perform just as well as students in most other 
provinces in the Canadian average''.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Think how much better they would perform if they 
had a good system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> There is the member for 
Halifax once again.
<P>
	It is important for the students, the educators and the leaders of 
the whole educational system in Newfoundland that we be careful. 
I do not support denigrating their system. It has moved forward 
dramatically and constructively and we should not knock it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Mr. Speaker, first on a personal note, I want to 
publicly say how much I have missed my hon. friend. I am 
enjoying this debate with him very much.
<P>
	Why do I believe that the educational system in Newfoundland is 
inferior? It is simply because I called a couple of my law school 
colleagues who are from Newfoundland. I asked them about their 
experiences. They explained that when they went to high school 
they did not have a qualified science teacher, except for geography. 
We talked about their experiences in literature. In the end they 
made it very clear that their educational experiences in grade 
school and high school were not as good as mine. They also 
explained the problems the island was having in terms of people 
moving out of the smaller towns and villages because of the lack of 
jobs and the pressure it was putting on the schools.
<P>
	I do not know what Premier Tobin is talking about when he said 
they have a poor system. It is not from anything Premier Tobin has 
said that I concluded it is an inferior system.
<P>
	Let me also say that being from Ontario, I think have a 
responsibility to take the counsel of the six members from 
Newfoundland and Labrador very, very seriously on this issue. 
They tell me they have an inferior system. I know them well 
enough to know that they are acting in good faith and they told me 
that with integrity. That is why I concluded that the system is 
inferior and needs to be reformed. That is why I am supporting the 
amendment.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood will take two or three more weeks of 
holidays so that we might have the time to ask questions.
<P>
	The member uttered a touching sentence in his speech, the tone 
of his voice changed and he had such a tremor in his voice that I felt 
like going to give him a kleenex when he said: ``I think that we 
should accept the fact that Quebec is a distinct society.'' We felt his 
heart was bleeding.
<P>
<B>(2045)</B>
<P>
	I would suggest that he consult with his colleague, the member 
for Churchill, a Liberal member, one of those who buried the 
Meech Lake accord. I would also suggest that he go and consult 
with the former premier of Newfoundland, Clyde Wells, another 
one who buried the Meech Lake accord; perhaps his heart would 
bleed less if it had been recognized that Quebec is a distinct 
society.
<P>
	By way of question, I will quote the third paragraph of the letter 
the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, sent 
to the Hon. Brian Tobin, the premier of Newfoundland, on May 29:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, we are concerned about the insufficiency of the school rights of the 
francophone minority in Newfoundland. Therefore, we strongly wish that your 
government seize the opportunity of the reform of its school legislation to 
provide, legislatively and administratively, the francophones in your province 
with the full management of their schools.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to hear the hon. member's comments on that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member does not know me, so I 
am a bit surprised by the personal attack. He seems to doubt my 
sincerity when I say that I accept Quebec as a distinct society. It is 
different. It has a different history, a different language and a 
different culture.
<P>
	There is a bit of a double standard. On one level the Bloc 
Quebecois says how awful Confederation is, how poorly we have 
done and how we do not get along. Bloc members attack our 
integrity. My integrity is being attacked if he doubts my sincerity. 
On another level, after the referendum, if they win, they are going 
to sit down to negotiate with us and we are going to have Nirvana. 
Everything is going to be wonderful. It just does not add up.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to accept my word. I do not know 
Clyde Wells. I have never met him. It is not my concern what are 
his views on this issue. Quebec is a distinct society and, as such, I 
support it. I am surprised that he has difficulty with that. I support 
it, so deal with it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
take part in the debate on the referendum held in 1995 on the 
denominational school system in Newfoundland. On September 5, 
1995, the Newfoundland government held a referendum on 
denominational education in the province, which is protected under 
term 17 of the union conditions signed by the Canadian 
government and the Government of Newfoundland in 1949.
<P>
	Part V of the Constitution Act, 1982, deals with the amending 
process to the Canadian Constitution. Section 43 allows the federal 
government to amend the Constitution in relation to any provision 
that applies to one or more provinces. Such an amendment requires 
the passing of a resolution by the House of Commons, the Senate 
and the legislature of the concerned province or provinces.
<P>
	Three times already since 1982, the Canadian government made 
constitutional amendments under section 43: first, in 1987, to put 
the Pentecostal schools of Newfoundland on an equal footing with 
the seven denominations recognized in the 1949 terms of union; 
second, in 1993, to guarantee the equal status of French and 
English in New Brunswick; and third, again in 1993, to facilitate 
the building of a fixed link between Prince Edward Island and New 
Brunswick.
<P>
	However, this case is an exception. Indeed, this would be the 
first time a referendum preceded the adoption of a constitutional 
amendment by the concerned legislature. It must be said that this 
referendum was not a prerequisite to the proposed constitutional 
amendment.
<P>
	Let us recall the objectives of the Newfoundland government. 
This project is part of an effort to streamline the provincial 
education system in order to save $17 million.
<P>
<B>(2050)</B>
<P>
	Newfoundland wants only one education system instead of four, 
only one school for all denominations. The number of school 
boards will be reduced from 27 to 10. From now on, the schools 
will be multiconfessional. By the way, this reform project is in line 
with the recommendations of the Newfoundland Royal 
Commission on Education, which where made public in 1992.
<P>
	In the 1995 referendum, the following question was asked, and I 
quote: ``Do you support revising term 17 in the manner proposed 
by the government to enable reform of the denominational 
educational system?'' Certain commentators said that the question 
was not clear, that is was complex and that it favoured the yes side. 
Such comments remind me of others made about the question of 
the last referendum in Quebec. Yet, at no time did we hear the 
federal government condemn the situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3368"> 3368 </A></B>
<P>
	I know the results of the Newfoundland referendum do not 
compare with those of the Quebec referendum. First of all, the 
participation rate reached only 52 per cent of eligible voters when 
it reached almost 94 per cent in Quebec. That low participation 
rate in Newfoundland means that 28.75 per cent of the voters were 
in favour of the change. The 19,941 voter majority in favour of 
the government plan may seem very thin.
<P>
	Nevertheless, all these considerations did not prevent the federal 
government from recognizing the result of this referendum. After 
the Newfoundland legislature approved, by resolution, the 
referendum result, Canada's prime minister expressed his intention 
to go ahead with the requested constitutional amendment.
<P>
	I acknowledge the recognition of a referendum result by the 
federal government. Even though the government is very careful 
not to give that interpretation to its decision, we can give this 
moment in history all its meaning because it is undoubtedly a 
precedent that we will be able to use to our advantage in the future.
<P>
	That precedent is indeed established through the recognition of 
the result of a referendum in which 52 per cent of eligible voters 
went to the polls and only 54 per cent of them voted in favour of the 
proposed constitutional amendment.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has chosen to support Newfoundland's 
decision since it was made in accordance with recognized 
democratic rules, through a referendum in which the majority of 
voters who took part voted in favour of an amendment.
<P>
	However, we are concerned about the inadequacy of the 
education rights of the francophone minority in Newfoundland. 
The Roman Catholic Church, through the Roman Catholic Bishops 
of Canada, has also expressed its concern, as well as the Fédération 
des parents francophones de Terre-Neuve et du Labrador. 
Therefore, we sincerely hope that the Newfoundland government 
will seize the opportunity to revise its legislation with regard to 
education in order to allow francophones in that province to 
assume total responsibility for the management of their schools.
<P>
	However, I deplore the fact that premier of Newfoundland, Brian 
Tobin, is saying high and low that, by supporting this motion, the 
Bloc Quebecois proved that the rule of law would prevail at all 
times and that it recognizes the Constitution's legitimacy. Yes, we 
support the rule of law if it is for the emancipation of peoples, but 
we reject the rule of law in cases where it would force peoples into 
subordination.
<P>
	Besides, Mr. Tobin, our ex-colleague, should be reminded that 
this matter is about the enforcement of clause 43 in the 
Constitutional amending formulas according to the specific needs 
of a province or group of provinces.
<P>
<B>(2055)</B>
<P>
	Quebec's sovereignty cannot go through that process which is far 
too restrictive. To recognize the right enshrined in section 43 of the 
Constitution does not lead to recognizing the political legitimacy of 
the whole. Let us not forget that the Constitution Act of 1982 has 
not yet been signed by the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	But above all, we, in the Bloc Quebecois, claim that it is the 
political, not the legal, legitimacy of the referendum results that 
matters. In this case, as in a future referendum in Quebec, politics 
take precedence over the legal niceties. This is why this House is 
complying with the result expressed by the people of 
Newfoundland. Mr. Tobin must understand that our support for this 
motion is based on the principle that democracy takes precedence 
over law. What government would dare to go against the freely 
expressed will of the people?
<P>
	Summing up, we are faced with a participation rate of 52 per 
cent, considered sufficient enough by the federal government to 
recognize the referendum results. We are faced with a federal 
government which has recognized a referendum question written 
solely by the Government of Newfoundland. We take note of it and 
we will draw from it the appropriate conclusions for Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
the Bloc members have spent most of their time talking about 
aspects of the referendum, I wonder if the member would care to 
comment on this referendum, which unlike the Quebec 
referendum, had a very low turnout.
<P>
	There was a 52 per cent turnout for the referendum and only 54.9 
per cent voted in favour of the question. This means that 28 per 
cent of the population were in favour of the question. Does the 
member feel that is a significant indication of the wishes of the 
people of Newfoundland? Or does the member believe some larger 
representation of the eligible voters should be required?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's question. I 
believe that in a referendum, the important thing is to make sure 
that all citizens can express their opinion and exercise their right to 
vote. If, in a referendum, the majority has spoken in favour of the 
process, in my mind, the referendum is legitimate.
<P>
	I would like to point out to my colleague that when 
Newfoundland joined the Canadian Confederation, it took two 
referendums, and the results of the second one were only 54 per 
cent in favour of it. I cannot see why this was good enough to let 
Newfoundland in and 52 per cent might not be enough when a 
province within 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3369"> 3369 </A></B>
<P>
Canada expresses its opinion by way of a referendum. I believe that 
50 per cent plus one vote is good enough  when people are called on 
to express their opinion and do so.
<P>
<B>(2100)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my turn to 
participate in this debate on the motion requesting that the 
Newfoundland government be authorized to modify its education 
system through a constitutional amendment, as provided in section 
43 of the Constitution.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc Quebecois support that motion, for two 
main reasons for this. The first one is very important; it is the fact 
that we are in a democracy. We believe in democracy and the 
Newfoundland government presented us with the results of a 
referendum held democratically and in accordance with recognized 
rules.
<P>
	We think that we do not have to agree with the reservations 
expressed concerning the question. The Newfoundland 
government, the elected members of the legislature discussed that 
question. There was a debate, there was a yes side and a no side. 
Everyone had the opportunity to vote. There was then a result and 
we, of the Bloc Quebecois, because we are democratic, recognize 
the result of that vote. The issue is not the final result. When a 
referendum is recognized, it is the 50 per cent plus one formula, as 
in the case of the Maastricht treaty, and many referendums held 
around the world. The democratic rule is 50 per cent plus one.
<P>
	That is why we, of the Bloc Quebecois, support wholeheartedly 
the Government of Newfoundland on this issue. Moreover, in the 
speech he made earlier, the member for Trois-Rivières was 
reminding us, rightly so, that the Government of Newfoundland is 
one that can be used as a model with regards to referendums.
<P>
	First of all, it is the only province that entered the Canadian 
Confederation after holding a referendum on the issue; I should say 
two, because there were two. The result was narrow in the first one, 
so the debate continued the following year, in 1949, and there was 
another referendum. The people of Newfoundland voted and asked 
the rest of Canada to accept them in the Confederation. That was 
done democratically. We have nothing to say on that. That is fine, it 
was in response to the wishes of the people.
<P>
	So, this time, the people of Newfoundland decide also 
democratically to hold a referendum on an issue they consider 
important, an issue that was causing division within the province; 
they decide to hold this referendum to change their education 
system. We support that, of course.
<P>
	The second reason is that-we sovereignists read the 
Constitution, we know what it is all about, because we have had to 
put up with it long enough, we know it by heart-section 93 of the 
Constitution says: ``In and for each province the legislature may 
exclusively make laws in relation to education''. To Quebecers, 
exclusively  means that this is none of our business, it concerns the 
people of Newfoundland, the men and women of Newfoundland. It 
is neither for Quebecers nor for the residents of other provinces to 
tell Newfoundlanders how to manage their school system.
<P>
	The objectives put forward seem logical to us, Bloc members, 
and we agree. But it is not because expenditures are being reduced 
or because a structure is being amended in such and such a way, but 
because this is exclusively under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	We would not appreciate people from Newfoundland or other 
provinces telling Quebecers and the Government of Quebec what 
to do in matters of education. Each time the federal government 
tries to interfere-and it has no compunction about doing so in this 
area-we remind it that it does not have jurisdiction, we do. We 
have a consistent approach to the principle included in the 
Constitution, which says clearly that it is up to Newfoundlanders to 
define what they wish to see in their school system. However, we 
do have some reservations concerning the protection of the French 
speaking minority's rights.
<P>
<B>(2105)</B>
<P>
	I want to make it clear right away that, according to statistics, 
there are 2,680 francophones in Newfoundland, which constitutes 
0.5 of the population, spread here and there across the island and 
also in Labrador. When I hear people say that we must oppose 
every change, every amendment, it sounds as if all of a sudden we 
had to protect the major progress the province of Newfoundland 
has made with regard to protecting the French speaking minority.
<P>
	I remind hon. members that there is no French school board in 
Newfoundland. None. Besides, there is only one entirely unilingual 
French school, only one. Other francophones are distributed among 
four other bilingual schools. What is it exactly we want to protect? 
I was about to say next to nothing, but that is the situation such as it 
is. There is only one school where all the students are French 
speaking.
<P>
	When the Leader of the Opposition met with Premier Tobin, he 
voiced his concerns about the situation and hoped for some 
improvement. Mr. Tobin said: ``Yes, but things are better than they 
used to be, since we will now have a committee made up of three 
individuals with a specific mandate to try to improve the situation 
of French speaking Newfoundlanders in terms of education''.
<P>
	Since the measure respects the Constitution and is to our liking, 
although we would like it to be more explicit, and since the final 
legislation to modernize the system has yet to be passed, we are 
confident that Premier Tobin will protect the rights of the French 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3370"> 3370 </A></B>
<P>
speaking minority, just like Quebec did with its English speaking 
minority. We would like him to go even further and to recognize  
more than one school. I will not start giving names, but there are 
2,680 francophones. So, we would like more schools to be 
recognized and greater participation of francophones in the school 
boards. This is what we want.
<P>
	But there is something else. I have been following the debate for 
a while and, in fact, the phenomenon goes back to the debate on 
Bill C-33. All of a sudden, two members were excluded from the 
Liberal Party, or left of their own will, and became independent. 
More and more often, the Liberal government lets its members vote 
freely. This, in my opinion, is the symptom of a routed 
government, a government that does not know where it is headed 
and that tries to please all its members. It lets its members speak 
freely. If we push it a little further-because apparently some 50 
Liberal members do not agree with this motion-the government 
would need the support of members in the two opposition parties to 
have its motions passed. It does not make sense any more.
<P>
	The way things are going, one wonders if we still have a 
government and a prime minister. This Prime Minister says that all 
referendums are not equal, and his intergovernmental affairs 
minister agrees and says it depends. This is a double standard. In 
Newfoundland, any question goes, any result and any level of 
participation are acceptable. In Quebec, it is a different story. The 
Prime Minister has to agree with the question. He wants to 
determine the majority needed to win a referendum. Sometimes he 
compares our province to a rod and gun club. He noticed that the 
bylaws of such clubs in Quebec-so he saw back home in 
Shawinigan, where he goes only in the summertime-provide for a 
66.66 per cent majority. He kind of likes that, and he would want to 
force that on Quebec, but not on Newfoundland.
<P>
	In Newfoundland, 50 p. 100 is good enough. That is 
unbelievable. The inconsistency of this government is just 
unbelievable. But in Quebec, it wants to be tough and object to 
everything. It goes as far as supporting Guy Bertrand, who wants to 
take away from Quebecers the right to self-determination. That will 
never be tolerated.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
supporting this legislation because I am not convinced the rights of 
minorities as entrenched in the Constitution are being safeguarded.
<P>
	To make the proposed changes to the school system in 
Newfoundland a constitutional amendment is not necessary. It 
already has the authority to make such a change under section 93. 
There should have been better consultation with the groups whose 
minority rights will be affected. I say this because some parents 
were here on the Hill last week. Those parents stated they had not 
had the consultation they required.
<P>
<B>(2110)</B>
<P>
	I ask the hon. member if he is aware that this consultation with 
the parents of these children who attend religious schools did not 
take place. They also stated that prior to the referendum people 
were not aware of any consultation. Does he not agree that in 
today's society with the peer pressure out there it is better to have 
religious schools for our young people than the other system?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two points to make with respect 
to the hon. member's question. First, she talked about the 
consultation of the groups affected by the measures. Is there a 
better consultation than the one in which people old enough to vote 
are first called upon to take part in the debate and then to vote?
<P>
	This is not a neighbourhood consultation about a school. It is a 
consultation about an education systen for the whole province. And 
it has been done. As for us, we are fully satisfied with the 
consultation aspect because the province of Newfoundland used, in 
my opinion, the best consultation tool of all: a referendum.
<P>
	Newfoundland is concerned with the rights or the claims with 
regard to the denominational aspect. I believe that this is none of 
our business and that we should stay out of Newfoundland's affairs. 
Similarly, Quebecers would not like that Newfoundlanders get 
involved in the discussions about such arrangements in Quebec.
<P>
	But since the hon. member is asking me, I will say that I saw in 
Newfoundland's proposal measures to let the different 
denominations express themselves. Therefore, any group of people 
can have access to its religion in its school board or school if it is 
large enough.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Wayne:</B> Mr. Speaker, in my riding of Saint John, New 
Brunswick last week I spoke at St. Vincent's girl's high school. The 
system has changed to the type of system in Newfoundland. Right 
now that high school is not allowed to continue as a religious high 
school without going before the board of education every year. 
That will happen all across Canada before we are through and all 
religious schools will be gone.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am saying that what my colleague is 
talking about concerns the people of Newfoundland. It was their 
decision to make, and that is what they did. Once the referendum 
results were known, their elected government, supported by the 
leader of the opposition and the leader of the third party, came to 
Ottawa to ask the Parliament of Canada to recognize the decision 
legitimitely made in their province. That is the only possible 
answer to such a question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3371"> 3371 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
feel compelled this evening to speak on the issue of the educational 
system in Newfoundland and on minority rights in Canada. We are 
told by some inside the House and outside that these two matters 
are separate and distinct, that they are unrelated.
<P>
	We debate tonight an amendment to term 17 as requested by the 
legislature of Newfoundland. We are assured this amendment will 
not negatively impact minority rights in Newfoundland or in any 
other part of Canada. We are told this is a local issue, a 
Newfoundland issue, and that it does not involve the rest of 
Canada. Not so, Mr. Speaker. A threat to minority rights anywhere 
in Canada is a threat to minority rights everywhere in Canada.
<P>
<B>(2115)</B>
<P>
	Many Canadians, including members of Parliament from every 
region, have at least three major concerns about this requested 
amendment. First, an analysis of the vote in Newfoundland shows 
that at least two of the minority groups affected voted against this 
amendment. It is a fundamental principle of fairness in a 
democracy that the rights of a minority guaranteed in law should 
not be changed, diminished or abolished without the consent of the 
citizens who collectively comprise that minority group.
<P>
	Second, this amendment, if enacted, could represent a dangerous 
precedent for the erosion of minority rights in Canada. It is 
obvious, Mr. Speaker, obvious there is disagreement among 
Canadian legal experts on the possible precedent this amendment 
could create. Expert legal opinion has stated that this matter should 
properly have been referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for an 
expeditious ruling before we make such a very important decision.
<P>
	Third, the process has been incredibly flawed, in my view. Other 
citizens of Canada want to be heard, Newfoundlanders and other 
Canadians as well. Leaders of several denominations wish to be 
heard on this matter, non-Catholic and Catholic alike. I would 
submit there should have been hearings on this very important 
issue before a decision is taken on it.
<P>
	I cannot think of any member of the House who does not support 
the people of Newfoundland in their desire to improve and 
modernize their educational system. Such a modernization and 
improvement ought properly to be arrived at co-operatively by the 
efforts of all concerned, the leaders of the Government of 
Newfoundland, the leaders of the communities and their citizens.
<P>
	While I support the improvement of the educational system in 
Newfoundland, I cannot support this amendment, as requested, 
because I sincerely believe that it could imperil minority rights in 
other provinces. It could imperil education rights and it could 
imperil other  minority rights. For those reasons I simply cannot 
support it. I must vote no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member discussed the issue of inclusion in 
the debate. I would like to point out very briefly that since 1990 a 
royal commission has been studying the issue of educational 
reform in the province and had reached specific conclusions in 
1992.
<P>
	The specific conclusions of the royal commission were based on 
the input of thousands of briefs that were received, the inclusions 
of hundreds of individuals who presented those briefs.
<P>
	Does the hon. member have any thoughts on those members who 
represent particular religious affiliations, particular religious 
beliefs and faiths, the 5 per cent we have not discussed here 
tonight, who at this current time do not receive any religious 
instruction in the faith of their choice? Would the hon. member like 
to comment on or discuss the 50 per cent of the Pentecostal faith 
which currently does not receive instruction in their faith, and 
whether or not the current amendments to term 17 would include 
those individuals in Newfoundland society?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from the province of Newfoundland for his questions and 
for his comments.
<P>
<B>(2120 )</B>
<P>
	One of the feelings that I hold very strongly is that we ought to 
have held public hearings, however brief. The need for such 
hearings has been well addressed by my colleague from the 
province of Newfoundland.
<P>
	If there are people from the Pentecostal faith who wish to be 
heard, let us bring them to Ottawa and hear them. If there are those 
of no particular religious belief who wish to be heard on this issue, 
let us bring them to Ottawa and let them be heard.
<P>
	In my view, in a democracy, it is fundamentally unfair to change 
and imperil minority rights without the opportunity of all who wish 
to be heard to have that opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I sat by and 
listened to a number of the comments, especially from those of the 
opposition.
<P>
	I am very concerned about the sociativity between various 
referenda that take place in this country. In my riding, we are 
currently having a referendum about whether parts of my 
constituency should be part of the GTA.
<P>
	It has no real legal impact. It is simply an opinion poll. For the 
members of the opposition to say that the referendum in 
Newfoundland was not necessary has a kind of major impact on 
future referendums to do with such a horrendous issue as 
succession which has no legal framework in our Constitution is 
ludicrous.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3372"> 3372 </A></B>
<P>
	The members opposite talk about democracy. Let us have a 
focus on what they mean about democracy. They are willing to 
take the welfare of the children of Newfoundland and use it for 
their own cause which is separation.
<P>
	The province of Newfoundland faces the highest illiteracy rate in 
Canada. The children of Newfoundland have one of the lowest 
scholastic scores in all of Canada. The province of Newfoundland 
spends, relative to the amount of money that they have available to 
them, far more than any other province and yet get one of the worst 
scholastic scores in this country.
<P>
	There is something wrong with the school system in 
Newfoundland. There is no question about that. The members 
opposite would use those facts to promote their own cause.
<P>
	Let us talk about democracy. Bloc members are willing to say 
50-plus one is some kind of democratic threshold when every other 
country in the world, when it comes to constitutional amendments 
to do with the basic framework of their country, require 66 per cent 
or 75 per cent. The reality is that there is no sociativity between 
these two things.
<P>
	Let us talk about some other facts that have occurred in the 
province of Quebec only recently. We have taken something like 
the Canada Student Loans Act and allowed it to be administered 
solely by the province of Quebec. Ninety-eight million dollars a 
year is allocated from the federal government to the province of 
Quebec to administer the Canada Student Loans Act. What has the 
province of Quebec recently done in that area? It has said that those 
students who want to take educational training outside the province 
of Quebec are prevented from doing so.
<P>
	Was there a referendum? No. Was there a consultation process 
with the people of Quebec? No. Do not tell me about your attitudes 
toward a consultative and democratic process. Do not tell me about 
using the children of Newfoundland to support the cause of 
separation.
<P>
	Finally, I support this amendment. It is not perfect. Nothing is 
perfect in our democracy but the feeling and the general attitude of 
the people of Newfoundland is that they need to get on with their 
lives, that they need to create a new educational system in the 
province. They need to create the opportunities for the people of 
that province.
<P>
	They have waited much too long to try to resolve this problem. I 
am willing to believe that the fair minded people of Newfoundland 
have made a decision both in the legislature and also with a 
referendum and they basically want to get on with their lives.
<P>
	The general thrust of the federal government should be to 
endorse that. I fully endorse it.
<P>
<B>(2125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very carefully to my hon. colleague's 
presentation. I was pleased to hear him indicate that while the 
province of Newfoundland made a decision to have a referendum, 
there was no necessity for them to do that. It did so only to get input 
from its citizenry.
<P>
	What happens after this amendment hypothetically is passed? 
Does it mean, for example, that it is the end of religious education? 
Does it mean that it is the end of denominations having input into 
the education system in Newfoundland? I wonder if the hon. 
member would care to comment on that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, denominational schools will 
continue in the province of Newfoundland.
<P>
	The framework is where numbers permit. Newfoundland has a 
population of that of the city of Calgary. It has the great problem it 
had in the time of Joey Smallwood of how to administer services in 
rural areas. It is very difficult to administer Cadillac services in 
areas which do not have the population base to sustain them.
<P>
	There is a need for rationalization but it does not mean the end of 
denominational schools. In those urban areas where numbers 
permit the denominational schools will continue. I believe the 
Roman Catholic school board will have more powers under this 
change because it will have a better rationalization of resources and 
a better ability to deliver those services to its students.
<P>
	There really has not been a significant change. Many people in 
Newfoundland are arguing that the changes in the proposals of the 
province of Newfoundland have not gone far enough to address 
some of their major concerns. The bottom line is that I respect the 
member's question. This is a change for the better for 
Newfoundland. Many people people still argue that it has not gone 
far enough, but it is our role to endorse those proposals and reform 
the educational system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are only a few minor elements I would like to discuss tonight. 
Many references to the participation rate in the referendum that 
took place in Newfoundland were made. It was said that that rate 
was so low that it undermined slightly the credibility of the 
exercise.
<P>
	People often say that the right to vote is a also a responsibility 
for the citizen. We know that there are citizens who are highly 
interested in politics and others who are not very interested. Would 
had it been very appropriate for those who did not really take an 
interest in the debate surrounding the Newfoundland referendum to 
make a judgment on the issue since they had decided to leave it to 
other more informed people?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3373"> 3373 </A></B>
<P>
	So, the participation rate is not really important. In Quebec, the 
participation rate, or the percentage of people who felt concerned 
by the issue, exceeded 90 p. 100. In Newfoundland, less people 
decided to participate. So be it. We have to respect their decision.
<P>
	The other thing I would like to mention is the fact that the word 
referendum seems to raise great fear in this House. I believe that a 
referendum, as has been said so many times this evening, is a very 
modern and highly democratic tool.
<P>
	What is important to understand is that, at the present time, in 
this dynamic world with its rapid changes, where we are constantly 
being required to totally change our tack, decisions must be made 
quickly, but they must be tailored to the wishes of the people. That 
leads us to the concept of referendum.
<P>
	What can be wrong with consulting the people, consulting those 
who have pondered the question? So we prepare a question for the 
population, and those who want to answer do so. That is completely 
normal, and I believe there ought to be more referenda.
<P>
	The other point is that, when legislation is being prepared, we 
need to add things to it, and then later on it will dictate to us how 
we ought to act.
<P>
<B>(2130)</B>
<P>
	In the end, the people are represented by politicians, and these 
very politicians establish the laws defining the broad social trends 
in our society. At some point in time, we realize that these laws, 
including the Constitution, are so complex we get lost in them. 
How can our country remain dynamic and adapt quickly, when we 
are caught up in a jumble of laws?
<P>
	This brings me to the Bertrand case, which claims that we cannot 
do what we want to do because the law prevents it. But the people, 
through their politicians, establish the laws to define the course of 
society, and we are not even allowed any more to oppose it. I think 
there is room to question this. Society needs to debate this point. 
We should ask people about this, because they are those who 
elected us here.
<P>
	They elected us to represent them along some party lines and 
those party lines are the ones defining social trends. However, we 
must lend an ear to the people to know if our decisions are 
appropriate. These are considerations that fascinate me tonight, and 
I think we would gain from pondering over them.
<P>
	Last September 5, the Newfoundland government held a 
referendum to change the school system to a non-denominational 
one. Results were a yes vote of 54 per cent with a 52 per cent 
participation rate, which meant that the Newfoundland government 
could start the process whereby it is today asking the federal 
government to amend term 17 of the 1949 union act, in accordance 
with clause 43.
<P>
	As we know, section 43 allows the federal government to amend 
the Constitution with the consent of one province when the 
amendment applies only to this province. We also know that 
section 43 was used on three occasions in the recent past. In 1987, 
with regard to the same rights of churches in Newfoundland, but it 
had to do with the Pentecostal Church. In 1993, to enshrine the 
equality of the French and English languages in New Brunswick. 
And again in 1993, to facilitate the building of a bridge between 
Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick.
<P>
	We do not see anything wrong with the proposed reform. The 
school system in Newfoundland has become too complex and too 
costly. Three years of consultations with the churches involved 
have led nowhere. If an agreement had been reached, it could have 
been cancelled by anyone with the help of the courts.
<P>
	As I was saying, the rule of law Mr. Bertrand is so adamant to 
support has its limits. When the limits have been reached, 
fortunately there remains democracy. We come full circle; is the 
law there to serve the people or are the people there to serve the 
law? What tools can we use? I think a referendum is a very good 
one.
<P>
	When the population so wishes, even if the turnout is not so 
large, the opinion of the well-informed prevails. Fifty-three per 
cent of the people felt they were informed enough to give their 
opinion. They said what they had to say. Democracy played its role. 
I hope things work just as well during the next referendum in 
Quebec. The participation rate will be determined by the number of 
people really interested in the debate.
<P>
	Maybe we should hold a broad public debate on the right to vote. 
Is it a civic duty or a right? Are those who vote knowledgeable 
enough to give direction to public debates in our country?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the member's dissertation that referendums were so valuable in 
society. Maybe they are, but at what point do we run a referendum 
or an opinion poll? Do we do it every five or ten years, every year, 
every two months or every two days?
<P>
	The member talks about democracy and the respect of 
democracy and yet we know there was a referendum recently in his 
province and he continues to talk about the next referendum. There 
does not seem to be any real appreciation of the votes and the 
desires of the people of Quebec to stay within the country. How can 
he claim he is a democrat?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, when can a 
referendum be held? In my opinion, whenever we see division 
among the people or the need for a societal debate.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3374"> 3374 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2135)</B>
<P>
	So, I would say to my colleague that, at 50 per cent and a little 
more or less, the issue is not really decided. When the people are 
asking themselves some questions, I believe it is appropriate to 
further the debate to inform them well. At that time, I think it will 
be very credible to have another one in four years, in two years.
<P>
	To respond also to the first question of my colleague, I would say 
that referenda are appropriate when the people ask themselves 
questions. It would even be interesting in the future to have a card 
announcing a referendum to be held at a given time and on a given 
issue. Perhaps we could have an annual day of referendum to 
ensure the people would participate more.
<P>
	There are many questions we have to ask ourselves. Inasmuch as 
we ask ourselves questions on our system and we not do consider it 
the best in the world, perhaps it is the best in the world, but that is 
not a reason for sitting down and saying it should stay the same. On 
the contrary. I think the world is modernizing today and we must 
constantly ask ourselves questions on what we do and what we 
want to become.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am speaking in support of the amendment before the 
House tonight because I believe it will be beneficial to the people 
of my province of Newfoundland and Labrador and to all of 
Canada.
<P>
	The educational system of Newfoundland and Labrador is 
distinct in Canada. The responsibility for educational matters falls 
within the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces. As a result there 
is a wide diversity among provincial school systems reflecting the 
wide diversity that is such an integral part of Canadian society.
<P>
	Members will recall there are no public schools in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. Our education system is a part of our 
history. That is the case in most provinces. Our first schools were 
sponsored, fostered and promoted by the churches and their clergy. 
Governments did not assume responsibility for education until 
much later in our history. Even when public funding became 
available the Newfoundland system was still directly exclusively 
run by the churches.
<P>
	The example of my home of Bonavista, an historic fishing town 
on the tip of the Bonavista Peninsula, best illustrates this. Not only 
is Bonavista the landfall of John Cabot 499 years ago this year, it is 
famous for other historic events.
<P>
	In 1722 Reverend Henry Jones came to serve in Bonavista where 
he supervised the building of the first church in Newfoundland. 
Four years later he organized the first school in Newfoundland in 
my home town. I did not attend that school but the three room, one 
teacher per room school on the very same site of that school that  
the existing system directed I attend. I had good teachers and 
enjoyed my time in school, but it kept me from attending a larger, 
more modern, better equipped school that would have more 
effectively prepared me for the future.
<P>
	By the time of Confederation, six individual denominations had 
been granted the right to operate schools. They still possess that. 
One denomination was added in 1987. Today in Newfoundland and 
Labrador there are four separate, distinct and individual school 
systems with 27 overlapping boards in a province with 575,000 
people and 110,000 students, roughly the size of Calgary.
<P>
	The people of Newfoundland and Labrador have now asked 
Parliament to give the provincial legislature the authority to make 
changes in the denominational educational system. That will be the 
effect of the amended term 17. Simply put, the legislature would 
have more authority to decide and direct educational issues and the 
individual denominations would have less. Those arrangements 
which were incorporated in the Constitution in 1949 reflected the 
wishes and the beliefs of the Newfoundlanders of that day.
<P>
	The people of the province through their government now wish 
to make different arrangements. They believe changes must be 
made to the schools for the sake of their children and their 
children's future. The decision to make change was neither hasty 
nor arbitrary and came as a consequence of a long process of public 
discussion and negotiation.
<P>
	Six years ago the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador 
appointed a royal commission on education. More than 30 years 
had passed since such a study had been made. The commission was 
chaired by Dr. Len Williams, a respected and experienced educator. 
The commission recommended far reaching changes designed to 
give the children of Newfoundland and Labrador far greater 
opportunities to prepare themselves to lead full, satisfying and 
productive lives.
<P>
<B>(2140)</B>
<P>
	The provincial government quickly decided to negotiate new 
arrangements and then Premier Clyde Wells and several of his 
senior colleagues began a series of discussions with the 
representatives of the denominations. These discussions continued 
for more than two and a half years. Agreement was not possible, 
however, despite the best efforts of all involved. I know all of those 
involved, representing churches and government alike, strove 
mightily and in the best of good faith to reach an agreement but 
were not able to do so.
<P>
	The provincial government was then faced with only three 
options: abandon the project to make changes it believed were 
necessary, agree to the much less far reaching changes which the 
leaders of the churches were prepared to accept, or seek a 
constitutional amendment to give the legislature powers with 
respect to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3375"> 3375 </A></B>
<P>
education similar to those already vested in every other provincial 
legislature. It chose the amendment route.
<P>
	The government believed that because the changes were so 
important to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador that it 
should not seek a constitutional amendment unless the people of 
the province agreed they wanted one. The government sought the 
views of its electors, the parents of the children of the province, in a 
referendum. A majority of 54.8 per cent of those who voted 
endorsed the government's reform proposal.
<P>
	The government then asked the House of Assembly to decide the 
issue. Every member of the House except the Speaker voted on the 
proposal. Thirty-one members supported the proposal, 20 voted 
against. All three party leaders voted in favour of it. That resolution 
is the one which is before us now.
<P>
	My colleague, the Minister of Justice, has described the 
amendment in detail and addressed the legal issues that arise from 
it.
<P>
	I want to say a word or two about the educational issues in the 
context of the province and her peoples. I know the denominational 
system well. I am a product of the denominational school, as I 
mentioned earlier. The system has served Newfoundland and her 
people well, but I am convinced it can be improved. I am convinced 
the changes proposed by the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador will provide a better education for the children who live 
in my constituency of Bonavista-Trinity-Conception and for all 
the children of Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
	I realize some of my colleagues and members on the other side 
of the House have concerns about the wisdom of the government's 
decision to ask Parliament to amend term 17. I have discussed it 
with many of them. I respect their opinions, which I know they 
have weighed carefully. I have done so too. So have many of our 
colleagues in the government. We did not come lightly or quickly 
to our decision to recommend the amendment to Parliament. Our 
decision came after detailed study, much thought, much reflection 
and strong debate.
<P>
	We are fully persuaded that the amendment is an appropriate and 
proper change. We have no hesitation in recommending it to 
Parliament and in asking members on both sides of the House and 
those in the other place to support it. We believe the result will be a 
better educational system for the children of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.
<P>
	The case for this amendment requested by the Newfoundland 
legislature is compelling in my judgment. I speak as a 
Newfoundlander, as a Canadian and as a member of the 
Government of Canada. It is true the powers enjoyed by our 
churches for the last half century will be diminished somewhat. 
However, all will be  diminished equally, and so the question is not 
one of the majority discriminating against a minority.
<P>
	Any fair minded observer would have to acknowledge that the 
constitutional protections, which will still be vested in seven 
denominations in Newfoundland and Labrador if the amendment is 
adopted, will compare favourably with those enjoyed by any 
established religious group anywhere else in Canada.
<P>
	It would be both fair and accurate to describe the effect of the 
amendment as being an intent to introduce in Newfoundland and 
Labrador a system comparable to that in effect in many other 
provinces, with the significant exception that all schools in the 
province will still be denominational.
<P>
	Members will have seen that the amendment gives the 
legislature the power to make provision for unidenominational 
schools. A constitutional provision will ensure the powers of the 
churches with respect to these schools will be comparable to those 
of separate schools in Ontario, for example.
<P>
	Some are troubled by the suggestion that the legislature's power, 
which is found in section (b)(i) of the item which has been 
discussed often today, to make rules with respect to the 
establishment of unidenominational schools could be used to 
frustrate the ability of any given denomination to organize a 
denominational school. I looked closely at that. I have sought 
advice from our lawyers on that point and I am assured that such a 
result cannot come to pass.
<P>
<B>(2145)</B>
<P>
	This comes about because of the use of the words ``subject to 
provincial legislation that is uniformly acceptable to all schools'', 
the preamble of the new term. I am told these are words which have 
a precise meaning in law and would be used by a court to determine 
the reasonableness of a legislative enactment. Those members who 
are concerned by this point can take comfort in this protection.
<P>
	In closing, I am convinced the legislature and the government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador will be able to provide the children of 
the province with a better education if we adopt this amendment. I 
am persuaded on the merits of the amendment. I am persuaded that 
it would not threaten or harm the rights of any other Canadian. I am 
persuaded that its adoption would not require a future Parliament to 
adopt an amendment that would unacceptably change the rights of 
any Canadian.
<P>
	I am going to vote for it for those reasons and on that basis. I am 
going to vote for it because I believe it to be in the best interests of 
the children who live in the constituency of 
Bonavista-Trinity-Conception and the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador. They deserve the best that 
Newfoundland and Labrador can provide. The adoption of this 
amendment will help make this so.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief 
because there are other members who want to speak and because 
we are anxious to vote on this motion. All I want to indicate to the 
minister with my comment-because I do not necessarily want to 
ask a question-is that this is a very emotional issue. I have 
listened carefully to questions and comments today and I must say 
that there was a lot of emotion involved.
<P>
	If I may use a little irony, I will say to the minister that each time 
we speak on issues like this, we are opening up the crab trap. The 
minister is smiling, so he is definitely listening to the simultaneous 
interpretation. I would like to tell him that regardless of our 
political differences or the different perception we often have of 
problems, I have made the effort to listen to all the debates on this 
issue. I must tell him from the start that I am always interested in 
recognizing democracy through a referendum. 
<P>
	I am not interested in commenting on the specifics of what the 
province does or does not need. What I wanted to say is that I have 
taken the time to listen, and I will vote in favour of the motion this 
evening. I would like to hear from the minister that he too intends 
to listen to all the other problems that arise, including in the crab 
fishery, so that people of good will can be heard in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much the comments 
of my hon. colleague. He listened to me and he is very much aware 
of course that I always listen to his very learned comments and 
seriously to the concerns of the constituency he represents, the 
concerns of fishermen on fishing issues and items related to the 
coast guard and marine service fees.
<P>
	He is aware that I listen but I cannot always accede to his 
requests because sometimes they are outside the bounds even of 
my jurisdiction. I always listen attentively to what he has to say. I 
always give due weight to the learned comments he brings to the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the hon. minister's comments.
<P>
	The minister will know that the issue of precedent with regard to 
the educational minority rights in other provinces is a very, very 
important issue. I refer the minister to the letter of March 26 to the 
Prime Minister from Archbishop Emeritus Cardinal G. Emmett 
Carter of Toronto, in which he refers to Professor Patrick Monahan 
of Osgoode Hall Law School, in which he said, among other things, 
that an amendment to term 17 would create a risk to 
denominational school guarantees in other provinces that hitherto 
did not exist.
<P>
	The minister has presented that there are judgments to the 
contrary. Would the minister not agree that a reference to the 
supreme court to clarify the question might help a lot of members 
in this place?
<P>
<B>(2150 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hear what my hon. colleague is 
saying. As I said in my comments, I was troubled by this debate. I 
sought legal advice. According to legal opinions, the preamble 
precludes this from happening in any other case. I am satisfied that 
this item of interpretation has been clarified and I think the 
Minister of Justice agrees. I am convinced that the adoption of this 
motion would not adversely affect any other province as is the 
concern of my hon. colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with care to the remarks of my hon. and gallant 
colleague, the minister of fisheries, who in my view gave ample 
justification for the passage of this resolution without amendment. 
However, I want to make my own views known on the subject 
because a considerable number of people in my own constituency 
have expressed their concerns and interests on this subject.
<P>
	The resolution that started the whole ball rolling was a resolution 
of the House of Assembly of the province of Newfoundland that 
was adopted in October of last year. Under the terms of section 43 
of the Constitution, the resolution that is considered by this House 
must be identical to the resolution of the House of Assembly of 
Newfoundland. Once the two have been passed with one from the 
Senate, the Governor General can then issue a proclamation 
amending the Constitution.
<P>
	Anyone who is interested in this subject and who is concerned 
about the wording of the resolution before the House today could 
easily determine what that resolution was going to say by looking 
at the resolution passed by the Newfoundland House of Assembly 
in October last year.
<P>
	Any argument that this has been sprung on the House at the last 
minute and is being rushed through in my view does not hold water. 
Everyone in Canada knew that section 43 was the route that would 
be followed for this amendment. Everyone in Canada who was 
interested could have looked at the Journals of the Newfoundland 
House of Assembly last October, read the resolution and known 
exactly what the Minister of Justice was going to propose in this 
House when the matter came here, once the government had made 
a decision that it was going to proceed with this resolution.
<P>
	For those who argue this is somehow being rushed through or 
that this is a surprise, I say they simply should get a subscription to 
a proper newspaper and read it because it was there for all to see. 
Many of us did not bother to look because many of us did not think 
it was important at the time. The issue has become very important 
now because so many people have apparently expressed 
considerable concern about this resolution.
<P>
	I decided to have a long look at the situation, to look at the facts 
under which the resolution was adopted and  make up my mind as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3377"> 3377 </A></B>
<P>
to what I should do. I did so with some care. I have decided to 
support this resolution and reject the amendment that was moved 
by my former colleague from Broadview-Greenwood. The hon. 
member has moved an amendment which has an initial appeal but 
which in my view is not necessary in this particular case.
<P>
	I believe we should approve the amendment the government has 
proposed and that the Government of Newfoundland has proposed 
without any change. I say so for these reasons: First, this resolution 
was adopted by the House of Assembly of Newfoundland. It was 
adopted in October 1995. It chose to have a referendum before that 
on the issue which happened, although it did not need to have one.
<P>
	We can argue whether it was a big enough majority or whether 
enough people voted but to me that was irrelevant because there 
was no need at all for a referendum. The Government of 
Newfoundland chose to have one and it had one but if the 
resolution had come from the House of Assembly alone, in my 
view it would have been proper for this House to act on it because 
that is the constitutional amending formula we have agreed to in 
this country. The Government of Newfoundland adopted in its 
House of Assembly a resolution which it sent to Parliament and 
asked us to act on.
<P>
	Second, after that resolution was adopted, there was an election 
in Newfoundland. If the people of Newfoundland felt that their 
government was not representative of their interests in this regard, 
they could have thrown the government out, but they did not. The 
government was re-elected and a subsequent resolution was 
adopted approving the former course of action. It was adopted 
unanimously in the Newfoundland House of Assembly and it was 
supported by all three party leaders. We have ample justification 
from the House of Assembly in Newfoundland to proceed with this 
constitutional amendment. That is all the Constitution of Canada 
requires under section 43 and that is what we are proceeding on.
<P>
<B>(2155)</B>
<P>
	The question came to me: How should I as an MP from Ontario 
react to this request from the Government of Newfoundland? 
Should I interfere in Newfoundland's decision on a matter of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction? I have concluded that I should 
not. If I were to interfere, on what grounds ought I to do so? In my 
view the only ground I could interfere on would be one of 
overriding national interest. I do not see a violation of any 
overriding national interest in this case.
<P>
	I know some of my colleagues on all sides of the House have 
argued that minority rights are somehow being diminished by this 
resolution. It may be that over a long period of time there could be 
a diminution of minority rights by virtue of the passage of this 
resolution, but the situation in Newfoundland is radically different 
from the  situation in Ontario given the protection that is afforded 
to minority education rights in our province.
<P>
	Effectively there is no public school system operating in 
Newfoundland. There are no public schools in Newfoundland as we 
know them in Ontario. All the schools are denominational schools. 
All the denominational schools are being treated the same by this 
resolution. They are all having their status slightly altered by this 
resolution but there will remain denominational schools in 
Newfoundland after this resolution is adopted until such time as the 
assembly changes those rules. It has not indicated a desire to do so. 
That is something the electors of the province of Newfoundland 
can deal with when they elect their members to their House of 
Assembly. They are the ones who should have the responsibility for 
education in that province and they will have to accept that 
responsibility. The electors will have to take their responsibility by 
electing the right people to the legislature.
<P>
	In my view we have not taken away the right of denominational 
schools to exist in Newfoundland by this amendment. It is provided 
in there that they may continue under the resolution that is before 
us. While we may have weakened the current status of those 
schools by this resolution, we have not undermined minority rights 
unless we regard every group that has a school as a minority 
because every one of the school groups has been changed. I 
suppose it could be argued that every one of them is a minority and 
therefore we have affected minority rights, but in my view it is not 
an argument I find compelling enough to convince me as a 
non-Newfoundlander to interfere with the decision of the duly 
elected representatives of the people of Newfoundland expressed in 
their assembly before an election and again after an election, when 
they had a chance to change the composition of that House.
<P>
	I also note that six of the seven members of Parliament from the 
province of Newfoundland in this House are supportive of this 
resolution. If my colleagues who are elected from that province 
support it, who am I to second guess them and say this is wrong?
<P>
	I am pleased to support the resolution. I will accordingly vote 
against the amendment. I do so bearing very much in mind the fact 
that there are fears this is going to make a significant change on a 
particular minority, namely the Roman Catholic one. I do not 
believe it will. I believe this will work out for the betterment of all 
the people of Newfoundland.
<P>
	The people from Newfoundland who have spoken in support of it 
have done so eloquently and they have done so in the belief that 
what they are doing will improve the education system in that 
province which on any unbiased record is, if not the worst, is one of 
the worst in our country. Everyone is admitting it needs 
improvement. This resolution is put forward by the province of  
Newfoundland with a view to improving it. I am happy to lend my 
support to it on that basis.
