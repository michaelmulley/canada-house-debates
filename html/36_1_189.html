<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the federal tax system should 
be reformed to end discrimination against single income families

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like the Speaker to know that during today's 
debate the members of the Reform Party will be dividing their 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my 
time with the hon. member for Calgary Centre, who has done 
yeoman's work in fighting for tax fairness for families and I 
think he deserves some considerable recognition for his efforts 
in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am today moving that, in the opinion of this House, the 
federal tax system should be reformed to end discrimination 
against single income families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really is unfortunate that we need to put forward a motion 
like this in this place today.  As the official opposition, we 
rise in the House to deal with the gross and inexcusable 
inequity, one that undermines the basic unit of any healthy 
society, the family. I speak of an inequity which creates 
perverse unfairness for struggling, hardworking parents who are 
doing the most important work of the nation, raising children, 
raising the next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This inequity is a tax code which treats stay at home parents as 
though they are second class citizens and which, in the words of 
the C.D. Howe Institute, gives children the same level of 
economic importance as disposable consumer items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We bring this motion forward today after years of advocating tax 
fairness for families not only as the official opposition giving 
voice to the concerns of millions of Canadians but in many other 
organizations across the ideological spectrum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We come here in a particular context, in the context of comments 
made this week by the hon. secretary of state for finance who 
said, as we know, on Tuesday: “If two members of a particular 
family are both working, first of all they are putting in twice 
the working hours as stay at home parents”.  He furthermore said 
that they also have twice the expenses, including the expenses of 
not having someone at home doing the housework, that is, having 
to pay for maids and nannies, I suppose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reflected the views, not just a temporary slip of the 
tongue but the fundamental views, of this government when it 
comes to justifying the unjustifiable and inexcusable inequities 
in the tax code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an isolated comment.  Yesterday I quoted from a memo 
that the Prime Minister's office distributed in October 1996 
wherein it said of the Reform Party's proposal to increase tax 
deductions for children that the notion that this will encourage 
parents to quit their jobs and return to the kitchen is naive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the Prime Minister's office believes that parents 
who work at home raising their children are “in the kitchen”? 
What kind of negative, prejudicial stereotype is this enforcing 
about people who are making real economic sacrifices to do what 
they believe is best by their families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this was not an isolated comment.  I was at a finance 
committee hearing in Calgary in October of last year when I heard 
the member for Vancouver—Kingsway say to advocates for tax 
fairness for families: “Most women can combine career and family 
life but a lot of women just take the easy way out”.  The hon. 
member for Vancouver—Kingsway, as reported in <I>Hansard</I>, said 
that stay at home mothers are taking the easy way out. I say 
shame on the member and anyone who would tolerate that kind of 
prejudicial remark to these stay at home parents making 
sacrifices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for St. Paul's in the same kind of fracas with 
these defenders of stay at home parents characterized them when 
she said they are perceived—presumably by her—as elite white 
women. 
She is talking to these individuals who have come before a 
finance committee to defend equity and disparaging them as elite 
white women?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Essex—Windsor in the last parliament said that 
the Reform Party's notion of tax for stay at home parenting was a 
nostalgic notion.  I ask, not rhetorically but really, what is 
nostalgic about the choice made today by a third of Canadian 
parents who choose to give up the second car, the bigger house, 
the vacation in order to stay at home and raise their kids, and 
spend as much time as they can bonding with their children and 
raising the future generation?  I submit that there is nothing 
nostalgic about it.  I submit that it is specious to suggest that 
these people do not work.  They are doing the most important work 
there is to be done in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could dismiss these slips of the tongue in evidence of the 
fundamental Liberal philosophy, which is hostile to stay at home 
parenting, but these comments reflect the real discrimination 
that exists in the tax code.  Rather than hearing empty apologies 
for these kinds of prejudicial remarks, we want to see this tax 
system corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with this tax system that we are talking about?  I 
will tell the House what is wrong.  A family with one income 
earner who earns $35,000 ends up paying $2,281 more in taxes than 
a two income family with the same gross income.  That is nearly a 
$2,300 differential for a very modest income family.  That is 
according to federal government budget documents.  According to 
the C.D. Howe Institute, a single income earning family making 
$50,000 pays about $4,000 more than its double income equivalent 
or about two-thirds more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just an aberration.  The government made policy 
changes in its last budget to increase the child care tax 
deduction, one of the principal offending elements of the tax 
code in this respect, by increasing it over the last and current 
fiscal years.  It actually increased the disparity, the inequity, 
the unfairness between two income and single income families with 
children.  That is inexcusable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People may ask what is the basis for this inequity.  First, 
there is the child care tax deduction which allows those parents 
who pay for third party day care to deduct a substantial portion, 
$7,000 per child under the age of 12.  That is a deduction which 
is not available to parents who raise their kids at home, who 
forgo the second income and do assume a cost, called opportunity 
cost, the cost of giving up income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other offensive things this government did was to 
raise the age under which parents can claim the child care tax 
deduction for minors.  It brought in a $4,000 deduction for 
children between the ages of 12 and 16.  What does this mean?  It 
means that some parents are claiming this deduction to send their 
kids to hockey school and summer camp, while those parents who 
are taking care of preschool kids at home get no coverage, no 
advantage from the tax system.  It is just plain wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other offending elements is the basic exemption 
versus the spousal exemption.  The spousal exemption is worth 
about 20% less than the basic personal exemption.  What this says 
to fathers and mothers who decide to stay at home is that they 
are second class citizens.  Their value to society is deemed to 
be only 80% of the value of somebody who works outside the home. 
We say enough of this kind of second class status for people who 
are staying at home to do what is best for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the principal offensive areas of the tax code.  Single 
income families also end up in higher brackets.  They do not get 
to claim as much RRSP room as the combined room of two income 
families and so forth.  Families do not want it this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the interesting things we see, according to the Vanier 
Institute of the Family, is that over the past several years two 
income families have seen their after tax income stay relatively 
flat, while single income families have seen their incomes since 
1989 go down by 10%.  The single income families that tend to be 
at the lower end of the income scale and that need the help the 
most are falling further behind because of these inequities, 
while the double income families that tend to be higher up the 
income scale are staying at least even with the enormous tax take 
of the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Families do not want it this way.  Eighty-two per cent of 
Canadians in a 1998 Compas poll said they wanted the tax code 
changed to make it easier for parents with young children to have 
a parent at home.  Ninety per cent of Canadians feel that taxes 
are too high for parents with children and that this is placing a 
greater stress on them than it did a generation ago. Eighty-six 
per cent of Canadians favour a lot or some priority for families 
with a stay at home parent.  Ninety per cent believe the family 
setting is preferable to day care when asked what is the best for 
an infant or preschool child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a 1991 Decima poll 70% of the women asked said that if they 
had the choice they would prefer to raise their children at home 
rather than work outside the home and use day care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Canadians are saying by overwhelming margins:  70%, 
80% and 90%.  We do not get that kind of consensus on virtually 
any other public policy issue.  It is very clear that these 
people are falling behind even though they are working harder and 
playing by the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the remedy?  Very simply, we propose to convert the 
child care tax deduction into a refundable credit and increase 
the value of that credit to $7,900, which would equalize the 
playing field.  We would also convert the child care tax 
deduction into a credit.  We would raise the spousal amount to be 
equivalent to the basic personal amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a starting point, but we need to start this national 
debate—

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am absolutely sure today that we are going to hear a great deal 
about the importance of raising our children and care giving, no 
matter what choice is made by parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the hon. member raised a couple of issues that I 
would like to pose to him.  The first issue is the differential 
between the basic amount, the non-refundable tax credit for 
individuals, which is $6,452 I believe, and the spousal amount, 
which I believe is $5,380.  One of the recommendations is that we 
equalize those because they should not be different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would comment on why he did not take into 
account the fact that spouses who stay in the home can in fact 
earn $538 of taxable income before any of the non-refundable 
credit would be eliminated.  There is in fact another component 
that he has totally missed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary question concerns a problem I have with the motion 
itself.  The member consulted with me yesterday and I suggested 
to him a change which he did not accept.  The motion states that 
the tax act discriminates against single earning families with 
children.  One out of six families in Canada are lone-parent, 
one-income families.  Why is the member excluding single income, 
single parent families from the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are not.  The motion 
speaks to single income families with children.  Single parents 
with children fall under that category.  Those single parents 
with children who have no income suffer no tax discrimination 
because they suffer no taxation.  I therefore do not follow the 
member's reasoning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the question on our proposal to raise the 
spousal amount to become equivalent to the basic personal 
exemption, this is simply a question of equity.  We see no reason 
for the current arrangement whereby stay at home parents who do 
not generate their own income are told that their contribution to 
society is somehow less significant than those who are in the 
“paid” workforce.  We ought to equalize that. 
It is not a convoluted, technical issue.  It is simply a question 
of principle and a question of fairness.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate the member for Calgary Southeast for bringing 
this motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Helping our families through tax relief is an admirable goal for 
any government.  Certainly the Conservative government in Ontario 
has led the way in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask a simple question of the Reform member.  In 1993 Ron 
Mix, a Reform candidate in Edmonton North, said this about women 
in the workplace.  “Women are being forced to work under the 
guise that they are being liberated and enjoying the freedoms of 
the workplace, when in fact it is bondage”. Meanwhile, in a 
100 page paper the Leader of the Opposition quoted from the Bible: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wives, be subject to your husbands as the Lord, for the 
man is the head of the woman. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Reform member, as this motion deals with ending 
discrimination in the tax system, will that member also refute 
those discriminatory comments, or does the Reform member support 
those comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I rebuke are the 
gutter politics of the member for Markham.  Shame on him for 
taking an issue like this, an issue of fairness and equity for 
families, which he ought to agree with in principle, and taking 
it down to the gutter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member may not have recognized that the members of my party 
have engaged in a form of unilateral rhetorical disarmament with 
respect to that party.  But as far as that member is concerned, 
that ends right now.  Let me remind him who started the 
inequities for families in the tax code and who tolerated them 
for nine years.  It was the Mulroney government.  It was the PC 
Party which he represents which allowed this discrimination to 
seep its way into the tax code.  It was that government which 
de-indexed the tax rate which has cost $11 billion to taxpayers 
since then. It has forced 1.2 million taxpayers on to the tax 
rolls since then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shame on this member for accusing the Leader of the Opposition 
of quoting from his scriptural book in a negative way.  To bring 
a member's personal religious convictions into a policy debate 
like this is beneath contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all sorts of ridiculous comments that have been made 
by members opposite in the last week which suggest a 
discriminatory attitude toward single income, stay at home 
parents.  That is what we ought to be addressing our attention 
to, solving the problem which is creating enormous pressure on 
Canadian families, enormous economic pressure— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I was listening to the comments made by my colleague from the 
Reform Party.  I believe I heard him say that our colleague on 
this side was using gutter politics.  I believe that to be 
unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am happy to look into the matter. 
I heard the expression.  I did not immediately leap to the 
conclusion that it was unparliamentary.  But at the request of 
the hon. member I will certainly have a look at the precedents to 
see if in fact such an expression has been ruled unparliamentary. 
It is borderline, but my inclination was to allow it.  However, I 
will look into the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  What a jerk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Resuming debate, the hon. member for

member for Calgary Southeast retract the statements he just made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Perhaps the hon. member could clarify 
which statements it is he is referring to.  If it is the one I 
have taken under advisement, I am sure he will wait until I have 
had an opportunity to advise the House of the position of the 
Chair.  But if there is something else that was said, I am not 
sure what it is he is referring to and I wish he would clarify 
the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot repeat what he said. 
It is unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  We are on a point of order at the 
moment.  The Chair has indicated that he will look at certain 
words to see if in fact they are unparliamentary.  I did not hear 
other unparliamentary words.

word.  I will withdraw any comments that I made that are 
unparliamentary and apologize to any members if they feel I may

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I heard you say my name quite 
clearly and I also heard the comments of the member from the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  He did withdraw, and that is the end 
of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it seems what we thought might 
be a fairly calm debate could be a lively one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating an important motion which has been a long time 
coming to the floor of the House.  The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the federal tax system should 
be reformed to end discrimination against single income families 
with children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Single income families have long known that they are 
disadvantaged by the Liberal tax policies and it keeps getting 
worse.  For example, a single income family earning $60,000 will 
pay $9,589 in taxes, but a two income family making the same 
$60,000 pays only $5,790 in tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The single income family pays 65% more taxes in this tax 
bracket.  It is the same scenario at $50,000.  The result there 
though is actually worse with 91% more in tax paid by the single 
income family.  The lower we go, the worse it gets.  At $45,000 
the single income family pays 136% more, and so it continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the dual income earning family can deduct child 
care expenses if children are cared for in institutional day care 
programs which would serve to further reduce the tax paid by the 
dual income families compared to single income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even after a decade of petitions and lobbying the Liberal 
government each year adds to the discrepancy between the tax paid 
by single income families and dual income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Single income families pay more in tax on the same income.  They 
also miss out on the $7,000 allowable child care expense 
deduction if children are put in institutional day care programs. 
To add insult to injury, a parent who is at home is treated as 
somewhat less of a person in that he or she receives a basic 
spousal deduction of almost $1,100 lower than what every other 
working Canadian receives as their basic personal exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of other voices are joining with Canadian families in 
the call for more equitable tax treatment.  The Canadian Council 
on Social Development and the Vanier Institute in 1998 noted that 
average Canadian family after tax incomes have substantially 
fallen in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The C. D. Howe Institute, the National Foundation for Family 
Research and Education, and the <I>Fraser Forum</I> have all now 
reported that there currently exists unjustifiable inequities in 
the current tax treatment of families.  For example, the C. D. 
Howe Institute, when referring to the child care exemption 
deduction, said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it is difficult to find a rationale for the CCED in the desire 
to achieve greater equity in the treatment of dual earner versus 
single earner couples, since families that care for their own 
children have lost all tax recognition for their children. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers have long been aware of the need for fair family 
taxation in Canada, specifically in past budgets and again in 
this year's budget.  Reform proposed an alternative budget. 
We detailed a fully costed out proposal that provides substantial 
tax relief to all families.  In addition, we detailed a fully 
refundable tax credit for all parents regardless of how they 
choose to care for their children.  It is not a tax deduction but 
a credit that would be equal in benefit to all parents whether or 
not they had taxable income.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say let us leave the money and the child care choices with 
parents where they belong.  Reform has long called for the basic 
spousal exemption to be equal to the basic exemption.  Today the 
exemption for a stay at home parent is $1,100 less than for a 
working parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial considerations are important but also important 
are the social messages current tax policies send.  Let us 
examine some of that social messaging.  We know that family 
situations are dynamic and changing in Canada today.  Parents are 
doing the best they can.  Sometimes parents provide child care at 
home.  Sometimes an extended family member helps with the 
children.  Others share their responsibilities with friends or 
with local community groups.  These and a dynamic variety of 
other arrangements occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Liberal government give a $7,000 tax expense 
deduction to institutional day care but there is no recognition 
of any other type of care?  It sends the message that parental or 
extended family care has no value.  This is wrong.  A refundable 
child tax credit to all parents leaves the money and the child 
care choices with parents where they belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the message to stay at home parents when the basic 
spousal exemption is $1,100 less than everyone else's basic 
exemption?  For many the message according to the Liberal tax 
code is that they are less than complete people, that they are 
second class people.  This is a wrong message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often these same parents have chosen to devote the majority of 
their time to the nurturing of their children, Canada's next 
generation.  Do members not think that is valuable work?  Then 
why does the Liberal government continue the message to them 
through the tax code that what they are doing is less valuable 
than the work done by every other Canadian? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers say that the basic exemption should be the same for 
all including parents at home.  A recently formed national 
coalition called the Canadian family tax coalition called on the 
government to allow income splitting by families.  This would 
allow both parents to pool their incomes and divide it equitably 
between spouses to reduce total taxes paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also increase the equity of dual income families.  This 
is not a foreign or unique concept.  This kind of thing has been 
done in many other countries including France, Germany and the 
United States.  Reform supports the examination of joint filing 
or income splitting, perhaps through a parliamentary committee 
and some public input, to assess the impacts and to advance us 
toward more equitable tax treatment of single income families in 
line with today's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The C. D. Howe Institute stated in a very recent review of the 
family taxation system that the take portion of Canada's tax 
system, the revenue raising part, assesses taxes on an individual 
basis but the give portion, the many spending programs, 
calculates benefits on a family basis.  It asked the question 
whether this inconsistency was defensible.  I suggest it is 
designed to raise the maximum amount of revenue and pay the 
minimum amount of benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same report the C. D. Howe Institute stated that the 
Canadian Income Tax Act was no longer about tax policy and that 
social policy had become an increasingly integral part. The 
institute continued by indicating that, whatever the merits of 
that side of the act, social policy considerations had crowded 
out legitimate tax policy objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our point today.  We are calling on every member to use 
this opportunity to address the anti-family discriminatory social 
policies inherent in the current structure of the tax code.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting before the word “end” 
the word “permanently”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair finds the motion to be in 
order.  Accordingly the question is on the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have two questions for the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member knows, as a result of the tax changes in the last 
two or even three budgets a typical one earner family with two 
children and an income of $30,000 or less now pays no net federal 
tax.  He also knows that families with incomes of $45,000 or less 
will have their taxes reduced as a result of changes in recent 
budgets by a minimum of 10% and, in some cases, by considerably 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, in the 1998 budget 400,000 lower income Canadians were 
completely taken off the tax rolls.  In the most recent budget, 
another 200,000 were taken off.  Therefore 600,000 Canadians are 
off the tax rolls altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, did the member vote for those changes and support help 
for lower income families in that case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with respect to the child tax benefit, which I know the 
member opposed, does he support the policy implemented by the 
Government of Ontario, with which his party is trying to develop 
some sort of united alternative, to deduct from single income 
families, the families he is apparently speaking in favour of, 
and families on social assistance, an amount equal to the amount 
of the child tax credit the federal government has provided in 
previous budgets and has added to in this budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member support the fact that these poor families which 
were expecting an increase through the child tax benefit had that 
increase taken away from them by the Government of Ontario, a 
government that his party is in bed with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are a number of 
questions and I will go fairly quickly.  Yes, we did vote against 
some of the initiatives which this member just raised.  Our 
proposal detailed how a million low income Canadians would come 
off the tax roll.  We are asking why those low income Canadians 
were ever on there in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has talked about the various budgets they brought 
forward to help low income Canadians.  As far as dealing with the 
motion today, the inequity or the differential between single and 
dual income families has only been accentuated by the government 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its previous budget of 1998 it actually increased the amount 
of money that can be claimed for child care expenses in an 
institutional day care.  Again it totally ignored the other 
arrangements of parents in the best interest of their families. 
It only increased the differential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the child tax benefit is concerned, one of the tragic 
points about it is that it is more of a bureaucracy benefit.  The 
government takes money away from the same families it then pays 
the tax benefit to.  They give $1 to the bureaucracy and the 
bureaucracy burns up 40 cents of the dollar and gives 60 cents 
back to Canadians.  Why does it not just leave the money with 
families in the first place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of improvements are needed over there.  It is a 
fundamental rework of the way they approach the whole tax 
structure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was looking at the level of incomes. I believe my riding has 
one of the lowest levels of average income at $31,000.  I have an 
interest in a statement the hon. member made in terms of 136% 
more being paid on an income salary of $45,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member give us the real numbers of what the 
comparisons were between single and double income figures?  One 
hundred and thirty-six per cent more would mean quite a bit more. 
I was trying to understand what the actual numbers were in 
comparison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is exactly 
right.  It is quite a bit more.  It is more than double.  In fact 
those numbers that I quoted in my speech and which I do not have 
committed to memory came from this Liberal government's budget 
book that was released to all of us in the House. Those tables 
chart out what single income and dual income families pay.  If we 
compare the tax paid at the bracket the member talked about, 
$45,000, it gets worse when the income is lower, as the hon. 
member has mentioned for his riding, and the differential between 
the two types of families gets even greater.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

suggestion that the tax system is consciously and perversely 
unfair to one earner families with children. I recognize that the 
member for Calgary Southwest who moved this motion has sincere 
intentions but I submit that his logic does not stand up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simple comparisons like these do not tell the whole story or the 
true story.  What causes the tax differentials between one earner 
and two earner couples is the application of two basic principles 
of our tax system: progressivity on the one hand and taxation 
that is consistently based on the income of the individual. Let 
us look at how the principles work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Progressivity means that as individuals move up the income 
scale, they pay a larger share of their income in taxes.  Is the 
Reform Party suggesting that we should tax someone who is earning 
$50,000 at the same rate as someone earning just $25,000?  Should 
someone who is earning $1 million be taxed at the same rate as 
someone who is earning $10,000?  That is patently unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individual taxation means that someone who goes to work outside 
the home pays taxes based solely on their individual earnings, 
not on the income of their spouse.  That is only fair.  It also 
means that individuals do not face increases or tax reductions 
when they choose to marry.  That too is only fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party wants to eliminate the tax differentials 
between one earner and two earner couples, it has to be prepared 
to do away with these basic principles of our tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion is not an appeal for equity.  I submit it is a 
Trojan horse hiding its real agenda under the guise of family 
values.  Does the opposition party object to progressive 
taxation, to the idea that more affluence must be accompanied by 
more obligations or by certain obligations?  Why does the Reform 
Party not tell us up front that it wants the tax burden on lower 
income Canadians to be the same as the tax burden on higher 
income Canadians?  That is what this motion leads to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members of the Reform Party want a family based tax system? 
Then why do they not make it clear that what they want is for 
many women to be taxed at the higher tax rates of their husbands 
or vice versa? That is what this motion really does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Reform Party really believe that a husband and wife 
earning $20,000 and $30,000 respectively should together pay the 
same amount of tax as someone who earns $50,000?  If this is what 
the Reform Party wants, it is essentially saying that every 
dollar that a spouse earns should be taxed at the 26% marginal 
rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, Reform Party members stand up and pound on 
the table and say to cut taxes in half for everyone but not once 
do they mention that they would gut pensions, gut equalization or 
health care in order to achieve that sole objective of cutting 
taxes in half. How would the Reform Party party do it?  The hon. 
member opposite talked about proposing an alternate budget, an 
alternate way of running the country and doing the finances of 
the country.  The member fails to mention that the Reform Party 
in its proposal is also predicting surpluses in the $30 billion 
to $35 billion range.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party bases its optimistic growth rates at 5.5% over 
the next three years.  It is almost two times what the private 
sector consensus is for growth in nominal GDP, which is the 
underlying tax base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about these types of motions, in the end the bottom 
line is that someone needs to pay for them.  In order to do that 
we have to be able to plan effectively and ensure that our 
finances are in place in order to move forward on an effective 
and realistic plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform members also assume in their plan that they want to 
reduce almost $9 billion in expenditures to existing programs to 
provide resources for new initiatives.  Perhaps that is how they 
are going to cut the tax rates in half, by gutting programs to 
the tune of $9 billion or more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the unrealistic surplus projection that they have put in 
their program, $30 billion to $35 billion over the next number of 
years, basing their revenue growth forecast on an average of 5.5% 
for the next three years, almost two times what the private 
sector consensus is, by gutting these other programs, cutting 
almost $9 billion, or more, we see what this motion is all about. 
It is all about gutting the programs that we have in place and 
jumping on this hobby horse under the guise of family values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I have no trouble whatsoever making it clear 
where this government stands and where I stand, not just as a 
member of parliament, but as a husband and a father and as a 
citizen of this country.  I appreciate and I commend the hard 
work and dedication of Canadians who choose to stay home to raise 
their children.  I commend them.  And while I do that, I also 
support the underlying principles which form the basis of the tax 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not standing here talking about my political ambitions, 
like members of the party opposite who under the guise of family 
values pound on the table.  But they have another agenda which I 
think is way below what this House really wants to get into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We stand for a tax system that is progressive.  It is only fair 
that individuals should pay a bigger share of their income in 
taxes as their income rises.  I think that is an underlying 
principle.  I think that if the Reform Party is putting forward 
this motion, then essentially it is saying that it does not 
believe in that principle. Reform Party members do not believe in 
the progressivity of the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We stand for a system based on individual taxation.  I do not 
believe that anyone in this House wants to penalize women who 
decide to enter the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition may choose to see someone earning $50,000 as no 
different from a couple earning $20,000 and $30,000 a piece.  But 
if we look at the situation fairly, rather than through this 
moral myopia, the fact is that the economic situations of these 
two families can often be very different.  We have to recognize 
that.  Recognizing that these differences exist is only fair and 
it is only what a responsible government should do and must do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That takes me to the real bottom line for a responsible 
responsive government. It is finding genuine, effective and 
equitable ways to help those families and children in real 
jeopardy and need.  The answer does not lie in the so-called 
discrimination against one earner families vis-à-vis dual income 
families.  It actually does more to obscure the broader debate 
about tax fairness than it does to advance it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that some one earner families are better off 
than some two earner families and vice versa.  This means that 
focusing on one earner versus two earner issues misses the point 
completely.  It certainly does not make for a productive debate 
on options for making the tax system fairer and reducing the 
burden on low income Canadians.  That is why as the fiscal 
situation improved we have taken concrete and increasingly broad 
action to help reduce the tax burden for all Canadians.  But we 
have also made it a priority to target what we can do, the 
largest share of that relief, to those with low incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child tax benefit, which the party opposite voted against 
and does not think is of any value, has been increased by $2 
billion in three successive budgets to provide increased 
financial assistance to families with children. 
Of the $2 billion, $1.7 billion was targeted to low income 
Canadians through the national child benefit supplement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our approach to taxation and to families is fair.  It makes some 
sense.  It is delivering relief to families that need it most, 
namely low income Canadians, especially those with children. The 
opposition may try to reduce difficult social issues to 
simplistic arguments of either/or, us against them, but I believe 
that the majority of Canadians see more clearly and more openly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some parents choose to both work; others have no choice.  Some 
parents choose to have one spouse stay at home; again, others 
have no choice.  Each have their special challenges and concerns. 
There is no tax system in the world that can give each and 
everyone of these individuals their own special treatment and 
privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a responsible government must do is identify basic 
fundamental principles and apply them universally, equitably and 
reasonably.  That is what our national tax system tries to do. 
It applies the principles of progressivity and taxation of the 
individual.  That is the fair way.  It is the open way.  I submit 
that it is the proper way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in support of those values and in the sustaining of 
interests of all families and children that I have no hesitation 
whatsoever in urging the House to reject today's motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
do not know where to start.  That was more of a diatribe on why 
he does not like the Reform Party than it was on anything 
substantive to do with the motion we are debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is so much I could dive into, but I want to bring us back 
to the actual motion.  The motion is talking about the inequities 
between a single earner and a dual earner family.  One of the key 
areas in which his government has continued to make the situation 
worse and worse is to continue to increase the tax expense 
deduction for parents who choose to put their children in an 
institutional receipt type day care situation.  It does 
absolutely nothing for every other kind of parent out there. 
There are all kinds of scenarios.  All parents incur costs in the 
rearing of their children and the government only respects one 
option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the government not at least look at the inequity that 
it builds into the system in ignoring every other kind of 
parental care and saying only one kind has value and that is 
institutional day care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand that the hon. 
member has a great interest in this particular issue.  He is out 
there promoting his position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often take exception to the fact that the whole basis of the 
question and of today's motion is the belief that other members 
of other parties in this House do not support the work done by 
Canadians who choose to stay home to raise their families. That 
is fundamentally wrong.  That is the basis I take exception to. 
To stand up in the House and point to another member, to a 
government, or to a party and say “You do not believe that the 
work that Canadians do in raising their children at home has any 
value”, I take exception to that.  We have taken initiative in 
trying to assist those Canadians who choose to stay home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about the child tax benefit and says that 
it does not in effect assist those Canadians who decide to stay 
home or the one earner versus the two earner family. Speaking 
directly to the motion today perhaps after I give the response, 
Reform members might look at the child tax benefit in a different 
light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian child tax benefit is targeted on the basis of 
family income.  A one earner family receives substantially more 
money on average from the child tax benefit than a two earner 
family when the 1999 budget measures are implemented.  If hon. 
members would take the time to do the analysis, they would find 
that the 1998 and 1999 budget is enhancing the tax position of 
one earner families versus two earner families.

the time to do that.

two earners, they completely ignored the measures the government 
has taken to try to provide fairness in the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, is he fundamentally opposed to the progressivity in the 
tax system?  Underlying the member's motion here this morning is 
opposition to that very principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party, by putting forward this motion and the 
arguments I have heard so far, has never once mentioned or 
indicated to the House that it supports the progressivity in the 
tax system, that those who earn more money have certain 
obligations in terms of the tax system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased that the Reform Party is giving us an opportunity 
to deal with the important issue of tax equity and tax fairness 
for Quebec and Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you probably know, tax fairness has always been a concern for 
the Bloc Quebecois. Since the 1993 election campaign, we have 
never stopped stressing the need for a personal and corporate 
tax system that is based on fairness and equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1996, the Bloc Quebecois released a study on 
corporate taxation which looked at tax expenditures for 
businesses, that is the provisions included in the Income Tax 
Act to allow businesses to pay less federal tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less than a year later, we tabled an in-depth report that 
reviewed personal income tax and tax expenditures, and in which 
we showed the evolution of that tax component since the Carter 
report, at the end of the sixties, and the obvious injustices we 
found in the tax system, particularly for middle income 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also proposed corrective measures to the Minister of Finance, 
who was favourable to the report when it came out.  These 
measures are aimed at making the federal taxation system fairer 
to middle income earners and a bit less generous for taxpayers 
earning $250,000 and up, for instance, or for millionaires and 
billionaires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, we analysed the tax spending of individuals and 
concluded that there were $4 billion dollars of tax resources 
spent on tax advantages for individuals that were outdated, 
exemptions that no longer served the purposes for which they had 
been designed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took these $4 billion in tax exemptions and reallocated them 
within the system.  We also generated over $2 billion in savings 
that could be put towards tax relief for low and middle income 
families and correcting inequities in the system, such as those 
denounced by the Reform Party this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance was quite impressed by our analysis and 
set up a task force that held closed door meetings for over one 
year but apparently looked only at corporate taxation, not 
individual taxation, because he did not want to spoil things for 
his rich millionaire friends.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group, headed by Mr. Mintz, an Ontario academic, tabled its 
report last year.  It has been on the back burner ever since. 
This may have been a good idea, because what it contained was 
not necessarily what was desired, at least as far as a good 
number of the recommendations were concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to a very serious need for fair taxation, the 
Minister of Finance struck a bogus group that turned out a bogus 
report, which led to bogus decisions, for the latest budget 
contains no significant personal or corporate income tax 
measures aimed at correcting injustices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is flagrant injustice as far as the income categories are 
concerned. One need only look at the taxation rates by level of 
taxable income to see that there is a serious problem.  That 
problem must be addressed, not ignored or studied by bogus task 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of a family with two taxable incomes of 
less than $30,000.  Both the man and the woman earn less than 
$30,000, let us say $29,500.  Their tax rate will be 17%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, for a single earner family whose income is 
less than $60,000, that is to say one person who earns under 
$60,000, instead of two with a total income of under $60,000, 
the tax rate will be 26%.  This makes no sense, particularly 
since there has been no indexation since 1984. 
When I refer to indexation, I do not mean just indexed tax 
credits, personal exemptions and other deductions, I mean also 
indexation of the various taxation levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since there is none, we find ourselves in a situation where the 
17% tax rate this year ought to apply not only to taxable 
incomes of $29,590 as it does at present, but to taxable incomes 
of $36,918. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, those with an annual single or family income of 
between $25,590 and $36,918 ought to have paid only 17% tax this 
year, but instead they pay 26%. 
Can members see the double injustice here? If we compare a 
family with two incomes totalling less than $60,000 and a family 
with a single income of less than $60,000, there is a difference 
in the tax rates, one being 17% and the other 26%, which is a 
blatant injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the 17% tax rate would not apply only to incomes of up 
to $29,590, but also to incomes of up to $36,918, had full 
indexation been in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members know how many taxpayers are affected by this 
situation? If we look at the tax brackets for Canadian 
taxpayers, we see that 70% of them are in the under $35,000 
category. 
This means that if the Minister of Finance had the political 
will to correct the gap between families with one income and 
families with two incomes, and if he decided to fully index the 
tax tables and tax brackets, 70% of all Canadian taxpayers would 
benefit from such a measure. This is a lot of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because the Minister of Finance does not have that 
political will, and because of the fact that he has been relying 
on economic growth since he took office, the government is 
maintaining injustices such as the ones condemned by the Reform 
Party and by the Bloc Quebecois since 1993. Furthermore, there 
is  a lot to be done regarding the tax system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we released two in-depth studies on corporate and 
personal income taxes, and we found that, in addition to the 
injustices being discussed today, the tax system is full of 
inconsistencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take, for example, the child care expense deduction. 
Does it make sense that Canadian families earning over $100,000 
save a minimum of $313 in taxes on each $1,000 they spend on 
child care, while those earning in the neighbourhood of $30,000 
save only $175 for the same $1,000?  This is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Finance had done more than just pay lip 
service to the Bloc Quebecois' analysis of personal income tax, 
he would have corrected this a long time ago.  The figures we 
provided in 1997 were very eloquent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pointed out that 25,000 Canadian couples earning over 
$100,000 had reported child care expenses of almost $25 million 
in 1993.  Their tax savings were $7.6 million. 
We are talking about $7.6 million for 25,000 couples earning 
$100,000 and over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these 25,000 couples had earned around $30,000, their tax 
savings on child care expenses would have amounted to only $4 
billion, or almost half what those earning $100,000 end up 
saving.  There is something wrong here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many similar injustices in the taxation system.  I am 
sure there will another opportunity later on, because we have to 
keep bringing these things up, to give other examples of unfair 
situations that must be urgently addressed.  These injustices 
affect low and middle income families and prevent them from 
contributing fully to the economic activity of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must wake up and take a look at what needs doing 
instead of taking advantage of the situation and congratulating 
themselves on producing a surplus on the backs of employed and 
unemployed workers by dipping into the EI fund.  It should be 
doing some serious work and not producing the likes of the Mintz 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be supporting the Reform Party motion and will continue 
to work for fair taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this motion has come up in the House over the last couple of 
days.  The opposition leader yesterday said: “A two income 
family and a one income family, each with children, each earning 
$50,000 a year, are taxed differently by this government.  The 
one income family is penalized up to $4,000 more than the two 
income family”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is what the member was referring to in his speech 
when he compared two $30,000 income earners to one $60,000 
earner, the comparative rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said, if I quote him correctly, that each of the two 
income earners earning $30,000 apiece, or just below at $29,950, 
the first bracket break, is at 17%. He went on to say, however, 
the one income earner making $60,000 is taxed at 26%.  I believe 
I heard the member correctly. He said $60,000 is taxed at 26%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member not aware that in our income tax system the first 
$29,950 is taxed at 17% and the next $29,950 is taxed at 26% and 
anything over $59,000 et cetera is taxed at 29%?  Why did the 
member suggest to the House that a $60,000 income earner was 
paying a federal tax rate at 26% when in fact it is only 21%? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am keenly aware of the 
comments and thank my hon. colleague for the opportunity to offer 
some clarifications on what I have just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know very well that what he has just said is a fact.  However, 
what I said is that if there are two incomes in a family, both 
the man and the woman working, and the family is made up of two 
adults and two children, and if the two together earn less than 
$60,000, the 17% tax rate applies up to the $29,590 level.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the income is $59,180, the portion falling between $29,000 
and that $59,180 will be taxed at 26%.  This is where the 
injustice lies.  In the first example I gave, a two income 
family, the overall tax rate for the two incomes, which together 
are under $60,000, will be 17%.  If this is one single income, 
the part between $29,500 and $59,180 will be taxed at 26%.  This 
is the first injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a second, that I mentioned earlier. 
Since there has been no indexation since 1984, not just of 
deductions and tax credits, but also of income levels, the 17% 
tax rate applies only to $29,590.  If there had been indexation, 
the amount between $29,590 and $36,918 would not be taxed at 26% 
but still at 17%.  In other words, a person earning $36,900 for 
example would be taxed at 17%, whereas at the present time he or 
she will be taxed at 26% on the amount between $25,591 and 
$36,900.  This is where the injustice lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation does not affect just a few Canadian taxpayers. 
Most Canadian taxpayers earn $35,000 or less.  According to 
Statistics Canada, 70% of taxpayers earn $35,000 or less.  With 
just this adjustment to the indexation level, middle income 
families would benefit from tax measures. 
It would be only fair to them to provide full indexing, as well 
as correcting the injustice surrounding the difference between 
one family income of under $60,000 and two family incomes 
totalling under $60,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two aspects of the tax system must be corrected.  The hon. 
member should support this, being a member of the finance 
committee.  With all his talk of fiscal justice, he ought to 
support such a measure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion today and to 
offer my party's support for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP are committed to tax reform that is both fair and 
progressive.  It certainly goes to the root of our party's 
philosophy and vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been long time advocates of tax policies designed to 
ease the stress on families and children just as we have been 
vocal opponents of policies which discriminate against middle and 
low income Canadians and which benefit corporate interests and 
the wealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats have also been aggressive in our support of 
children, whether as leaders in the movement to end child poverty 
or fighting for a child tax benefit that does not discriminate 
against the poorest of the poor or erodes over time because of 
deindexation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also fully support, for example, the ideas that families 
where one parent chooses to work to raise their children should 
not be penalized financially for that choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we advocate extending the child care expense tax 
deduction to all parents, not just those who work away from the 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support that measure because it acknowledges that family 
friendly policies, progressive and fair policies, are policies 
that focus on children and not necessarily on the working status 
of their parents.  That is also why we support progress 
indicators that are not only focused on the fiscal bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current measures of well-being focused solely on GDP ratios do 
not recognize the important value of unpaid work to society as a 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By measuring the value of unpaid household work, genuine 
progress indicators like the GPI index championed in Nova Scotia 
remedy this flaw.  Measures like this one allow us more accurate 
estimates of our actual growth as a society and should have a 
direct impact on social policy and on assessments of our quality 
of life and our overall progress as a society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberal and Reform parties debate in the House who has 
it better, parents who work in the home or parents who work 
outside the home, the truth of it is that we are really missing 
the point. 
The truth gets lost in the platitudes.  Even this motion, which 
has good points, misses the bigger picture.  The truth is that 
all Canadian families and kids are under stress.  This government 
often with the support of the Reform Party has done more to 
increase the load than to ease the burden.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many reasons for this.  For example, incomes are 
dropping while time spent on the job is increasing.  According to 
the recent growing gap report the annual income of the least well 
off 90% of families fell in real terms between 1992 and 1997, 
most dramatically for the bottom 30% who depend heavily on social 
programs and suffer most because of unemployment, while only the 
top 10% of families saw a significant increase in income, up 
$5,000 to $138,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Billions of dollars have been cut from social spending since the 
Liberals came to power and increased targeting of programs has 
meant that some children are deemed more worthy than others.  We 
only have to look at affordable day care and decent day care 
options to know that this is more and more difficult to find. 
Affordable quality child care would ensure that children of 
parents who work outside the home are given the necessary early 
education and care despite their parents' incomes.  High quality 
care and early childhood education are critical components of an 
integrated strategy to meet the needs of families but 
unfortunately the government has chosen to renege on its promises 
and it is the children who feel the impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the tax burden for low and middle income 
families has also been on the rise.  Instead of increasing tax 
credits in the last budget for lower and middle income Canadians 
who have been badly hit by cuts to social assistance and UI and 
the growth of insecure jobs, the finance minister chose to 
deliver significant tax relief to high income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, families are under stress and Canadian kids are 
suffering because too many government policies and policies the 
Reform Party advocate are too narrowly targeted to favour some 
families over others.  Even Tom Kent, a former Lester Pearson 
adviser and one of the architects of Canada's social 
infrastructure, blasted the finance minister last week for 
failing to better the situation for all Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been the result of all this targeting and 
discrimination that has been designed by public policy into the 
system?  What has been the result of reducing everything to the 
fiscal bottom line?  The investment that parents make when they 
raise their kids seems to be treated like any other expense and 
kids become treated like any other commodity, like a company car 
or a business lunch.  That was not always the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a society we did not always favour one child over another 
because of how parents spend their days.  We did not always say 
that kids on social assistance did not deserve the same 
consideration as kids whose parents were among the growing ranks 
of the working poor.  We used to have a system tied to 
universality where there was a basic understanding within 
governments, within public policy, that the responsibility for 
raising children was seen as a collective and a community 
responsibility as well as a responsibility for parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognized that the well-being of children has a direct 
impact on the well-being of all of us. We used to have a family 
allowance for example that was universally accessible and was 
tied to support for children, not the working status of parents. 
Instead what we are left with in the nineties is a child tax 
benefit system that actually discriminates against the poorest in 
society because it was designed, not by accident, not to apply to 
families on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People on welfare do not qualify for the child tax benefit. 
While the funds will initially be distributed to every child 
below a specified income level, provincial governments will 
deduct that amount from current welfare payments. That means that 
most welfare poor children have gained absolutely nothing from 
this plan.  It is a system like so many others that is structured 
more to reduce welfare rolls and subsidize low wage jobs than to 
combat poverty and help children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than alleviating the poverty of the working poor and the 
non-working poor, the benefit is designed to push poor women to 
leave welfare and it does not recognize the value of the work 
parents do in the home. 
Most jurisdictions now have rules forcing single parents on 
welfare to look for work once their youngest child has reached a 
certain age.  Those ages can range anywhere from 6 months to 12 
years.  This age is actually going down as some provinces become 
harsher with people on welfare.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, single parents on welfare are forced to take low 
paying jobs even when it is not in their best family interest and 
not in the interest of their children.  The result is the 
percentage of children in low income families has increased from 
15.3% in 1989, one in seven children, to a staggering 21% in 
1995, one in five children. Since 1989 the number of low income 
children has increased by close to half a million or by 45%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the policies this motion refers to, the child tax benefit 
is discriminatory.  It discriminates against the poor and it 
discriminates against an increasing number of children who live 
in poverty in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women who have children are also subject to further 
discrimination with maternity benefits.  They receive only a 
percentage of their salary for the time they take off with their 
children, making the economic liability of child rearing that 
much heavier to handle.  Like any worker, if they do not meet the 
stringent demands for hours worked they get nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague for Acadie—Bathurst has advocated eliminating the 
new entrant requirement for workers who have left the labour 
force to care for children or family members as a first step in 
providing fairer coverage for women.  Once again it is a policy 
that discriminates against some families while favouring others 
but in the process does a disservice to all children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need is a much broader approach than the one advocated 
by this motion.  We need to make children the centre of family 
friendly policies that benefit all families in all their 
derivatives, be they dual income, single income, lone parent or 
extended low income or middle class. We need a plan that 
recognizes the importance of all parents, all families, all 
children, not just some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this motion because it does deal with one aspect of 
discrimination but we must go further.  We in the NDP will 
continue to advocate for a broader approach hinged on equity and 
fairness in our tax structure.  We will continue to fight for 
plans that do not discriminate some families over others because 
they are poor or on social assistance.  We will continue to 
advocate an approach that recognizes that it is children who are 
important, not just the working status of their parents.  We will 
continue to champion the fact that child rearing is a 
responsibility all society must share in.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to the members of the opposition, specifically the 
Reform Party and the member of the NDP, I agree with many of the 
comments I have heard this morning. Members were talking about 
comprehensive tax reform and fixing the inequities in the tax 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it strange that we are having this debate three weeks 
after the budget has been announced. This is like trying to 
debate something after it is a fait accompli.  The time to talk 
about comprehensive tax reform and fixing these inequities was 
before the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For three months all we heard from the opposition was gossip on 
airplanes, pepper spray, water bombs and other cheap political 
tactics.  Never once in the three months leading up to the budget 
did we have any real solid comprehensive debate on the fact that 
our tax act needs serious reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we count on the New Democratic Party over the next few 
months to put a more specific and substantive focus on 
comprehensive tax reform, building fairness into the system, so 
that we can build toward this for the next budget?  On some of 
the inequities members are pointing out I tend to share their 
views. I think our best hope now for reform is to build toward 
the next budget at this time next year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
comments.  I do not know how often the member has been in the 
House to listen to debate.  I can say, having been here during 
the budget and prior to the budget through all of last year, that 
time and time again these issues of discrimination not just 
within the tax system but within public policy, policy that has 
been developed by the government, have come up in this House for 
debate on a continual basis.  If the member is asking whether the 
NDP is going to continue to raise these issues, whether we are 
going to continue to advocate fair and progressive taxation and 
an end to discrimination, the answer is absolutely yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question would be when is the government going to listen to 
those issues?  When is the government going to respond to those 
issues by supporting this motion?  Will it begin with this one 
basic issue that has been identified within the tax system and 
then in a progressive comprehensive way say that it believes 
there should be child centred policies that support the family 
and end discrimination, for example the child tax benefit I 
mentioned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question really goes back to the other side of the house. Is 
the government prepared to listen and take action in defence of 
Canadian families? 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the NDP member for her comments.  I 
appreciated her stating very clearly that we on this side of the 
House have talked about this problem over and over again.  The 
first question was that we have spent too much time talking about 
APEC and all of these things. Was it this side of the House that 
provided the fuel for all that debate?  Did we bring up the 
debate?  Where did all the fuel for the debate come from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comments.  If we look at all these other issues, whether 
it is the scandal around APEC or the role of the Prime Minister's 
office, we have to look to the government's actions to know that 
members of the opposition from all four parties have had to raise 
these issues because Canadians are demanding answers.   Whether 
it is the scandal to do with APEC and the role of the Prime 
Minister's office, or discrimination in our tax system, or 
discrimination against poor people, these are issues that demand 
to be raised in this House.  It is unfortunate the government 
member says that we can do either/or.  These are all things that 
are before the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are debating this motion.  Today we are focusing on 
this issue and calling on the government to right a wrong.  We 
are calling on the government to recognize an injustice that 
exists.  We in the NDP are saying that this has to go much 
further.  We need to have a comprehensive strategy that says we 
believe we need to have child centred policies to promote the 
well-being of children in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to speak on the motion to eliminate the 
discriminatory tax treatment of single earner families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no more important fundamental debate about the future 
of our country than the debate about the future of the children 
of Canada.  If one takes the time to review the information that 
abounds on this topic, including the Mustard studies, it has been 
demonstrated unequivocally that the first three years and the 
first six years are the most important years in the development 
of a child's cognitive skills and socialization skills.  During 
that period it is absolutely pivotal that a child have a 
stimulating environment in which to develop the type of 
creativity and socialization necessary to succeed in an 
increasingly complex knowledge based society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discriminatory policy against single earner families with 
children is one way the government is currently encouraging one 
type of behaviour over another. 
It is what I refer to as a Pavlovian tax policy which tries to 
encourage or push Canadians toward one type of activity and 
discourage another type. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party believes very strongly that Canadian families should 
have the opportunity to make their own choices on these types of 
matters and that the government does not have a role in trying to 
push Canadian families, for instance in this case to putting 
their children in day care when in fact many Canadian families 
would prefer one parent to be actively involved and stay at home 
to help raise the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The C. D. Howe Institute in its recent studies calculated that a 
single earner family making $60,000 per year will pay a penalty 
of $4,000 per year over what a double income family would pay.  A 
single earner family at $70,000 would actually pay a $14,000 
penalty over what a double earner income family would pay.  This 
is clearly unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals point to the child tax credit, and I have heard 
this repeatedly over the past few days, as a way to ameliorate 
the perverse effects of their tax policy.  The fact is that the 
tax credit through means testing reduces any benefits to Canadian 
families beyond an income of $65,000, actually $67,000.  There is 
no benefit beyond that.  In fact the benefit begins to decline at 
the $25,000 level.  For the Liberals to point to the child tax 
credit as a way to ameliorate or to soften the impact of their 
perverse tax policies is absolutely false. It is bogus and is not 
reflective of the realities here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that on the lower income levels, eight of the 10 
provinces are clawing back the child tax benefits from the social 
assistance recipients. While the child tax credit purports to 
benefit Canadian families and Canadian children directly, it does 
not because at the low income level, eight of the 10 provinces 
are clawing back the money.  Money that was designed to directly 
impact the lives of Canadian children is being used to support 
provincial bureaucracies. At the middle income levels it is being 
clawed back by the federal government so as to not provide that 
benefit to families that need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa encourages new parents to put their children in day care. 
We believe that families should be able to make these choices.  I 
think we all know of cases where having both parents working in 
professional situations particularly is actually advantageous to 
the children. The parents choose to work and they choose to be 
self-actualized in a work environment and they choose an 
appropriate positive day care environment for their children. 
Everyone wins.  There is nothing wrong with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people argue that it is better for a child to have stay at 
home parenting.  Some recent studies actually demonstrate that 
either can work, but it depends on the individual family. It is 
important that individual families and parents can make these 
choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is not advocating a return to some 1950s model of a 
Ward and June Cleaver family.  This is not what we are 
advocating.  We are not purporting to know what is best for 
Canadian families.  But we believe that Canadian families know 
what is best for them and what is best for their children and 
that they can make those types of decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax system should not encourage, in our opinion, either stay 
at home parenting or the utilization of a day care system or an 
alternative system.  We should not be encouraging either.  We 
should give Canadians the choice.  It would be equally pernicious 
and counterproductive to have a discriminatory policy against two 
income families, because in some cases that may be the best 
alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position on this has remained consistent from as far back as 
August 1996 at our Winnipeg policy conference.  I will quote from 
a document: “A Progressive Conservative government would 
introduce a joint tax return so that single earner households 
with dependent children stop paying more tax than dual earner 
households with equal incomes”. That was in August 1996. 
“Beyond that, a Progressive Conservative government will 
introduce a child care tax credit available to parents working 
inside or outside of the home to replace the present system of 
day care credits”. We have been consistent on that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member for Mississauga South has worked 
assiduously on this issue.  “Caring for children is an 
honourable profession.  Parents who make the sacrifices and 
deliver quality care have earned the right to get support”. That 
is a quote by the hon. member for Mississauga South who is an 
expert in this area and has written extensively on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Liberal government not listen to its own members 
who have devoted so much time, research and effort to this cause 
and eliminate this discriminatory tax policy that takes choices 
away from Canadian families and parents?   Ultimately it may 
result in Canadian children not having the best possible start in 
their lives, particularly in this global knowledge based society 
where their cognitive skills and brain power are not only going 
to enrich their own lives but will reflect directly on the future 
standard of living of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue currently, and it is argued disproportionately, 
affects women.  Working women with children, for instance some 
argue, are actually paying an incredible cost because not only 
are they working hard in the workplace but when they return home, 
despite the fact that society has evolved somewhat, they are 
still faced with a disproportionate share of work in the home 
whether it is with child rearing or other domestic areas.  This 
is fundamentally unfair but it is a fact that women continue to 
share a significant burden both in the homes and in the 
workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have evolved from an agrarian society where men had 
significant advantages because people made their livings with 
their hands and brute force, to an industrial society where to a 
certain extent that may have been reduced but still occurred, to 
a knowledge based society today. I would argue that in a 
knowledge based society, women will have significant advantages 
over men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue about it disproportionately affecting women, people 
should recognize that in an evolutionary sense, in the future 
this will not disproportionately affect either sex.  Based on the 
graduation ceremonies I have been attending over the past several 
years for grade 12 and also university, women are winning the 
scholarships and the student council presidencies. They are 
earning top marks not just in history, arts and English but in 
maths and sciences. In the future this issue is going to affect 
all Canadians equally regardless of gender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members opposite may say that this motion is some type of 
archaic movement by the opposition parties to return Canadian 
society to the Ward and June Cleaver family model.  I would argue 
that from our party's perspective it is a way of effectively 
recognizing a societal trend that will benefit all Canadians of 
either gender.  We also believe that we should start treating all 
Canadians fairly and equally and it should start with the 
Canadian family.  Give Canadian families the opportunity to make 
the best choices for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will choose for both parents to work and for the children 
to have appropriate care outside the home. Some will choose to 
stay at home.  The best choices can be made closest to the people 
affected, the children.  Those choices can clearly be made best 
by the families of those children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get away from this ridiculous Pavlovian tax policy of the 
government where it believes that it can make the best choices. 
Let us return the choices to the people who really should have 
had them from the beginning, the Canadian parents and families 
for the benefit of Canadian children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for his kind remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do admit that I have been somewhat preoccupied in my 
parliamentary career with families and with children.  I agree 
with the member that we should not be playing mathematics when we 
are talking about the physical, mental and social health outcomes 
of children and that parents are in the best position to 
determine this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a contradiction here because the member does 
not like June and Ward Cleaver yet he is advocating choice. 
When I think of <I>Leave It To Beaver</I> and that family life, I 
am not so sure I have a problem with that choice about a caring 
and loving mother and father, about two well adjusted kids, some 
friends and a little bit of mischief.  I am not sure there is a 
problem with that.  But I do understand the member and I will not 
take him to task on it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise with him an issue with regard to the motion 
itself to see if he agrees with me.  I am personally having some 
difficulty with the motion.  The motion is so very simple that it 
lends itself to having some problems because it cannot cover all 
cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member would consider the situation where two parents 
work in the paid labour force and grandma takes care of the kids, 
and no payment is made, there is no child care expense deduction. 
All of a sudden the mathematics that the Reform Party have thrown 
to us fall apart, except for the fact that a one earner family 
would pay a slightly higher marginal rate on the amount over 
$30,000 versus the two $25,000 of a low income family.  If there 
are no child care expense deductions and the only other 
difference is progressivity, the only way to deal with it is to 
advocate a flat tax.  The only way we could resolve Reform's 
position is by saying that it advocates a flat tax and it 
advocates eliminating the child care expense deduction or 
extending it to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not agree that the motion is maybe a little too 
simplistic and maybe it is a little difficult to suggest to 
anybody that it is a solution to anything? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was not attacking Ward 
and June Cleaver.  Who knows?  Perhaps June wanted to work. Maybe 
Ward drank a little too much.  We do not know what he did outside 
of the house.  I am not convinced that it was a totally 
functional situation.  Perhaps it was.  But that was television 
in the 1950s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is, if June wanted to work she should have had 
the opportunity.  My point was that choice is fundamental.  We 
are not advocating a return to the chauvinistic principles and 
ideals that may never have existed in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this motion is sufficiently vague to represent 
the general intent to reduce and eliminate the discriminatory 
policy that currently exists toward stay at home parenting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Mississauga South is an accountant, so I 
forgive him for delving into the minutia of the details of 
implementation.  Perhaps that is why many great ideas that start 
with a glistening generality never actually make it to fruition 
on the Liberal benches.  They become so engulfed in the details 
that they never make it happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this motion is clear.  The intent of this motion 
is sound.  And we will be supporting this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was very pleased to hear the hon. member talk about 
choice.  In my particular case, when our children came along, I 
was married to a professional teacher.  She was a very 
professional mother.  We are glad we made that choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree that the tax situation we have forces 
that parent not to become a professional parent and that they 
both have to go out and work simply because of the tax system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw a cute little sign some time ago that I believe belongs on 
the other side of the House.  I will see if my hon. colleague 
agrees:  “A woman's place is in the home and she should go there 
right after work”. That is the attitude of this government.  I 
wonder if the hon. member would agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, after work a woman should 
have the right to go wherever she wants to go.  That is my 
opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the other issue, the government has clearly 
created a tax policy that discriminates against stay at home 
parenting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to my point that it should be a matter of choice, 
depending on the parents, in some cases it might be better for 
both parents to work if the children have appropriate care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give one brief example.  My mother and father raised four 
children.  I am the youngest.  Until 1968, for 23 years, they had 
a business, a store.  My mother was an equal partner with my 
father in that store and she worked day and night.  The first 
three children did not really have a stay at home parent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the member for Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the opposition parties for supporting our motion and 
also for the qualified support of some members on the government 
side.  I know this is an important issue to many members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to salute the work of my colleague for Calgary 
Centre who has done an outstanding job in supporting families and 
bringing light to this issue.  It is an extraordinarily important 
issue for people across the country.  It has not had the light 
that it deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a quick rebuttal to my colleague from Broadview—Greenwood, 
many people who have come before the finance committee over the 
last several years have pointed to this issue.  They have said it 
is a problem.  The Reform Party has pointed that out in minority 
reports.  Sadly, it is never reflected when budget time comes 
around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole reason this debate is happening today is because the 
Reform Party made this an issue.  We made it an issue, partly in 
response to comments that came from some government members in 
the last week, but really because we believe that this issue 
simply has not had the scrutiny over the last several years that 
it deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We underline the tremendous value of parenting in Canada today. 
Reformers believe that the family really is the basic social unit 
in society and that we need to find ways to support that unit if 
we want to have a strong civil society in Canada.  Whether it is 
a one parent family, a two parent family, a dual income family or 
a single income family, we have to find ways to support those 
families.  In doing that we end up supporting children and 
ensuring that they have a healthy environment in which to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers believe that there is probably no more important job 
in the world than being a parent.  I have done a lot of hard 
things in my life.  I have had to get up at four in the morning 
to go to work.  I have had to hire people and let people go and 
do a lot of tough things, but I can say, and I think a lot of 
parents would bear this out, that the hardest job in the world is 
being a parent.  A parent has to know and try so many things. 
They have to be a teacher, a health care provider, a bit of an 
amateur philosopher, a psychologist, a social worker and the 
family historian.  A parent has to do a million different things 
and there are no guidebooks.  It is extraordinarily difficult and 
it has always been so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would argue that it is even more pronounced because 
people have to work so extraordinarily hard just to get by. 
There are all kinds of polls saying that families are completely 
stressed out.  Both parents work today, oftentimes not because 
they want to but because they have to.  One parent has to work 
just to pay the taxes because in Canada we punish our citizens 
through our tax system.  Our taxes are extraordinarily high. They 
have to come down.  That would help not only single income 
families, it would help dual income families as well as 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a young woman phone me today at my office.  She and her 
husband are both in the paid workforce.  She said “Monte, please 
make the point that when we go to work we would like to have a 
better quality of family life as well, and the way to do that is 
to find some creative ways to allow us to spend a bit more time 
at home, maybe work from home”.  She said that if they were not 
taxed so heavily maybe they could work at home.  They would not 
have to put in as many hours, but they would still have roughly 
the same amount of money because the taxes would be lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She pointed out that some companies in Canada are doing things 
to help people because they recognize that in a lot of cases 
women with extraordinary skills are being forced out of the 
workforce because they want to spend more time with their 
families.  In a lot of cases it is women, but not in all cases.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an article in <I>Maclean's</I> recently about the Royal 
Bank allowing flex time for its employees and Deloitte & Touche 
doing the same thing so that they could accommodate the needs of 
the people who want to stay at home with their families and at 
the same time keep their expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the government has an obligation to do that. 
Maybe it could do that in its negotiations with the public 
service.  Maybe there are ways to do that for its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A way to help everyone in Canada would be to start cutting taxes 
of all kinds.  The debate has been a little limited today, but we 
need to cut taxes for dual income families.  We need to cut taxes 
for individuals and, of course, for single income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way this debate arose today, the catalyst for it, were the 
remarks that came from the junior minister of finance earlier 
this week.  Maybe unintentionally, he disparaged the work of 
parents who stay at home with their children.  He somehow 
suggested that they really do not provide a great service.  I 
would argue that they provide the most valuable service that can 
possibly be provided.  To raise and nurture children is 
extraordinarily important.  Any parent or anyone who has been 
raised in a family who reflects back on what it was like for 
their parents understands how difficult a job it really is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do about this?  The first thing we have to do is 
change the attitude that we are seeing from the government.  The 
minister apologized and I appreciate that, but the minister is 
not the only one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from members of the finance committee last fall in 
Calgary.  The member for St. Paul's chastised groups who came 
forward to argue for fairer treatment in the tax system for 
families.  She chastised them, saying they were a bunch of elite 
white women telling us what to do.  She dressed them down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Vancouver Kingsway said “Being a single mother, 
I do not quite see.  Most people can combine career and family 
life.  We know it is very difficult.  A lot of times people just 
take the easy way out”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going home to be with family and to raise children is not the 
easy way out.  It is the hard way.  It is a tremendous sacrifice 
to forgo an income to spend time with sick children and to help 
children get through the difficult times in their lives.  That is 
not the easy way out.  It is extraordinarily difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who is a parent will know that if there is something 
wrong at home nothing else in the world really matters.  When 
someone is at work and the children are sick or they are 
struggling in school, whatever the problem, nothing else matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say it is a great sacrifice to stay at home to be with the 
children.  I honour those people who make that decision.  Whether 
it is the male in the relationship or the female, it is a great 
sacrifice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us first change the attitude on the other side.  The second 
thing we have to change is the system.  In last year's budget the 
government actually made worse the discrimination against single 
income families in the tax system.  My friend opposite who has 
done a lot of work on the family issue must acknowledge that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government increased the child care deduction, but that only 
applies to people who make the choice to look after their 
children in day care.  If they choose to do that, that is fine. 
But we are saying, let us give people the choice.  If they choose 
to use someone else, maybe a relative to look after their 
children, or if they choose to look after their children 
themselves, they should be treated equitably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this government making an ideological value judgment that 
day care is the best way to go?  Let parents make that choice. 
Parents know what is best for their families.  Let us leave it in 
their hands.  Let us give them that choice.  I think that is 
extraordinarily important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often we see the government, the nanny state, saying “We 
think it should be done this way, or that way”.  We reject that. 
Leave the money in the pockets of parents and they will make the 
best choices.  No one cares more about their families than they 
do; not the government, not the heritage minister, the finance 
minister or anyone else in government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We encourage the government to pay serious attention to the 
motion which simply asks for an end to discrimination in the tax 
system against single income parents with children.  It is not a 
motion that covers all eventualities, as my friend across the way 
has pointed out, but it goes a long way to dealing with a bone of 
contention, something that is very important to many people in 
Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my friends across the way to consider this carefully 
and to do what is right for Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I understand that the blues show me having made 
unparliamentary comments this morning.  I just want for the 
record once again to clearly, unequivocally and sincerely retract 
any unparliamentary language that I used directed at any hon. 
member this morning. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the member's speech.  I thank him for his 
kind words.  I am not as comfortable with his words which perhaps 
attribute or ascribe the views of a couple of people to all.  It 
is the same kind of tolerance we should demonstrate with regard 
to the choices of parents.  I will not pit one against the other. 
If I disagree with someone I will make my point, but I will make 
it affirmatively and not because they are wrong.  I take 
exception to the yellow part of the speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have presented over 200 petitions to the House since 1993 
referring to managing the family home and caring for preschool 
children as an honourable profession which has not been 
recognized for its value to society and therefore requesting that 
the Income Tax Act be changed to reflect equity for those who 
choose to provide direct parental care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe all members of this place fundamentally understand 
that we are talking about children and we are talking about the 
facility of parents to make choices in the best interest of their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member a question, however.  The aspect of 
single parent families or lone parent families is not covered. 
There are no child care expenses if both parents work and grandma 
is caring for the children.  There are jillion other examples 
where it is not fair to say to the House that it can done by 
fiddling with the child care expense deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree that what is more important is that 
we are talking about looking at comprehensive tax reform and not 
just tinkering? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, my friend across the 
way points out that many people today pay taxes which makes it 
difficult for them to get by.  That is kind of what he is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party agrees with that.  We believe there needs to be 
fundamental tax reform and deep tax relief.  That is why we have 
advocated $26 billion in tax relief over the next three years so 
that everyone is better off in the end.  We want people, no 
matter what their family situation, to have more money and the 
ability to go out and carve out the types of lives they want to 
live.  We want less stress on families and less stress on 
individuals.  We agree with that completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying that the motion covers every eventuality.  We 
are not saying that at all.  We are saying that this is a 
specific matter the government can address.  It has the fiscal 
wherewithal to do it right now.  It has a large surplus.  It is a 
bone of contention.  It cries out for rectifying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Groups have come before the finance committee year after year 
and the hon. member has called for the issue to be addressed.  I 
say this is a specific thing we can do now.  It is within our 
grasp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on my friend across the way to embrace the motion and 
help make a change.  This is his chance to make a change.  I urge 
him to consider very carefully that now is the time, after all 
the petitions and the motions he has brought in, when he can 
actually make a change.  I call on him to support the motion.

the hon. member agree that while we should eliminate the current 
discriminatory policy, we should not create another 
discriminatory policy which actually favours single income 
families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was the youngest of four children.  My mother was a great mom 
and was also a partner in a business for the first three 
children.  She worked hard as a mother.  She raised me as a full 
time homemaker after they sold their business.  My three older 
siblings ended up being very successful and I ended up in 
politics.  I am not certain we should necessarily be encouraging 
one or the other if it has that kind of effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, that really is a tale 
of woe.  I am sorry about the member's position.  I agree we 
should treat all people equally in the tax system.  That requires 
a lot of changes.  We need to do a lot of work.  We need to have 
a real fundamental discussion about how to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first step could be some of the things proposed today by my 
party, by the member's party and others.  I encourage the 
government to open its mind.  There is a huge majority of 
Canadians are onboard in this regard and the government would do 
itself an immense favour if it voted in support of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is a real pleasure for me to rise in the House today to speak 
to the motion put forward by my hon. colleague from Calgary 
Southeast.  I am sure all hon. members of the House would agree 
that the motion and the debate today are not just about taxation 
but also about the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a huge stake in the Canadian family.  I have eight 
children, as I have said before in the House.  There is hardly 
anything that goes on in the country that I do not have some kind 
of opinion on because those eight children usually involve me in 
all kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my family of eight children we have two who are now married 
and have their own families.  One family is a single income 
earner family.  Another family is a two income earner family.  My 
wife has been a stay at home mom for a number of years.  With 
eight children that was very important.  I think I know a bit 
about the kinds of huge pressures on family life today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is anything we can do as parliamentarians in this 
place, it should be to pass legislation that helps the family. 
The family is still the essential building block of society.  If 
we take away the family or damage the family unit in some way, we 
damage the country, the nation, the society we all love very 
dearly.  This is not just about taxation; this is very much about 
the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past several days and even today a number of hon. 
members opposite have talked about the wonderful budget of 1999 
that is good for all Canadians.  However, there is a group of 
Canadians for which the budget is not so good: single income 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get the facts before the Canadian public.  If single 
income families earn $50,000, they will pay almost $4,000 more in 
tax than if both parents brought in the same $50,000.  The common 
sense of the people ought to prevail.  Surely we can see this is 
not right.  It does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should not only take my calculations in this 
regard.  They could listen to other authorities in the country 
who feel the same way:  the C. D. Howe Institute, the Fraser 
Institute, the Vanier Institute or Statistics Canada. 
According to these authorities and numerous others, the family as 
a whole is paying more in taxes and the single income family is 
paying more than the dual income family earning the same amount.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What sparked the debate today were the remarks of the Secretary 
of State for International Financial Institutions.  I do not want 
to go back over the words that he said.  They have been replayed 
on every television channel across the country, but what he said 
sparked a huge debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly I hear from people in my own riding, as I am sure 
other members in the House have also heard, that Canadian stay at 
home parents are outraged by this kind of statement.  Whether or 
not the secretary of state meant it in the way he said, it was 
said and it has produced outrage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this how little the government cares for Canadian families? 
Is it indicative of how little it cares for children?  Children 
are very much a part of this debate.  Is it how little it cares 
about changing the burdensome tax system it has created? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actions always speak louder than words for any of us.  If the 
government truly wants to change the public perception of the 
Income Tax Act in this regard, it has to change it.  It has to 
produce action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before I understand these matters quite a bit.  My 
wife has been a stay at home mom for a number of years.  At a 
certain point in our lives she made the decision to quit her 
registered nursing career and stay at home with our children.  We 
have fostered for many years and have many children in our home 
now because of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did she do when she chose to give up her career, for which 
I salute her today?  She chose to give up her career as a nurse 
in a hospital to be a full time nurse, chef, domestic engineer, 
entertainer, chauffeur, counsellor, comptroller and administrator 
with a host of other full time duties in order to raise our eight 
children.  If that is not work, what is?  That is work. When my 
wife heard the words of the parliamentary secretary we can 
imagine the deep groan that came from her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B>  The Secretary of State for International 
Financial Institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  I know there are probably times when 
these families have questioned which is easier: to remain as a 
stay at home parent or to stay in the workforce.  It is a 
decision that many Canadian families have to make. The real 
question, however, perhaps should be:  Which is more worthwhile 
to them personally?  How do they want to raise their families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge that many families do not have the option of 
having stay at home parents.  There are many single parent 
families in Canada today, and for these families the parent must 
play the part of both mom and dad.  They must be the breadwinner. 
They must attend to the multitude of needs of their children. In 
many other situations both parents need to work outside the house 
to make ends meet financially, and I salute these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that if Canadian families had their 
way and the opportunity to do what they wanted in this situation, 
70% of women have said that they would stay at home if they had 
the choice.  In a 1994 Angus Reid poll 77% of Canadians said the 
individual or family should have the primary responsibility for 
child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the budget process we have heard about the need for 
equality among Canadians.  What we are speaking about today is 
not equality; it is inequality.  Simply stated, Canadian families 
that are able to make the choice of having one parent at home to 
raise their family will pay more tax than the family that earns 
the same total amount of money through the combination of both 
parents.  The government penalizes them for wanting to raise 
their own families.  It is as simple as that.  Is that equality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims that it has balanced the books.  The 
budget has been balanced at the expense of Canadians, not at the 
expense of the government. 
Let us look at how the budget has been balanced: 76.7% of the 
balancing came from higher tax revenues; 14% came from slashing 
health and social transfers; 7.2% came from cutting transfers to 
individuals; and a minuscule 2.1% came from cutting federal 
spending.  This government should be ashamed for even bringing 
this budget forward with these kind of statistics. The hon. 
members opposite face some very serious questions not only here 
in the House but in their own ridings.  They will have to answer 
to the Canadian public for this kind of juggling of the figures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to fully grapple with the question of applying tax 
equality to all families we need to look at the benefits to 
society offered by stay at home parents.  We have seen from 
previously mentioned reports that this is not the choice of 77% 
of Canadian women.  The question begs to be asked why they do 
return to the workforce.  They have to go to work because they 
are taxed to death.  That is the reason one of the members of our 
family circle has had to go back to work.  The mother of that 
family has had to go back to work because her family has simply 
been taxed to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is unacceptable.  We must have comprehensive tax reform 
that brings equality to all families.  The motion today is a 
small step along the way to achieving that.  I ask all members to 
support it.

and then compared that to two people making $25,000 each.  The 
reality is a married couple with $50,000 and only one earner 
would always have the potential to send the one at home out to 
work.  So it is not $50,000 to $50,000, it is perhaps $75,000 to 
$50,000 which is the whole premise of his argument. It is idiotic 
and the motion is idiotic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did the same thing.  My wife stayed home during a certain 
period of my career.  That was a personal choice we made.  We did 
not come to the Government of Canada and ask if it could 
subsidize us somehow.  They are really saying that working men or 
women are allowed to claim child tax credits and are also allowed 
caregiver credits, and they think this is improper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the discrimination argument were reversed they would be 
saying we should not give those people who are working the right 
to claim day care expenses of up to $7,000 per child.  This leads 
into the last part of his argument that 70% of women would gladly 
go back home.  I do not buy that.  The argument is that women do 
not choose to go to work but that they are forced and driven out 
of their homes by the taxation system to go to work.  There are 
many women, and I know thousands, and many in my family, who 
choose to work.  They want to work and they want to be part of 
the workforce.  They want to contribute to society in that way. 
We all contribute in our own way. Some contribute by staying at 
home, others contribute by interfacing in the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member not really asking if we can get all these women to 
go back into the kitchen?  He is not talking about 
discrimination. He is talking about a way of life he would like 
to live that existed a hundred years ago. That is where he wants 
us to go. He is a revisionist.  I would like the member to give 
an answer to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comments but I do not think he is living in the real 
world. There are all kinds of families in this country that do 
want to see fairness in the tax system for the very reason we are 
sharing today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent issue of <I>Maclean's</I> magazine, which he may or may 
not have read but should, indicates a sociological trend in our 
country where many women who have been in the workforce for a 
number of years are now coming to the realization that whether 
they want to be out there or whether they were forced to because 
of the economy, it is simply more fulfilling for them in many 
cases to stay at home with their young children, and it is a lot 
better for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore in order to make that choice of going from the 
workforce back to the home they are now faced with a 
discriminatory tax system that will penalize them for going back 
into the home.  They have made the choice, and no one has forced 
them, to go back into the home and now this taxation system 
penalizes them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across the way is not in touch with the reality of 
today.  Times change, things change and what was good between 
1960 and 1970 may not be good today.  That is what we are asking 
these members to open their minds to and take a look at. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am delighted for many 
reasons to respond to the motion put forward by the hon. member 
for Calgary Southeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really nice to know that the opposition party suddenly 
cares about women.  This is a party that talked about women as a 
special interest group for so very long that I am delighted to 
hear that it has suddenly recognized that women exist and have 
complex issues to face in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is intriguing is that, as usual, the party takes what is an 
extremely complex issue and puts it into a very simplistic way. 
There is a danger in that because when we take complex issues and 
deal with them in a simplistic manner we quite often make worse 
the disparities that have occurred in a society as a result of 
those complex issues. We tend to bring the wrong measures to 
correcting things and make them far worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the complexity of the issue.  That is why I 
am glad to speak to this today.  I would like to inform the 
members across the way about the complexity of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is about valuing unpaid work done in our society. When 
hon. members talk about single income families, what they need to 
understand very clearly is that single income earning families 
come in many shapes and sizes.  They are not only the single 
income family in which one parent stays at home and looks after 
the children and one parent goes to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are single income families that have no choice about going 
to work. I would like to inform hon. members that these are 
called single parents.  They have no choice about going to work. 
They go to work because there is no one else to do so. They 
cannot afford to stay at home.  Eighty per cent of these families 
tend to be made up of women and about 60% of them tend to be in 
very low income jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These single income families are the ones that are to benefit 
most by what this government has done to deal with the issue of 
single income families, i.e. the national child benefit. These 
single income families earning $20,000 a year will be able to get 
$1,800 for their first child and $1,500 for the second child. 
That is $3,300 a year, which I think is a fairly good way of 
assisting people in supporting their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not only about families and the complexity of the single 
income family. It is also about the issue of ensuring that 
children are taken care of.  Whether a parent is forced to work 
because he or she is a single parent or whether a parent makes 
the choice to work in the paid workforce, these are the 
complexities of the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make sure members across the way understand the 
complexity of the issue before they try to apply the usual 
simplistic band-aid solution that they do to everything they 
discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue therefore is how do we value the unpaid work that is 
done in our society mostly by women. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For members who do not know what the government has been doing 
about this because they have never cared about women and consider 
them to be a special interest group, this government has led the 
world, literally, in valuing unpaid work.  We were the first 
country to put questions in the 1996 census about unpaid work, 
the amount of unpaid work in families looking after children, 
seniors and those who are ill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing we have done is a great deal of analysis with 
communities living in the real world. There is a group that has 
being doing a lot of work on unpaid work in partnership with the 
government.  It is called Mothers are Women. It tends to want to 
look at the issue of unpaid work, which the people across the way 
should talk about.  Unpaid work is not only done by women.  There 
are some men who still do some of the unpaid work and stay at 
home and look after their children. I hope those gentlemen across 
the way would be pleased one day to stay at home and look after 
their children.  I wonder if this would happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government doing for that group?  Right now if one 
chooses to drop out of the workforce to look after one's children 
there is something called the Canada pension plan.  I bring that 
to members' attention. It is the only insurance that allows for a 
child rearing drop out.  It allows for the person to get out of 
the workforce, stay at home and look after their children. They 
do not lose the benefits that accrue to give them a pensionable 
income at the end of their lives.  This is an extremely 
progressive form of assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other one is when people drop out of the workforce to look 
after children they can have up to five years away from the 
workforce.  Then they can go back and be retrained to get back 
into the workforce if they so choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all about choice.  This is all about ensuring that 
Canadian families, the complexity of them, the multiplicity of 
them, have the choice for any parent to stay at home if they 
choose.  We also have something called parental leave that 
addresses that issue.  Either parent can take parental leave to 
look after their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Canada pension plan that gives them the ability to 
stay at home and look after their children. Employment insurance 
gives up to five years of leave.  We also have the national child 
benefit that values single, low income earner parents in the 
workforce to get up to $3,300 for two children. Those are some 
things the government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is how do we talk about the income tax system which 
the hon. members have been talking about.  Let us look at what 
happens when we have a two parent, one income family with two 
children making about $60,000 and a two parent, dual income 
family making about $60,000.  Hon. members across the way are 
absolutely right. If all we do is look at how the income tax 
system treats these parents, the single income, dual parent 
family does a lot worse than the dual income, dual parent family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are back to choice. There are some families that cannot 
choose to have both parents stay at home because they need to 
work to bring up their children and do some of the things they 
want to do to give their children a better chance in life. In 
those families, other than the income tax, when we factor in 
payroll deductions, the cost of quality child care for those 
children, the dual income family is way behind the single income 
family by about $3,500 to $3,800.  This is a complex issue.  If 
we did the simplistic response hon. members across the way would 
have us do we would now have made that dual income family worse 
off than it is today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is complex.  We need to look at the issue in its 
fullness so that we can talk about the complexity of the issue. 
The point is that the government has been looking at the issue in 
many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one of the first chances we had we looked at how we valued 
the unpaid work that persons do in society.  That was when the 
Minister of Finance, in his budget of 1998, gave a $400 tax 
credit to persons who looked after the seniors and the disabled 
in their families.  That was a first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still looking at the issue because it is complex.  We 
want to make sure when start valuing the unpaid work done by 
whomever that it is done in such a way that we do not make worse 
the situation of people who are suffering disparities right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to inform hon. members across the way about the issue in 
all its complexity and let them know what we have been doing so 
far on this issue and to make them understand that the single 
income family comes in many shapes and sizes.  It is not only 
about one person staying at home while one person goes to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to talk about the new policy measures we can take as a 
government to encourage the connection between non-paid and paid 
work.  Forty-five per cent of women today are in the paid 
workforce.  We know that these same people have to go into the 
communities, do their paid work and come home and do the unpaid 
work as well.  These are the kinds of things we want to look at. 
How do we value the unpaid work?  We are talking about choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics prove the incontrovertible evidence of one of the 
great achievements of the century now drawing to a close.  Women 
know more now about freedom, flexibility and choice.  They can 
decide to pursue a career in the paid workforce or to dedicate 
themselves to raising their children or to volunteer within the 
community.  That is another area of unpaid work that is being 
done.  In fact, some women in Canada do not just one but all 
these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make very clear that the government recognizes the 
valuable work being done by women and men in the home.  In 
today's debate I hope that both sides of the House will send a 
strong signal across Canada to all women that we respect and 
support the decisions they make, whether they choose to go into 
the paid workforce or whether they choose to stay at home. It is 
about respecting choices, not about forcing people to do one 
thing or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is measuring and valuing unpaid work. 
As we create public policy our role as government is to ensure 
that government is a force for good, that government makes good 
public policy, not just policy because we want to throw a 
band-aid at the issue or not simplistic policy as the hon. 
members across the way would have us make.  We want to make good 
public policy that will eventually ensure that as time goes on, 
and very soon within the next century, men and women will be able 
to make the choices they want about going into the workforce or 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality remains that we do not have the resources to do 
everything we can to provide Canadians with the kinds of 
initiatives which would help families to ease their burdens 
whether they are engaged in paid or unpaid work.  The government 
knows that this is a challenge and that more has to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to doing it as resources permit.  We are not 
committed to doing what hon. members across the way would have us 
do.  They would have us increase the disparity which now exists 
within families that go into the workforce and between dual 
income earning families and single income earning families in 
spite of their complexities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the real cost of providing for one's family. Have 
hon. members taken into consideration how much money a dual 
income earning family or a lone parent earning family has at the 
end of the week for day care needs?  When other factors such as 
that are taken into consideration, dual income earning families 
as we know have very much less after tax disposable income than 
single income earning families with two parents. 
I want to make a distinction between single income earning 
families with two parents and single income earning families with 
only one parent, the worker in the paid workforce and the unpaid 
worker, at the same time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we treated the single income earning two parent families 
equally, it would not achieve equity.  I repeat that we can treat 
people equally and not achieve equity because it is a very 
difficult idea for hon. members across the way to get their heads 
around.  It is very complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a difference between treating people equally and 
achieving equity.  The government is committed to equity.  In 
spite of the different barriers that people face, we are 
committed to achieving equity regardless of whether barriers 
exist because it is a single income earning one parent family, 
because it is a dual income earning two parent family or a single 
income earning two parent family, or whether they are disabled or 
their race, culture or language are problems in the workplace. We 
are talking about equity.  That is something I want that group to 
understand.  One size does not fit all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member's solution would be to eliminate paid 
child care as a cost of employment in the tax system.  Are hon. 
members across the way talking about eliminating paid child care 
as a tax deduction?  That would surely equalize things.  It would 
create equality as they see it.  It would, however, increase the 
disparity to no end between parents who must go out into the 
workforce, single income earning or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be another way to apply the illusion of equality in 
the system.  It is all about illusion; it is all about smoke and 
mirrors across the way.  It is all about pretending to care.  It 
is all about talking about complex issues in a very simplistic 
manner that will make it worse for families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan recognizes non-financial contributions 
to families, as do the child rearing dropout benefits, the 
maternity and parental benefits, and the divorce law.  I suppose 
hon. members did not even factor them in.  They were just looking 
at one small component of transfers and how families have net 
incomes.  It is not just the income tax system that deals with 
the income of families.  It has to do with benefits, with pension 
plans and with transfers to individuals.  It is very complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The divorce laws should be brought into this debate.  I want to 
talk about when a family breaks up and how the children are cared 
for in the family.  In that family there may be still be only one 
income earning parent who is no longer living in the home.  How 
does that parent ensure there is income in the home for the 
children.  The divorce law looks at that and divides the pensions 
equally so that the spouses who do not go out to work and look 
after the children have something in the end when they retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is complex.  It has to work in the progression of the life 
cycles of Canadians.  We cannot simplistically look at one spot 
in the life cycle of Canadians.  Any policy affecting unpaid work 
must be guided by the principles of equity and fairness.  It must 
recognize the different situations of women and men who may be 
full time homemakers and women and men who work for pay and at 
the same time provide care to dependants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that in spite of what we hear today from opposition 
members, Canada is a recognized leader in how we measure and how 
we value unpaid work.  Everyone talks about how Scandinavia has 
been doing very well, and it has.  The Scandinavian countries 
have done a great deal to look at the issue, but they are not 
world leaders in looking at the issue of valuing unpaid work.  We 
are.  They are getting their information and analytical stuff 
from us so that they can start looking at how to make good public 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our efforts are ground breaking.  They are varied and they will 
continue.  Hon. members across the way may scoff, but they scoff 
because they are ignorant of the issue.  Because they believe 
women are a special interest group they have never bothered to 
look at the issue, never even bothered to consider it or analyse 
it in the great policy analysis they do.  Women do not figure in 
their policy analyses. 
Let us not forget they do not know so they can scoff:  ignorance 
is bliss and 'tis folly to be wise.  I can never accuse hon. 
members opposite of being too wise.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first time in Canada that we have been looking with 
the provinces at economic gender indicators.  We measured the 
time spent doing unpaid work whether or not one was in the paid 
workforce.  It was the time spent and the value received.  The 
provinces worked together very closely in that regard.  Canada 
hosted an international symposium on the issue last year.  We 
attended and conducted workshops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think hon. members opposite have anything new to teach 
the government.  In fact they might learn from us.  I would be

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am one of the hon. gentlemen across the way.  I hardly 
know what to say about such a shameful diatribe from the 
secretary of state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say something in defence of my brother who is at 
home right now looking after an infant and a toddler while his 
wife works as an occupational therapist.  I noticed the minister 
has a stereotype that it is only women who choose the option of 
household arrangements to look after their children.  I remind 
her that is not the case.  There are families that make choices 
for their children and for themselves in a variety of ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a single income parent after the death of my husband. 
Somehow for the last speaker to suggest that anyone who talks 
about single income families as being exclusive of single parent 
families certainly does not respect the life experience I have 
had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the secretary of state a question.  She 
talked about parents who choose to stay at home as though somehow 
they were opting out of life by spending a period of time giving 
care, guidance and training to their children, as my brother is 
doing.  In the same breath she said that we should not force 
people to do one thing or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If low income families with one or two parents pay $3,000 or 
$4,000 more in tax because of child care choice <I>a</I> or save 
$3,000 or $4,000 because of child care choice <I>b</I>, how is 
that supporting and allowing proper choices and equality of 
choices in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I sometimes think I speak in 
a vacuum and that it must echo across the way very hollowly. What 
is interesting is that I reminded hon. members opposite that some 
men stay at home, look after their families and do the unpaid 
work.  I clearly said that.  Maybe the hon. member was asleep at 
the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member understands so well that some stay at home 
parents or some single income parents happen also to be single 
parent families, she should explain that to her members because 
they have been mixing up the words single income family and stay 
at home mom in their speeches all morning.  As far as those 
members are concerned, those words can be substituted for each 
other.  Maybe the hon. member might want to tell members opposite 
the truths of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think the hon. member talked about making judgments. 
It is the opposition members who make judgments.  I think 
families should be able to make choices, whatever their choices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Staying at home and looking after the family is a valid choice. 
It is a good one to make.  That is why this government has been 
doing the groundbreaking international work on unpaid work in 
this country.  We do understand there is a lot of unpaid work 
done by men and women.  The reality is that the majority of it is 
done by women, but men do it too.  We are interested in doing the 
right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about paying $4,000 for child care versus 
not paying $4,000.  I do not know where she is because people 
cannot pay $4,000 a year for child care any more if they want to 
have someone look after their child properly.  It costs about 
$1,000 a month.  It costs about $800 a month minimum for a child 
in this country.  Let the member do her math:  12 times $800 
equals $9,600 a year. That is a lot of money.  That is not 
$3,000.  That certainly is not all deducted within the income tax 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what it costs a dual income earning family when they go 
out to work. That is, in terms of treatment, what puts them 
behind the single income earning two parent family.  That is what 
I took pains to repeat.  I thought I was repeating myself too 
much, but it is obvious I did not say it over and over enough 
times. I do not know the number of times it would take to get the 
information across.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
very much appreciate the comments of the Secretary of State for 
the Status of Women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important point which stuck with me is the complex family 
structures we have these days.  There is no single tax burden or 
initiative that is going to make everything equal and equitable 
for everyone.  We have to look at it in the context of tax 
measures and non tax measures as well as other social policy and 
economic initiatives.  I congratulate the Secretary of State for 
the Status of Women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state is responsible for the status of women. 
This morning in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> I read a piece that 
concerned me a bit and I hope she will be able to help.  I am 
sure mothers have read this and I am sure that Mothers Are Women, 
Kids First and other groups have read it. It quotes a report from 
the status of women.  I do not know who wrote it. It says that 
any new measure targeted only at parents who stay at home to 
provide care to children would only further reinforce barriers to 
employment by reducing the incentive to engage in paid work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This says to me that what we have now represents incentives to 
go to paid work and if we do anything for those who choose to 
stay at home, that incentive would be a negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need some help from the Secretary of State on the Status of 
Women on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was a very good question 
the hon. member asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, the sentence is taken out of context.  It 
was the Government of Canada's response to the United Nations on 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many people who have never been attached to the 
workforce who have stayed at home to look after their children. 
When they want to go into the workforce they would like the 
ability to have incentives to get the training they need.  We 
also must be careful as we balance the incentive and the 
disincentive that we do not go so far as to create a 
disincentive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is simply what that means, that we must be very careful 
that we make sure choices are equitable and do not counterbalance 
it in one way or another. There is a risk of doing that if we 
only look at the income tax system as the way to deal with 
transfers to individuals in our country.  That is what it means. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to follow up on this last exchange. There is a point I need 
clarification on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear that the secretary of state indicated that the 
incentive was to encourage people to enter the workforce.  That 
of necessity says if we are going to give an incentive, we are 
going to put money, presumably with a tax break, a direct credit 
or whatever, toward helping people leave their families so they 
can go to work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me, it looks as if the government, if not forcing people to 
go to work because of economic constraints, is directing economic 
benefits to those who do in order to somehow achieve this goal. 
I have a problem with that.  I would like her to clarify exactly 
what she means by this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought I just did.  I 
thought I answered the hon. member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not about incentives, it is about disincentives as well. 
We must be careful in very complex situations to make sure that 
we balance incentives and disincentives so that there is not a 
higher focus on one.  We do not want to create disincentives for 
people to enter the workforce if they choose. Why would any 
thinking group want to do that?  Nor would we want to create 
disincentives for people to stay at home if they choose. It is 
about making sure that we have disincentives and incentives which 
do not counterbalance each other.  If someone wants to go back 
into the workforce, and we know there are lots of single parents 
who stay at home or parents who say they do not want to go into 
the workforce afterward, we need to give them incentives to do so 
when they choose to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, certainly there seems to be a great deal of 
defensiveness on the part of the government about a very simple 
concept of ending discrimination.  I always thought that we would 
have a great deal of support on the Liberal benches for any 
attempt to end discrimination.  Apparently not.  Apparently this 
has generated all sorts of resistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today is very simple.  It is not simplistic, but 
simple.  The tax system should be reformed to end discrimination 
against single income families with children.  I am at a loss to 
understand why there would be such resistance and such anxiety on 
the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that on the other side when the position is 
indefensible, members opposite will misrepresent the position of 
their opponents and then attack that rather than try to defend 
their own position or even put forward, God forbid, a 
constructive alternative.  No, what they do is misrepresent and 
then they attack the misrepresentation and they are the heroes 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an old tired tactic.  It is not going to work in this case 
because there are thousands and thousands of families in this 
country who at one point or another decide that the best 
household arrangement they can make is to have one of the parents 
care for the children of the family.  They want some value 
attached to that choice.  What they do not want is for that 
choice to be penalized, to be discriminated against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the government can protest all they like, but this is 
precisely what they are doing and have done for years and are 
refusing to stop doing, in spite of the fact that parties like 
our own have spent a great deal of time bringing this 
discrimination to the attention of government, to the attention 
of those who structure our tax system.  We are simply asking for 
fairness, for an end to discrimination for people in our society 
who choose to spend a period of time for whatever reason caring 
full time for the children of a family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me to be a concept that should be readily supported 
by the members opposite, but instead we hear some very, very 
strange language over there.  We just heard a member talking 
about the workplace.  Excuse me, but how many parents do not 
think that the place where they care for their children is a 
workplace?  One works when one is caring for children.  It is a 
workplace.  It is time we recognized that it is a workplace and 
that that choice of work, if not being paid, should at least not 
be penalized.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state went on at some length about all of the 
international work that Canada is doing to give value to unpaid 
work, which is very nice.  What puzzles me is why we would put so 
much effort in that direction but fail to do the simple ordinary 
things that can be done through our own tax system at least not 
to penalize the people who are engaged in very important choices 
in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said that treating people equally 
does not mean equity.  Is that not an interesting concept?  How 
much discrimination in our society in the past has been justified 
by just such a specious argument as that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to end discrimination against choices, if we are 
truly going to allow and validate free choice in our society 
about the best way to spend one's work time, particularly if that 
involves our own children, then surely ending discriminatory tax 
arrangements would be our number one priority. However, here we 
see the Liberal government members tying themselves in absolute 
knots trying to avoid the issue that we are laying on the table 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention that this has been an issue for 
Canadians for a long period of time.  In 1994 a group of 
Canadians very close to this House, in the riding of 
Lanark—Carleton, raised an issue through the political process 
of my own party, the Reform Party.  The issue concerned a young 
family in that riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family had made the decision that one of the parents would 
work in the home full time giving care and guidance to the 
children in the family.  Because of that work choice, the family 
felt very naturally that it should be given the same value as a 
choice of work would be given to any other Canadian.  They made 
an arrangement whereby the parent caring for the children would 
be paid a salary from the other parent and the tax deductions and 
arrangements were claimed on that basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the intense chagrin, disappointment and sorrow of this young 
family, Revenue Canada denied this arrangement and won the court 
case, a case which cost the family money it could ill afford but 
brought to make the point.  The family then sought to redress the 
situation through the political process.  They went to their 
local constituency association, explained the discrimination they 
had experienced and asked that policy making be put in place that 
would redress the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituency association drafted a resolution and submitted 
it to the policy making process of the Reform Party assembly. The 
resolution was very simple.  Often there is nothing complex about 
these issues, in spite of the protestations of government which 
seems to find complexities wherever it does not want to find 
solutions.  The resolution stated, “The Reform Party supports a 
revision of the federal income tax regulations to end 
discrimination against parents who provide child care at home”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resolution went forward from the Lanark—Carleton 
constituency association.  It was one of mine that was put 
forward.  This went to all the other constituencies taking part 
in the assembly.  The constituencies then ranked the resolutions 
that came forward.  Three of the Lanark—Carleton resolutions 
made it to be debated, discussed and voted on at the assembly. 
One of those three resolutions from Lanark—Carleton was the one 
I just read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 600 resolutions that started at the constituency level, 40 
reached the floor of the assembly by having levels of support 
suggesting that members of our party decided that they were 
important enough to debate.  This resolution was passed at our 
assembly and is now part of Reform Party policy and has been 
since 1994.  I will read it again.  The Reform Party supports a 
revision of the federal income tax regulations to end 
discrimination against parents who provide child care at home. 
This has been part of our policy and part of our election 
platform.  Through the tireless efforts of people like the hon. 
member for Calgary Centre this issue continues to be raised and 
will not go away. There can be all kinds of rhetorical evasions 
on the other side. There can be all kinds of misrepresentations 
and purple prose and trying to invoke the ghosts of old 
stereotypes but the fact is our party lives, as all Canadians do, 
in the society we have today where there are, as the hon. member 
for Mississauga South just mentioned, a variety of family 
arrangements.  What we are proposing today is that these 
arrangements should not suffer any undue discrimination.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of discrimination do they suffer?  Perhaps hon. 
members will listen again to this.  Federal tax, prebudget, paid 
by one earner families of four with a total income of $50,000 was 
$7,116.  Post-1999 budget it was $6,464.  The bottom line is one 
earner families paid 91% more tax after this budget than a two 
income family.  It is unfair.  It is discriminatory.  We ask 
members to support us in putting an end to it today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when I first spoke today I suggested we would hear some unanimity 
or some consensus in the House on how important it was to provide 
quality care for our children regardless of how parents chose to 
provide that care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am working out some numbers.  For someone who makes $25,000 a 
year, after doing the full tax return here I find that they pay 
$4,469 in income tax. They have also paid CPP and EI.  Their net 
cash in pocket from a $25,000 a year job I calculate to be 
$19,168.  It is a lot of money. It is insulting to suggest with a 
child care tax deduction which for a $25,000 a year person would 
give them a benefit of about $1,700, federal and provincial about 
25%, that their decision to provide direct parental care is 
driven by $1,750.  I cannot in my heart believe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that parents who choose to provide direct parental 
care do it because it is their family value.  They believe it is 
their choice in the best interest of their children that they 
provide direct parent care because they believe it has a direct 
impact on physical, mental and social health outcomes of children 
and what we are really talking about are the outcomes of children 
here, not about taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member whether she would not agree that the tax 
consequences we are talking about here are really minor when we 
consider the net income a $25,000 a year job would generate, that 
the economic sacrifice being made is far greater than the impact 
of a tax deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it a little sad 
that the member would suggest that if parents really believe in 
this it does not really matter if there are financial penalties 
applied because they are doing what they believe so that is a lot 
better than money in the bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, that certainly is not good enough.  Parents also 
value being able to put a roof over their children's heads, feed 
them milk, clothe them and make sure they have opportunities to 
develop their skills and abilities through training, through 
recreation, through the kinds of things we do in society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is on the track that discrimination in the tax 
system is fine because they have the intrinsic emotional reward 
of doing what they think is best, surely he is joking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government that unfortunately does take this attitude. 
For example, the government starts clawing back the child tax 
benefit when income exceeds as little as under $26,000.  The CCTB 
supplement is phased right out when the family income exceeds 
just under $21,000.  Imagine trying to raise a family on $21,000, 
but this government seems to feel we do not need this child tax 
benefit supplement, which it is so proud of, if we earn over 
$21,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who just asked the silly question about the reward of 
looking after children being far bigger than something financial 
said on July 22, 1998: “The bold reality is that our Income Tax 
Act does discriminate against families that choose to provide 
direct parental care”. This same member proposed that Ottawa pay 
parents who make this choice $50 a week.  Clearly he does not 
believe his own rhetoric that somehow there is no financial 
dimension to this choice. I suggest he abandon that nonsense 
right away. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to first respond to an assertion made by the 
member for Mississauga South.  I sort of agree with his line of 
thinking.  He said that families choose to have a parent stay at 
home for reasons other than tax benefits, in particular family 
values and decisions they have made about the worth of having a 
parent stay at home.  I absolutely agree with the member if that 
is what he believes.  I am sure the member for Calgary—Nose Hill 
agrees with that.  It is not a tax driven decision when parents 
make that decision.  We can agree on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member to also agree with me given the clear evidence 
in his tax policies that once a family has made the decision to 
have a stay at home parent in a single income family that the tax 
system of this Liberal government, the member's government, then 
penalizes it for that decision.  That is what it is about.   It 
is about the penalty the Liberal tax regime imposes on two parent 
families that choose to have one parent working in the workplace 
at home raising the kids because of values and decisions and one 
parent out working in the general workplace outside the home. 
The government penalizes them for that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us agree on that.  We can agree that it is a decision made 
by the family in the best interest of the family.  We can all 
agree on that.  If we can agree on that then we have to agree, 
given the evidence in the Liberal tax policies, that a family of 
four that chooses to have one parent stay at home with a single 
earner income of $55,000 a year is penalized to the tune of some 
$4,000.  That is the whole point of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not be confused by all the rhetoric we heard from the 
Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and the Status of Women 
who I believe is completely out of touch with the ambitions, the 
goals and the dreams of the average Canadian family.  She 
verifies that statement every time she stands to speak in the 
House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My personal opinion, although I know it is shared by many 
Canadians, is this tax discrimination, this tax penalty does not 
stand alone as sort of a single thought.  I believe it is part of 
an overall scheme of social engineering that began back in the 
mid 1960s with the hero of these Liberals, Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau.  No other person in this country set out to purposely 
destroy the family as we know it as Pierre Elliott Trudeau did. 
He alone was the driving force that has fuelled the Liberal 
government's scheme to initially drive the second parent out of 
the household, to separate that second parent from the 
responsibilities and the ability to nurture and guide their 
children in the values that made this country strong in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is far more than this penalty.  This is a continuation of a 
social engineering plan put in place by the Liberal government 
under Trudeau back in the mid 1960s.  This government is carrying 
on that social engineering plan very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does it not want a parent at home?  If there is not a parent 
at home, if both parents are working, it takes away from the time 
the children have with their parents to look to them for 
guidance.  It takes away from the strength of the family.  It 
takes away the togetherness of the family unit, the strongest 
building block we have in our society.  At one time we had far 
more building blocks, far more family units than we have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Mississauga South agrees with us.  He knows 
families with a stay at home parent on a single income are 
discriminated against by the government.  I will tell the House 
how he knows it. He said it.  He agreed with us.  He said on July 
22, 1998, and he will remember this: “The bold reality is that 
our Income Tax Act does discriminate against families that choose 
to provide direct parental care”.  His Liberal colleagues are 
all shaking their heads saying how could he make such an 
outlandish statement.  I believe that if the member from 
Mississauga South looks into his heart he knows about the value 
of the whole part of our argument.  He knows we are right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is with the majority of his colleagues.  I say 
majority because there are some members who do not because of 
their beliefs hold positions of any great authority in that 
government.  If there are free thinkers in the Liberal caucus, if 
there are members who cling to some traditional values, they do 
not get very far in that government. I congratulate the member 
for Mississauga South, even though his talk is a little confusing 
today, and probably a half dozen or more in that government who 
have had the courage to stand up for their deepest held 
convictions.  Mr. Speaker, you know the value of standing up for 
your deepest held convictions. I know you appreciate those few 
members in that party who do as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real nut and bolt in this thing is the tax penalty, the 
fine, the levy, the increased tax burden placed on two parent, 
single income families. 
That is the whole point of it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a severe penalty to pay if any Canadian family makes 
the decision to have one parent in the workplace and one parent 
at home.  There is a single income.  There is a severe penalty to 
pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to every logical, common sense, grassroots, ordinary 
Canadian to be a travesty, to be an injustice in this country 
that this government would lay that upon a family which makes the 
decision to have a parent stay at home to raise the kids while 
the other parent is out earning a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just think of the sacrifice that parents make when they make 
that choice.  There could be two parents who are capable of 
earning, say, $50,000 a year each because they have gone to 
school.  They have an education.  They have training.  That is 
$100,000 in gross income they could be bringing into the 
household.  But they say no because the nurturing, the guidance, 
the care of their children is more important.  One of them will 
stay at home.  That is a tremendous sacrifice they make from a 
financial point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then they find, after they have made that decision, that the 
Liberal government imposes a penalty on them on top of what they 
have already given up.  I cannot believe the insanity of whatever 
weird logic the government used in that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot and I will not, when this motion of ours comes to a 
vote, understand any government member who votes against it. I 
will not understand the logic of any member of parliament in this 
House who votes against this motion.

<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to thank the member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley for his comments.  Being from B.C. at one 
time, I have travelled through his riding quite extensively.  It 
is a beautiful spot in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing he keeps mentioning, and I have heard it on several 
occasions, is that a person who stays at home has made a terrific 
sacrifice.  On an economic level, he is correct.  When my wife 
and I made the decision to have children and to have one of us 
stay at home, we never considered that a sacrifice in terms of 
the economy, we considered it an investment in the raising of our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Reform Party for bringing the motion forward today. 
I can stand here quite proudly and say that I wholeheartedly 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the Liberals discriminate when it comes to pay equity 
for their own workers.  We know they discriminate when it comes 
to regional rates of pay.  Why does he think it is any different 
to discriminate on a tax basis? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the 
hon. member for Sackville—Eastern Shore for reminding me—and I 
certainly agree with him—that it is not only a sacrifice, but 
there is real value and reward in having one parent stay at home 
if a family can make that sacrifice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the other points that he made as well.  The fact 
is, today we are talking about the Liberal government and the 
penalty which it has imposed, the levy it has heaped upon 
families who choose to have one parent stay at home and a single 
income.  That is the motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other comments that he made I am sure we will deal with as 
this parliament goes along.  I thank him for his support of the 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think the member was right in his assessment on where my heart is 
on parents who choose to provide direct parental care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, one of the things I have learned is that one does not 
pit one group against another.  We should not make judgmental 
calls on people's choices.  We should be promoting flexible 
options and letting parents make the choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I started in this place I pushed on the discrimination 
side.  I continue to deliver on behalf of my constituents and 
Canadians from all provinces who want me to table petitions on 
discrimination against stay at home moms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the member will know that one of the major changes made in 
the last couple of federal budgets was the increased investment 
in the Canada child tax benefit of $1.7 billion.  It is fully 
available to those making under some $25,000, and in fact people 
earning up to over $60,000 are still getting some benefit.  It 
was primarily directed at those families who had lower and middle 
incomes.  The value of that, as the secretary of state laid out, 
is very significant.  In fact it is greater than the value of the 
child care expense deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the member should look more carefully at not just what 
happened in the tax act, but what has happened since to other 
non-taxable benefits.  He will find that the attitude of the 
government has been to put the interests of children first 
because, according to our commitment to the UN on the rights of 
the children, children have the first call on the resources of 
the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member to be very judicious in suggesting that somehow 
I do not agree with one item.  I put it in the whole context and 
say that kids are being treated fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the values of 
the member for Mississauga South, but unfortunately he has chosen 
to do what every single Liberal who has spoken today has done. 
They have not been prepared to address the direct thrust of this 
motion.  They have talked all around the whole system as it 
pertains to families, but they have carefully avoided the very 
particular part of the tax system that our motion refers to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Mississauga South knows very well that in no 
part of my presentation did I attempt to pit families against 
each other because of their choices to have both parents in the 
workplace or one at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals themselves since 1965, since Mr. Trudeau, have 
deliberately pitted themselves against Canadian families, 
particularly against single income, two parent families.  The 
Liberals have done the pitting.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to speak to this issue as a mother who works 
outside the home and as a very proud mother of three wonderful, 
talented, brilliant, charming and intelligent children, ages 17, 
14 and 9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The diverse and changing nature of working family life in Canada 
poses ongoing challenges to policy makers.  With limited 
resources, government priorities have placed an emphasis on 
assisting families in greatest need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken direct action to help low income 
families with children through the Canada child tax benefit which 
provides a special supplement of $213 per child under the age of 
seven for families that do not claim child care expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the 1999 budget, by July 2000 a typical one income 
family will be receiving better than twice the amount of a 
typical two income family for the Canada child tax benefit.  The 
figures show $2,610 per year versus $1,270 per year.  Indeed with 
the measures announced in the last three budgets the Canada child 
tax benefit will be enriched by $2 billion by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada provides a range of income tax in children's benefits, 
but our tax system is based on individual taxation and a 
progressive tax rate.  Moreover, when the real cost of child care 
in dual earner and lone parent families is taken into account, 
these families have relatively less after tax disposable income 
than single earner couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If paid child care was not recognized as a cost of employment to 
the tax system it would constitute a serious barrier to women's 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to pensions and retirement, parents who stay at home 
to care for children are recognized in several ways.  Parts of 
the retirement system provide a basic benefit for all residents 
and an income tested guaranteed minimum income.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also provisions for an income-earning spouse to 
contribute to a private registered retirement savings plan for a 
stay at home spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan also has specific provisions for parents 
who care for children at home.  The child-rearing dropout 
provision, for example, ensures that parents who are able to 
contribute little or nothing to the plan while caring for a child 
under seven are not penalized when future benefits are 
calculated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance benefits in Canada provide temporary income 
replacement to individuals who qualify.  To qualify for benefits 
a parent must have been engaged in insurable employment prior to 
the birth or adoption of their child.  Maternity, parental and 
adoption benefits do, however, provide income replacement for 
mothers and fathers who temporarily withdraw from paid work, 
including part time work, to care for their infants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, parents who stay at home after their benefit period 
has ended are eligible for up to five years to access a range of 
measures to help them return to employment if they should so 
desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government also continues to assist Canadian children and 
youth through a variety of programs.  I am very proud to speak 
about the community action program for children and the Canada 
prenatal nutrition program which are jointly managed by the 
federal, provincial and territorial governments and which provide 
the kind of support that families need to help their children 
have a good start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 budget announced increased funding for these programs 
of $100 million for the next three years.  In the 1999 budget the 
Canada prenatal nutrition program was further enhanced.  It 
received an additional $75 million over the next three years to 
reach many more high risk pregnant women.  This is a program of 
which many constituents in my riding of Parkdale—High Park are 
beneficiaries.  The community action program for children and the 
Canada prenatal nutrition program benefits the women's health 
centre and the Parkdale Parents Primary Prevention Program, which 
is known affectionately as the “five <I>Ps</I>”, and which works 
out of St. Joseph's Health Centre in my riding.  It is a 
wonderful program and has assisted many, many young children and 
pregnant women at high risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also remember that we have Canada student grants of up 
to $3,000 a year which are available to both full time and part 
time students in financial need who have children or other 
dependants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the Liberal government's tax principles.  The 
Liberal government's tax is based on three fundamental 
principles.  First, our tax system must be fair.  Tax reductions 
must benefit first those who need them the most, low and middle 
income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, broad based tax relief should focus initially on 
personal income taxes.  That is where the burden is the greatest. 
Canadians should pay taxes consistent with their capacity to pay. 
We have a progressive tax system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, because of our debt burden, broad based tax relief should 
not be financed with borrowed money.  The elimination of the 
deficit in 1997-98 allowed the government to introduce measures 
providing for broad based tax relief.  Targeted tax reductions 
into critical social and economic concerns are our first 
priority.  Our government has put in place a responsible fiscal 
policy that has allowed us to preserve the valued programs that 
matter most to Canadians.  Targeted tax relief has been provided 
for students, for charities, for persons with disabilities and 
for the children of parents with low incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal approach has been based on results.  With an 
improved fiscal situation over recent years, the Liberal 
government has been able to offer targeted tax relief where the 
need was the greatest.  With the budget balanced, the government 
is in a position to do even more, and not on borrowed money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 and 1999 Liberal government budgets will provide tax 
relief of $3.9 billion in 1999-2000, $6 billion in 2000-2001 and 
$6.6 billion in 2001-2002, for a total of $16.5 billion over 
three years so that all Canadian parents, those who stay at home 
and those who work outside the home, have more money in their 
pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the financial resources permit, general tax relief will 
continue to be provided, the priority being personal income taxes 
for middle and low income Canadians.  Families with incomes of 
$45,000 or less will have their taxes reduced by a minimum of 10% 
and in some cases more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Typical one-earner families with two children and incomes of 
$30,000 or less will pay no net federal tax. 
Families with incomes of $45,000 or less will have their taxes 
reduced by a minimum of 10% and in some cases even more.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the 1998 budget, 400,000 lower income Canadians 
no longer pay any federal income taxes.  The 1999 measures will 
ensure that an additional 200,000 lower income Canadians will no 
longer pay federal income taxes.  That brings to 600,000 the 
total number of taxpayers removed from the tax rolls due to both 
budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We welcome a debate but we will not exploit it as a way to 
divide Canadian parents and Canadian women whose top priority, be 
it at home or outside the home, is giving their children the best 
future they possibly can. Let us start on that debate now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the disadvantages of dual earner families, people 
who have to pay for child care, people who do not have the 
ability to stay at home.  We have talked many times about looking 
at having the whole child care benefit totally tax deductible. 
As we want to encourage women to export abroad they will be away 
from home more.  We need to make sure that we have in place the 
good care givers and that those expenses can be deductible and 
have the same position as the cost of a secretary or the cost of 
janitorial staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us open the debate on what else we can do.  Let us look at 
what we can do to make sure that we have in place all the things 
that are needed to provide the best for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say one thing to the members of the Reform Party.  I 
welcome this opportunity to look at all the ways we can best 
assist our society in making sure that our children are taken 
care of. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, certainly family issues have been a big concern of mine 
since I was elected in 1997.  They are a big concern for my 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is not particularly wealthy.  There are many people 
with average or lower incomes.  Child poverty has been brought to 
my attention many times over and over, both through the school 
system and by individual parents.  People have also brought 
forward the unfairness of the tax system that is in favour of the 
two income families and discriminates against one income 
families. Does the member not appreciate and agree that if this 
discrimination was removed, child poverty would be lessened in 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question about child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a mother who works outside of the home, I have always felt 
that as legislators, as policy makers, when we look at questions 
of child poverty or abuse against women and children, we have the 
duty to do everything we possibly can to ensure that we foster an 
environment to promote the economic independence of women.  When 
we can foster the environment where women can walk away from 
abusive situations, it will be the children who will benefit. It 
will be those children of single, dual or whatever parent who 
will benefit.  I again would welcome how we do that as a 
government through our tax policies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one of my favourite backbenchers of the Liberal Party is 
speaking again today. I do appreciate the fact that being a 
mother of three she has a great concern for this particular 
subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple.  She admitted that we have to work 
more.  We have to find new solutions to help not only dual income 
earners but also the single income earner with a family. Why then 
did her government break its 1993 promise for day care facilities 
across this country to help those people who are in poverty and 
in tight situations?  Why did her government break the day care 
promise which was the red book platform? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about child poverty and our promises, we promised 
that we would put in the Canada child tax benefit.  The Minister 
of Human Resources Development yesterday in the House spoke about 
how consultations were made on how to best deal with child 
poverty. 
The answer was $850 million in the child tax benefit.  In the 
following budget there was another $850 million, totalling $1.7 
billion. In the 1999 budget we have another $300 million.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to the hon. member not only are we honouring our 
promises to combat child poverty but we have done it in every 
single budget we have looked at in the last three years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the 
member missed the question so I would like to rephrase it.  The 
question was, why did the Liberal government promise day care 
spaces in the 1993 election campaign and then break that promise? 
That was the specific question.  I would like to know the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought I had answered 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were talking about dealing with child poverty. We have put in 
place many things to assist parents who want to go back to work. 
We have Canada student grants as I indicated. I do not understand 
why the opposition does not acknowledge the tremendous benefits 
of the Canada child tax benefit.  Perhaps it is because the 
Reform Party voted against it time and time again, but now the 
Reform Party is coming out as a saviour of children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it appears that we have another day in la-la land with the Reform 
Party motion.  Somehow it has arrived on the road to Damascus to 
some great revelation that it has compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party will recall that yesterday the Minister of 
Health announced a new policy to allow for the medicinal use of 
marijuana on a pilot project basis.  I am curious if the Reform 
Party caucus might not be one of the first pilot projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I am listening very carefully to the comments of the 
member for Mississauga West and I am trying to see how marijuana 
has any relevance to the topic before the House.  The member is 
not addressing the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know that there is always some 
latitude allowed in debate.  The hon. member for Mississauga West 
has only had the floor for 40 seconds.  I think it is 
understandable that perhaps he has not quite reached the topic he 
is going to address which is the motion before the House.  I know 
he will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, their strategy to rise on 
some nonsensical point of order in an attempt to disrupt the flow 
of my speech will not work.  I know that you, Mr. Speaker, will 
rule them out of order as they continue with this frivolity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is what this motion is about.  The member for Calgary 
Southeast is trying to put forward a softening image.  Perhaps he 
is trying to launch his campaign for leadership of the Reform 
Party. He is trying to show that he is compassionate man.  For 
the member for Calgary Southeast to be giving advice on whether 
or not people should stay home with their children is not unlike 
a Catholic priest giving marital counselling.  I would suggest 
the member should talk to people who have actually walked the 
walk and talked the talk.  Any attempt to try to define the 
Reform Party as compassionate will be seen as nothing more than 
an oxymoron which is exactly what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Moron is a great word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Moron, or maybe we should delete oxy, 
I am not sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know for a fact that the Reform Party's policies would hurt 
children in this country.  The Reform Party has consistently 
voted against measures announced and taken by this government 
that benefit children. And Reform Party members chirp on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally what we see on opposition day from the Reform Party are 
motions to cut this or cut that, to spend this or spend that.  I 
do not know how Reform Party members would pay for the tax cuts 
they talk about when in fact their tax position would benefit a 
family earning $215,000 in exactly the same way that it would 
affect a family earning $15,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's tax policies would benefit the rich.  Reform 
members know it.  It is flat line. 
Of course that is fitting with their flat earth mentality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that they do not understand a progressive tax 
policy that benefits people who need it.  Child care, day care, 
child tax credits; they vote against all of them; they talk 
against all of them.  For them to all of a sudden arrive in this 
place and try to tell us and Canadians that they indeed are 
kinder, gentler, more caring and softer does not add up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have proposed in the past that 50% of what they 
refer to as a surplus should be used to reduce debt.  Another 50% 
should be used to reduce taxes.  A third 50% should be used 
toward health care.  Another 50% should be used to cut defence 
spending, to cut the heritage ministry, things that they get on 
as their hobby horses.  Now they are trying to perpetrate what 
amounts to a fraud that they somehow care about children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And here we go with a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I could handle the hon. member's lack of knowledge of 
mathematics, but I cannot accept the word fraud to be used in 
reference to my party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid that word has been used 
quite a lot and I have real difficulty ruling that one out of 
order.  I think that perhaps we have to be a little tougher in 
our thinking, but I have heard it used in relation to many 
parties in the House, including that of the hon. member for 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley and the government party and some 
of the others.  I do not think the point of order is well taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in that case do I have your 
approval to use the term stable waste when referring to the items 
in his speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member will not want 
to get into that discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, whatever it is, it is 
probably on the hon. member's boots.  I would have a look. In any 
event we know where they spend most of their time and what 
certainly clouds their thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me share if I can some of the other so-called progressive 
tax policies the Reform Party would try to sell to people during 
an election campaign.  The Reform Party opposed all positive 
initiatives by the government, everything that we have introduced 
to enhance the lives of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Party members voted against the child tax credit.  Why 
would they do that?  They voted against funding a community 
action program for children. Unbelievably they voted against 
funding for prenatal nutrition care.  Yet today, as I say, they 
somehow miraculously have arrived at this wonderful position that 
they are the saviours for stay at home parents and their kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who do hon. members think might have faced the brunt of a $3.5 
billion cut to the social assistance program?  Might it just be 
children in need?  I suspect it might.  That was a policy of the 
Reform Party.  Maybe the Reform Party has cancelled that policy. 
It is one of those “we have got principles and if you do not 
like them we have got others”.  Maybe Reform has done that. 
Maybe the Reform members have made that shift, but I have not 
heard it in terms of anything they have said in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would Reform Party members propose to cut $1 billion in 
equalization payments to the have not provinces and another $1 
billion to aboriginal programs?  Does it occur to them that 
cutting $1 billion out of aboriginal programs might have a 
trickle down impact on aboriginal children, some of whom are the 
most needy children in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the Reform Party's basic principles, as I said before, 
would give the same benefits to a family earning $215,000 as one 
earning $15,000.  How can Reform members possibly justify that 
and then stand here as if somehow they have a plan that will help 
families and it will save taxpayers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party in putting this motion forward is calling for 
$26 billion in tax cuts, $19 billion to pay down the national 
debt and an additional $2 billion for health care, yet it wants 
to eliminate government revenues.  If Reform members had it their 
way, as those of us who had the wonderful privilege of being at 
the united alternative conference saw—and I see the member for 
Markham who was with us—they would simply turn everything over 
to the provincial governments. 
The opening keynote speaker for their wonderful conference was 
the Premier of Alberta.  Guess what.  He thinks Alberta should 
run the country.  It is quite clear this is a provincial 
parochial minded group of politicians who only want power for the 
provinces.  They think that the federal government should be 
eliminated.

health care?  If families with three kids have to go to emergency 
they pay user fees.  Alberta tried to bring in user fees and this 
government said it could not do that.  It was this government 
that said it was violating the Canada Health Act and that 
Canadians would not stand for it.  It was this government that 
made Alberta retract that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would be hurt?  Might families with three kids, with or 
without stay home mothers, be under some duress if they had to go 
to hospital and fork out money for user fees? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to take a balanced, progressive tax system and turn it 
on its ear because they have come across an idea they think is 
politically sexy and politically attractive.  It is not based on 
party principles.  They did not hear it discussed at the united 
alternative conference which clearly failed because they could 
not take two rights and create a wrong.  That will not work, but 
that is what they tried to do.

Would you clarify for the House whether this member is hopefully 
sharing his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  He has a 10 minute speech and has a 
minute left in his time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have only one minute 
left.  I know they will be disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am attempting to point out what I think most Canadians 
understand.  They cannot say cut, slash and burn on one side of 
the coin and then somehow try to pretend that they are a new 
image, that they are softer, kinder and gentler.  We know better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 30 years ago my wife and I made a very difficult decision 
that she would stay home with our kids.  It was a good decision. 
I have three young men of whom I am very proud.  I believe that 
by my wife's staying home for many years in their formative 
years, with great assistance from me, actually helped raise what 
I consider to be a pretty darn good family.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am our party's social policy critic.  The last speaker 
chose to parrot the misrepresentation put forward yesterday that 
the Reform Party was not supportive of the national child benefit 
and other programs and voted against them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two question for the member.  When did we vote against 
programs that we agree with?  That never happened.  He also said 
something about the Reform Party cutting social assistance 
programs.  What happened to the cuts his government made to the 
health and social transfer which supports welfare programs in the 
provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can he accuse other parties of doing something which they 
have not done and defend the cuts that his government has made to 
social assistance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did something really 
radical.  I read the blue book, the policy book.  Some of them 
should.  I hate it when people actually read the stuff we put out 
and expect us to stand behind it!  It is really difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their policy program in the last election campaign were $3.5 
billion in cuts to social assistance.  The member can deny that 
her party voted against the child tax credit, the prenatal 
program or any of this. 
The facts speak for themselves.  Members of that party simply 
vote negatively the minute they get out bed every morning without 
any thought of the consequences and the impact on children and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am quite taken aback by the fact that the hon. member 
said it was a difficult decision to raise his own children.  My 
wife and I decided to raise our own children and it was not 
difficult to make that decision.  It was an honour and a 
privilege we had raising our own children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did some reading as well.  I read the 1993 red book of the 
Liberal Party.  My question was not answered before by the member 
from Parkdale so I would like this member to answer it now.  Why 
did the Liberal government break its promise on day care 
facilities for Canadian families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, talk about 
misrepresentation.  Let us be clear.  The difficult decision that 
my wife should stay home with our children was a financial one. 
It simply meant that we had to make sacrifices financially.  I 
say that it was the right thing to do and a good thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should not try to pretend, as NDP members often do, 
that they sanctimoniously have that particular market cornered. 
Many of us on this side have made decisions like that to raise 
our families.  There is no question they are tough decisions.  It 
is easier to just stick to the income side of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of what the government has done, the government has 
realized that we cannot function with a $42 billion deficit. The 
government came into office and realized that we owed it to 
Canadian families and Canadian children to be able to afford to 
provide day care programs, to be able to afford to provide social 
assistance, to be able to put money back into health care as we 
did in the last budget to which members opposite are opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make tough decisions in government, unlike members 
opposite who will never find themselves in those difficult 
decision making positions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I sat here and listened to the hon. member's speech.  He 
talked eloquently about the caring, sharing aspect of the Liberal 
government when it comes to families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at their tax situation right now.  Let us look at 
what it has created.  It has created child prostitution.  It has 
created children being out on the streets.  They are called 
latchkey kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the caring, sharing member over there who 
turned down help for hepatitis C victims and who turned down our 
motion to stop child pornography.  It is dead against families; 
that is all the government has ever been since I have been in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to see 
that at least I am raising a bit of passion although it might be 
somewhat misplaced.  The government has put the ship of state in 
the right direction.  We have built a financial foundation that 
will serve Canadian families for years and years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member attempts to do what others have suggested, that 
is misrepresent the position of the government, he knows it is 
nothing more than hyperbole and nonsense.  The government is 
committed to families, to children and to this great country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is time to educate the member across the way.  It is 
the Reform Party that stood for fiscal responsibility because 
fiscal responsibility is social responsibility.  We ended the 
decades of Liberal fiscal overspending that compromised social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party prefers the national head start program which 
will have one of the biggest positive effects on children that we 
have ever seen.  The Reform Party is defending aboriginal women 
by voting against Bill C-49.  The Reform Party wants to scrap the 
Indian Act because it is racist.  The Reform Party wants to 
decrease taxes for the poorest in the country because they are 
the most compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the facts.  The member should put that in his pipe and 
smoke it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not hear a 
question, but I am delighted the member used the word racist 
because I would not want to use it.  The member failed to point 
out that, if given a chance, his party would have cut a billion 
dollars out of the aboriginal budget. 
It would have slashed those programs.

crossed the boundary of parliamentary language.

taxing single income families unfairly the Liberal government has 
placed its ravenous appetite for tax revenues above the 
well-being of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some countries governments permit children to be abused 
through child labour.  Instead of ensuring that children receive 
an education, those governments look the other way, forcing 
children to punch the clock every day.

enough to justify staying out of the paid workforce for a certain 
period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Likewise, the majority of Canadians believe that the task of 
caring for our children, the next generation of Canadians, is 
important enough to justify a parent's decision to stay out of 
the paid workforce for a certain period of time.

is not taxable, their contribution to society is less valuable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the comments just float to the top.  Now we have proof again that 
the Liberal member for Vancouver Kingsway in committee last fall 
told stay at home parents in Calgary that they “take the easy 
way out”. The Liberal member for St. Paul's told stay at home 
women that they were just a bunch of elite white women. These are 
not slips of the tongue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not true that this is the real family policy of the 
government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if we look at the measures this government has brought 
in, whether it be the child tax benefit, whether it be the action 
program for children, whether it be the prenatal nutrition 
program, whether it be the wide range of programs involving 
aboriginal head start, it is very clear that this government 
values enormously not only the work done at home but the raising 
of children, family policy.  That is an essential part of our 
values.  More important, we do not simply talk about it, we have 
put it into legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
this government really loved children I dare say it would not 
have allowed child pornography to go through.  Is that proof of 
loving children?  I hardly think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have Liberal backbenchers who are appearing in public with 
these attitudes and they are not simply a slip of the tongue.  I 
quote again.  A Liberal member said a lot of times people just 
take the easy way out to look after their kids at home.  The 
member for St. Paul's said it is just your perception as elite 
white women.  The member for Essex—Windsor said that this is 
just for stay at home parents a nostalgic notion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is fiction.  There are people right across the country who 
are sacrificing to stay home with their kids.  Why does the 
government discriminate against them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government does not 
discriminate against persons who stay at home to look after their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to look at the child rearing drop out in the Canada 
pension plan to know that.  We only have to look at the EI 
provisions that allow someone to stay at home for up to five 
years and then be able to get back with training into the 
workforce.  We only have to look at the credit splitting and at 
the Divorce Act and the money we have put into the child tax 
benefit to know that we do not discriminate against stay at home 
persons.  We recognize it is a very complex issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is one thing to try to defend the indefensible. It is not 
going to fly.  Right across these government benches we have seen 
people stick their foot in their mouth for days now and they are 
not defending the indefensible because there is no way they can 
do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about discrimination, is $4,000 more to pay in 
taxes not discrimination?  What about this government which 
continues to discriminate against parents who stay at home with 
their kids? When will the Prime Minister make this right and tell 
these people they are not just taking the easy way out?

understand that people in this party have many unique 
experiences, not just unique to the Liberal Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status

that with all that experience the hon. members still do not 
understand the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they want to talk about single income families, let us talk 
about single income family working people, 80% of whom are women 
and 60% of whom are in low income communities.  When they earn 
$20,000 the child benefit will assist that single income earning 
family.  The hon. member's mother would have been helped by that

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
here is what the government says about stay at home parents. They 
are taking the easy way out, they are not working, they are elite 
white women.  That is the government's attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see systemic discrimination every year in the finance 
minister's budgets, six budgets in a row increasing the

that to happen?

by facts.

yesterday we heard the finance minister and the Prime Minister 
distance themselves from the outrageous comments of the secretary

the remarks of the hon. Liberal member for Vancouver Kingsway who 
said that most women can combine career and family life but that 
a lot of times people, that is, stay at home parents, just take 
the easy way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very simple question that could have a very direct

what it is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about valuing the unpaid work, I would like to know 
why that group has voted against every single initiative in this 
House.  When we talk about looking after children and taking time 
off to do that, they have called for the dismantling of the CPP, 
the most important thing for allowing parents to drop out and 
look after their kids—

<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will tell the minister why we voted against every single tax 
raising, health care cutting Liberal budget.  It is because the 
Liberals have been reducing the disposable income of Canadian 
families.  Every tax increase, like the $10 billion CPP tax 
increase, has had a particularly negative effect on single income 
families.  Those are the families that have seen the biggest 
shrinkage in their disposable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple.  Will this government allow a free 
vote on this motion for family tax fairness when it comes up next

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week the 
Minister of Health announced the creation in Vancouver of a 
centre of excellence for prostate cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister explain spending $15 million in British

<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

announcement of the minister about the centre of excellence will 
build on the expertise at the Vancouver General and B.C. Cancer 
Agency in the area of prostate cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prostate clinic at the Vancouver General Hospital is 
considered to be a leader in prostate cancer research, 
prevention, diagnosis, treatment and education.  It will benefit 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than quibbling about where the centre of excellence 
should be located, I would have thought the member opposite would 
have applauded the government's decision to establish a centre of 
excellence in prostate cancer.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL DEFENCE AND VETERANS AFFAIRS

<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order with respect to an incident that 
happened today at the Standing Committee on National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee adopted a procedure restricting me from 
tabling a document because of the official language that I chose 
to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving motions and tabling documents in either official language 
is a right granted to members by the authority of the House and 
by law.  Yet I was denied these rights today at the Standing 
Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 4(1) of the Official Languages Act reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>English and French are the official languages of Parliament, and 
everyone has the right to use either of those languages in any 
debates and any other proceedings of Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This subsection defines the right of members of parliament to 
speak and submit documents in the language of their choice in 
parliamentary proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing orders state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All motions shall be in writing ... before being debated or put 
from the Chair ... it shall be read in English and in French by 
the Speaker, if he or she be familiar with both languages; if 
not, the Speaker shall read the motion in one language and direct 
the Clerk of the Table to read it in the other— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 116 states that “in a standing committee the 
Standing Orders shall apply”.  Standing Order 116 lists some 
exceptions, such as the election of the Speaker, seconding of 
motions and times of speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind you, Mr. Speaker, of two important 
rulings in regards to committees on standing orders of the House. 
On June 20, 1994 and November 7, 1996 the Speaker ruled that 
while it is a tradition of this House that committees are masters 
of their own proceedings, they cannot establish procedures which 
go beyond the powers conferred upon them by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee, by adopting a procedure restricting members from 
introducing documents in the official language of their choice, 
has established a procedure which goes beyond the powers 
conferred upon it by the House.  This committee is in breach of 
our standing orders and the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 5, 1998 the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca raised a 
similar case regarding the Standing Committee on Health.  In his 
presentation he used similar arguments that I am putting forth 
today.  Unfortunately this matter was not dealt with.  The 
Speaker has not yet ruled on that point of order and the matter 
of our rights as members of parliament to operate in the language 
of our choice, as provided for in the rules of the House and in 
common law, still remains unresolved today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House should be aware that the Speaker on May 5, 1998 made 
the following statement: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that members of this House are free to 
operate in either of the official languages. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I remind the Speaker of the recommendation of the 
commissioner of official languages in his 1996 report to 
parliament: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commissioner recommended that the Speaker of the House advise 
committee chairs, referring particularly to Subsection 4(1) of 
the Official Languages Act, that language should not be an 
obstacle to Members of Parliament in the performance of their 
duties. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that this warning from the Chair is overdue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for your information, 
at that particular committee it was voted unanimously by all five 
parties represented that any document or any motion be brought 
forward in both official languages.  I find it strange that this 
is brought up today.  As I said, it was voted unanimously that 
this be done. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too am 
astonished that such a question should be raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gentleman has been a member of this House for six years. I 
have always heard it said that committees worked in both 
official languages and that documents were tabled in both, 
unless there were outside witnesses.  When that is the case, we 
accept tabling in one language, with a committee commitment to 
have it translated into the other, so that all committee members 
may have a document in both official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, however, the document is from an official government agency, 
such as CBC or the Canada Council, or from a committee member, 
we require them to be in both official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the committees are totally autonomous in their 
rules of procedure, and to my knowledge—and I have a certain 
degree of overview of the procedures in all committees because 
of the position I hold within our party—it would appear that it 
is a universal rule that all documents be tabled in both 
official languages, unless they come from outside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not, therefore, see any reason for raising this question 
today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was the acting chair of the Standing Committee on National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs today when this issue was raised. 
This is what occurred at the committee:  The member for 
Okanagan—Coquihalla was attempting to deal with a document 
obtained through access to information that was only in one of 
the official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Joliette had some difficulty with that because it 
was the first time he had seen the document in English.  He had 
no previous knowledge that it was coming forward.  As a courtesy 
to the member for Joliette, as the parliamentary secretary has 
indicated, in terms of the previous practice of the committee 
which has been dealt with by motion in the committee, we agreed 
as a committee that this matter would be deferred until the 
document could be translated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member indicated that he tried to table the document and 
that the chair refused to table the document.  That is not the 
case.  The document was tabled with the committee and will be 
dealt with presumably at a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated, it was solely a matter of courtesy to the member 
for Joliette, who is not as functional in English as are the 
other members of the committee.  It was done as a courtesy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are two issues.  First, a 
request has been made by an hon. member that the Speaker should 
rule on an issue.  I do not want to get into that one.  Mr. 
Speaker will rule on any previous issue whenever Mr. Speaker 
feels it is appropriate for him to do so, if he decides it is 
appropriate for him to do so.  None of us should question that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of the procedure before committee, we went through 
this a number of years ago, as the Chair will recall.  I believe 
some work was done.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is necessary to fine tune the procedures we had set 
before, so be it.  Perhaps the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs should look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, our general principle would make immanent sense to most 
of us.  If a government document is to be tabled in committee, 
the same rules as would apply to the House should apply.  A 
government document in the House has to be tabled in two official 
languages and I think it should be the same in committee.  That 
is only logical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the speech of a witness comes to the committee obviously the 
witness appears with his document and it appears in the way that 
it appears.  I think that is equally normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a member walks in with a document and would like it made 
available to all committee members surely that document can be 
given to the clerk to have it translated and then given to the 
members.  That seems equally logical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are all principles which I do not think are very hard for 
any of us to understand.  They only refer to what is practical 
and what respects the official languages so that all members of 
parliament can read what is given to us.  I feel that should be 
the guiding principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that needs to be refined in any way we have very excellent 
staff in the clerk's office that can prepare a document for us to 
be fine tuned for the committee on procedure and House affairs 
and then used by all committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would prefer that the members of the committee 
settle whatever differences they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member can correct me, but did he say he was not 
allowed to table the document? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the document was not 
officially tabled.  It was handed to the members of the committee 
and the member for Joliette objected to the document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My understanding, from what the acting 
chairman of the committee told me, is that the document was 
tabled with the understanding or agreement that this document 
would be translated and discussed at the next meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case then the document was tabled, according to 
the chairman, and will be discussed at the next meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if hon. members bring committee problems to the Chair, 
I would prefer to deal with them when I get a report from the 
committee.  That is how we usually work it here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking the hon. member is that if the information we 
heard today is indeed accurate on all sides, if it could be 
settled by the members of the committee I would much prefer it, 
but I invite hon. members to bring back a report to me.  At that 
time I will take it under consideration.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to join this debate today on such a 
positive motion being brought forward by members of the official 
opposition.  It is such a pleasure to speak on this topic because 
it is a topic that is so dear to my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the father of four young children, ages eight, six, four 
and two. My wife is working at home raising those kids as am I 
when I get a chance to be there.  It is hard sometimes with this 
job.  We know there are some major commitments here as members of 
parliament.  There are lots of Canadian families making major 
commitments to their families.  They have made a number of 
different decisions.  Some families have decided to have one of 
the parents stay home to look after their children. Some families 
have decided that they need both parents working. There are all 
sorts of other arrangements with others giving care to children 
in the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is becoming very evident in this debate today is this 
government's approach, this government's real attitude toward 
families and to parents who choose to look after their children 
at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue was brought to light by the junior finance minister. 
We are all well aware of his comments made earlier this week and 
his apology for those comments, which is an honourable thing to 
do.  I think that is a good thing to do but also we must take a 
look at what government members are saying and, more important, 
what they are doing, what the Liberal government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is purposely discriminating against families, 
against individuals who choose to stay at home and raise their 
children.  It is saying is that there is not real value in that 
very hard job of raising families, at least not the same value as 
if those individuals, those parents, were outside the home 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard numerous statements.  We heard the member for 
Vancouver Kingsway try to enter in on a point of debate not happy 
about what she said.  She said most women can combine career and 
family life. We know it is very difficult.  A lot of times people 
just take the easy way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is that member saying?  What is the government saying to 
families that choose to have one parent stay home to look after 
their children?  I think it is an amazing admission of what the 
government's real agenda is.  It is unbelievable and it does not 
stop there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard in question period today and throughout debate as well 
another member of the government, the member for St. Paul's, 
talking to members who appeared before the finance committee, 
saying that your perception as elite white women is not helping 
colleagues stay at home, individuals, mothers in this case, 
called elite white women.   That is reprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It shows there are members of the government who are bringing a 
voice to what the real belief of the government is. It is 
becoming evident through debate today what the real agenda of the 
government is as it relates to families.  That is discrimination. 
The government does not have a problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not have a problem about discriminating against families 
that choose to have one parent stay home to raise children.  In 
fact, if government members put action to their empty words about 
what they believe they would do something in their budgets about 
this discrimination that continues. Year after year the 
government has been in the House and it has not addressed this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members will throw out some straw dog arguments about 
the child tax deduction and benefit which helps certain 
individuals but not all individuals. 
They neglect to mention the clawback factor.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millionaire finance minister believes that individuals who 
are making between $30,000 and $60,000 do not deserve the same 
amount of benefit as other individuals.  He must think those 
individuals are rich and that $50,000 is a lot of money to raise 
a family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the millionaire finance minister that is not a lot of 
money.  There are a lot of families in this country working 
really hard to try to raise their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never intended to get involved in politics.  One of the things 
that motivated me to get involved was that very fact, the 
outrageous amount of taxes the government was taking out of my 
family's pocket to subsidize its spending habits that seem to 
know no end at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife is a professional.  She is an early childhood educator. 
She was a supervisor of a day care.  I was a teacher.  We made 
the decision to have her stay home and raise the children.  She 
has also worked outside the home.  She has worked sometimes 
during the summer and I have stayed home to look after the 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of multiculturalism made some fairly outrageous 
statements earlier about members here, about why we do not just 
look after our own children. I will tell that minister that is 
exactly what our family is doing.  That is exactly what we are 
working on and that is what families are working on across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agenda of the government is very clear, discrimination 
against families that choose to have an individual stay at home 
to look after the children.  What we are asking for is a choice 
and equality for all individuals, for all families, for the 
different arrangements people choose to make regarding looking 
after children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes people choose to stay home to raise children. 
Sometimes they need to work outside the home.  Why is the 
government so against choice?  I cannot believe it.  It is just 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the government seem to be talking out of both sides 
of their mouths.  Some of the members say yes, we are 
discriminating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read a question that was asked to the finance minister 
by an individual in British Columbia earlier this week.  This 
mother had chosen to stay home to raise her children.  She was 
phoning a talk show and these are her exact words to the Minister 
of Finance on March 1: “We were hoping to see in this budget 
some form of help for families with stay at home moms.  We are 
under an incredible amount of stress because we have decided for 
me to stay home to raise the children.  My husband is the single 
income earner.  We are bringing home less.  We are actually being 
penalized. The mothers or the care givers going to work and 
getting better tax breaks than those of us who are deciding to 
stay home and deciding to send one of us out to work.  What is 
the finance minister going to do about that?  Why has he not done 
something this year?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister did not give the normal rhetoric and spin 
he gives in the House of Commons, which was refreshing.  He said: 
“The fact is that you are right”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the caller right about?  The caller was saying that we 
are being penalized because we choose to send one of our members 
of the family out to work outside the home.  The finance minister 
admitted that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: “There are anomalies that have been allowed 
to build up in the Income Tax Act over the years”. He has been 
the finance minister for five years and he has allowed those 
inequities to go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is discrimination against families, discrimination against 
Canadians who choose to have one of the members of their family 
stay home and look after their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is a positive motion that seeks to end the ongoing 
discrimination of the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope we have unanimity on the opposition benches and that 
this positive motion will go forward.  We hope that government 
members will have an opportunity in a free vote to turn this 
around and put an end to this Liberal government discrimination 
against families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I think that we 
should limit our questions and comments to one minute in order 
that more members can participate in the debate this afternoon. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I want the hon. member to recognize that I think this is a very 
serious issue.  He has expressed it very eloquently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To characterize the anomaly, in the finance minister's words, 
when we have a tax system and we are implementing policy changes 
and regulation changes simultaneously, anomalies happen.  To 
characterize this as discrimination are we also, with the 
progressivity of the income tax act, discriminating against 
people who have the skills and knowledge that the marketplace is 
going to pay more for?  Is that following that argument to its 
logical conclusion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a specific question. The Reform Party, rightly sometimes 
and wrongly other times, accuses us of not answering but I want 
to ask a very direct question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent last week on a very informative tour of eastern Canada 
with the heritage committee.  The reason I was not at home with 
my son is that the committees cannot travel when the House is 
sitting because the Reform Party will not sign the pairing sheet. 
So the rubber is hitting the road here, guys. If they were 
concerned about all families, not just their families, is the 
Reform Party willing to agree to sign the pairing sheet so that 
we can manage our job and spend more time with our families too? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know the hon. member 
is working hard to raise his young family as well.  We are very 
much in the same situation in that regard.  We all have families 
we need to attend to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know as a member of parliament he will understand that 
committees make decisions about what it is they are going to do. 
I do not think it is fair to lay the blame on one individual or 
one particular party.  This is something which all committees 
have to come to an agreement on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the immigration minister who yesterday witnessed the great 
disharmony in the committee in the fact that the government would 
not allow members of the official opposition to ask the minister 
simple questions on whatever topic they wanted.  As a result of 
that, they have shown their inability to work together.  It is 
that frustration which leads to having to take other measures, to 
even plead with the government to listen to members of the 
official opposition on other important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we can all work together.  I hope the member will join us 
in working together in a harmonious manner. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, again I thank the hon. member and his party for bringing 
forward this very important debate.  I have a couple of questions 
for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is on the national standards for all families, especially 
for those who are low income or single parent.  Would he and his 
party not agree that the Canada pension plan, although we have 
difficulties with some aspects of it in terms of the premium 
payments, is a good idea for those people with low income so that 
they will have some kind of pension in their later years?  Many 
low income families cannot participate in the RRSP program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree that that program as well as national day care 
for low income families are good to have on a national basis? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate my 
colleague's questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of national standards and the pension issue, one of the 
best ways to solve that problem is to leave more dollars in the 
pockets of families across Canada.  That would allow individuals 
the opportunity to do what they see fit with those dollars, 
including investing in pensions in any way they see fit.  That 
would allow choice in that particular area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked about a national day care program.  This is something 
the Liberal government promised in 1993.  It was in the red book. 
I think I heard the member refer to that earlier in debate. 
This is another promise the Liberal government broke.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that Canadians need?  What more proof do they need 
that when the government says something and does not deliver on 
it, they should perhaps look at absolutely everything it says to 
see whether or not it will deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mother taught me that actions speak louder than words, and my 
father did as well in various ways, but we will not get into 
that.  I must say that the actions of the government clearly 
indicate that it is not willing to make a commitment on many 
programs and it is not willing to end the discrimination against 
families who choose to have an individual raise the children at 
home. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to this most important motion. 
The objective of the motion is to encourage the government to try 
to understand the difficulties that families are facing in 
today's society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems obvious to me from listening to the debate that the 
government just does not understand the difficult choices 
families have to make.  We do not have to go too far back to 
observe some of the actions of the government and reflect on the 
result of those actions to see that that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the government refused recently to take realistic 
action to discourage children from smoking.  That is important. 
It is a health issue.  It is important to try to bring that issue 
forward to children yet the government seems to ignore that 
concern. Recently it refused to protect children from sexual 
predators by not invoking the notwithstanding clause after a 
recent unfortunate court decision in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the type of issue we are talking about is that the 
government refuses to ensure that families are treated fairly 
under the tax system.  In fact, it denigrates the role that has 
been played by stay at home parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much mention has been made today about the comments of the 
junior minister of finance.  The most unfortunate comments that 
he made reflected a real lack of understanding of the important 
role that homemakers play.  Those comments of the junior minister 
are not to be unexpected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, the Prime Minister's office produced talking 
points recently which said that Reform does not understand the 
modern family, that parents work for a variety of reasons and 
finances is only one of them, and that the Reform platform 
assumes that increased tax deductions will encourage parents to 
quit their jobs and return to the kitchen. That is a shameful 
comment. It comes right out of the Prime Minister's office and 
shows a complete lack of understanding of the important job 
parents do when they decide to stay home to provide care for 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That disregard for that important role was expressed very 
clearly by the member for Vancouver Kingsway who talks about the 
low esteem that may keep parents at home.  It is low esteem if 
one desires to stay at home and look after children. She refers 
in that same statement to parents who decide to stay at home as 
being looked down upon as misfits.  I find it outrageous that 
anyone could think those things and then try to suggest they were 
misunderstood.  The words speak for themselves.  Parents, she 
says, who stay at home are simply taking the easy way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a real concern about that because that is simply not the 
case.  It is not the easy way out.  It is the difficult way out 
in many respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a friend.  Both he and his wife are well educated people, 
both capable of providing an income for the family. It would be a 
modest income because we know how the tax penalizes single family 
earners. 
A few years ago this friend of mine, who as a matter of fact ran 
for parliament in 1988, decided that he would stay home and look 
after the home front while his wife went out to work.  He stayed 
home to look after their two young children until they were well 
into their elementary school years. It was difficult for him. Not 
that many years ago many people did not understand why he would 
choose to stay home, because as I said, he certainly was capable 
of earning a living.  But that was a choice that he made. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend is going to be penalized all the way down the line for 
that in a financial way.  Maybe I will talk a little bit more 
about that, about the financial sacrifices that were made by that 
family and the sacrifices that will be felt in the years to come 
when both parents elect to retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the sacrifice that people make is ignored.  The member 
from Essex—Windsor talks about stay at home parents as a 
nostalgic notion promoted by the Reform Party.  It is an absolute 
outrage to refer to a stay at home parent and those who wish to 
do that as a nostalgic notion.  I am disturbed by that.  I am 
disturbed by the notion that somehow people who stay at home are 
misfits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife was a well-qualified teacher.  She chose to stay home 
and look after our son many years ago.  I think he appreciates 
that to this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>C. D. Howe Institute researcher Kenneth Boessenkool calculated 
that a dual earner family with two preschool children and an 
income of $70,000 gets more than $14,000 in child related tax 
breaks that are not available to the single earner family. That 
is absolutely astounding, $14,000.  That is over $1,000 a month 
in benefits that accrue to a dual earner family, benefits that 
are denied to a single earner family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact in the C. D. Howe Institute document, Boessenkool traces 
the federal government's tax treatment of families with children 
since World War II.  He notes that in earlier decades income tax 
provided reasonable tax deductions for children to both single 
and dual earner families.  In recent years however, he notes, tax 
benefits have been targeted toward very poor families and dual 
earner families.  Middle income, single earner families with 
children are taxed as heavily as families without children.  Let 
me repeat that.  Middle income, single earner families with 
children are taxed as heavily as families without children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are we going to prepare ourselves for the future?  How are 
we going to prepare our children for the future if we are taxing 
their parents to death?  How are they to pay the high tuition 
fees that are required today if they are facing a tax regime 
which is that stringent and unmerciful? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Boessenkool notes that it is unfair.  The tax system should 
accommodate the cost of child rearing whether or not both parents 
are working outside the home.   He argues further and makes three 
points that I want to raise here as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he says that the tax system no longer recognizes the cost 
of raising children in all families.  That is true.  The facts 
are there and are very, very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, he notes that to the extent that the tax system has 
relieved the burden for middle and upper income families with 
children, it has done so disproportionately for dual earner 
families through generous child care exemptions.  Again, the 
discrimination there is built into the tax system and has been 
ignored by the finance minister who acknowledges that the problem 
exists yet for five years has done nothing to rectify it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Boessenkool notes that the combination of clawed back 
social policy transfers plus income and other taxes has created 
unacceptably high effective marginal tax rates for families 
earning between $20,000 and $30,000.  I do not think one can live 
on $20,000 or $30,000 in the area where I live.  I do not know 
whether there are many areas in Canada where one is going to be 
able to survive on between $20,000 and $30,000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to recognize that we are not whistling in 
the dark over here or singing a tune alone on this issue. There 
is a loud chorus behind us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An October 1998 Compas poll showed that 92% of Canadians felt 
that families with children today were under more stress than 50 
years ago, 90% felt that parents were working too hard and too 
many hours and 78% felt that not enough respect was given for the 
effort parents put into raising children. That is a serious 
condemnation of this government's policies. They are out of line 
with what the public is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Vanier Institute pointed out that single income families 
with children are 3.8 times more likely to have a low income than 
a dual income family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a serious problem and I appreciate the opportunity to 
address it today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very attentively to what the hon. member has just had to say, 
and I find it totally logical and rational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My congratulations to the hon. member for Calgary Southeast, who 
introduced this motion, for we can never do too much to honour 
those who stay at home to rear their children, whether fathers 
or mothers.  I would describe child-rearing as the finest job in 
the world, in fact I would call it more than a job, it is the 
greatest profession in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is too bad that the father or mother—for it could very 
well be a father—who decided to stay at home is penalized for so 
doing. 
I would even go so far as to say that stay at home parents ought 
to have a guaranteed income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask my colleague from the Reform Party whether he 
thinks they ought to be guaranteed an income of $14,000 per 
year? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member's noting that 
a stay at home parent is the greatest profession in the world is 
something I think everybody in the House should appreciate and 
agree with.  I know that goes for across the aisle with many 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as guaranteed annual salaries, it is an interesting 
option.  However, the issue before us today is the unfair 
treatment by the tax system.  I think that is the issue we have 
to address first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that many people who forego economic opportunity to stay 
at home with their children do not mind that.  What does bother 
them is the unfair treatment by the tax system.  They are 
prepared to accept a lower standard of living so that they can 
enjoy their children more and have total responsibility for the 
upbringing of the children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member referred to people earning between $20,000 and 
$30,000.  I have just done the calculation and wanted to put on 
the record the calculation of an employee who had earned an 
income of $25,000.  This person would pay $4,469 in tax, $675 in 
EI and $688 in CPP which would mean a net take home pay of 
$19,168. The effective tax rate is 17.8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since an income earner making $25,000 a year is paying a 17.8% 
tax rate, does the member believe that it should be lower based 
on his comments and, if so, how much lower? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Madam Speaker, to be quite honest, I 
find it rather difficult to expect someone making $25,000, the 
total family income, to be paying any income tax at all.

earning $25,000 a year are paying taxes.  I find that an absolute 
outrage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
we are talking today about an issue that is very important to not 
only me but I think to all members in this place. I know that 
many members have had initiatives to try to bring focus to this 
issue and we should not divide ourselves on whether the spirit 
and the intent of what is being discussed here is at all in 
dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became a member of parliament I wanted to be involved and 
the first thing I did was draft a private member's bill, Bill 
C-256, to split income between spouses so one could stay at home 
and care for preschool children.  I was not exactly sure how the 
mechanics of all that would work out but members will know that 
private members' bills necessarily have to be somewhat simplistic 
to have an opportunity to pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was disappointed that it was not votable.  I do not want to 
isolate anyone for it not being votable but we had an opportunity 
to debate it and I knew that there was support in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also had a bill to amend the Canada pension plan act so that 
we could have Canada pension plan benefit entitlements for a stay 
at home mom.  I thought that would be great.  I am not sure 
exactly how it would work but I think it makes great sense 
because we forgo economic gain but unpaid work is still work and 
deserves to be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also had a bill to convert the child care expense deduction to 
a credit and extend it to all families.  I agree with the intent. 
I am not exactly sure again about the mechanics but I support 
the intent and I wanted to raise it in the House so that we could 
discuss the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also had Motion No. 30, a care giver tax credit for those who 
provide care in the home to preschool children, the chronically 
ill, the aged and the disabled.  Members will know that we passed 
that motion in this place 129 to 63.  As a result of the intent 
of the House and the signal that was given there were 
improvements in the disability credits that are transferable to 
those who care for them. There was also the introduction of the 
care giver credit for an aged parent which is now in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not quite get that care giver benefit for those who 
provide care in the home to preschool children and we are working 
on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real cost.  There is no question.  I will not 
dispute.  I presented a petition over 200 times in the House that 
managing the family home, caring for preschool children is an 
honourable profession which has not been recognized for its value 
to our society.  In my view that is one of the most important 
outcomes that should be from this debate today, that we are able 
to give true recognition to the important contribution to our 
society to raising healthy children and families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members agree on that.  I know they do.  I have seen them debate 
here.  I have seen them vote on issues related to the family.  I 
know family and healthy children are an important priority for 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real cost.  We know where parents choose to have both 
working in the paid labour force and they pay for third party 
care there is a cost to that care.  It includes food, toys, 
books, music and infrastructure in a salary, and $7,000 is the 
maximum that can be claimed as a deduction.  A stay at home 
parent also has costs. Child care expenses exist not because 
parents work but because children exist.  Parents who care for 
their children in the home have the books, the toys, the music, 
the food, the infrastructure, the place to raise a healthy child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the unpaid work situation and I am not sure if we will 
easily be able to resolve that.  But a starting point will be to 
recognize in this place that there is a value to that unpaid work 
and in my view it is the most important job in the world.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe no family should have to choose between the job it 
needs and the child it loves.  It is a very difficult decision 
for many families to make.  I believe that parents and not 
governments should be making decisions as to what is the best 
possible care for their children.  I agree with the sentiment 
expressed by somebody that we should not have significant 
incentives or disincentives.  We are talking about choice and I 
support options, flexibility and choices for parents to choose 
the best possible care for their children. We need to value the 
contribution of those care givers through economic supports, 
which I will deal with at the end of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We obviously want to give that recognition to those who choose 
to provide direct parental care to their children.  It is their 
family value, it is their social value.  They believe that is the 
best arrangement for their children.  But for some there is no 
option because affordable child care may not be available.  It 
may not even be accessible.  We do not all live in urban centres. 
It will not always be available. We have so many different 
circumstances across this great land that there is no single 
solution to solve everybody's problems. That is an important 
point for all members to remember. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my principle and my view that parents providing direct 
parental care provide the best quality of care possible in the 
vast majority of cases.  I appreciate that many families have 
forgone the opportunity to have both parents working, to earn 
economic gain, to buy RRSPs, to have those vacations, and they do 
it because they love their children and because they want to 
raise healthy children and strong families.  It is a very 
significant contribution being made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have high quality care, we have better physical, mental 
and social health outcomes in children.  That means we have lower 
health care costs, criminal justice costs and social program 
costs.  All Canadians benefit when we have healthy outcomes for 
children.  That is the contribution and that is why everyone here 
is saying very clearly that we value stay at home parents for 
their contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I understand I am splitting my time with the 
member from Vancouver, which we talked about earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not support this motion today and I will present to 
members the reason why.  I have about seven points to make. 
First, the child care expense deduction is only available to the 
lowest income earning of the two spouses.  As a result it may not 
be equitable to treat everybody the same.  I do not believe the 
child care expense deduction is that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child care expense deduction has a problem with it.  Members 
including the member for Calgary Southeast will know that the 
deduction is worth more to higher income earners versus low 
income earners which is also discriminatory.  I have a problem 
with the child care expense deduction, period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion does not address the fact of lone parent families 
which are growing dramatically.  The family breakdown rate in 
Canada is rising to a level above 50%.  In 1994 when I came here 
lone parent families represented 12% of all families.  Stats 
Canada now reports that one out of every six families is a lone 
parent family and this motion would do nothing to help them.  I 
want to help lone parent families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comparing $50,000 to two incomes of $25,000 is a specious 
argument.  We really have to start with here is a couple working, 
one making $50,000, one making $25,000, and then they have a 
child.  Now we have to make the decision of should I withdraw 
from the workforce and provide direct parental care or should I 
engage care and have a child care expense deduction. That is the 
debate and that is what has not been put on the table by the 
Reform Party.  I am sorry, but it is inappropriate for discussion 
to have a $50,000 income compared with two $25,000 incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to do that we would have the same situation as in the 
United States with a different tax table. We cannot calculate it 
on individual tax tables.  If they were straightforward and 
forthright on this issue they would say that we would adopt the 
same situation of joint filing that the U.S. has and also have a 
separate tax table for joint filers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue cannot be looked at simplistically and have the 
Income Tax Act solve all problems for all family configurations 
for all care giver choices.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other things have to be taken into account such as non-tax items 
and the child tax benefit.  The government introduced a change of 
$1.7 billion which will significantly enhance the position of 
stay at home moms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want members to know what I want.  I cannot just be against 
something.  I want to eliminate totally the child care expense 
deduction.  I want to replace it with a caregiver benefit 
available to all caregivers so that they can choose how they will 
provide it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to increase the paid parental leave under the EI 
program by an additional 27 weeks so that parents can choose to 
provide one full year of care for their children during those 
first important formative years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to amend the Canada pension plan so that stay at 
home moms can finally have some benefit from our Canada pension 
plan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, at the outset let me say that I have enormous respect 
for this member who has done as much or more than any member in 
the House to promote the principles of tax equity for families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has done far more work than I have in this regard.  I think 
we all owe him a debt of gratitude as do the advocates of tax 
fairness for single income families, but—and it is a very big 
and unfortunate but—I was really disappointed to hear the 
rationale of the member for voting against the motion before us 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could understand the member voting against it on some sound 
principle but he did not articulate that.  I really am 
embarrassed with the rationale the member provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the federal tax system should 
be reformed to end discrimination against single income families 
with children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as general as can be, framed that way specifically so that 
members such as the member for Mississauga South could feel 
comfortable to support the principle he has just advocated.  None 
of the specifics about deductions or the basic personal exemption 
are included in the motion.  This is a very general motion.  What 
specifically does he object to in the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, let me repeat.  First, the 
child care expense deduction is only available to the lowest 
income earning spouse so that parents with part time incomes of a 
very small amount cannot make full use of the benefit.  It is not 
equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the motion does not take into account the case of lone 
parents.  Lone parents represent one out of every six parents in 
the country.  They would get no benefit from the motion.  I want 
to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not disagree with the intent of the motion.  I think I said 
I agree with the intent.  I just do not agree with the approach 
and because of that I will not leave it there.  I explicitly 
articulated three ways in which we could improve not only the 
fairness but also the equity between incomes and tax benefits for 
all families. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I was not planning to rise but the member mentioned EI 
and now I want to say a couple of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 one of my predecessors, Mr. Broadbent, put a motion to 
the House to eliminate child poverty by the year 2000.  We have 
had four years of Conservative government.  We have had six years 
of Liberal government, and now child poverty is fourfold in the 
country.  Also the use of food banks is on a rise.  It is 
absolutely astounding that the government can stand by and this 
member can try to defend Liberal action in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned EI.  Under the government $21 billion has 
been ripped away from the workers and employers, some $7 billion 
this year alone.  As has already been admitted by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, that money has been spent on other 
programs.  This money belongs to the employees and employers, 
especially working mothers who could stay at home.  The rules 
were changed.  If a woman decided to stay at home and have 
maternity leave it was very difficult to achieve that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the facts of the matter.  Would the hon. member 
respond to that, please? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.  The motion that was dealt with by the House in 1989 
was to seek to achieve the goal of eliminating and not to 
eliminate.  I just wanted to point that out for the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of poverty is related to this issue because of the 
growing number of lone parent families in Canada.  They represent 
about one out of six families, but they also account for 46% of 
all children living in poverty. 
The member raised a very important point and we have to do 
something about it.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The single largest cause of poverty is family breakdown. Family 
breakdown has to do with the significant level of domestic 
violence in Canada, with alcohol and drug abuse, and with the 
financial stress on couples.  These are social problems on which 
we have made no progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member.  We have to do something.  I do not 
know what we will do with domestic violence other than take some 
stronger, tough love measures and start reporting more cases, 
charging more people and protecting victims.  We need to do some 
important work in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for raising the issue of poverty.  It will be 
an important issue for the House for some time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, our government has introduced its sixth budget.  It 
provides the health care system, the most fundamental need of 
Canadian families and children, with $11.5 billion in new funding 
over five years.  It also provides over $7 billion in broad based 
tax relief that will benefit every Canadian.  A large portion of 
the relief is to lower income individuals and families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a motion by the official opposition before us.  Does 
it challenge our health care investment?  Does it propose a new 
tax assistance for those in need?  The answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an outrageous idea that a family in which both parents 
work at lower income levels may pay less tax than a single 
breadwinner who is lucky enough to earn as much as the other two 
people combined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The false logic of this alleged discrimination has been properly 
and precisely rebutted by my colleagues in government.  I will 
step over this red herring motion, or maybe I should say 
misleading proposal, and address the underlying issues.  The real 
agenda behind the motion is to try to suggest that the government 
is not taking concrete, committed action on the tax burden 
affecting every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the budget made clear, tax reduction plays a key role in the 
government's objective to build today for a better future.  The 
federal government is committed to providing substantial tax 
relief in the fairest way possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Significant relief was directed at students, charities, persons 
with disabilities and the children of parents with low incomes 
upon the elimination of the deficit in 1997-98.  The 1998 budget 
began the process of providing broad based tax relief.  For the 
first time since 1965 tax relief is provided for every taxpayer 
without deficit financing, without borrowing money to pay for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interest of fairness, the greatest tax relief in the 
1998-99 budget will go to low and middle income Canadians.  The 
1998 budget benefited low income Canadians by increasing by $500 
the amount of income they can earn annually before paying income 
tax.  The 1999 budget increases that amount by $175, to $675, and 
extends it to all Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that effective July 1, 1999, the basic amount of 
income that all Canadians can therefore earn annually on a tax 
free basis will rise to $7,131.  As well the spousal equivalent 
will increase to $655.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those measures will benefit low income Canadians.  In the 1998 
budget, 400,000 low income Canadians no longer pay any federal 
taxes.  The 1999 measures will build on those numbers by removing 
200,000 more Canadians from this tax burden, for a total of 
600,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget began the process of eliminating the 3% surtax 
introduced in 1986 by the previous government as a measure to 
help reduce the federal deficit.  Last year the government 
abolished the 3% surtax for taxpayers with incomes of up to 
$50,000 and reduced it for those with incomes between $50,000 and 
$65,000.  All in all, 14 million Canadians received tax 
reductions as a result of this measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget also builds on previous action to assist 
families through the Canadian child tax benefit which is composed 
of basic benefits and a supplement for the low income family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the finance minister has noted, the tax measures in the 1998 
and the 1999 budgets reflect three fundamental principles of the 
government's tax policy.  First, our tax system must be fair. 
Second, broad based tax relief should focus initially on personal 
income tax.  Third, because of our debt burden broad based tax 
relief should not be financed with borrowed money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together the 1998 and the 1999 budgets provide the largest tax 
reduction at the lowest income level.  For example, single 
taxpayers earning $20,000 and less will have their federal income 
tax reduced by at least 10%.  A typical one earner family with 
two children and an income of $30,000 or less will pay no net 
federal tax.  A family with income of $45,000 or less will have 
tax reduced by a minimum of 10%, and in some cases even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 and 1999 budgets ensure that 600,000 low income 
Canadians will no longer pay any federal tax.  As a working 
mother I would support whatever help we can give to working 
mothers either at home or at work.  The government has focused on 
helping low income families, providing also for mothers working 
at home.  It is our purpose to support and help the 600,000 low 
income families. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have been listening with some interest to the member for 
Vancouver—Kingsway.  She mentions how fair the tax system is, 
how wonderful it is and how it treats everybody in Canada the 
same, but we have to ask the Liberal member some questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are Canadians paying $2,020 more in federal taxes today than 
they did in 1993?  Why over the last decade do more families have 
both parents working?  In 57% of all families both parents work 
now and in 1976 only 34% worked.  Why is that if the tax system 
is so fair? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this member back to an October 8, 1998 
finance committee hearing in Calgary where Kids First were 
appearing.  The member for Calgary Southeast was there to witness 
the outrage that these people felt when the member stood and said 
“Most women can combine career and family life.  A lot of times 
people just take the easy way out”.

his question.  Sometimes members like to quote only half of my 
sentences and not finish what I said.  That is misrepresenting my 
statement.  Actually, I am trying to encourage— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is quoted from <I>Hansard</I> word for 
word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung:</B>  You are 10 years ahead of my time.  It 
is a 1998 correction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Jason was in diapers then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung:</B>  He was probably in high school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to finish my comments to the hon. member's question 
regarding my remarks.  I was actually trying to encourage mothers 
to choose.  They can have both, a career and a family.  I know as 
a working mother that it is very demanding and it is challenging 
to combine both.  I say that they can have it either way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If mothers find combining the two is difficult, they have to 
know that there are opportunities for them to develop abilities 
to meet new challenges in life.  I stayed home until my son was 
ready to attend grade two.  I feel it is perfectly all right to 
stay at home. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to ask the question again to the Liberal member 
because I have not received the answer from any of the other 
Liberal members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 this government promised day care for low income 
families and families across this country.  That promise was 
broken.  My question is why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung:</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
member for reminding me that we did make the promise.   We are 
willing to help working mothers by subsidizing day care. 
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to work with different 
provinces, especially when some provinces do not wish to 
co-operate to work out combined support for a day care program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member just denied having made those comments in 
October of 1998.  Let us not be silly about the date.  The member 
was there.  I was there.  The witnesses from Kids First were 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from the official parliamentary transcript:  “Perhaps 
individually you have low self-esteem for many reasons” she said 
of the stay at home parents.  “Being a single mother I don't 
quite see.  Most women can combine career and family life.  We 
know it is very difficult.  A lot of times people just take the 
easy way out”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement came from a millionaire, the member for Vancouver 
Kingsway.  How can she justify this kind of prejudicial remark? 
Does the member really believe that stay at home parents are 
taking the easy way out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung:</B>  Madam Speaker, if the member wants to 
hear the answer he should not walk away.  That is the coward's 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wishes to listen to my answer he should stay. 
This is the place to listen, to have a good debate.  I welcome 
that.  As a matter of fact, I did not know I was a millionaire. 
Where did the member get that idea?  If I was a millionaire I 
would not have to work here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, we as parliamentarians must do what is best for our 
country.  The best thing for our country would be to do what is 
best for our children and our families.  What is the best thing 
for our children?  To allow them to have the right to have loving 
parents stay at home to take care of them without being penalized 
by the state for doing so. 
Are they being penalized?  Yes.  I want hon. members to look at 
the facts.

according to the C. D. Howe Institute's latest report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current Canadian tax policy affords no universal recognition of 
children.  In effect, it treats children in middle- or 
high-income families like consumer spending, as if parents had no 
legal or moral obligation to spend money on their care.  This 
treatment is indefensible. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a quotation from the C. D. Howe Institute's November 
1998 report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They go on to say that federal tax, pre-1998 budget, paid by one 
earner families of four earning $60,000 was $10,319.  That was 
the tax paid by a family of four.  Federal tax, post-1999, for 
this same family was $9,589.  The federal tax, pre-1998 budget, 
paid by two earner families of four earning $60,000 was $6,410 
and after the 1999 budget this family paid $5,790. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the C. D. Howe Institute points out that the one 
earner family paid 60.98% more in federal taxes than the two 
earner family before the 1998 budget.  After budget '99, this 
difference jumped to 65.6%.  With this latest budget the 
discriminatory tax situation increases 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The C. D. Howe Institute goes on to say that at $45,000 these 
numbers jump even higher.  At that rate the discrimination is 
111% and after the 1999 budget it jumps to a difference of 136%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are numbers from an external source.  These are not 
numbers that we have put together.  They clearly indicate how 
discriminatory this Liberal Party has been against parents who 
choose to have one parent stay at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They go on to say that federal tax, pre-1998 budget, paid by one 
earner families of four with a total income of $50,000 was 
$7,116.  The federal tax for this family after the 1999 budget 
was $6,464.  Also, before the 1998 budget the federal tax paid by 
two earner families of four earning an income of $50,000 was 
$3,716.  After the 1999 budget this family paid $3,160.  So a one 
earner family paid $3,400 more or 91.5% more in federal taxes 
than a two earner family before the 1998 budget.  After the 1999 
budget this difference rose to $3,304, for an increase of 104%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this debate is about today.  These are the facts. 
If hon. members go out into society they will find that one of 
the greatest irritants parents have is our present discriminatory 
tax policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to allow parents to have the choice without being 
penalized.  Do not penalize single income households.  I have 
heard all kinds of rhetoric from the other side where members are 
trying to excuse themselves because they have been whipped into 
voting against this motion.  It is a motion that is supported by 
the vast majority of Canadians.  Allow them to make a choice. 
Allow parents to stay at home to care for their children without 
having to pay a penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has had the opportunity to change this 
discriminatory policy that favours dual income households and it 
has not yet done it after five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first root of the problem is that the government wants to 
manipulate society.  I ask myself:  Why does it not do this?  It 
wants to restrict people in their choices.  Labelling stay at 
home parents as child care dropouts indicates how government 
members are thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second root of the problem is that taxes are much too high 
and the government does not want to reduce them.  It is most 
reluctant to respond to the desire of Canadians to have their 
taxes reduced.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact taxes are so high that these taxes drive parents out of 
the home in order to pay the bills.  In order to provide the 
food, shelter and clothing that are needed, parents today are 
forced to supplement their income by having both parents work out 
of the home.  This limits parents in their desire to do what they 
feel is best for those they cherish most, their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the experts, this restriction on the parents' 
desire to directly care for their children has raised costs in 
four areas.  Costs to society increase because parents are 
restricted in their choices.  In their desire to spend time with 
their children, psychologists have told us that it is absolutely 
necessary that they be with their children, yet the social 
engineering of the Liberals has raised costs in four areas. These 
four areas are education, social costs, justice and health care 
costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals allowed parents to exercise their choice freely 
without being manipulated by the tax system we could lower our 
level of taxation in this country.  Why?  Because education costs 
could be reduced.  Health care costs could be reduced.  Justice 
costs could be reduced.  All of those social costs could be 
reduced.  What would appear as maybe a loss of income to the 
government would actually have the opposite effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accusation was thrown at us by the Liberals that we would 
like to remove paid child care as a tax deduction.  We have never 
said that.  We would not oppose a tax reduction for parents.  But 
we do object to the fact that parents who stay at home to care 
for their children are not treated equally.  The parent who stays 
at home is not allowed to reduce their taxes accordingly.  The 
government does not give equal treatment to parents who choose to 
stay at home.  That is the main point of this motion.  That is 
what we are going to be voting on.  We need to look at the intent 
of this motion.  Many of the speakers on the opposite side have 
avoided the intent of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, let me talk a little about the brain drain and 
how that is affecting families.  Canada is one of the most highly 
taxed nations in the world.  According to the Fraser Institute, 
the total tax rate runs at 49%.  High taxation is driving our 
young people out of this country.  A single person would have 38% 
disposable income in the United States.  In Canada they only have 
22%.  That is a huge difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What effect does that have on the family?  Grandparents who 
would like to see their grandchildren are unable to do that. 
Grandparents have an important role to play.  This government 
makes it more difficult to have extended family relationships 
because our young people are forced to leave to go to the U.S. to 
find jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are we incurring huge costs educating young people, 
young people who could contribute to our quality of life and our 
economy, we are forcing them to leave the country.  We are also 
harming extended family relationships.  That is very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we thought through the tax policies of the government we 
would see how it has completely disregarded the pleas of 
Canadians for tax reduction and fairness in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Some Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  I hear a member opposite saying 
some Canadians.  Look at what people think.  Over 70% of mothers 
in the workplace would prefer to be at home with their children. 
Over 80% of Canadians, mothers and fathers, feel that the 
government is discriminating in the area of taxation against 
parents who would like this choice.  That is very serious.  That 
is what this debate is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard all the rhetoric on the other side, the waffling 
and the excuses because they are not allowed to vote freely.  I 
think we should put politics aside and do what is best for the 
children and for the families of this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Sackville—Eastern Shore, Public Service of 
Canada; the hon. member for Mississauga South, Health; the hon. 
member for Winnipeg North Centre, Health.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I agree with sentiment and the spirit of the member's comments as 
I think he listened to my speech earlier.  He will know that I 
have some difficulties not with the intent of the motion but 
rather based on the speeches that were given with the approach to 
dealing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because the child care expense deduction which 
appears to be the foundation of the debate is only available to 
the lowest income earning spouse.  It is also worth more to a 
higher income earner versus a low income earner.  It is 
problematic.  Given that it is only available to the lowest 
income earner it does not do justice or equity to parents where 
one of them may have some part time income because that parent 
would be the only one to claim the child care expense deduction 
against a low level of part time income.  Also not taken into 
account would be someone who has interest income as a second 
earning.  A stay at home mom with interest income would have to 
claim the child care expense deduction and could not transfer it 
to the higher income earning spouse.  It would not benefit them. 
The third situation would be lone parents. They either work or if 
they do not work, they will have no income to deduct the child 
care expense deduction against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argued and I ask the hon. member whether he would not consider 
that if the child care expense deduction in itself is technically 
flawed and is not apparently an instrument that can be inclusive 
of the different kinds of configurations of families and income 
situations of families, maybe we should just scrap it and replace 
it with a care giver benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Madam Speaker, I respect the member 
opposite. However, he is trying to change the subject.  He is 
trying to find an excuse not to support the motion.  Look at the 
intent of this motion.  Do not start going off on some tangent. I 
submit that if this motion had been introduced by the finance 
minister he would have stood up and supported it.  He is going 
into all kinds of extraneous details that are not in the motion 
and which could be debated when the legislation is introduced but 
the general principle is what we are talking about today, 
fairness and equality in our tax system for parents who would 
choose to stay at home and do a very valuable job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had everybody support the intent of that.  They are 
doing a very valuable job and yet that is the problem we have 
here.  The question I would like to pose back but cannot is why 
he is not supporting the intent of this motion.  If it were 
introduced over there he would be supporting it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to quickly put a question to my colleague. 
What we are doing here is asking that a system be set up so we 
can look to end this discrimination.  My colleague knows 
very well that there are many people opposite who want to end 
this discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When does my colleague think the whip came down and said “no, 
we will vote against it” and for what reason?  Can the member 
think of any reason they would defeat a motion that is so 
fundamentally clear and honest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is impossible to 
answer that question.  I cannot get into the heads of the people 
on the other side.  I have asked myself many times the question 
of what makes them tick, why they knuckle under to the whip and 
why they do not use their heads when it comes to debating and 
looking at the legislation.  This flies in the face of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we should be doing in the House is listening to the 
legislation and the motions being debated.  That is our job as 
legislators, as parliamentarians, to listen to the pros and cons 
of a debate and vote accordingly.  That is not happening. This is 
the most undemocratic place we can imagine because of the system 
that has developed here.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has to change and unless we change this system, we will not 
change much else in the country.  Our parents will still be 
discriminated against if they choose to take care of the children 
because of the system that exists here, where members of 
parliament are not allowed to vote freely on this. How they are 
kept in line is up to speculation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a disgrace and I am ashamed that we even have to 
talk about this as we are about to turn the millennium, that we 
discriminate against parents who choose to stay home and raise 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get into specifics.  This all boils down to just one 
issue as I see it that we have to decide on.  Will we recognize 
that parenting is one of our most important occupations that any 
Canadian can do? I suggest it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife stays at home.  She works 14 to 16 hours a day raising 
our children.  There is not one other occupation I can think of 
that is more difficult, more demanding and is more of a 
cornerstone of the fabric of our society than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into specific examples out of their own documents 
to prove this, I will relate something that is even more 
insulting, more disgraceful.  Members opposite, instead of giving 
tax fairness to stay at home parents are more concerned about 
providing tax relief to NHL franchises, to NHL hockey players who 
are earning millions and millions of dollars.  That is what they 
are focusing on.  That is insulting. That is a disgrace to all 
these parents who stay at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not disagree that they are probably overtaxed but if the 
government is to give out one thin dime and a tax free 
certificate it had better give out 30 million of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get to the specifics.  I have a document, a child care 
expense deduction form for 1998, form T778.  That is what any 
Canadian will have to fill out to claim a child care deduction 
for this year.  I will use myself as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife has a university degree.  She was a director of 
information services at a local college.  She can speak four 
languages, is well educated but she chose to give up her career 
because she felt it was so fundamentally important to stay home 
with our children while I went out to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example.  My sister is a school teacher in 
Invermere, British Columbia.  He husband James chose to put his 
career on hold and stay at home with their three daughters until 
they started school.  He felt it was important that one parent be 
there.  He put his career on hold and stayed at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For either James or my wife or anybody else in similar 
circumstances, if they wanted to get the same tax deduction as 
two working parents there is one way they could do it.  I am 
looking on the tax form, part C.  If they ticked off the box that 
they are mentally or physically incapable of raising children 
they would be eligible for the same deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This one is even more amazing.  Let me read word for word from 
the government's tax form: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>e) The other supporting person was confined to a prison or 
similar institution for a period of at least two weeks in 1998. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is so they would be eligible for that tax deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not rhetoric.  That is fact.  It is an insult to every 
single man and woman who chooses to stay home and look after 
their children and it is absolutely shameful that we are 
discussing that as we go into the next millennium, that we can 
discriminate.  I plead to the members.  I am telling straight 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other way that they could get this deduction.  My 
wife and I would have to separate.  If we are living separate and 
apart we would get the deductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an insult that we are promoting that. I know seniors who 
have come to me and said the only way they could get tax fairness 
is if they were to get a legal divorce.  That is another whole 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue we are talking about today is whether we recognize the 
role of parents who choose to stay home and raise their children. 
The question is whether we recognize that as the most important 
occupation in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government puts zero importance on it.  It discriminates 
against it. They are not entitled to it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT80"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT80"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, one of the Liberal members point this out to me.  I am 
appalled.  These are the facts.  I challenge any member on that 
side to come to talk to me personally or stand up in the House 
and I will provide him or her with this document.  They can get 
it from any post office.  These are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They keep coming up with all these other arguments on everything 
they have done.  Some of these came in with the Tories but we are 
not discussing those because those are available to everybody. We 
are talking about the one deduction that is available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that has been raised is how a two parent family 
each earning $25,000 is better off than another two parent family 
that has only one person earning $50,000.  The family that 
believes it is important to stay home and nurture and raise 
children is discriminated by $4,000.  This is on top of the the 
child care issue which I was just explaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My children are four and five.  They go to preschool for 
my wife's benefit so that she can get a few hours out of each 
week to do the things she needs to do.  It is also, I argue, a 
benefit for them and very good for them.  However, we are not 
entitled to that tax deduction because my wife is not a criminal, 
she has not spent two weeks in jail and we are not separated. 
These words are right off the form: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>f) You and you spouse were, due to a breakdown in your 
relationship, living separate and apart at the end of 1998 and 
for a period of at least 90 days—. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is insulting to these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example which takes me back four or five years 
going to law school.  This goes on to part D.  We had our 
children when I was going to school.  My wife gave up her career 
while I was in law school.  If the circumstances had been the 
same as they are today, we would not have been entitled to put 
them in a day care and claim that deduction even though the 
family income was only for three or four months a year around 
$16,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If both the parents are not working they both have to be going 
to school to claim that deduction in part D.  This is right off 
the government's tax forms.  I encourage members to look at them. 
I read these and I am appalled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then listen to other comments made by members in the House and 
the insults get deeper and deeper and the wounds become deeper 
and deeper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about the member for Vancouver Kingsway. She was 
sitting on a committee in Calgary along with my hon. colleague 
from Calgary Southeast who explained to me the outrage of the 
people she was addressing. These people were just disgusted. 
There is a quote in <I>Hansard</I> which she laughs and sneers at 
when she is questioned in the House.  She said perhaps 
individually you have low self-esteem for many reasons but you 
cannot say this applies to all women at home.  They are not being 
looked down upon as misfits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that my wife is not a misfit. She has a degree and 
is fluent in four languages, written and spoken, but she chose to 
place her priority on our family.  We believe that it is very 
important to stay at home and raise our children.  She is also 
fully aware of the sacrifices she has made.  She wants to go back 
into the workforce when our children start school.  We are facing 
those choices now.  She took five years out of her career because 
she felt it was so important.  We discriminate against those 
people. There are hundreds of thousands of those kinds of people 
across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also said most women can combine career and family life. It 
is not about that.  It is about making choices.  I find this 
absolutely outrageous.  That the government will give the tax 
deduction to a criminal who spends two weeks in jail, somebody 
who is separated or somebody who is not capable of raising their 
children but the person who chooses to stay at home is not 
entitled to that same deduction is outrageous.  How can the 
government insult Canadians?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an opportunity to correct this by standing and voting 
in favour of this motion.  We can do what is right, put politics 
aside, rise above party labels and do what we believe is right 
for Canadians.  I will give members this document and they can 
read it for themselves and make the choice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member has expressed the sentiment of all members who spoke 
today and I think of all members of the House of the important 
contribution families make when they choose to provide direct 
parental care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of discrimination continues to be part of this 
dialogue. The member will know that in the Income Tax Act there 
is a lot of discrimination.  In fact policy by its very nature is 
discriminatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We discriminate in favour of seniors because we give them an age 
exemption and pay OAS. We discriminate in favour of aboriginals 
because of the special programs and benefits. We discriminate in 
favour of high income earners because they can deduct larger 
amounts in RRSPs. We discriminate in favour of low income earners 
because they have a lower tax rate than others. We discriminate 
in favour.  All of the tax measures that were put in probably 
were done in response to a particular situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anyone in this place will disagree with the 
spirit and with the intent.  But the member will know that the 
child care expense deduction is not inclusive enough. It does not 
deal with the benefit available to someone with part time work or 
just non-earned income work or with lone parent situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in those comments the hon. 
member has acknowledged there is discrimination.  We are talking 
about discrimination against parents who choose to stay at home 
and raise their children.  My family is one of those. I have 
siblings who have made those choices, along with hundreds of 
thousands of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us recognize the value that they contribute to this society, 
the very fabric and what will be the future of our society.  They 
have such a fundamental important role.  Let us fix that 
discrimination the member talks about.  It is right here in the 
tax forms.  Why would we give a deduction to a criminal who goes 
to jail for two weeks?  Why do I have to separate from my wife 
for 90 days to be eligible for a deduction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we not recognize the value that they give to society, that 
it is the most important occupation we have in this land?  It is 
not about some of the comments that have been made that other 
people have to work hard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is an element of holier than thou in this debate. 
I have sat here quietly for the last three hours and I have heard 
the Reform Party opposite constantly ask why did the finance 
minister not do something on this issue, that since 1993, for 
five years this government has not moved on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition party has an opportunity to present an opposition 
motion every week or so.  I would like to ask the member opposite 
why has it taken five years for that party to bring this motion 
forward in this House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have to prioritize. We 
have had to bring motions forward to try to provide some relief 
for hepatitis C victims.  We have had to bring motions forward 
for debate in this House on offering protection to children in 
this country against pedophiles and pornographic materials. 
Those are the priorities on which we had to make choices to bring 
to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stick to the facts.  The facts are on the government's 
own tax forms.  It is discriminating. We are not recognizing the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to acknowledge at the outset that I will be splitting 
my time with the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that in this debate I can offer some constructive 
suggestions with respect to the motion at hand.  I will 
diligently attempt to stay away from gender politics and all of 
the nonsense that goes with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supply days in this House are a little like playing paintball 
with a blind man.  If you shoot often enough, after a while you 
hit a target by accident.  Under serendipitous circumstances 
somehow or another you finally hit the mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To any great credit of the Reform Party it actually hit on an 
anomaly in the Income Tax Act which bears some review and is a 
point worth debating.  I cannot say that has been often true from 
the opposition parties as the points frequently raised from the 
other side seem to bear no relevance to reality and are not worth 
debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I went to law school I took income tax.  I hated the 
subject.  I would do everything to avoid the course.  I then went 
on to bar admission and had to do it again.  Again I would try to 
do everything to avoid the course.  I wondered why I really 
objected to the Income Tax Act.  The essential reason was that 
when I thought I had a solution to a particular problem, suddenly 
the solution evaporated in my hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is similar to that.  It appears to be a good idea. 
It seems like a good idea.  Who could be against discrimination, 
or for discrimination as the case may be?  It makes no sense 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 22 years of practising law, I have frequently been asked 
questions with respect to the Income Tax Act.  I have had enough 
courage to say to clients that I know that I do not know a great 
deal about the subject.  I dare say that such candour seldom is 
experienced by members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Income tax is extremely complicated.  The act is complicated. 
It is understood by very few people in its entirety.  There is an 
argument to be put that almost no one in Canada actually 
understands the act in all its complexities.  Any time one plays 
with a certain part of the act, there are implications in the act 
that one probably does not anticipate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding that, we are not being asked so much to deal 
with the act as we are dealing with the values that underlie the 
act.  In that respect, the motion has merit.  The motion reads 
“that, in the opinion of this House, the federal tax system 
should be reformed to end discrimination against single income 
families with children”.  I am somewhat disappointed in the 
drafters of the motion having chosen somewhat inflammatory 
language such as discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Mississauga South pointed out, the act tries 
to address a number of inequities in family living situations 
such as people who split up, such as people with certain 
disabilities.  Every time one tries to favour one group in that 
respect, one almost necessarily appears to discriminate against 
another group.  I would rather use the word that it is an anomaly 
and address it as an anomaly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time we use the word discriminatory we start to vision the 
charter of rights and freedoms.  We start to get into definitions 
as to whether this is or is not discrimination and whether it is 
justifiable in a free and democratic society.  Knowing members 
opposite, particularly the proponents of the motion, I know that 
is not where they intend to go with their motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not pretend to go into a legal analysis on this matter but 
I would like to address a family that is earning about $60,000 as 
a family income.  Clearly the numbers do not add up.  If one is 
married or living common law and earning $30,000, spouse one and 
spouse two, the total family tax is about $11,600.  If however 
only one of the spouses is earning the $60,000, the tax burden is 
about $16,000.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inequity is apparent.  It is about $4,300.  That inequity is 
further exaggerated if one is also a single parent, although when 
one gets into various spousal equivalents it gets somewhat 
closer.  Clearly there is about a $4,000 discrepancy between the 
two situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the tax system do to exaggerate the anomaly or to 
minimize the anomaly?  I point out to members opposite that the 
child care deduction has an approximate value of $4,000 to 
$7,000.  This goes to the spouse who has the lowest income.  Of 
course the premise is that the spouse who has no income will not 
be able to benefit from that child care deduction.  That actually 
exaggerates the anomaly rather than minimizes it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there aspects which actually reduce the anomaly?  The most 
obvious is the child tax benefit which by anyone's standards is a 
significant initiative on the part of this government.  It is 
approximately $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with arguing on the basis of the child tax benefit 
is that it applies both to single family incomes and families 
that have double incomes.  That in and of itself does not help to 
reduce the anomaly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue as I see it is that it is a values decision. This 
government has made an attempt to minimize the effects of the 
Income Tax Act on those most vulnerable and most in need.  If 
that is the damning indictment of a government, then I stand with 
the government to try and reduce the impact of the tax on those 
most vulnerable and most in need.  This is something I support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that in that respect the government has done a 
reasonable job.  Over the past two budgets, the government has 
taken about 600,000 taxpayers off the rolls and that, regardless 
of where we sit in this House, is a considerable accomplishment. 
I am aware that as employment improves, there will be more 
taxpayers added to the rolls.  Again those are results of 
government policies which can only bring more fairness into the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the government has made the right decision 
in this area to attempt to reduce the effect of the income tax on 
anyone below a certain threshold.  Frankly, again I cannot 
imagine how members on any side of the House would argue that is 
anything other than a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the threshold rises, it has benefits to all families, 
regardless of whether they are a single parent or have both 
parents, whether they have a single income or a double income. 
The additional and obvious benefit has been to move up the 
threshold by $675 which means that an individual is going to have 
to have a taxable income in excess of $7,000 before there is 
going to be any tax at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area in which the anomaly can be reduced is in the 
spousal credit.  This goes somewhat toward the reduction of the 
anomaly by about $1,000 in our example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An additional area where the government has attempted to address 
the inequity is through the Canada child tax benefit.  This 
provides a special supplement of $213 per child under the age of 
17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are, I would argue, modest attempts to reduce the 
anomalies. The 1999 budget should be credited for doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition there was an introduction of the Canada child tax 
benefit which has a value of $2,600 for a family that has one 
income versus $1,270 for a family that has two incomes.  Again if 
we put those benefits together, the spousal credit and the child 
tax benefit, we have reduced the anomaly somewhat which still 
leaves it in the range of approximately $3,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point I would like to make with respect to the 
reduction of the anomaly is that the increase in deductibility 
and the removal of many people from the tax rolls is an enormous 
benefit that is not factored into the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final issue with respect to this is whether— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry but I 
must interrupt.  The hon. member did say that he was splitting 
his time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Yes, I did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Well, this is the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will try to be brief.  The member for Vancouver 
Kingsway said that they had difficulty with the provinces 
establishing a day care to fulfil the Liberal promise of 1993.  I 
have the 1993 promise right here and I should remind the House 
that provincial leaders do not run for federal politics.  Only 
governments do and the five political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government ran in 1993.  Its promise was to create 
50,000 child care spaces in each year following a year of 3% 
economic growth, to a total of 150,000 over three years.  It also 
said that for families which need two incomes to survive and for 
single parents who want to get off welfare and other social 
assistance and get jobs, access to quality child care was a must. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere in the promise of 1993 does it say that the government 
would co-operate with or even discuss with the provinces.  This 
was a federal Liberal promise which was broken by this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I ask this member of the Liberal Party why they made 
the promise and why they broke it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the member well knows, 
any initiative in this area, any amendments to the Income Tax Act 
or any separate freestanding act with respect to this issue, has 
to be done in conjunction with the provinces.  If we cannot get 
provincial co-operation we simply cannot succeed in that area. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member referred to the discrimination of the 
Liberal government's tax policy as an anomaly.  He would prefer 
if we would use the word anomaly.  I bet he would prefer for us 
to use the word anomaly because it does not sound near as bad as 
the tax discrimination of the government against families that 
have one of their members remaining at home to look after the 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday a caller in Vancouver asked the finance minister this 
very question.  In response the finance minister used the same 
terminology of an anomaly.  The caller said that her family was 
being penalized by the regressive tax policies of the federal 
government and the finance minister, and the minister said that 
she was right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister admitted this was a regressive taxation 
policy that clearly discriminated against families.  He would 
like us to believe that it just kind of happened, that it was an 
anomaly which has built up over the years.  The finance minister 
has been here for five years and has done nothing to change the 
law to address this discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague on the other side not agree with the 
finance minister?  If this is an anomaly, as he likes to say, 
rather than blatant discrimination, why has the finance minister 
done nothing over five years to address these serious inequities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are not arguing whether 
this is an anomaly or an inequity.  The issue is that it is 
acknowledged by the finance minister that it is an inequity, an 
anomaly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member were listening, and I know he was listening to 
everything the minister was saying, he would have heard the 
finance minister's answer in the House today that it was being 
referred to the finance committee.  It is an issue that has been 
circulating in this caucus a great deal.  I do not see that the 
finance minister has been anything other than straightforward 
with the House in terms of addressing that issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
very brief. I would just like to ask a short question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals opposite have a policy of helping the rich get 
richer and the poor get poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand my colleague when he says that they are 
sympathetic.  Why could this not be resolved quickly?  Everyone 
agrees that it makes no sense, that it is discriminatory, but 
they have done nothing about it.  My colleague said earlier that 
they have been in office for five years, more even, and have 
done nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why could this not be resolved quickly? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know what the hon. 
member has been doing in the House for the past number of years, 
but if we look at the initiatives on the part of the government 
with respect to children, I do not think we need to stand down to 
anyone.  Two billion dollars as a Canada child tax benefit is a 
huge amount of money by anyone's standards.

with respect to its financial position. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am actually delighted to take part in this debate 
because I have been waiting for it for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My connection with this problem goes back to my beginnings as a 
politician.  I ran for the first time as a politician in 1993. 
One of the platform planks of the Liberals in 1993 was the 
creation of 150,000 day care spaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both before and after I won the nomination I made it very clear 
to the press and to all members of the Liberal Party in my riding 
that I did not support the creation of 150,000 day care spaces. 
That resulted in a telephone call out of the blue from Ottawa. I 
picked up the phone.  I had never met the man before but he 
introduced himself on the other side of the phone as Mr. Martin. 
It turned out that this Mr. Martin was one of the architects of 
the Liberal platform for 1993.  He said on the phone to me “I 
understand that you don't agree with the Liberal platform”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said “No, no, Mr. Martin.  That is not it at all.  My problem 
is that I do not believe that the creation of 150,000 day care 
spaces is the best way to spend money in comparison to possibly 
finding a better way, a tax break for stay at home spouses”. I 
also said “Mr. Martin, when I win I expect to convince you of 
the rightness of what I am saying”, and he said “Well, fair 
enough.  See you in Ottawa”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just a little illustration that the Liberal Party is an 
inclusive party.  It permits and encourages dissent on key 
issues, but one has to be able to persuade, to convince the 
leadership that the suggestion is the right suggestion and should 
be given priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very fortunate after 1993 because I did not have to 
aggressively pursue this issue.  The member for Mississauga South 
took up the issue with a great deal of eloquence.  He was 
constantly arguing that we should do something to give better tax 
breaks to stay at home spouses.  He was very good on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year ago he became sick when we were in caucus out west and 
debating this budget.  Because the member for Mississauga South 
was unable to attend that caucus, I rose and there was the 
finance minister taking suggestions from members of caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said to the finance minister that I thought in this upcoming 
budget it would be a very appropriate and very effective way of 
spending money, with such surpluses we might have, to give better 
equity to those families that choose to have a spouse stay at 
home to look after their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need statistics to know that there is merit in the 
motion that has been proposed, quite apart from my long history 
with the issue.  In my riding I have frequent fall and summer 
fairs at which I have a booth.  It gives me an opportunity to 
meet thousands of my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one young couple who always comes to these events.  The 
first they came they had two children; the last time they had 
three.  They ask me when I will persuade the finance minister to 
adjust the Income Tax Act so that there is at least fairness for 
those who choose to stay home to look after their children rather 
than go out to work.  There is merit on that side of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of the issue we heard at various times today is 
that the government has been very aggressive in addressing the 
needs of children, although I have not won so far on the issue of 
getting tax breaks for stay at home spouses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have heard today, there have been all kinds of government 
programs since the government came to power to try to address the 
problem of children in need and to try to give them the best 
opportunity in life, including the child tax benefit and various 
other programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where it has been difficult to convey the logic and and where 
there is some genuine disagreement is on the idea that a stay at 
home spouse actually has real monetary value to the state and 
that there is justification for supporting a stay at home spouse 
through the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that we can address money to specific problems, but 
it is not so clear to some people, though it is clear to me, that 
it is in the state's interest to encourage through expenditure, 
which is what a tax incentive is, that some spouses at least have 
the choice to stay home if they so desire.  That is the other 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand why some members on my side will disagree with 
the motion and why I have had difficulty in persuading the 
finance minister that this is indeed something we should be 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons I welcome the motion that has come before us 
today is that as a backbench government MP I do not have the 
opportunity the opposition has to bring this kind of motion 
before us for public debate, so the whole country can debate it. 
If I could have put the motion forward years ago, I would have 
done it.  The problem is that the only option I have is a private 
member's motion, which is a lottery and the chances of actually 
getting the motion on the floor is very remote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard earlier one Reform member opposite explain that the 
reason the Reform Party did not bring the motion before the House 
earlier in the five years it has had to do it was that it had 
other priorities like chasing pedophiles and dealing with 
hepatitis C.  It also made choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More power to the finance minister.  If he did not move on the 
issue as fast as I would have liked and as fast as the member for 
Mississauga South would have liked, at least the reason he did 
not move as fast was that his priorities were looking after 
children, providing benefits for children and looking after low 
income families rather than trying to bring various criminals to 
justice.  It is a matter of choice.  The priorities demonstrated 
by the finance minister are the kinds of priorities I would 
prefer to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have accomplished much by this debate.  Regardless of how 
members on either side vote on the motion, the finance minister 
today in question period said that he felt this was an important 
issue and that he would send directions to his parliamentary 
secretary to get it on the agenda and hopefully debated in the 
finance committee.  Finally, the member for Mississauga South and 
I will see the initiative to give equality and opportunity to 
stay at home spouses come to pass.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be the first elected 
member of the House of Commons to speak, not just today in this 
debate, but in the history of the House of Commons, on this 
vital matter of the legalization of marijuana for health and 
medical purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marijuana has been used medicinally throughout the world for 
thousands of years.  Today many patients, particularly those 
suffering from cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and 
other diseases, testify to the marked relief they obtain from 
inhaling marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The therapeutic use of marijuana is, however, still banned by 
the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and users are liable to 
a six-month prison sentence and a $1000 fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a view to changing this unacceptable situation, I 
introduced a motion one year ago in favour of the legalization 
of marijuana for health and medical purposes.  For me, this is a 
matter of compassion toward sick people suffering from nausea, 
loss of appetite, vomiting, and other major discomforts which 
accompany a number of chronic diseases.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion is simple and unequivocal.  It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
undertake all necessary steps to legalize the use of marijuana 
for health and  medical purposes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, it is unacceptable for a person with a chronic 
condition, or a terminally ill AIDS patient, to be liable for 
six months in prison and a $10,000 fine for using a medical 
treatment recommended by his or her physician. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act is 
totally devoid of understanding and compassion toward the 
chronically ill, who want nothing more than to live in dignity. 
This act must be changed as soon as possible, in order to allow 
the medical use of marijuana by those who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario court has already found part of the Narcotic Control 
Act to be unconstitutional.  Clearly, the ball is now in our 
court here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been elected to fulfil a role as legislators.  We have 
no right to let the courts decided in our stead.  We must now 
assume our responsibility as elected representatives by inviting 
the federal government to pass concrete measures without delay 
that will allow the therapeutic use of marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, the only parliamentary approach that can 
achieve this is to give solid support to Motion M-381, which we 
are debating here today for the first time, and which calls upon 
the government to “undertake all necessary steps to legalize the 
use of marijuana for health and medical purposes”. The situation 
is urgent.  For those who suffer, every day counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My position in favour of the legalization of marijuana for 
therapeutic purposes was not formed yesterday. I was first made 
aware of this injustice by my constituents, who urged me to take 
a public position in favour of legalizing marijuana for health 
and medical purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last March 6, I publicly supported a proposal along these lines 
by young delegates to the Bloc Quebecois youth forum.  I am 
happy that this proposal was passed unanimously at the time by 
forum delegates.  The proposal called on the Bloc Quebecois to 
take a stand in favour of the therapeutic use of marijuana and 
urged its parliamentary wing to follow up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Delegates were very happy to hear our leader, the member for 
Laurier—Sainte-Marie, support their proposal in his closing 
address to the conference.  Two weeks later, I followed up with 
the motion we are debating for the first time today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new debate.  The media and the courts have been 
looking at this issue for some time now.  Doctors are discussing 
it with each other, and criminologists and patient advocacy 
groups are giving it thought. 
It is a topic that has been of interest to many people except, 
until today, members of the House of Commons.  Now, since this 
debate will be followed by a vote, each of us here in the House 
will have an opportunity to take a clear stand on the issue. 
This is, in our view, a simple issue of transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now, every time the issue of legalizing the therapeutic 
use of marijuana came up, the Minister of Health or the Minister 
of Justice tried to duck it.  Their answer was always that they 
were open to the issue, their officials were studying it, and 
they hoped to be able to announce a plan or something more 
specific in a few months' time, all the while hoping that the 
issue would go away.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say the same thing the next time the question comes up. 
This was what they did last year when an Ontario court judge 
ruled that a section of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act 
was unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was what they said when an AIDS sufferer from the Outaouais 
and his physician asked the government to take action on this 
issue.  It is also what the Minister of Health and the Minister 
of Justice told me when I put the question to them here in the 
House one year ago on March 10 and 23, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, it was the usual scenario. 
On the eve of the first day of debate on the motion that 
marijuana be legalized for medical purposes, the Minister of 
Health suddenly feels a need to demonstrate compassion towards 
the chronically ill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he do to help?  He announces that he will ask his 
officials to prepare a plan to draw up guidelines for eventual 
legalization of marijuana for medical use.  I repeat: he 
announces that he will once again ask his officials to prepare a 
plan to draw up guidelines for eventual legalization of 
marijuana for medical use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have the officials the minister asked to look into this 
issue last year been doing?  What do they have to show for their 
research?  Only the minister knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the Minister of Health took a step in the right 
direction, and I said so yesterday.  He deserves credit. 
He has announced that he will be asking these same departmental 
employees to draw up an action plan with a view to legalizing 
the therapeutic use of marijuana.  Hence we now know the mandate 
he claims to have given to his staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we have any faith in his words when, in the past, the 
minister's actions did not fall in line with his commitments? 
Why did the minister announce a policy of openness but still no 
precise timeframe or concrete measures to achieve the legal use 
of marijuana for health and therapeutic purposes? Once again, 
his actions denote a lack of transparency. 
What is more, this new policy smacks of last-minute improvization 
by the minister.  He rushed to give his people a mandate just as 
the issue was about to be debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B> Not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> I hear the parliamentary secretary over 
there taking the liberty to react to what I am saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary ought to be familiar with the 
demands by the Canadian AIDS Society.  She ought to be familiar 
with the position of the Canadian Hemophilia Society, which has 
been tabled today.  She ought to be familiar with the positions 
of Donald Kilby, director of the University of Ottawa Health 
Services. And of Réjean Thomas, a leading figure in the 
treatment of AIDS.  And she ought to be familiar with the case 
of James Wakeford, who has made a request under the special 
access program.  With the cases of Jean-Charles Parizeau and 
Terry Parker.  But no, the parliamentary secretary does not want 
to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's new policy smacks of improvization, as I have 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has given a hasty mandate to his departmental employees on 
the eve of a debate on the matter, but is unable to give any 
details on his policy.  In fact, the minister cannot even say 
whether his announcement means that he is taking the necessary 
steps to legalize the health and medical use of marijuana. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what today's motion is calling for.  The 
minister is still refusing to say whether he will vote for or 
against the motion.  I hope that we can clarify his intentions 
in the course of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister said yesterday that he was prepared to take 
steps towards legalization, the only course open to him in June 
is to vote in favour.  Any move by the government to vote 
against this motion will be interpreted by those favouring the 
legalization of marijuana for medical purposes as unwillingness 
to keep this promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, the government and the minister must demonstrate in 
good faith.  I grant that he has taken a step in the right 
direction, but his actions must suit his words, and he must vote 
in favour of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the minister is certainly not yet able to tell us what 
stand he will take.  We are still waiting, and would have liked 
an announcement yesterday as to where he stood.  But instead we 
must wait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in touch by phone as recently as yesterday with patients, 
doctors, and associations asking me to continue the fight, 
because nothing is a given, because although there was an 
announcement yesterday, no timeframe was mentioned.  There was 
no research protocol. 
We know that there is no indication whatsoever that the minister 
listens to patients, for instance those who have made 
applications under the Health Canada special access program, 
which is the minister's own responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore wish to assure everyone, not only in this House, but 
everyone involved in the campaign, the physicians, the patients, 
that I will continue the awareness campaign I launched this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to assure them that this lack of transparency can only 
make me step up the pressure so that a majority of MPs here in 
this House will be able to vote in favour of this motion.  The 
government has no excuse whatsoever for taking refuge behind 
inaction, as it has so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one disputes the therapeutic effectiveness of THC, or 
tetrahydrocannabinol, the principal active ingredient in 
marijuana. 
Moreover, physicians can already prescribe Marinol tablets, and 
have been doing so for some years now.  This authorized 
medication contains synthetic THC and is already available in 
pharmacies.  It is prescribed mainly to relieve nausea in 
terminally ill patients and to stimulate appetite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, taking synthetic marijuana pills is not as effective as 
inhalation.  According to the prestigious <I>New England Journal of 
Medicine</I>, swallowing pills cannot be compared to inhalation, 
which rapidly raises blood THC levels and greatly enhances the 
sought-after medical efficacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, many patients who would be candidates for the 
medical use of marijuana are already required to take huge 
numbers of pills daily.  We are talking of numbers even in 
excess of 30. 
One can imagine what taking more pills in the form of Marinol 
means, then.  The precise purpose of marijuana is to help make 
the taking of so many pills bearable by relieving nausea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, it is better to administer THC for nausea by the 
pulmonary route than the digestive route.  Many physicians are 
therefore campaigning for the possibility of prescribing THC in 
the form best suited to their patients.  They argue that they 
are in the best position to determine what suits their patients 
best.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Medical Association represents the medical 
community in Canada and ensures that the health care system 
provides doctors with what they need to deliver quality health 
care to their patients.  Since 1981, this association has been 
arguing that the simple possession of marijuana should be 
decriminalized, but it deplores the absence of more systematic 
scientific research on the topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the American Medical Association pointed out the need 
to review American legislation on the therapeutic use of 
marijuana.  The British Medical Association goes even further: 
it has called on the British government to take all necessary 
steps to authorize the therapeutic use of marijuana, while 
respecting all established scientific criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British Medical Association has also publicly encouraged the 
police and the courts to tolerate use of marijuana for 
therapeutic purposes.  In its report, it says, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some patients are forced to use an illegal drug to relieve 
symptoms that are not controlled by existing medication. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and that there is sufficient evidence that marijuana can help in 
certain circumstances. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were quotes from a report by the British Medical 
Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, following a major scientific research study by the 
British House of Lords, the British government decided to go 
ahead and authorize the first official trials to evaluate the 
therapeutic effects of marijuana.  The Royal Pharmaceutical 
Society is confident that, three years from now, cannabis will 
be a prescription drug in Great Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec and in Canada, well known physicians such as Réjean 
Thomas and Donald Kilby have already come down unambiguously in 
favour of legalization for medical and therapeutic purposes, as 
have some major dailies.  So have the Canadian AIDS Society, the 
Canadian Hemophilia Society, which wrote me another letter this 
morning, and the Coalition des organismes communautaires 
québécois de lutte contre le sida.  All these organizations are 
calling on the government and members of parliament to vote in 
favour of Motion M-381. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I ask the men and women fighting for this legalization to 
be patient, because I am very confident that they will have all 
the support they need in June.  Therefore—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as I rise today to participate 
in this debate there are several members in the House whose work 
on this topic should be acknowledged.  I would like to begin by 
acknowledging the member for London West for the work that she 
has done in this area since 1997.  I would also like to 
acknowledge the member for Rosemont, the member from 
Okanagan—and I regret that I cannot remember the correct name of 
the riding—and other members who have spoken to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is aware that Canadians are suffering who have 
terminal illnesses and who believe that using medical marijuana 
can ease their symptoms and we in the government want to help 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that those Canadians who are struggling to find new 
and better ways to maintain and improve their health have no 
interest in this topic, and to all of those who are healthy I 
would say that I hope this is a topic that will never be of 
interest to them and that they will never need to come forward to 
ask for this product. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern we have is that there are those who are suffering. 
As the Minister of Health said in the House yesterday, he has 
asked his officials to develop a research plan that will include 
clinical trials for medicinal marijuana, appropriate guidelines 
for its medical use and safe access to the supply of this drug. 
This will allow the government to get the information it needs so 
it can share that with Canadians.  We want a flexible approach 
that will help Canadians and protect the health and safety of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to truly assess the value of marijuana as a drug it is 
essential that we have reliable scientific evidence.  We know 
there is much anecdotal evidence.  We heard the member in his 
opening remarks refer to that evidence, but to date there is no 
reliable scientific evidence.  Therefore, as I have stated, the 
Minister of Health has asked his officials to develop a plan that 
will include the kind of information gathering, research and 
development of clinical guidelines for the appropriate use of 
medical marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to do is facilitate the development of these 
guidelines so that those people who are suffering and in need of 
help will have access to something that may be beneficial and 
that may assist them.  Many are terminally ill, many are in pain, 
many are suffering from symptoms which they believe, and there is 
anecdotal evidence to suggest, could be helped in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to get the facts.  We want to know whether this is 
effective.  But we also want to be able to use sections of 
existing federal legislation to give those people the opportunity 
to have access to a safe supply of medical marijuana that could 
be helpful to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing that most people would not know is that 
Health Canada has already explored the possibilities of securing 
a medicinal quality source of marijuana for use in its research 
projects.  As well, it has looked at ways of promoting research 
within this country.  We would provide patients with access to 
medicinal marijuana in a controlled setting as part of clinical 
trials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is important to note, and I particularly address 
people who have expressed concern about access to the program, 
that the current Canadian drug regulatory framework and 
international control framework create a scheme by which medical 
quantities of marijuana could be legally available for medicinal 
purposes like any other therapeutic drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the distribution of marijuana as a medicine 
could already be possible provided that the product, the quantity 
and the supply, is of good quality and originates from a legal or 
licit licensed supplier as opposed to an illicit supplier.  That 
is very important.  It is also very important under the existing 
law that this be used in the proper research context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The announcement by the minister dealt with the concerns that 
have been raised by many in this House:  access for those who are 
suffering and in need, those who need help, but access within a 
controlled clinical environment of research with appropriate 
guidelines to ensure quality and safety and to ensure that the 
access to the supply of this drug is of good medicinal quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state very clearly that physicians would be and must 
be very involved in the development of these research projects. 
The government wants to help Canadians who are suffering, but it 
wants to make sure they have the very best of advice and 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we will be developing a research agenda which will include 
clinical trials to gather evidence and needed documentation on 
both the risks and the benefits of the medicinal use of medical 
marijuana, we want a flexible approach that will provide patients 
with access to medicinal marijuana at an early stage of the 
research and in a setting that includes the support of qualified 
physicians.  That is very important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member opposite use the term legalizing of 
marijuana.  People should know that we are not talking about the 
legalizing of marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this does is it creates a research environment where we can 
do the research, gather the evidence and in that environment, 
just as we would with any other drug, make it available to people 
in a research context.  During the research setting, people would 
have access to the drug.  We would also be sure to develop 
appropriate clinical guidelines to make sure that it was used 
appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would allow us to respond in a sensitive and compassionate 
way to those who are terminally ill, who are suffering and are 
coping with symptoms where the anecdotal evidence would suggest 
that medical marijuana might be helpful to them. We want to find 
solutions for Canadians who are suffering.  We want to help 
Canadians.  We want to do it in a way that is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I am pleased to say that I intend to amend the 
motion.  At the appropriate time I will move an amendment to the 
motion.  I would like to give members notice of what I plan to 
move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be saying that the motion should be amended by deleting 
all the words after the word “should” and substituting the 
following “take steps immediately concerning the possible legal 
medical use of marijuana including developing a research plan 
containing clinical trials, appropriate guidelines for its 
medical use, as well as access to a safe medicinal supply and 
that the government report its findings and recommendations 
before the House rises for the summer”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite and others have asked are we prepared to put 
forward a timeline for this plan that the minister has asked his 
officials to develop.  I say to members of the House as part of 
this debate that it is the government's intention to do this work 
on a rapid basis so that we can have in place the plan to develop 
the research and give people access as expeditiously as possible. 
We know that the House rises for the summer in June.  Before 
that time the minister is making a commitment.  We hope all 
members will support the amendment.  I know that there is support 
in all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time I have remaining, I would like to thank all of the 
members who have spoken and who will be speaking on this, those 
who spoke in private and those who sent notes to the minister 
letting him know of their support for this initiative. I want to 
emphasize again that this is not the legalization of marijuana. 
This is treating marijuana like a drug that may be helpful to 
some.  We want to find out if it is.  We want to provide the 
conditions for access in a controlled clinical environment with 
appropriate clinical guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I move:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to private member's Motion No. 381 which 
reads “That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
undertake all necessary steps to legalize the use of marijuana 
for health and medical purposes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the amendment.  On the face of it the amendment appears 
to be okay as long as this is not a backdoor entry for legalizing 
marijuana smoking.  As long as a firm guideline is established, 
probably it should be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only recently undertaken the role of the official 
opposition's deputy critic for health.  My constituents and my 
colleagues are proud to have me speak to Motion No. 381 and 
express our compassion for the predicament faced by those 
Canadians suffering from the diseases and conditions that cause 
them to turn in desperation to marijuana to ease their symptoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking through the lens of compassion, my efforts on this issue 
are dedicated first and foremost toward the thousands of 
Canadians who are desperately seeking medicinal therapy for 
various illnesses.  These Canadians admittedly are frustrated at 
being in a situation where the only source of relief from their 
illness comes from smoking a substance that carries many 
extremely harmful side effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With them I seek less harmful alternatives.  It is very 
important to look through the sympathetic consciousness of 
others' distress together with a desire to alleviate it. 
Therefore, I will continue to be outspoken on behalf of Canadians 
who are sick and seek safe medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically, the use of marijuana goes back centuries.  The 
remains of a woman from the fourth century were discovered.  The 
woman had died giving birth.  There were marijuana leaves found 
near her dead body at the site.  Apparently she was inhaling 
marijuana, relieving her pain all those hundreds of years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To review the pros and cons, let us see how various 
professionals look at this issue.  Medically, THC, the drug in 
the marijuana plant, is known to be helpful to treat symptoms of 
cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, epileptic seizures, multiple sclerosis 
and migraine headaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States there are people who would like to have 
marijuana moved from schedule 1 substances where it is deemed to 
have no therapeutic use, to schedule 2 substances which are 
useful drugs that can be prescribed by doctors. There are people 
who would like to see it treated as a herbal remedy instead of a 
drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking of support for legalizing marijuana for medical 
purposes, in a national U.S. survey, 50% of cancer therapists 
said they would prescribe marijuana if it were legal and 44% said 
they are already suggesting it. It is far less addictive and far 
less subject to abuse than other drugs used as muscle relaxants, 
hypnotics or analgesics, according to the survey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Harvard University, the chief concern about the use 
of marijuana is the effect on the lungs of smoking it.  Cannabis 
smoke carries even more tars and other particulate matter than 
tobacco smoke.  Water pipes may reduce but cannot eliminate the 
side effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are fast approaching the 21st century.  We need to look into 
more advanced research to reap any benefits the drug can offer 
without side effects.  Perhaps a technological inhalation of 
cannabis vapours could be developed, an inhaler for example, or 
something else which could deliver the contents of marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question for us to consider is if it is ethical to deny 
people who are in pain something that will relieve their pain.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of Dr. Corigall's research at the University of 
Toronto dealing with the effects of canna-binoids on the brain 
predicts that there could be a creation of a synthetic form of 
marijuana. In arguments against legalizing marijuana for medical 
purposes, Dr. Corigall says that the dosage of marijuana as an 
analgesic cannot be regulated and ultimately people should not 
resort to smoking it to relieve their pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know that smoking is bad for us because of all the 
carcinogens that come with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again on the negative side of the issue, a retired U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Agency official said in 1996 since there are better 
medicines with less harmful side effects than marijuana available 
for the diseases for which it is touted, medical marijuana is a 
cruel hoax.  It does not help.  It does more harm than good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another study, the chairman of the International Drug 
Strategy Institute two years ago said, “suggesting that 
marijuana be smoked as a medicine would be like proposing tobacco 
be used for anxiety and weight loss”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Institute of Health determined that crude marijuana 
adds nothing to currently available medicine and indeed creates 
increased risk to patients. The U.S. National Institute of Health 
also says that a marijuana cigarette contains a complex mixture 
of over 400 different compounds, including carcinogens. This 
would be a concern for anyone but especially for patients with 
chronic disorders or impaired immune systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. National Eye Institute fact sheet on the therapeutic 
use of marijuana for glaucoma states that none of the studies 
demonstrates that marijuana or any of its components could safely 
and effectively prevent optic nerve damage from glaucoma.  Also, 
there are about 24 FDA approved drugs for the treatment of 
glaucoma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. National Cancer Institute notes that inhaling marijuana 
smoke is a health hazard.  It has a long list of agents that are 
more useful than marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look as well at the positions put forward by 
different professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lawyers have said through the Canadian Bar Association that the 
government's drug policies are misguided. They are in favour of 
decriminalizing marijuana because to continue the government's 
approach is doing more harm than good. The damage inflicted by 
the legal system seems disproportionate to the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Canadian Police Association recommended making 
simple marijuana possession a ticketable offence, similar to 
speeding.  The Ottawa police chief said that the risk of things 
going wrong during marijuana busts are too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, 43,000 Canadians were charged with 62,000 drug 
offences, and 71% of them were for marijuana. In the past 20 
years, 700,000 Canadians were arrested on marijuana charges. 
Since 1995 in British Columbia, B.C. police have been advised to 
stop laying marijuana charges because of court backlogs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what the medical community says.  The World 
Health Organization treats drug abuse as a health issue.  In 
those countries that treat drug abuse as a health matter rather 
than a criminal matter, people are not afraid to seek help.  Drug 
abuse declines and remains at lower levels in those countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Providing treatment for drug abusers makes more sense than 
prison terms.  The goal is a healthy population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these things in mind, we should study using marijuana for 
health and medicinal purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would say what is important to me is 
compassion. If nothing else works for the diseases and suffering, 
I do not see anything as a barrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would expect to have more research done. Through research and 
innovation, harmless methods may be found to benefit from the 
medicinal use of marijuana.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to start by congratulating the hon. member 
for Rosemont for this initiative and for the role he has played 
in encouraging the federal government and the Minister of Health 
to take steps to allow the legal use of marijuana for health and 
medical purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to offer my support for this resolution, which 
states very clearly: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the government should undertake all necessary steps to 
legalize the use of marijuana for health and medical purposes. 
</UL></UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my colleagues in the NDP caucus have also worked very 
hard on this issue but I want to acknowledge many in our party 
who have come before us and have been quite outspoken on this 
matter over the years.  All of us in our own ways have tried to 
find ways to put pressure on the federal government to act on 
behalf of persons who need to use marijuana for medical purposes, 
who need to find some relief from pain and suffering or to deal 
with the symptoms of chronic or terminal illnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that these people who are speaking out and asking 
for action are already in a poor physical state and are being 
forced to purchase marijuana illegally and with the risk of 
arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today to join with the Bloc and with all members in 
the House who support this view to urge the Liberal government 
today to take a brave step to overcome the history and 
associations of marijuana and recognize its value to the medical 
community as a part of legitimate treatment options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urge the Minister of Health, in the commitment that he made 
yesterday, to work with the Minister of Justice to ensure that 
people who use marijuana for medical purposes are never subject 
to prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have before us this resolution from the Bloc now 
amended by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health 
which will require some study and deliberations before we are 
prepared to indicate our support for the amended motion.  Our 
major concern will be whether the intentions of the government, 
as stated today, will in any way inhibit access for those people 
who are suffering today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing for the government to announce a plan of action 
to move on this very critical issue. 
It is another thing for individuals suffering from AIDS and other 
illnesses to wait four or five months before they will know 
whether there will be access.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly does not answer the question about all those 
individuals who have been charged as a result of possession of 
marijuana for medical purposes, nor does it address the question 
of whether individuals currently under doctor's orders to access 
marijuana will be charged in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many questions that must be addressed.  I think for all 
of us here today our concern is with trying to find a way to 
immediately alleviate the pain and suffering of individuals for 
whom marijuana prescribed on a medical basis is an important 
solution, an important alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party have presented different positions 
to us and they are certainly going through a great deal of soul 
searching about where they stand on this issue.  There are 
broader issues to be addressed.  I think for today it is 
important for all of us to say that we must address this issue 
from the point of view of compassion and we must do it on the 
basis of a great deal of urgency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to repeat the many arguments that have been 
presented to the House about the medical value of marijuana. I 
think it is important to simply summarize some of the information 
that has come from the medical and scientific community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from studies that marijuana has been proven to be 
effective in reducing pressure in glaucoma.  It has been proven 
to be successful in reducing vomiting and nausea associated with 
chemotherapy.  It has been clearly identified as stimulating 
appetite in patients with AIDS wasting syndrome.  It has been 
found to be useful in controlling spasticity associated with 
spinal cord injuries and MS.  It has been found to decrease 
suffering from chronic pain.  It has been found to be useful in 
controlling seizures in seizure disorders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marijuana is also considered to have a potential for a number of 
other conditions such as emphysema, because it dilates the 
bronchioles in lungs and in migraines.  It has a wide margin of 
safety and by all accounts is non-lethal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other important factor in all this is that marijuana used 
for medical purposes does not have many of the side effects that 
so many other treatments entail, side effects that sometimes are 
so serious that patients stop using the medications despite their 
suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer members to a 1997 editorial in the prestigious <I>New 
England Journal of Medicine</I> which refers to the parallel 
American prohibition as “misguided, heavy handed and inhumane”. 
It also states: “To demand evidence of therapeutic efficacy is 
equally hypocritical.  The noxious sensations that patients 
experience are extremely difficult to quantify in controlled 
experiments.  What really counts for a therapy with this kind of 
safety margin is whether a seriously ill patient feels relief as 
a result of the intervention, not whether a controlled trial 
proves its efficacy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many scientists who are convinced of the value of marijuana in 
terms of its medical significance are advising patients to use it 
despite the legal risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to another study quoted in the national news on 
September 24, 1998: “Science is assembling convincing evidence 
that Queen Victoria was not merely catering to royal whim when 
she used marijuana to numb her menstrual cramps. “Researchers at 
the University of California have discovered that cannabis 
triggers a pain suppressing circuit in the brains of rats, which 
demonstrates that the drug is indeed a pain killer”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article outlines significant scientific and medical 
information to lead us to believe that study and research have 
been done on this issue.  We may be just delaying the need to act 
by talking about clinical trials and further study before moving 
as quickly as possible on this matter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members of the most recent letter from the Canadian 
AIDS Society which urged all of us to support the resolution put 
forward by the hon. member for Rosemont: “As a result of the 
illness facing people with HIV and AIDS individuals often suffer 
severe nausea and an inability to eat.  Wasting, which is a lack 
of body fat and muscle mass, is one of the leading causes of 
death for people with HIV and AIDS.  Many of the current drug 
regimes that individuals are prescribed include strict timetables 
of when they can and cannot take the medication as well as 
whether the medications need to be taken with food or without. 
The side effects of these medications often include nausea”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is ample evidence of the benefits of marijuana use on a 
medical basis. There have been significant studies and clinical 
trials.  I think the time is now for action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the amendment put forward by the government today mean 
in terms of legal ramifications for people who are either charged 
now with illegal possession or are perhaps facing charges?  I 
suggest to the minister that there is provision now within our 
Food and Drugs Act for actually ensuring that under the emergency 
relief program we can ensure reasonable and responsible access to 
marijuana for treatment in keeping with the requirements of 
Canadian law pertaining to the use of marijuana as a new drug 
under the Food and Drugs Act and as a controlled substance under 
the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will study very diligently the amendment of the government 
but we strongly support the motion put forward by the Bloc member 
and we urge the government to move quickly.  We may need more 
clinical trials, more studies and more research but we also need 
to act immediately to deal with the pain and suffering of many 
individuals for whom there is no other reasonable alternative. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the debate today really centres around the word 
compassion.  I want to read the motion so that the viewing 
audience has a chance to hear it once again: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
undertake all necessary steps to legalize the use of marijuana 
for health and medical purposes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the key words, health and medical purposes.  We are 
talking about a compassionate use of a substance which is 
illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate today could be taking place on any number of 
substances used for pain relief in medicine, prescribed by 
doctors on a timely basis in cases where they are needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine for a minute whether we should be debating the 
use of morphine.  Should we not be talking about the use of 
codeine, morphine or heroin?  What we are talking about is the 
use of a drug to relieve pain in those who are suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is very commendable.  We are not talking about the 
legalization of the product for recreational or casual use. We 
are talking about a drug prescribed by doctors to help patients 
deal with the threshold of pain and suffering.  In many cases we 
are talking obviously of terminally ill patients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Medical Association, which I consulted on this, has 
some interesting observations.  I think it is worth putting these 
on the record as well.  It is not cut and dry. Certain 
considerations have to be made any time a substance is used for 
medicinal purposes. Some of these are outlined very clearly by 
the CMA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote a letter to me from the CMA which says the CMA has 
advocated the decriminalization of the possession of marijuana 
for many years. 
I think that position goes back to 1981.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the Canadian Medical Association is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Canadian Medical Association recommend to the federal 
government that the jurisdictional control of marijuana be moved 
from the Narcotics Act to the Food and Drugs Act and that all 
past criminal records related to simple possession be erased. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has a very strong position on the decriminalization of the 
use of marijuana.  However, when it comes to the medical use of 
marijuana, it is quite ironic that it has concerns, some of which 
I will outline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMA is concerned that as a herbal medicine it cannot be 
patented.  It says that exploitation of research is therefore 
precluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is concerned that the chemical content can vary considerably 
from plant to plant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is concerned that the standardization and reproducibility of 
clinical trials is problematic as the plant and its delivery 
system is unique and, therefore, it would be almost impossible to 
conduct blind trials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reservation is that the delivery system is not reliable 
from patient to patient as the dose received depends upon the 
delivery technique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern is that there is almost no independent quality 
research available, such as randomized control trials, to guide 
decision making on the appropriate and effective medical use of 
marijuana or the side effects and risks associated with its 
consumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that everyone in this House would agree with some of 
those concerns.  Basically, it boils down to the consistency of 
the product being used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from some members in this House as to whether or not it 
is really effective.  However, if it is working on some patients 
and not on others, it is probably not unlike any other drug. 
Different drugs have different effects on people because of the 
chemistry of the human body.  I think that is to be expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of it, probably from the patient's perspective, is what 
they believe.  It is like the individual who wears a copper 
bracelet for rheumatism or arthritis.  I guess if they believe 
that it works and they say that it works, it probably does work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a hotly debated topic.  I want to quote from the 
transcript of a program by Dr. David Suzuki.  I think most of us 
from time to time have watched— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that I 
must interrupt the member at this point.  However, I wish to tell 
him that the next time this bill comes before the House he will 
have approximately four minutes if he wishes to use that 
opportunity.

consent for the member to finish? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, the House is being very 
generous tonight and I appreciate it because we did start early. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Suzuki in his program was talking to his listening audience 
about marijuana and its use.  He was talking about a gentleman 
who had a sick son.  I want to put this on the record because it 
spells out pretty clearly the effects and how positive it can be 
when used for the right reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A gentleman by the name of Lester Grinspoon was speaking.  He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son who in 1967 was diagnosed as having acute lymphatic 
leukaemia, he was 10 years-old then.  By the time he reached the 
age of 13, was beginning to get some of the cancer 
chemotherapeutic substances which cause severe nausea and 
vomiting.  He would vomit for about eight hours or have the dry 
heaves for eight hours.  He would vomit in the car on the way 
home from the hospital and just lie in his room with his head 
over a bucket on the floor.

relatives and loved ones who were sick and receiving 
chemotherapy. It is not unusual for that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that he and his wife were at a dinner party 
and a doctor recommended the use of marijuana for this young boy. 
He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the way home from that dinner party my wife Betsy said 
“Well, maybe we should get some marijuana for Danny”.  I'm 
ashamed to say it, I said “No we can't do that.  It's against the 
law and we don't want to embarrass the people at the Children's 
Hospital who are taking such great care of Danny”.  His next 
chemotherapy was due a couple of weeks later and Betsy and Danny 
smoked in the parking lot outside of the Children's Hospital.  I 
couldn't believe what happened because not only did he not have 
any nausea but he even asked his mother “Could we get a 
submarine sandwich on the way home?”  And I then called 
Dr. Jaffy who was the doctor who was directly involved in Danny's 
care and said to him “Look”, I told him the story, I said “I'm 
not going to stand in the way of his using marijuana this time”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story goes on in quite a bit of detail.  Basically what it 
is saying is that it does work under controlled circumstances.  I 
believe that the House has to consider that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, going back to the very nature of this bill, we are 
talking about the word compassion.  In relation to other 
substances out there let us give it a try under controlled 
conditions, under doctor's orders.  If we could do that we would 
be prepared to support this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> from March 2: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government seems intent on “breaking the back” of 
its unions with “hardball” labour policies that have left rank 
and file public servants underpaid, demoralized and facing poor 
working conditions, says the chairman of the Senate finance 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Terrance Stratton, who headed the committee's year long 
investigation into the brain drain in the public service, warns 
that the government's hardline position on capping salary 
increases at two per cent a year will accelerate the flight of 
experienced talent to the private sector.  It does not help 
matters that, at the same time, senior executives [of the 
government] got raises of up to 20 per cent, plus bonuses. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gilles Paquet, director of the centre of governance at the 
University of Ottawa, stated that the committee's report 
underscores that the Liberal government has no agenda for its 
public service other than the one driven by the finance 
department to cut costs and save money:  “The government doesn't 
give me the feeling that it respects the public service.  It 
ended the notion of a career public servant and then turned 
around and asked them for more and more loyalty.  Give them less 
and less money and more and more work.  It just doesn't add up”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, no finer words have been spoken in such a long time when 
it comes to the issue of pay equity, regional rates of pay and 
the quality of life and work for our federal public service, 
especially the blue collar ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is regional rates of pay are discriminatory.  Just 
because you live in Halifax does not mean you should be paid less 
than if you live in Vancouver. Ninety-seven per cent of all 
public servants in this country, RCMP, military, members of 
parliament, all get paid the same base salary no matter where 
they live, whether it is Whitehorse, Inuvik, Vancouver or Sheet 
Harbour in Halifax. It does not matter, they get paid the same 
except when it comes to the lowest paid workers of the public 
service, the blue collar workers, the warehousemen, the 
electricians, the plumbers.  It is an absolutely discriminatory 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just does not fly for the Treasury Board president to say 
that it is because of provincial legislation and provincial 
responsibilities that he does not want to end regional rates of 
pay. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am aware that some hon. 
members wonder why the Government of Canada does not get rid of 
regional pay rates for its blue collar workers and simply pay the 
same scale nationally.  There are good reasons behind the present 
practice, some very good reasons to continue it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who know the history of the House know that regional rates 
were put in place in 1922.  In those days the Government of 
Canada recognized that wages paid to certain trades were 
determined by local and regional market realities, realities that 
have remained unchanged and realities the Government of Canada 
cannot ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that in 1962 the Glassco royal commission 
recommended regional rates be maintained as a compensation policy 
where markets are regional or local.  Thus in 1967 the government 
set forth its recommendation when it instituted collective 
bargaining processes within the federal civil service.  If we had 
decided to go with a uniform rate rather than a regional rate 
that reflected local realities what would have happened?  Quite 
simply we would have created local inequities in pay scale that 
would have engendered instability in local labour markets 
especially for private sector employers seeking to hire at rates 
that reflected the local market realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must all recognize that incomes vary from place to place as a 
function of cost of living and other factors.  I remind the 
member that representatives of the government and the unions are 
currently at the negotiating table.  We all hope for a positive 
outcome and we value the important work that all members of the 
public service provide to the people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
in February 1999 the advisory council on health infostructure 
presented its final report to the health minister entitled 
“Canada Health Infoway:  Paths to Better Health”.  Over the 
course of 18 months the 24 member advisory council met and worked 
with a number of collaborators, including the provinces, 
territories and other federal departments and various health 
stakeholders across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of its recommendations was the subject of a question I posed 
last week to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Health.  It has to do with report cards on our health system. One 
of the key recommendations was that the government support 
evaluative analyses and consensus building to develop yardsticks 
and fair measures of health care system performance and health 
status of Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These analyses would form a basis of report cards to the public 
that will improve the overall accountability of the health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to repeat the question I posed to the parliamentary 
secretary in French, as I tried to do in question period. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main recommendations in the final report of the 
advisory council on health infrastructure is the provision of a 
public report card so as to improve the general accountability 
of our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Government of Canada is responsible for health 
care standards, does the department support this recommendation 
and will it undertake discussions with the provinces and 
territories with the aim of implementing this method of 
accountability? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically Canadians value our health care system and they need 
this kind of information.  They need to know about how our health 
care system is performing.  They also need to know that the 
dollars that are invested in our health care system are being 
used widely in every province and in every territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised the question with the parliamentary secretary with a 
view to getting a little more information about how this would 
work, whether or not the government was supportive of it and 
whether or not there was more information she could give us on 
report cards on our health care system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I acknowledge the interest of 
the hon. member for Mississauga South and thank him.  Thirty-five 
seconds in question period does not allow for a full answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening I would like to tell the member that the advisory 
council's final report called the <I>Canada Health Infoway: Paths 
to Better Health</I> was presented to the Minister of Health and 
made public on February 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report contains a number of recommendations relating to the 
development of a Canada health infoway including protecting the 
privacy of health information, empowering the public, 
strengthening and integrating health care services, creating 
information resources and building an aboriginal health 
infrastucture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report presents an exciting, positive, future vision of a 
Canada's health infoway, a vision which the Minister of Health 
and the Government of Canada strongly endorse.  The 1999 budget 
provided the needed support toward actualizing the vision.  We 
have committed $328 million over three years for improving the 
gathering, sharing and analysis of information about health and 
Canada's health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advisory council acknowledges in its report that developing 
a Canada health infoway will require collaborative efforts with 
all stakeholders, particularly the provinces and the territories. 
In fact, the Canada health infoway is to be built on the 
foundation already being designed or implemented by provinces and 
territories.  Without their participation and support there can 
be no Canada health infoway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the Minister of Health has already initiated 
discussions with provincial and territorial counterparts to seek 
consensus on how they can move forward together in these 
directions and build on current collaborative efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said to all members of the House, we believe there needs to 
be greater accountability by all governments, not to each other 
but to Canadians, and the health infoway will help us to achieve 
that goal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, on November 30 I raised a concern about the 
apparent change in name of the health protection branch to the 
management of risks to health branch.  It is impossible to find 
in any official document from the Department of Health any 
reference any longer to the Health Protection Branch.  The HPB is 
out; MRH is in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question for all of us is does this mean anything. It would 
seem to me that it does mean something, using the old adage that 
if you change the name you change the game.  I believe that is 
what is actually happening with the government.  The health 
protection branch was supposed to be responsible for guarding 
public health:  the safety of the food we eat, the medicines we 
take and the toys our children play with.  These all depend on 
the investigative strength of this important arm of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something has gone terribly wrong.  The federal government has 
been closing labs.  We have the RCMP investigating in terms of 
blood and breast implants.  We have had scientists appear before 
the Senate committee expressing concerns about the approval 
process for bovine growth hormone.  More recently, we have had 
evidence of blood coming from prisons in the United States into 
this country without proper regulation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had the minister refuse to take action on scientific 
studies showing toxins in bags that contain blood products.  We 
have had as recently as today officials of the department 
promoting a risk management approach when it comes to organs and 
tissues.  I think we have a critical situation.  The whole way of 
doing business has changed under this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important question for all of us, the question that 
sets the tone for the entire safety process, has to do with the 
burden of proof.  Canada's health safety system has always 
required the makers of new or questionable products to prove that 
their products are safe before they are released to the public. 
The public has always been confident in the knowledge that long 
before they ate their roast, swallowed their pill or sprayed 
their lawn, the makers of those roasts, pills and sprays had to 
prove to someone that the product was safe.  Someone was looking 
out for their well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now under this government it is all changing.  The burden of 
proof will be on government regulators at HPB to prove that the 
products are harmful.  Our system has been successful because it 
was based solely and solidly on the precautionary principle. The 
government seems to be now sacrificing that for a corporate 
friendly system of risk management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This in our view is intolerable.  We will fight it at every 
opportunity.  Any risk is too high. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the mandate of the Health 
Protection Branch is to protect Canadians against current and 
emerging risks to health.  These risks come from prescription 
drugs, medical devices, consumer products, food and water 
contaminants, air pollution, radiation, chemical hazards, tobacco 
diseases, and natural and civil disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Risk management is a decision making process for dealing with 
health risks.  The health protection branch uses a formal method 
called a framework that lists all steps in the risk management 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the member what these steps include:  identifying 
and assessing risks; developing, analysing and choosing options 
for managing the risks; implementing the selected options; and 
monitoring and evaluating the results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach is used by provincial, territorial, national and 
international health organizations.  The risk management 
framework was adopted in 1993.  It has helped to ensure 
consistency and thoroughness in the way that risks are assessed 
and decisions are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also results in a more understandable and transparent 
process.  It promotes the use of best available scientific and 
technical information.  It clearly identifies roles and 
responsibilities.  It ensures that those who are affected by risk 
management decisions are properly consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health protection branch is one of the department's 
organizations that contributes to the management of risks to the 
health business line.  I would like to take this opportunity to 
reassure the member that the health protection branch has not 
been replaced by an entity called the management of risks to 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year the minister launched a process called 
transitions which includes improving the risk management 
framework for the 21st century.  At the present time this is a 
process of review.  It is open and transparent consultation which 
hopefully will lead to an era in the new millennium so that even 
the member will have confidence and stop saying such nasty things 
about the renewed health protection branch. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
