<BLOCKQUOTE>That, during the first thirty sitting days of the Second Session of the 
Thirty-fifth Parliament, whenever a Minister of the Crown, when proposing a 
motion for first reading of a bill states that the said bill is in the same form as a 
Government bill was at the time of prorogation of the First Session, and, 
whenever any Private Member, when proposing a motion for first reading of a 
public bill states that the said bill is in the same form as a private member's 
public bill that he or she introduced in the First Session, if the Speaker is 
satisfied that the said bill is in the same form as at prorogation, the said bill shall 
be deemed to have been considered and approved at all stages completed at the 
time of prorogation and shall stand, if necessary, on the Order Paper, or, as the 
case may be, referred to committee, at the same stage and under the same 
legislative procedural process at which it stood at the time of prorogation;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Provided that any evidence adduced by any committee with regard to any bill 
in the First Session of the Thirty-fifth Parliament that is affected by this Order 
shall be deemed to have been laid upon the Table, and, as the case may be, 
referred to the appropriate committee;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Provided that, if this Order is applied to any bill, the consideration of which 
had been completed in the House of Commons, but which was before the Senate 
at the time of prorogation, the said bill shall be deemed to have been introduced, 
completed at all stages and passed by the House of Commons in the present 
session; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, for the remainder of the calendar year 1996, Standing Order 81 shall be

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This motion is intended to provide a framework for the effective 
management of the business of the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="168"> 168 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our standing orders are designed to provide a framework for the 
normal operation of the House of Commons on an annual calendar 
without regard for the periodic disruptions of that calendar which 
may be caused by dissolutions, prorogations or emergency 
situations. Whenever that calendar has been interrupted and for 
whatever reason, the practice has been for the House to amend its 
standing orders or to pass a special order to deal with the situation 
in question.
<P>
	Therefore the government is placing before the House a motion 
for a special order to deal with the current situation. We are not 
proposing permanent amendments to the standing orders at this 
time. Instead we are proceeding in a manner which we view as 
being similar to but more constructive than that used in the past to 
deal with a situation that has occurred on a number of occasions 
previously and will no doubt recur many times in the future.
<P>
	For that reason there may appear to be similarities between some 
of the solutions we are putting forward in this motion and some of 
the actions of a previous government in a previous Parliament 
which some members on this side of the House as well as others 
criticized at the time. I submit there are fundamental differences 
between our proposals now and those put forward in 1991.
<P>
	On that occasion the government of the day dealt only with 
specified government bills at specified stages. There was no 
attempt to provide a system that would apply equally to private 
members' business as well as government bills and the motion 
attempted to reinstate a limited number of government bills only in 
one fell swoop. Of course this is not what is being done with this 
motion.
<P>
<B>(1005 )</B>
<P>
	If the procedure we are proposing for the special order operates 
effectively, the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs may want to recommend some permanent revisions to the 
standing orders along the lines of our proposed special order. Of 
course this is for the committee to consider.
<P>
	The rules governing the business of supply require that the main 
estimates, that is the spending proposals of the various departments 
and agencies, be tabled and referred to the several standing 
committees by March 1 and reported by May 31 in order to be 
passed before the summer adjournment. Also, in order to facilitate 
government operations in the first three months of the fiscal year, 
an interim supply bill is passed in March.
<P>
	With the opening of the new session, if this motion were not 
adopted, under the regular rules in our standing orders governing 
the opening of a new session, the standing committees of the House 
need not be organized before mid March at the earliest. This means 
that if the  normal procedure were followed, the time available to 
study the main estimates could quite properly be truncated, be cut 
by 20 per cent or more. In addition the normal rules, if this motion 
were not adopted, would require the tabling of the main estimates 
before the budget.
<P>
	The budget when presented could alter the fiscal needs of the 
government as initially reflected in the estimates. Therefore this 
would make the estimates a less reliable instrument for 
Parliament's scrutiny of government expenditure.
<P>
	It is therefore proposed in this motion that for the year 1996 
only, the supply cycle be altered to remove the referral deadline of 
March 1 and the report deadline of May 31 and to provide a new 
report deadline of June 21, the day the House adjourns for the 
summer.
<P>
	The House will be asked to give final approval to the main 
estimates in September or October rather than in June. This will 
replace the three weeks of what I might call dead committee time in 
March with three weeks of live committee time in June. In other 
words, the full period of time that would have been available to 
standing committees to study estimates would be restored to them 
through this motion. In order to facilitate this, in March the House 
will be asked for seven months rather than three months interim 
supply.
<P>
	Members will recognize that the government could well have 
ignored this situation. We could have presented the main estimates 
sometime this week before the budget and met the March 1 
deadline for their referral to the standing committees. Under the 
rules, even though these committees would not have been able to 
meet before the middle of March, they still would have been 
compelled to report the estimates to the House by May 31.
<P>
	The government does not view that as a desirable course at all. 
The work of standing committees on the expenditure process is an 
important element in our approach to the revitalization of 
Parliament. Therefore, we are not prepared to take advantage of a 
quirk in the rules to deprive members of upward of 20 per cent of 
the time normally allotted to this process.
<P>
	We believe that the proposed temporary supply calendar for 
1996 as set out in the motion now before the House will work to the 
advantage of members on all sides of the House and to the public at 
large.
<P>
	In a similar vein, we believe that the provision of a procedure for 
members to reinstate bills on which progress had been made in the 
previous session to the stages which they had reached at the time of 
prorogation should be viewed as a progressive and constructive 
step.
<P>
	It is important to note, as I have said on another occasion, an 
initiative in this regard was actually taken last autumn by the House 
leader of the Reform Party, the hon. member for Lethbridge. At 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="169"> 169 </A></B>
<P>
that time he put down a  notice of motion calling for private 
members' bills to be reinstated after a prorogation.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	When this motion was chosen as a votable item on the order of 
precedence, my colleague, the former parliamentary secretary to 
the House leader, the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, 
privately indicated to him the positive interest in his proposal and 
our likelihood therefore of offering an amendment to his motion 
that would treat all bills the same, government bills as well as 
private members' bills. It seemed to make sense. It seemed to be 
fair and reasonable. If it was sensible to reinstate private members' 
bills to where they had left off at the time of prorogation, it was 
equally sensible to do the same thing for government bills.
<P>
	Unfortunately, on the day the proposal of the Reform House 
leader was to be debated, the Reform House leader, the hon. 
member for Lethbridge, unexpectedly was not present in the 
House. As a result, under the rules his proposal disappeared from 
the Order Paper. In effect the government is now picking up the ball 
where the hon. member for Lethbridge had dropped it last fall.
<P>
	The motion we have put before the House does not deal with any 
specific bill. It may well be that some members, whether ministers 
or private members, have reasons for not reinstituting proceedings 
on their bills that were terminated by prorogation. We are therefore 
merely providing a procedure to apply equally to ministers and to 
private members.
<P>
	Under this procedure, bills on which valuable parliamentary 
time had been expended in the last session may be proceeded with 
in the new session without duplication of work and the resulting 
waste of both time and taxpayers' money. At the time of 
prorogation 15 government bills and 11 private members' bills had 
at least been advanced to committee but had not been given royal 
assent.
<P>
	There are ample precedents for the House of Commons deeming 
government bills from previous sessions to have been advanced in 
new sessions to the stages at which they had expired at prorogation. 
This has been done in the interest of not wasting parliamentarians' 
time. It has been done in the interest of not wasting the time of 
members of the public who otherwise would have to come back to 
committees to present their views and briefs all over again. It has 
been done in the interest of not wasting taxpayers' money by 
repeating exactly the same debate or committee hearings on 
exactly the same bill.
<P>
	What is unprecedented in our motion is that we are proposing to 
give private members exactly the same rights as ministers on this 
matter. Since taking office in November 1993, this government has 
acted to enhance the role of the private member especially with 
regard to private members' public bills.
<P>
	As far as supporters of this government have been concerned, 
every vote on a private member's public bill has been a 
non-whipped, that is, a free vote. It would not therefore be either 
equitable or consistent with its policy on private member's 
business for the government to seek authority from the House to 
reinstate its legislation without also asking the House to grant the 
same authority to private members. Consequently, for the first time 
in Canadian parliamentary history, private members' bills will be 
eligible in a new session to be reinstated to the point they had 
reached in a previous session.
<P>
	The proposal in this motion will apply only to bills from the last 
session in which the House and therefore the public had invested a 
significant amount of time, namely those bills on which the House 
had at least taken one more decision in addition to permitting first 
reading. This would be those bills that had at least been referred to 
committee, whether before or after second reading. Bills that had 
merely been introduced but not advanced any further in the last 
session do not represent any real investment of House time and 
may simply be reintroduced in the new session in the ordinary 
fashion.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	The procedure will work as follows. During the first 30 sitting 
days of the new session any minister or private member who 
introduces a bill precisely the same as a bill in the old session and 
which had at least been referred to a committee will have the right 
to request that the new bill be reinstated to the stage at which it had 
progressed at the time of prorogation.
<P>
	If the Speaker is satisfied that the bill is precisely in the same 
form, it shall be ordered reinstated at that stage. This procedure 
does not oblige a minister or a private member to reintroduce a bill. 
It merely gives them a new right to do so during a limited period at 
the beginning of the session.
<P>
	For the government's part, it has already decided to reintroduce a 
number of bills under this proposed regime. There will be some 
bills returned to the committee stage, some resumed at the report 
stage and some at third reading stage. At least two will, under this 
special procedure, be deemed by the House to have passed all 
stages in this session and be sent forthwith to the Senate where they 
were at the time of prorogation.
<P>
	Not every minister has reached a final conclusion on this matter, 
but the list will include Bill C-7 regarding controlled drugs and 
substances; Bills C-52, C-95 and C-96, reorganizing a number of 
departments; Bill C-78 respecting witness protection; Bill C-84 
respecting regulations; Bill C-88 respecting internal trade; Bill 
C-94 regarding fuel additives; Bill C-98 concerning oceans; Bill 
C-100 regarding financial institutions; Bill C-101 respecting 
transportation; Bill C-106 respecting the Law Reform 
Commission; Bill C-111 respecting employment insurance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="170"> 170 </A></B>
<P>
	This may not be an all inclusive list. Ministers as well as private 
members will have 30 sitting days to make their final decisions 
on restoration of bills.
<P>
	I cannot speak with authority on which private members will 
reintroduce their measures. At least four of my colleagues on this 
side of the House have been in communication with my office, 
demanding the action we are proposing. I hope it is not 
presumptuous of me to expect members on the other side to be 
equally committed to their own legislative proposals.
<P>
	One initiative actually came from the hon. member for 
Lethbridge. I am looking forward to his thoughts, which I hope will 
be positive, on our acceptance of what could be argued to have 
started with his own proposal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, I think this is a very good motion and I ask the House 
to support it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I commend the motion to the House and I ask for its early 
approval.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a great pleasure to rise today to speak to this motion 
and especially to present my arguments to someone like you, Mr. 
Speaker, who has a great deal of experience as both a lawyer and a 
member of this House. Moreover, you lived through that whole 
period in 1991 when members of this government were sitting on 
opposition benches and singing a very different tune.
<P>
	I think, Mr. Speaker, that it gave you an opportunity to assess the 
opposition's arguments to the government then in office and today I 
am sure that they will recognize some of what I will be saying 
regarding the first motion tabled by the government in this session.
<P>
	I can tell you that there is nothing reassuring in this motion for 
the opposition, and more particularly for Canadian democracy. 
They want us to support the kind of motion presented today as if it 
were a routine matter.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	According to the government House leader, this is a routine 
motion intended to provide a framework for effective management, 
as though Parliament did not already have a framework. I am going 
to show you that Parliament already has a framework, a tradition, 
which this government wants to bypass this morning by tabling this 
motion.
<P>
	This is an exceptional case. On February 2, 1996, the 
government decided to prorogue Parliament, with full knowledge 
of the facts, including the consequences of prorogation. Should this 
motion be adopted today, it will mark the end-and I am weighing 
my words carefully-of the value, principles and effect of 
prorogation in this Parliament.
<P>
	We should perhaps determine what prorogation means. What is 
the effect of prorogation? We as members of the House are used to 
this kind of language; we know what it means. Some people, 
however, may not know what prorogation means or how it can 
impact on Parliament.
<P>
	Since I do not want to quote myself, I will quote law experts, 
people with a great deal of experience in this area who have written 
at length on the subject. According to citation 235 in the sixth 
edition of Beauchesne:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The effect of a prorogation is at once to suspend all business until Parliament 
shall be summoned again. Not only are the sittings of Parliament at an end, but 
all proceedings pending at the time are quashed. Every bill must therefore be 
renewed after a prorogation, as if it were introduced for the first time.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As an effect of prorogation, it is rather important.
<P>
	In the fourth edition of his book, on pages 102 and 103 of the 
French version, Bourinot is even more explicit:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The legal effect of a prorogation is to conclude a session; by which all bills 
and other proceedings of a legislative character-in whatever state they are at 
the time, are entirely terminated, and must be commenced anew, in the next 
session, precisely as if they had never been begun.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is important. At page 137 of his 1993 book entitled <I>The 
House of Commons at Work</I>-you know, the reference material 
newly elected members are given to acquaint themselves with the 
operation of this House-your predecessor, the hon. John A. 
Fraser, whom you knew, says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Proroguing a session does not dissolve Parliament, but it does have a similar 
effect-</BLOCKQUOTE>
He is going very far.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-on the business before the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He then says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All current business is abandoned, committees cease their activities, and bills 
die.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As you can see, over the years, prorogation has always been 
construed this way. I will come back to 1991 later. For the moment, 
while Mr. Fraser had decided a certain way in 1991, he took a 
slightly different stance in his book, in 1993, and I will tell you why 
in a moment.
<P>
	Over the years, custom and tradition have shaped the meaning of 
``prorogation''. We have before us a government that claims to be 
respectful of the system and is trying, through this motion, to strip 
a parliamentary principle of any real meaning.
<P>
	This motion is unacceptable in that it disrespectfully 
circumvents the established legislative process and raises political 
interference to new heights.
<P>
	With this motion, proroguing a session would not mean anything 
any more, except a chance for the government to pay a visit to the 
other House, waking up a number of senators who are asleep-that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="171"> 171 </A></B>
<P>
is the bright  side-and spend the rest of the day enjoying a big 
bash at Rideau Hall, at the taxpayers' expense naturally.
<P>
	The government is trying to make us swallow a principle that is 
trend setting and unacceptable, under our current system.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	When one reads the motion, one realizes that, deny it as they 
may, it says exactly the same thing as the 1991 motion. Of course, 
this motion having been moved by the Liberals, it cannot be 
identical to the one put forward by the Conservatives. But it is 
identical. In fact, it is just worse.
<P>
	What does the government motion say? It says, in essence:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That-whenever a minister of the Crown, when proposing a motion for first 
reading of a bill states that the said bill is in the same form as a government bill 
at the time of prorogation of the first session-the said bill-shall stand, if 
necessary, on the Order Paper, or, as the case may be, referred to committee, at 
the same stage and under the same legislative procedural process at which it 
stood at the time of prorogation;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Basically, under this motion, while the government may have 
prorogued the session, there is no actual prorogation. ``We can do 
as we wish, we are in power. So let us go, we are the government''. 
But the Liberals are doing so in a way that they condemned when 
they sat on the other side of the House.
<P>
	If the government wanted to prorogue a session, it had to live 
with the consequences of its decision. It did not have to prorogue 
the House. Who calls a prorogation? The Prime Minister. He is the 
one who decides to prorogue the session or not. He does not have to 
do it. Why did he do it, knowing full well what the consequences 
would be? If there is a problem, as the government House leader 
said earlier in his speech when he stated that this motion seeks to 
bring a solution to a current problem, that problem was brought 
about by the Liberals. Must they now invoke their own turpitude to 
find a solution? I believe the Liberals are responsible for the 
situation that currently prevails in this House.
<P>
	I doubt that the legislative agenda for the first session was too 
heavy, since the issues that we discussed here led us to conclude 
that the government did not have much to propose. It kept putting 
off all the important legislation because Quebec was holding a 
referendum. The government did not want to displease anyone; 
consequently, it kept putting off the really important bills.
<P>
	The UI bill was controversial; consequently, the government had 
to manoeuvre carefully. It postponed introduction of that bill. The 
result is that the government prorogued Parliament when these bills 
had not yet been passed. Is that the opposition's fault? Is that the 
fault of our democratic system? No, it is the Liberals' fault. Why 
did they choose to go that route?
<P>
	If this government were serious and had a clear legislative 
vision, we would not be debating such a motion, because the 
government would have passed the bills that it deemed important, 
before deciding to prorogue Parliament. The government's way of 
doing things makes me wonder.
<P>
	Could it be that we have in front of us a government that does not 
know where it is going? I think we can rightly ask ourselves that 
question. Or could it be that we have in front of us a government 
that does not care at all about Parliament and would rather run the 
show-Mr. Speaker, I apologize for using that expression-like an 
autocrat? This is also a question that we can ask ourselves.
<P>
	Indeed, acting in this fashion and trying to use some procedural 
trick that one would expect on the TV show <i>Les Parlementeries</i>, 
so as to circumvent a clear and well established principle, can only 
be done by a government that rules and manages the country's 
business with arbitrary and absolute authority. The government 
claims to know what is best, and that is it. It often displays this 
attitude, as evidenced by this motion.
<P>
	I know that, in order to justify such undemocratic behaviour, the 
government will refer to a so-called precedent dating back to May 
29, 1991. I am getting to it now. The government will try to find 
differences between what was done in 1991 and what is being done 
now and it will say: ``We are not proceeding in the same way. We 
are much more open. It is much more transparent in this case''. We 
heard the government House leader earlier.
<P>
	But let me tell the House: there is no difference. Even if there is, 
the motion before us today is worse than the one tabled in 1991.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	It might be worthwhile reviewing what happened in 1991 for 
those who are not aware of the details. The motion tabled by the 
government of the time, the Mulroney Government, was to 
reinstate six bills that had died on the Order Paper as the result of 
prorogation.
<P>
	The government tabled a motion clearly indicating the bills it 
wanted reinstated, the stages they had reached and at what stages 
they wanted them to be after the motion was adopted.
<P>
	I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that you will recall that the Liberals were 
up in arms over this move by the Conservatives, accusing them of 
having committed just about every sin in the book, at least every 
one of the seven deadly sins, and stating that this motion 
represented a denial of the legislative process of this House. In that 
instance, however, six very specific bills were involved. The ones 
they wanted reinstated were listed specifically, whereas this time 
anybody can get up and say ``This bill is at the same stage as it was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="172"> 172 </A></B>
<P>
at the  end of the session'', and we start up where we left off, as if 
nothing has happened.
<P>
	I am going to refer to some portions of the speeches made by the 
Liberals of the time. I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that you will find this 
amusing, because it will bring back to you what those Liberals had 
to say on an identical motion.
<P>
	The hon. member for Cape Breton-East Richmond said: ``I 
contend that the motion is in principle unacceptable in that it seeks 
to circumvent, indeed to subvert, the normal legislative process of 
this House. In the past this kind of thing has been done only by 
unanimous consent. Now the government is seeking to establish an 
ominous precedent by attempting to force this procedure on the 
House. This is an offensive and dangerous departure from the 
practices of all parliamentary bodies and the Chair is, I believe in 
accordance with Beauchesne's citation 123.(1) and Standing Order 
1, required to refuse to put the motion because of its unprecedented 
violation of the checks and balances written into the rules 
governing the normal legislative process.''
<P>
	That speaker is now a government minister, and I am dying to 
hear what he has to say. I hope he will rise and say that what his 
government is doing makes no sense, because the procedure is the 
same as the one before us today.
<P>
	Another member who rises frequently in the House, or at least 
who rose frequently in the House, the member for Kingston and the 
Islands said: ``What is happening today is unprecedented in that the 
government is moving a motion under Government Orders for 
debate to reinstate bills in this session. I have searched precedents 
back to 1938 and did not find one where a motion of this kind was 
moved for debate. It was always agreed to by unanimous consent. 
Never before has a government moved to suspend the rules in 
effect and put bills back into their position at the time of 
prorogation of a session''.
<P>
	His comments become even more significant: ``If royal 
prerogative is to meaning anything, the prorogation ended those 
bills. They have to be reinstated in the usual course, but they ought 
to have been introduced and dealt with as new bills in this session. 
That is proper procedure in the absence of unanimous consent''.
<P>
	Further on, to really impress the Speaker at the conclusion of his 
speech he said: ``The government itself exercised its royal 
prerogative on May 13 to bring this session to an end on May 12. 
The publication has been made of the Governor General's 
proclamation declaring the session at an end. He started it again. It 
was the government's decision to do it. It cannot have it both ways 
and now bring one of these motions to trample on the rights of this 
House and in effect prevent us from debating these bills''.
<P>
	Further on, he said: ``The government wants to impose a new 
definition of democracy on Canadians, one of the greatest affronts
<P>
to the House in years. It is immoral for the government to introduce 
this motion. The government is short-circuiting the legislative 
process to consider five bills. This behaviour is reprehensible. The 
government knows it. He has not produced a single tittle of 
evidence to support this gross breach of our practice, and I suggest 
that it is totally inappropriate''.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	I hope that the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands will 
rise in this House to condemn what his government is doing with 
this motion. It is exactly the same thing. If it was unacceptable in 
1991, it is just as unacceptable in 1996. Are there two systems of 
justice, two ways of proceeding, one when you are in the 
opposition and one when you are in the government? Is this the 
Liberal way of doing things?
<P>
	Another good member, the hon. member for Halifax, said in 
1991: ``The government should be ashamed. We are wondering 
today why there was a prorogation''. I am also wondering today. 
``The House leader is presenting us this pernicious motion, and I 
emphasize the word-it is the hon. member for Halifax, and not I, 
who says it-in order to speed up the passage of five bills, in total 
disregard for the traditions of the House and the British 
parliamentary procedure and in disregard for the Canadian 
people''.
<P>
	I hope that the hon. member for Halifax will rise today to 
condemn the actions of her government. I hope she will be here to 
say: ``What you are doing makes no sense. I do not want to go back 
on what I said; what I thought was unacceptable in 1991 I find 
wrong in 1996''. I hope that she will rise to make that point.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saint-Léonard is another member who was 
in the opposition in 1991 and is in the government today. What was 
he saying regarding this motion? ``If the government really 
intended to examine these bills, it should have done it before the 
prorogation of the House and that should have been negotiated.'' 
You know, things that can be negotiated before proroguing the 
House.
<P>
	Did the government ask us anything to speed up things? No, it 
can do anything when in power. It can do anything. That at least is 
what I am led to conclude today.
<P>
	I see an hon. member, and I will come back to him, because he 
also made an excellent plea in 1991. Before I do that, I want to 
mention another member who is now a senator; he was then the

	After examining and analyzing the effects of prorogation, he 
quoted Beauchesne and other legal experts. He came to that 
conclusion after careful consideration. I will quote from his speech 
because it deserves to be read, even if it is a little long. I think 
people have a right to know what today's senator was saying when 
he was in opposition.
<P>
	He said this: ``I now oppose-being presented with this jumble 
of legislation, some of which we seriously oppose and some of 
which we have agreed to. I cannot understand why this 
government, these government bullies now want to impose their 
will on the House of Commons through force of numbers''.
<P>
	He went on to say once again: ``There are good arguments that 
the government has no business proceeding as it is doing and that it 
is contrary to parliamentary reform and all political decency''. He 
concluded by saying: ``I think that is bad management, bad policy 
and, in my opinion, unparliamentary''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ah, ah!
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Now we are getting to it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> I see that the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is here. I hope he will rise to 
denounce his government for the way it is proceeding. I am going 
to tell you what he said in 1991 when he was sitting on our side of 
the House. You are smiling, Mr. Speaker, because you can surely 
remember it.
<P>
	The hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell had 
carefully reviewed all the consequences of prorogation. He said he 
feared the kind of precedents such a motion would create, and what 
it would mean if the Speaker accepted the motion put forward by 
the Conservative government. He said he was afraid it could 
resuscitate any bill. I will even give you a specific quote from this 
great law expert. ``Finally, if this precedent is allowed to proceed, 
then what is next? I ask the question rhetorically. If one can 
resuscitate five bills with this motion, or four bills, what stops one 
from resuscitating all legislation from the past?'' He even waxed 
poetic. Indeed, what would keep the government from adopting 
another motion whereby all bills before the House are deemed to 
have reached third reading? ``What stops us from resuscitating a 
bill from 1977, saying that that particular bill has now reached third 
reading, and we are going to vote on it right now? As a matter of 
fact, we could actually pass a motion stating it has completed third 
reading debate''.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	If I interpret his words correctly-because he is so poetical at 
times that it is difficult to understand what he meant-had the 
government motion been ruled in order by the Speaker in 1991, the 
government could have done just about anything thereafter. It 
could have taken a bill  that died on the Order Paper in 1970, 
brought it back and considered that the bill was at third reading. 
``Hey, there. We have decided to pass this bill; we have a majority 
in this House''. That is what he meant.
<P>
	He went on to say, and this is really good: ``What we are in fact 
doing is amending completely the rules of the House by adopting 
this motion, were we to do so, or were this motion to be ruled in 
order''. For once, I must say that I agree with him. ``The 
implications of ruling this motion in order would be such that I fear 
we could render-if a government wanted to, and I am not saying it 
does-this House of Commons totally irrelevant and redundant. 
Render this House of Commons totally irrelevant and redundant? I 
hope this rings a bell. I hope that the hon. member will rise in this 
House and condemn his government's first motion, saying: 
``Listen, the government made a mistake. We cannot go back on 
our word. That is the position we took in 1991''. I do not know if 
certain members opposite have Alzheimer's disease, but they seem 
to have forgotten what they did in the past. I have many more 
quotes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Great. How interesting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> This is interesting, indeed, especially coming 
from the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, whom I quoted 
earlier and who, at the time, had risen to condemn the Conservative 
government's motion. I see that he is here and that is listening 
carefully to what I have to say. He is nodding that it is the case. He 
agrees with me. I hope that he will rise in this House and muster the 
courage to condemn his government and say: ``Look, we are 
making a mistake''. I hope he does that. I hope he has the decency 
to do so, because it is indeed a matter of decency.
<P>
	In 1991, the Liberals were right-yes, you heard me correctly, 
Mr. Speaker-to be infuriated by the process that the Conservative 
government was trying to impose in this House. The Liberals were 
convinced they were right in 1991, and they showed it very clearly 
to the Speaker. They pleaded their case on several occasions and 
they voted against the motion. Therefore, if they were right in 
1991, how can they now table a motion that is even worse than that 
of the Conservatives?
<P>
	Should this motion be adopted, it would have major 
repercussions on the traditions and practices of this House, but also 
on the democratic system as a whole, on the values that we 
Quebecers hold dear and on the values that you, as Canadians, hold 
dear, and on democracy. Such would be the consequences of 
adopting the Liberal motion now before us. Let us be clear. 
Political parties in this House cannot keep changing established 
practices, setting precedents and doing as they please just because 
they hold the majority, without jeopardizing democracy. They 
cannot always bend the rules. Nor should they try to get too much 
mileage out of some precedents. Speakers in this House may, at 
times, have made 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="174"> 174 </A></B>
<P>
mistakes. They may have given too wide an interpretation  of 
certain principles. This is not the way to make law and 
jurisprudence any better: it only generates anarchy in this House.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	The motion before us today is totally unacceptable in terms of its 
content, form and goal. Let me elaborate on each of these three 
points.
<P>
	By its very content, as I have already said, Motion No. 1, the first 
motion tabled by the government in this session, more or less gives 
ministers the discretion to rise anytime during the first 30 days of 
the second session of the 35th Parliament and say ``Now, this is 
such an important a bill that it must be reinstated exactly where it 
was in the previous session''. The motion the government would 
like to see adopted as the rule for this House confers unwholesome 
discretionary powers and is unacceptable.
<P>
	The same applies to its form. They have not even taken the 
trouble to go into any detail. I have just heard the government 
leader listing all of the bills that have died on the Order Paper 
which it would be important to reinstate this session. They cannot 
be so important as to eradicate all precedent in this House.
<P>
	Some, no doubt, are more important than others. Where does the 
government stand with respect to all those bills? What was it up to 
before prorogation if all those bills were so vital? I believe that the 
government ought to have shown good faith by making a selection, 
provided there is any good faith on the other side, but I doubt it. I 
was trying to comply with the rule of law which states that good 
faith is to be presumed. If so, I guess there are some four or five 
bills that are more important and it could have listed them. And 
even before that, it could have taken the precaution of seeing they 
were passed before prorogation. But, when one does not know 
where one is going- We will give the government the benefit of 
the doubt, but there are four or five bills that could have been 
specified and that was not done.
<P>
	The most important point is the objective of the motion, and that 
is unacceptable. The objective is to block democracy, and to block 
our growing opposition to certain of those bills. It is to block the 
opposition taxpayers are organizing against those bills. It is to push 
through their passage with undue haste. It is to thumb one's nose at 
tradition. It is to attempt to manipulate public opinion and, 
particularly, to deprive the members of this House of their right to 
make decisions on these bills.
<P>
	We knew that the government, and the Prime Minister in 
particular, had lost control. We knew that the Prime Minister had 
lost control of his cabinet, that we have evidence of daily. We knew 
he had even lost control over his own actions, and today this 
government wants us to be sucked into the same loss of control, 
because it has lost control over its legislative agenda through its 
own  fault. No, that will not do. The official opposition refuses to 
get on side with the government, refuses to support the 
government's intent to have this motion adopted.
<P>
	If we strip prorogation of its meaning and consequences, we pay 
a price. If, despite all, Mr. Speaker, you decide to allow the 
government motion and go along with this formula for avoiding the 
consequences of proroguing a session, I would like to propose an 
amendment to the government's Motion No. 1. I move, seconded 
by my colleague for Joliette:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding at the end of the first paragraph, after 
the word ``prorogation'', the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``except when a Member states on a point of order his of her opposition to the 
Bill whose reinstatement is being proposed, in which case first reading of the 
said Bill shall be moved and it shall be debated like any other new measure 
introduced in the House by the government''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	That is the amendment the official opposition proposes.
<P>
	In closing, I know that common sense, justice and parliamentary 
fairness will be reflected in your ruling.
<P>
	As I said at the start of the debate, if you believe in all good 
conscience that, by making a ruling that could, at first glance, go 
against the 1991 ruling on a similar motion, be aware that the 
Supreme Court of Canada in certain instances has felt the need to 
adjust things to the point of rendering inconsistent decisions.
<P>
	I think you have the power to do so as well, to make adjustments, 
to put the pieces of the puzzle back in the right place and to identify 
and clarify the customs and traditions of this House. I think you 
also have the right and the obligation to do so, because the 
government seems to have totally eliminated common sense and 
fairness from this House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I can tell the member and our colleagues 
that the amendment is in order. The hon. member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley has the floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a new member I had the expectation that 
when I came to the House with a new government things would be 
done a little differently from the previous government. It is 
interesting for me to see not only in this instance but in many others 
that the present Liberal government and the former Conservative 
government appear to be the very same thing.
<P>
	When the members on the government side sat in opposition 
they were very much against this type of motion. When my hon. 
colleague from Berthier-Montcalm read from the transcripts of 
<I>Hansard</I> in 1991 he quoted many of these members who were very 
opposed to this type of motion. It is very  interesting to see that 
with the transfer from opposition to government the Liberals have 
<P>

<B><A NAME="175"> 175 </A></B>
<P>
changed their stripes and are now the same as the Conservative 
government before them.
<P>
	I also find it very interesting that in the last session the 
government was debating issues that were almost irrelevant to the 
Canadian public. It was debating whether it should add MMT to 
gasoline and what the national horse of Canada should be.
<P>
	If this legislation the government wants to reinstate is so 
important, why were we not debating it last fall and last spring? 
This is the same government which last spring let important 
legislation sit for months and months after passing committee and 
second reading.
<P>
	This is the government that sat on legislation and tried to pass it 
in one week before summer recess. If the government felt its 
legislation was so important to reinstate it in this session, what was 
it doing last time other than sitting on its hands?
<P>
	The lack of serious legislation last session does not justify 
reinstating it in this session.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to know where all the new government legislation 
will come from to support the honourable things they will 
supposedly be doing under the new speech from the throne. When 
are we to get the new legislation to bring in all of these programs, 
policies and promises under the new speech from the throne? The 
government does not have any idea where it is going or how it will 
get there.
<P>
	The House leader for the government says we will treat Private 
Members' Business in the same way; we will be magnanimous and 
allow Private Members' Business to come forward and be 
reinstated as well.
<P>
	I am one of the individuals affected by Private Members' 
Business. I have Bill C-240 which is supported by hundreds of 
thousands of Canadians, along with Bill C-226 from the hon. 
member for York South-Weston. Canadians all across the country 
support those private members' bills. Let me tell government 
members, in case they do not know, those two private members' 
bills have been stuck in committee since December 1994. They 
have not been dealt with and there has been plenty of opportunity 
for the government in committee to deal with those private 
members' bills.
<P>
	To have the hon. House leader tell me he is being gracious in 
allowing my private members bill to be dumped into committee for 
another two years is certainly no encouragement.
<P>
	If the government is really serious about doing something for 
private members it would separate Private Members' Business 
from government legislation, stop controlling private members' 
legislation and allow it to go through in the manner it should. When 
private  members' bills are passed through the House of Commons 
at second reading they deserve to be heard equally with any 
government bill. I do not think any government should have control 
over private members' legislation and bury it to the extent it has.
<P>
	The government is actually showing contempt for Parliament in 
the way it has treated not only my private member's bill but my 
colleague's from across the way. These two pieces of legislation 
have the support of the Canadian public but the government does 
not have the courage to bring those bills to a vote. It is content to 
bury them in the committee where it does not have to face the 
Canadian public and stand up and either support these bills or vote 
against them and to be seen by the Canadian public to be voting 
against some very good legislation.
<P>
	The government tells me and my colleague that it will be 
gracious and allow our private members' bills to be buried in 
committee for another two years.
<P>
	I have had two chairmen of the justice committee assure me over 
the period of a year and a half that my private member's bill will be 
dealt with. I have witnesses who have waiting since December 
1994 to appear to speak to this bill. To have the government with 
two chairs of the justice committee making that assurance to me, I 
will have another chairman of the justice committee making that 
assurance.
<P>
	I would like to know whether it is three times lucky or three 
strikes and you are out. I would like to know if my private 
member's bill is reinstated whether it will be buried, whether the 
government will refuse to have the guts and the fortitude to be 
accountable for supporting legislation that will provide safety to 
Canadians, that will kept dangerous offenders off the street, that 
will keep convicted first degree murderers incarcerated for the 
period of time the courts deem appropriate.
<P>
	I would like to know whether government members have the 
courage to show the stripe they wear or whether they will simply be 
warmed up Conservatives for another two years. I hope that is not 
the case. I hope members on the other side will listen to some of the 
comments about how it is just rehashed Conservative government 
crap and do things a little differently.

The government whip when in opposition stated in <I>Hansard</I>:

increase, will add $600 million to the burden my constituents pay''.

providing a retirement income support system for  Canadians is one

across this country value the CPP and are counting on it for their 
future. In Alberta a recent poll indicates that 57 per cent of 
Albertans believe that the CPP is an important part of their 
retirement income, yet many I have spoken with are worried that 
the rising cost of CPP is placing their pensions at risk.
<P>
	We heard our Prime Minister commit this government to 
working with the provinces to preserve the fabric of our social 
programs, those very same programs that we as Canadians value as 
our social responsibility one to another no matter where we live in 
this country.
<P>
	The CPP belongs to Canadians and they deserve to have a say in 
its future. That is why our government will be consulting with 
Canadians in their own communities this spring about how we can 
sustain the CPP.

	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleagues will certainly be happy to learn that the financial help 
awarded by the Business Development Bank of Canada reached a 
record level in 1995. The loans granted by the Business 
Development Bank of Canada reached a total of almost one billion 
dollars and they helped support investments of $1.7 billion in 
businesses borrowing from the bank.
<P>
	The loans awarded by the Business Development Bank of 
Canada cost nothing to taxpayers and they lead to the creation of a 
great number of jobs. In 1995 alone, businesses borrowing from the 
bank employed 188,000 persons across Canada. Here is another 
proof that strategies put in place by our government to support 
small businesses are effective.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
January 24, we were stunned to learn that Mr. Tran Trieu Quan had 
been condemned to life imprisonment by Vietnamese authorities 
after a mock trial. How can the foreign affairs minister accept that 
this Canadian citizen, clearly the victim of a conspiracy, be held 
prisoner in Vietnam without any action on the part of the Canadian 
government to get him out of that plight?
<P>
	We have the right to ask ourselves today if the powerlessness and 
inertia of our government can be explained by its decision to put 
financial considerations before human rights. Instead of turning a 
blind eye to that situation, the foreign affairs minister should prove 
that Canadian citizenship still means something abroad by carrying 
out his fundamental duty, that is to protect the interests of 
Canadians everywhere in the world.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the throne speech the government shows a commitment 
to defending publicly funded health care in Canada. It recognizes 
that we are faced with increasing  costs and increasing demands, 
but it does not give a single constructive solution on how it is going 
to save this program. While the government politically postures 
over defending the Canada Health Act, people are dying while on 
waiting lists.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party are committed to ensuring that all 
Canadians regardless of their income are going to get their health 
care when they medically need it. We have the solutions and we are 
willing to share them with the government. I urge the government 
to take those suggestions and employ them for all Canadians across 
the country who want their medical care when they need it, not 
when the government says they need it.

the tremendous achievements of seven Canadian music artists at 
the American Grammy Awards this past Wednesday.
<P>
	1995 was obviously a good year for Canadian artists. They 
accumulated a total of 10 Grammys, making their presence felt in 
the music industry. Their success testifies to their incredible talent 
which has not gone unnoticed by North Americans.
<P>
	The big winner is Ottawa rocker Alanis Morissette with four 
awards. I am particularly proud of Shania Twain from Timmins 
who won best country album. Veteran folk singer Joni Mitchell 
took home two Grammys including best pop album. Rob 
McConnell took home a jazz Grammy. Charles Dutoit and the 
Montreal Symphony claimed a Grammy and Toronto composer 
Rob Bowman also left with one.
<P>
	I join with the House to congratulate all the Canadian winners on 
their success at the Grammys. Next week watch Canadian artists 
for similar success at the Junos.

<P>
	In January I initiated a national unity essay contest at all of the

ideas about how Canada could achieve long term national unity. I 
wanted to encourage our riding's youth to put their thoughts on 
paper and to commit themselves to working together with their 
peers to promote unity and pride in Canada.
<P>
	Our students' responses are a tribute to the sincerity and depth of 
these young people. I have received many terrific essays and ideas.
<P>
	Most encouraging of all is the strength of conviction I feel in 
these students' writings. They believe in their country. They 
believe in a united Canada from coast to coast to coast. They

track of the MP for Richmond who is the Secretary of State for the 
Asia-Pacific. Little did I expect however that in my role I would be 
asked by so many of his constituents to chide him for not 
representing their views in Ottawa. But since they have asked, why 
not?
<P>
	Recently the MP for Richmond was told in no uncertain terms at 
a town hall meeting that he should vote against the Liberal disunity 
package but he refused to listen. Instead of representing his 
constituents, he intentionally voted against them in this House.
<P>
	In the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> he was quoted as saying: ``Canada has to 
come first. B.C. comes second. And then the opinion of my 
constituents-comes third''. This is an elitist political code that 
really means: the party comes first, the Prime Minister comes 
second and the people come last. Shame on the MP for Richmond. 
He should ask Kim Campbell.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on Wednesday, the <I>Vancouver Sun</I> reported the words of 
one of the Prime Minister's principal advisers, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``We believe it is possible to act to avert another referendum''. 
``Quebecers are coming to realize all the disruption, tension and 
instability it will cause''. ``That was the beauty of the issue of 
partition''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Would the Deputy Prime Minister confirm the Prime Minister's 
adviser's statement that the government itself fanned the flame and 
willingly encouraged the separatist movement through its actions 
with the aim of intimidating the people of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I suspect that the Deputy Prime Minister may well not 
have read either the papers or the statements by her colleague, the 
Minister of Indian Affairs.
<P>
	In the light of the remarks by the Prime Minister's adviser, could 
the Deputy Prime Minister reassure the House and tell us that the 
federal government has no intention of using its powers of 
disallowance and reservation against a bill that would permit 
Quebec to attain sovereignty?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am surprised by the hon. 
member's criticism of our desire to work in partnership. We heard 
the premier of Quebec shortly after he was sworn in talk of working 
in partnership.
<P>
	Now, we have an opening offer on the table, and I hope the 
federal Leader of the Opposition will listen to the premier of 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we always have the feeling we are living on another planet 
when the Deputy Prime Minister responds to our questions. We did 
not criticize the desire to work in partnership. I will send you the 
question afterwards. There will be other questions on this very 
thing a bit later. You should listen to questions from time to time, 
perhaps we would get somewhat coherent answers. I realize this is 
asking a lot, Mr. Speaker.

<P>
	I will take it slower. Would the Deputy Prime Minister, the 
member for Hamilton East, seated over there, kindly tell us 
whether the government has shelved Stéphane Dion's plan B, 
among others, and will stop once and for all intimidating the 
people of Quebec by dubious means? Is that clear?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we support the remarks 
by the premier of Quebec about his willingness to set the issue of 
the referendum aside in order to work on Quebec's economy. We 
are following the advice of the premier of Quebec, because we on 
this side of the House want economic growth for Montreal, Quebec 
City and Canada.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. The 
heritage minister and her government are inviting Canadians to 
mark the 30th, 31st and 32nd anniversaries of the flag with 
exuberance and enthusiasm, since the ``One in a million'' flag 
campaign will last until next year. In the same breath, the heritage 
minister is inviting Canadians to celebrate Saint-Jean-Baptiste 
Day.
<P>
	How can the heritage minister invite Canadians to celebrate 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, when her own government and those of 
several English speaking provinces blithely flout the rights of 
francophones recognized in the Constitution and the Official 
Languages Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am merely following the 
advice of the Bloc's designated critic on official languages, who 
said that there was nothing wrong with celebrating 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day elsewhere.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since the Commissioner of Official Languages states that 
federal employment centres in Ontario effectively steer 
francophones toward courses taught in English, what is the heritage 
minister waiting for to denounce unequivocally this measure to 
assimilate francophones?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, when I suggested 
yesterday in reply to the throne speech that Saint-Jean-Baptiste 
Day should be celebrated across the country, it was precisely to 
recognize the fact that Saint John the Baptist is the patron saint of 
all French-Canadians. It is Quebec's national holiday as well as a 
day of celebration for all Canadians who want to understand and 
associate themselves with the French fact in our country.
<P>
	I invite the hon. member across the way to visit Hamilton in my 
riding on June 24 and I hope that she will do so, because I can 
assure her that, if the French community in my riding is celebrating 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day this year-as it has done for many 
years-it is precisely because we want to share in the pride of being 
French-Canadian here in this country.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, two days ago in 
the House the government promised that before we take on a Haiti 
mission it would ``get a better handle on costs'' because they could 
easily spiral out of control. Yesterday the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs bailed out the United Nations' mission with a blank cheque 
signed by the Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	The Canadian people would like to know how the government is 
going to control costs when there is no information on the mission? 
How is the minister going to control these costs, as was promised in 
the House, when we do not have a clear mandate or the costs? I 
would like the minister to tell us how this is going to be controlled.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as often happens, the Reform Party gets it wrong. The real 
importance of the decision that we took last night is that Canada 
has made a major contribution to secure democracy in Haiti, to 
ensure the United Nations is able to provide an effective 
international presence to support the people there and to ensure that 
once again Canada is able to exercise real leadership.
<P>
	As I said Wednesday night, and I believe the hon. member was in 
the House at that time, it was our initiative that broke the stalemate 
and allowed the United Nations security council late last night to 
take the decision that would allow us to go into Haiti with a 
supplementary force and therefore maintain the evolution toward 
democracy.
<P>
	I want to assure all members of the House that the commitment 
we are making is totally and completely within the budget 
reference levels of the Department of National Defence. There is 
no extra money beyond what we are asking. It is totally within the 
peacekeeping budget that the Government of Canada has set aside. 
We think that peacekeeping is a priority, unlike the hon. member 
opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Reform members 
are also concerned about democracy, the spreading of democracy 
and the people in Haiti. We also believe that peacekeeping is a 
valuable mission for Canadians and Canadians are behind it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="181"> 181 </A></B>
<P>
	However, there has to be a plan. How can the government know 
it is within the budget if it does not have a plan? In 1915 the 
Americans went into Haiti to develop democracy. They left 20 
years later and the infrastructure was not there. The infrastructure 
is not there now and yet we are going to build this infrastructure 
in four months and return democracy to this country.
<P>
	Does the UN or Canada have plans to bring about this miracle of 
rebuilding Haiti in a four-month period?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the critic for foreign affairs, the hon. member would be 
well advised to actually read what the plan is. The plan was tabled 
on February 14 by the Secretary-General where he set out on 
several pages the specific mandate for the extension of the United 
Nations force. That would enable the Haitian government that has 
gone through a very successful democratic election and now taken 
office to continue in the development of its own police forces with 
the backup and support of the international force to ensure that 
there is a proper stabilization during that period of time.
<P>
	I would be quite glad, at the request of the hon. member, to send 
him a copy of the Secretary-General's report to the council. That is 
the exact mandate that we are working on and the plan that we 
have. That is the kind of arrangement we have made with the UN.
<P>
	What is most important, because of the our intervention on 
behalf of Canadians and on behalf of everybody else, is that we 
were able to break a deadlock to ensure that the United Nations was 
able to continue its presence.
<P>
	From the debates last night, I would like to take one comment at 
random from the ambassador of the United Kingdom speaking to 
the security council. He said: ``We pay the warmest tribute to the 
Government of Canada for the lead it has taken in making the 
union's continuation possible. It is a source of great satisfaction to 
my delegation. The United Nations will now be able to continue its 
mission in this stabilization phase''. Due to Canada, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do have a copy 
of that UN document and have read it carefully. Basically we are 
going from 6,000 American troops holding the big stick to 2,000 
UN-Canadian troops now trying to deliver democracy. We have 
done the Americans a big favour because Mr. Clinton promised to 
be out of Haiti within or by the end of February.
<P>
	I would like to ask the foreign affairs minister why he will not go 
along with or use this favour in negotiating better conditions for 
Canadians and get them to not enforce the Helms-Burton bill as it 
relates to the many jobs that Canada may potentially lose?
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I really disagree with the fundamental premise of the hon. 
member's question.
<P>
	We are not doing the Americans a favour. We are contributing to 
the United Nations. We are contributing to the democratic 
development in Haiti. We are helping a poor country that was under 
a dictatorship for many years to regain the opportunity for its 
people to choose their own lives, to have economic development. 
That is what we are in there for, not to do people favours.
<P>
	Unlike the Reform critic for foreign affairs, I think that much 
more to the point is the comment made in debate on Wednesday 
night by his colleague, the member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek, when he said: ``Besides being in our national interest, there 
is a certain moral imperative for our continued presence in that 
unhappy country to preserve life and to provide humanitarian 
assistance''.
<P>
	That is the real spirit of what we have done. It was expressed by 
the member from Swift Current.

my question is for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	In the Liberal government's speech from the throne, only one 
short paragraph is devoted to personal security. There is one short 
sentence, at the very end of this paragraph, stating that: ``Criminal 
procedure will be reformed to better serve victims of crime''. No 
concrete measure was put forward regarding the security of 
individuals. There is no clear indication of genuine concern on the 
part of the government either. In a word, what we have here is 
seven or eight lines of lip service.
<P>
	What positive steps, if any, does the minister intend to take to 
better serve the victims of crime?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the question from my hon. friend.
<P>
	I will point to just two measures which will be very important in 
this regard. We are working on legislation to extend the legislation 
we passed in the last session regarding the use of DNA evidence. 
We are working on measures to have a national DNA data bank to 
make it more effective with respect to the use of such evidence.
<P>
	Together with the Minister of Justice, I intend to proceed with 
legislation to give the public more effective protection from high

risk violent offenders. I hope I will  have the support of my hon. 
friend and his party when these measures are presented to the 
House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
the same issue falling under the minister's responsibility, what 
possible courses of action is the minister contemplating to resolve 
the problem of prison overcrowding without jeopardizing at the 
same time the safety of the public?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again I thank my hon. friend for raising an important point.
<P>
	The answer to the question will be longer than is permitted in 
question period. We are working on measures in consultation with 
the provinces and territories which will have as a foundation the 
protection of the public, while at the same time focusing on high 
risk dangerous offenders and finding alternate means for those who 
are not in that category; thus ensuring protection of the public 
while saving taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Again, when we bring forward details, after we have consulted 
with the provinces and territories, I hope that we will have strong 
support from the hon. member and his party and all members of

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the Prime Minister finally admitted what Reformers have been 
saying all along. The government's role in job creation is to create 
the atmosphere or environment for the private sector to invest.
<P>
	This government has failed to deliver. Despite a $6 billion 
infrastructure program, 1.4 million Canadians are out of work, 
800,000 are part time employees. Despite reducing deficits, 
interests costs on the debt are rising faster than the spending cuts 
made by the government.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister tell Canadians why her 
government continues to support deficit spending, make work 
schemes, direct business subsidies and higher taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member makes the 
point that the government is still struggling to try to create a 
climate to foster employment. There is no doubt about that. It is not 
a problem that is peculiar to Canada.
<P>
	However, the hon. gentleman should admit that the government 
has come a long way in establishing the fundamentals that are 
required for the private sector to get into the business of job 
creation.
<P>
	Interest rates are at very low levels and comparable to those in 
the United States. We have inflation at 2 per cent or less. 
Unemployment is below 10 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I agree with the hon. gentleman. One way to correct one of the 
problems for which I am responsible, which is to take care of the 
unemployed, is to create jobs. Surely all of us can agree that the 
fundamentals are in place and that the private sector-I believe that 
the challenge the Prime Minister put to it is an appropriate 
one-are now in a position to get on with the business that business 
does best, creating jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
getting scary. This is the second person who agrees with 
Reformers. I kind of like this.
<P>
	The government promised to create jobs, not the business 
community. The government talks about security and chances for 
youth.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. If her government 
wants business to perform and create jobs, will she commit to have 
the finance minister promise no new taxes, or tax increases of any 
kind in the next budget which would be the best inducement for job 
creation, as all members know.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure in these last few days 
before the budget we are all trying to communicate our respective 
messages to the Minister of Finance. Being the kind of person who 
listens well, I am sure he will take it all into account.
<P>
	The hon. gentleman knows that the budget process requires that 
whatever is going to be announced in the budget be withheld until 
Wednesday afternoon, and we are all looking forward to that.
<P>
	As a point of clarification, I would like to point out to the hon. 
member that during the last election campaign when Liberals 
talked about jobs, we recognized then as we recognize now that 
what governments at all levels should be doing is creating the 
environment and the climate to allow the private sector to create 
jobs. We are wrestling with that. It is not an easy task. We 
understand the impact of payroll taxes. We understand the impact 
of debt financing and the rest of it. But governments at all levels 
across the country are trying. Some, I think, are succeeding more 
than others. But a sincere attempt is being made to create an 
environment that will allow the private sector to create jobs.
<P>
	Surely the hon. member would recognize that since I stood to 
answer the question, it would not be very appropriate for me to 
suggest that the government is creating jobs after what took place 
at Transport.

question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Haitian Canadians who have been trained by the RCMP could 
not be integrated into the national police force in Haiti, despite the 
commitments made by the Haitian government. Canada has spent 
nearly $2 million to train these police officers.
<P>
	At a time when Canada is striving to help the people of Haiti, 
will the minister tell us what he intends to do to ensure that these 
police officers can be integrated as planned into the Haitian 
national police force?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to thank the hon. member for 
acknowledging the very important contribution we have made in 
the training of Haitian nationals as well as Canadians of Haitian 
descent in the peacekeeping operation.
<P>
	At the present time the majority of those who have been trained 
have been incorporated into the new Haitian national police. There 
are still about 20 or 30 to be integrated. As I understand it, there 
was a problem because of the transfer of power between the two 
different administrations. Now that we have confirmed the 
extension of the international UN activity in Haiti, we will be able 
to continue to work with the Haitian government to ensure the 
integration of all those who received proper training to help 
stabilize the situation in that country.

minister assure us that Canada's contribution will not be 
overlooked by the Haitian government, and could he tell us what 
benefit he plans to derive from the money invested in the training 
of these police officers pending their integration into the Haitian 
police force?

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one of the major initiatives of the continuing UN mandate 
is to continue the training, both in institutions and on the ground of 
the new Haitian police force.
<P>
	I want to pay tribute to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who 
have provided over 100 officers to Haiti. Chief Superintendent 
Pouliot has been the head of that operation since the beginning and 
has provided along with the French a continued involvement and 
participation.
<P>
	I will certainly take the member's representation to ensure that 
those who have been trained here in Canada will have full access 
and opportunity in the Haitian police force.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 25, 1992 Canada admitted Lee 
Chau-Ping and her family into Canada as investor immigrants. 
Unfortunately Lee was not the hardworking businesswoman the 
department of immigration thought she was; rather, she is the most 
notorious female drug trafficker in the world.
<P>
	Can the parliamentary secretary of immigration explain how this 
woman was able to immigrate to Canada despite the fact she had 
been under investigation by the royal Hong Kong police since 
1986?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this person 
arrived in Canada under the administration of the former 
government, which is important because we have changed.
<P>
	At issue here is the effectiveness of the security checks 
conducted when this person made her application for permanent 
residence. The Immigration Act gives us the authority to take 
removal action against a person if they falsified, lied or 
misinterpreted any material fact on their application for permanent 
residence.
<P>
	Bill C-44 also takes away the right of appeal of permanent 
residents who have been convicted of serious offences. The 
business immigration program is undergoing an extensive review. 
These changes will make the program less open to abuse. Bill C-44 
will also deal with that issue.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently this issue has come up. It is not an 
isolated instance; it is still happening. A Hong Kong crown 
prosecutor stated: ``Canadian immigration is very much a laughing 
stock of criminals, and Canada is being used by criminals such as 
drug traffickers as a soft spot for entry of drugs into North America 
and as an exit point for the laundering of funds''.
<P>
	Is this the type of open for business reputation the government is 
trying to promote worldwide?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand 
the member opposite voted against Bill C-44, a bill which helps.
<P>
	The government recognizes the safety of the Canadian public is 
of paramount importance. However, studies have shown that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="184"> 184 </A></B>
<P>
foreign born individuals represent a  significantly lower number in 
our prison system compared with Canadian born individuals.
<P>
	We have in place effective mechanisms, one of which the hon. 
member voted against, to identify the small percentage of those 
who try to abuse the system. The joint RCMP-immigration task 
force will become a permanent partnership. Bill C-44 strengthens 
the Immigration Act, not weakens it.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister responsible for the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. In his speech from the 
throne, the Governor General described as a conciliatory measure 
the federal government's withdrawal from the social housing 
sector. This is just nonsense of course, since, in its last budget, the 
government had already put a stop to any new initiative regarding 
social housing.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the government is about to propose to 
Quebec a partnership in an area that does not come under its 
jurisdiction, in which it does not invest any money, but regarding 
which it intends to maintain national standards that are ill-suited to 
Quebec's needs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are about to start 
working with the provinces to ensure better management in these 
areas.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary. Will the minister admit that 
this apparent will to decentralize is only a budgetary scheme 
designed to offload onto the provinces, with no financial 
compensation, the responsibility for 1.2 million Canadian 
households desperately in need of social housing units?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as we said on many 
occasions, the idea is to make good use of the money available. If 
we can do that in co-operation with the provinces, we will do so. I 
am surprised that the hon. member, who is from Quebec, would be 
opposed to what we are doing and will continue to do.

have not been consulted by the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, and there are many concerns. They are deeply worried 
about their future,  the future of their families and the future of 
their coastal communities.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans what he is doing to 
resolve the concerns of these fishermen and ensure they will have 
an opportunity to be listened to and have a strong voice in the 
management of the fishery in the future.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question and for the 
manner in which he and his colleagues have represented fishermen 
and their concerns.
<P>
	I am aware of these concerns. The emphasis up to now has been 
on the occupation of DFO offices. I want to de-emphasize that 
because I am aware there are many fishermen who are not 
occupying offices, who are interested in speaking, talking and 
discussing the issues of concern. They have indicated their 
eagerness to do this to me.
<P>
	To that end and as a result of meeting with members of 
Parliament last night I have instructed my officials over this 
weekend to contact those people who are occupying the offices to 
give them the opportunity to join the discussions that will take 
place early next week with those fishermen who share the same

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
earlier this week my constituents held victims' rights rallies in 
Nanaimo and Duncan, B.C. Last night a rally was held in 
Abbotsford, B.C. with over 2,000 people.
<P>
	The reason for these rallies is that Canadians do not feel safe in 
their homes or on the streets. They feel the system has been stacked 
in favour of the criminals and they are demanding their rights be 
respected for a change.
<P>
	When will the Minister of Justice start defending the rights of 
victims of crime?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the throne speech in its reference to 
our continued commitment to ensure the criminal justice system 
safeguards the rights of victims is simply additional evidence of the 
government's continuing commitment in that regard.
<P>
	Over the last two years the House of Commons has seen, has 
debated and has enacted more constructive changes to the criminal 
justice system than in any period in the last 20 years. The 
government has shown that commitment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the answer, like the throne speech, is more  rhetoric without real 
commitment. The people of Abbotsford, like the people across

Canada, are looking for a specific, a victims' bill of rights. Would 
the minister support such a bill?

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is only the most recent 
occasion on which representatives of the party opposite have 
sought to cloak themselves in the cause of victims.
<P>
	The record discloses that when the Canadian people come to 
assess which party spoke for victims in the House they will decide 
it was the government.
<P>
	For the first time in the history of the justice system the 
government through Bill C-37 introduced victim impact statements 
in the Young Offenders Act. What happened? The Reform Party 
voted against that bill.
<P>
	This party with Bill C-41 strengthened enormously the rights of 
victims to restitution. What happened? The Reform Party voted 
against it. This party for the first time changed section 745 to 
provide for the rights of victims to participate in the hearings. What 
happened? The Reform Party voted against it.
<P>
	When victims groups, mothers and fathers of victims, came to 
Ottawa, brothers and sisters of those shot to death in crime, arguing 
for gun control, what happened? The Reform Party voted against 
that bill.

	Two years ago, the Liberal government pledged to take 
immediate action, and I emphasize the word ``immediate'', to 
improve the lot of the Innu living in Davis Inlet, notably by 
relocating the community in a healthier location.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Indian Affairs tell us when his government 
will make a decision on the relocation of that community, which 
continues to live in conditions comparable to that of third world 
countries, as witnessed last week by the hon. member for 
Saint-Jean?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member. I thought 
the Bloc had forgotten about me.
<P>
	I consider Davis Inlet one of the success stories of the 
government. I went in there, unlike the Bloc. I went to  Atlantic 
Canada five time. I went to the community once. I met with the 
leadership in Ottawa several times. I met with it in Halifax several 
times. We provided a package of almost $80 million of federal 
funds for that community.
<P>
	We have done 35 consultative reports with those people. We are 
working on their education facilities and we are building houses. 
We are not building houses for them; we are working with them. 
They are building their own houses and they are getting trained. We 
are working in the health facilities.
<P>
	Unlike what happened under the former government, this was 
not only a local story or a provincial story, it was an international

is for the justice minister. I am glad to see he has moved to the front 
bench, closer to the Reform Party. At least I can see the whites of 
his eyes now. Of course, the converse of that is true.
<P>
	The information I have is that licensing by firearm owners will 
not begin until January 1, 1997, a one-year delay. The registration 
of long guns will not begin until January 1, 1999, another one-year 
delay.
<P>
	Is this true? Are these two key components of his gun legislation 
to be delayed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I first speak to geography. I 
assure my hon. colleague that my move was lateral and that the gulf 
that separates us remains just as wide.
<P>
	On the subject of timing, when the firearms legislation was 
tabled in February 1995, which now seems like a very long time 
ago, our projection was for licensing to begin on January 1, 1996.
<P>
	Through the very skilful and elaborate means my hon. colleague 
used in his vain attempt to impede and defeat  the legislation, much 
time was taken in the parliamentary process. It was not until 
December 1995 that the legislation obtained royal assent.
<P>
	Naturally the hon. member would want us to take all the time 
necessary in order to produce a user friendly, efficient and effective 
system of registration and licensing in order to be fair to the 
firearm owners of Canada. That is what we intend to do.

are easy and reliable to use for firearms owners, and when we are 
certain they will achieve the many worthwhile objectives for which 
they are intended.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I first 
came to the House I used to respect the statesman like manner with 
which the justice minister answered questions head on, but he has 
learned to dance and juggle like the rest of them over there.
<P>
	This party and I had nothing whatever to do with determining the 
timetable of Bill C-68. The government invoked closure in the 
House, set the timetable in the standing committee and invoked 
closure on third reading.
<P>
	If the justice minister claims lives are being lost in the absence 
of licensing and registration, if he truly believes this, why the 
deliberate delay?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the licensing and registration 
systems are being designed with the help of a users committee 
comprised of police officers, police chiefs, farmers, hunters, 
aboriginal persons, gun collectors.
<P>
	We are putting this system together in a way that will work 
properly for Canadians. We will take the time required to do that 
and get it right.
<P>
	This legislation was not given royal assent until December of 
1995. That is a simple fact. The registration and the licensing 
systems will be brought on stream when they are ready and not a

<P>
<HR>

post-secondary education. However, the government has  gutted 
this program by ripping out over $7 billion in transfer payments.

<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister: How is this government going 
to pay for these summer student jobs, short of mortgaging the 
future of this country's students?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am dismayed that the hon. 
gentleman would raise the spectre of gutting post-secondary 
education in this country as a result of the actions of the federal 
government.
<P>
	The hon. member knows that the student community, having 
heard the news that the Government of Canada is doubling the 
amount of money thereby doubling the number of jobs that will be 
available next summer, knows this is a very good news story. I 
believe it is something that young people across the country were 
looking forward to.
<P>
	To suggest in the same breath that Canada, compared to 
practically any other nation in the world, and the Canadian 
taxpayers are not shouldering their burden in terms of making a 
contribution to post-secondary education in this country is to say 
the least very misleading. Canada's educational system at the 
post-secondary level in terms of funding is at the top of the list on 
any criteria.
<P>
	Any increase in tuition is very difficult for students and we 
recognize that. One of the ways we have attempted to try to allow 
young people to cope with that is by confirming early in the game, 
in the throne speech and the Prime Minister's speech, that this 
summer young people can look forward to twice as many job 
opportunities as a direct result of the actions of the Government of 
Canada. At the same time we are challenging the private sector and

<P>
	In recent town hall meetings discussing the proposed changes to 
the UI system there has been a lot of wrong information and 
misunderstanding. Could the minister tell this House exactly how 
the intensity rule of the proposed employment insurance system 
will affect claimants with an existing history of repeat use?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources

deep concern, which is shared by many people across the country, 
with respect to the legislation that is going to be brought back 
before the House and considered by committee as it relates to the 
intensity rule.
<P>
	Perhaps the safest thing for me to say at this point is that we 
recognize in the existing legislation the need to go back and 
recognize that people who have been out of the employment 
insurance scheme for a few years, who have been unable to find 
work and who have had to resort to welfare or whatever, have a 
legitimate right to have access to training programs and so forth. 
We will recognize past history back three years and will try to find 
ways to include them in whatever new process is determined upon.
<P>
	I would think that all of us are looking forward to next week 
when hon. members on both sides of the House from all parties will 
again be asked to sit on the committee that will consider the 
legislation that is going to reform the employment insurance 
situation in this country.
<P>
	We will together, as a result of the very massive consultation that 
has gone on over the past few months, address the question of 
continuous weeks of work and the question of the intensity rule. I 
have no doubt, having been made aware of the goodwill that exists 
in this House and the questions that have been brought forward by

	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-211, an act to amend the Access to 
Information Act.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to inform the House that the 
member for Calgary Centre is not here to second the bill, but the 
hon. member for Swift Current-Maple Creek will.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to present my private member's bill, an act to 
amend the Access to Information Act. This will bring the Canadian 
Wheat Board under the jurisdiction of the Access to Information 
Act.
<P>
	Privacy Commissioner John Grace appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Justice in 1986. At that time the committee reviewed 
the operation of the act and recommended that it be expanded to 
include all crown agencies.
<P>
	The committee felt that the exemptions contained in the law 
provided protection from potential competitive harm. The Wheat 
Board has no legitimate claims that it would suffer competitive 
harm.
<P>
	Western farmers will support this change of the act very strongly 
and I hope that the House will also.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it gives me pleasure to rise in this House

Wheat Board Act audit.
<P>
	Currently the auditor general does not have the authority to audit 
the Canadian Wheat Board. Over the years the auditor general has 
provided a valuable service to Canadians by pointing out waste in 
federal government as well as showing where Canadians have 
received value for their money.

	This change to the act would not only provide for more trust but 
would also make the wheat board more accountable and acceptable 
to producers.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I believe the hon. member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley has 13 minutes left in her 
intervention from before question period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member would 
have liked to finish her remarks but at this moment she cannot be in

<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was rising to speak. The 
representative of the third party has spoken.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The whip is quite correct. We rotate on 
matters. No member from the Liberal Party indicated they wished 
to speak. I should have recognized the hon. whip from the 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to take part in today's debate on the motion 
put forward by the hon. Government House Leader.
<P>
	The motion by the hon. Government House Leader is very 
innovative. True, it proposes a system that is rather new but not 
unprecedented.
<P>
	First, I must indicate that a little earlier today one of our friends 
from the Bloc Quebecois mentioned that in 1991, some 
parliamentarians objected, and rightly so according to him, to an 
initiative by the last government to reinstate bills that had died on 
the Order Paper in a previous session of Parliament.
<P>
	As we know, several hon. members then rose and accused the 
Conservative government of discrimination. The Conservative 
government wanted to reinstate only some of its legislation by 
means of a single motion and denied the same privilege to other 
members of the House.
<P>
	As you well know, in spite of our grievances those of us who had 
protested lost their cause nonetheless on most of the issues raised. 
Although we believed our argument to be well-founded, we lost. 
The Speaker made a ruling and, naturally, the bills were reinstated 
although in a slightly different form than what the government 
expected. What are we trying to do today?
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	We want to do something completely different. First of all, the 
motion before the House is not discriminatory. It allows all 
members of Parliament, ministers, secretaries of state, private 
members on the government side as well  as those of the opposition 
to reintroduce their bills at the stage they where at the end of the 
last session.
<P>
	Personally, I first heard about that innovative idea not from a 
government member or a minister, but from the hon. member from 
Lethbridge himself.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Lethbridge moved Motion M-476: ``That, 
in the opinion of this House, all private members' bills that have 
passed second reading in the first session of the 35th Parliament 
and which are presently at committee, report stage or third reading 
stage should stand for the second session of the 35th Parliament''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Lethbridge is an experienced 
parliamentarian not only here but in another legislature, a person 
who has undoubtedly a lot of knowledge about things 
parliamentary. He proposed this motion. Given that the hon. 
member for Lethbridge is the House leader for his party, I am sure 
he was speaking on behalf of his party. He must have been. After 
all, he is the boss of that party, he is the House leader.
<P>
	The boss of the Reform Party wanted to reinstate all private 
members' bills. Hold that thought for a minute. We on our side of 
the House, being non-partisan and congenial as we are, had one of 
our colleagues, the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, 
approach on our behalf the hon. member for Lethbridge. We told 
him it is such a good idea to revive private members' bills from the 
opposition. Given that we are non-discriminatory and congenial, as 
I said, we said let us apply it to all bills in the House.
<P>
	Mysteriously on the day the initiative was to have been debated 
the hon. member for Lethbridge did not debate the item in question. 
I cannot refer to presence or absence. That would be 
unparliamentary, but if I could I would. Shall I say he was unable to 
debate the issue in question.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It was withdrawn.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> How was it that he was not available to debate it 
or, as the member across said, deliberately withdraw it?. That is 
even worse after having proposed it, given that he was the boss of 
his party and speaking on behalf of his party.
<P>
	I do not understand all of these things, but then again I do not 
have a Reform mindset and maybe that is why. I cannot think like a 
Reformer and hopefully I never will.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Now, the Reform members' boss wanted to reintroduce private 
members bills, those from opposition members as well as those 
from government members, even though, traditionally, private 
members bills are mainly an instrument used by the opposition to 
advocate certain measures. We liked the idea and we wanted to 
apply it to bills from opposition as well as government  members 
using the very formula proposed by the hon. member from 
Lethbridge, that is that a bill that was merely introduced in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="191"> 191 </A></B>
<P>
House would not automatically be reactivated. Likewise, a bill that 
was before the Senate would not automatically be reinstated. But 
bills that were still before the House and had passed second reading 
could be, under this formula.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us remember the other point. This is enabling and it does not 
in itself cause the bill to be reactivated. In other words, if I had a 
private member's bill, which I do not as the whip, presently before 
a committee, if the government had already dealt with the issue and 
solved the problem, which the government so often does, and if I 
felt my private member's bill was now redundant, it would not be 
automatically reinstated. In other words, it simply enables a 
member who feels his or her private member's bill is still important 
enough to merely cause it to go back to the point it was at prior to 
prorogation.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	This is remarkable because it mirrors what the boss of the 
Reform Party, the hon. member for Lethbridge, was asking us to 
do.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He is not the boss.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> An hon. member across says his House leader is 
not his boss. That may be so. I will not tell the Reform Party House 
leader that one of his colleagues said the House leader was not his 
boss. I will keep it a secret among us. We shall not mention it to the 
hon. member for Lethbridge. We would not want to have the hon. 
member for Lethbridge all upset at some of his colleagues who 
have said in the House today that he is not the boss.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> We do not believe in top down like you guys.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I wonder if the member for Elk Island does not 
think the whip is the boss. Anyway, I will let Reform members 
discuss their caucus disagreements. It seems there is a lot of 
disagreement if they do not think anyone is running the show.
<P>
	Let me go back to the motion proposed by the House leader for 
the government which I believe to be quite innovative. One of the 
important things about this motion is that it saves a lot of money to 
the taxpayers of Canada. I suppose if a bill had been terminated at 
second reading the economies are somewhat smaller, although they 
are there as well because there is sometimes quite a step to reach 
that level.
<P>
	Nevertheless, for a bill or another initiative that has gone to 
committee and which has received the input of Canadians from all 
across the country testifying either here or elsewhere in Canada, for 
the people who have submitted briefs and so on, there are 
economies in not repeating the exercise a second time on an 
identical piece of legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Groups who have already made representations, who have 
already submitted briefs to parliamentarians, would not have to 
repeat the whole process a second time for a bill that is identical to 
the one that was considered during the previous session.
<P>
	To protect parliamentarians, the motion states clearly that the 
bill has to be identical to the one from the previous session, as 
verified by the office of the clerk of the House of Commons, 
otherwise this new condition would not be applicable.
<P>
	You can see the validity and the objectivity of this whole 
exercise. I am sure members opposite could find it in their hearts to 
support such an initiative.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This has been the subject of consultation among political parties 
in the House. I cannot discuss the details of the consultation 
because that is not normally done when consultation is between 
House leaders. However, I can say that consultation between the 
House leadership teams, leaders, whips and so on, of each political 
party has taken place. People were contacted. The substance of 
what was there was described to the officials of political parties 
across the way. Therefore consultation had taken place previously.
<P>
	For those who say or pretend this has been brought on at the last 
minute, it is not so. It does not reflect reality.
<P>
	The <I>Hill Times</I> of February 26 had a long story on this. It has 
been known for days through that medium, through the 
consultation that we had and so on. Consultation has taken place. 
Only bills that are identical to those-
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Are you sure?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Oh, yes, I am quite sure. I can even give the exact 
time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Were members of all parties present?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Yes. The hon. member from Calgary wants to 
verify that we contacted all parties to inform them of this motion. 
Indeed we had. I contacted someone from each party personally 
and revealed the contents of the motion. I can discuss privately the 
name of the MP that I consulted if the people opposite want to 
know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> We read about it in the <I>Hill Times</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The hon. member said they read about it in the 
<I>Hill Times</I>. Believe me, Mr. Speaker, the consultations between 
officials of parties were held long before that.
<P>
	If the member from Calgary has been led to believe differently, 
that is not true. Consultations were held.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="192"> 192 </A></B>
<P>
	The first criteria is that only bills that are the same as those 
presented in the last Parliament qualify. Only bills that went 
beyond second reading qualify.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Moreover only bills from both sides of the House qualify for this 
fast tracking system that we have established.
<P>
	Finally, what we are in fact proposing is an initiative that was 
first presented to the House by an opposition member, namely the 
boss of the Reform members, the member for Lethbridge.
<P>
	So, as you can see, Mr. Speaker, our government is open to 
initiatives coming from the other side of the House since we are 
willing to accept and maybe improve on a suggestion made by 
someone on the other side. We are using this initiative that came 
originally from an opposition member, after making some 
improvements to it.
<P>
	It is non discriminatory, it applies to everybody and it is not at all 
what the Conservative Party proposed. They wanted to reinstate all 
at once eight of their bills, I think, only government bills, only the 
ones they wanted, etc.
<P>
	In this motion, it is optional. The motion offers a mechanism for 
reinstating bills, which have to be reinstated one by one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us look at some of the bills that would qualify because they 
were not completed in the last session of Parliament. I do not know 
which minister, which backbench MP on the government side, 
which opposition member will wish to reactivate any of these bills. 
These are examples. For instance, there is Bill C-7, the controlled 
drug and substances act, an act to repeal the Narcotic Control Act 
and parts of the Food and Drugs Act.
<P>
	It has been the subject of a lot of debate. Why would we want to 
repeat all of that? Why not save the taxpayers' money and pick up 
where we left off?
<P>
	Bill C-101, the national transportation agency bill, was 
completed at the committee level. A lot of work was done there. 
Bill C-94 is an important bill with regard to interprovincial trade. 
Also I believe there is a bill with regard to the use of ethanol as a 
fuel additive. That is a very important issue. As a rural member 
representing an electoral district where ethanol is produced I want 
to see that bill proceeded with as soon as possible.
<P>
	Let us look at some of the private members' bills. The 
opposition is telling us: ``Don't proceed with this accelerated 
mechanism''. Here is what they do not want us to do.
<P>
	A Reform MP proposes that we amend the Elections Act with 
regard to political parties. Seemingly the Reform Party is going to 
vote against accelerating this bill  and bringing it to committee. 
The member from Mississauga proposed Bill C-337 in the last 
session, an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act. That was already 
in committee as well. What about the bill regarding intervener 
funding proposed by the member for Oxford?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Quebec has also introduced a very 
important bill dealing with genital mutilation of female persons, 
which is unfortunately practiced, in somes cases, in Canada. This is 
an important issue. The debate in this House was completed and the 
bill referred to a committee. Why would anyone wish to delay our 
work on such bills?
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A Reform MP from British Columbia who spoke earlier this 
morning against this innovation would be unable, if her party-it 
depends when we refer to her party because her boss some months 
ago wanted to do precisely this-by its statements today, would 
prevent us from proceeding with further consideration of her bill, 
an act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Releases Act and 
the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Another member from the Reform Party has a bill regarding an 
amendment to the Divorce Act granting access and custody to 
grandparents. Why would they not want to proceed with that? Why 
would they not want to proceed with the bills that they initiated? 
That is all the motion of the government proposes. I have some 
difficulty in understanding why the Reform Party does not want us 
to go ahead with some of these.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The same thing applies to the members of the Bloc. I know that 
they will probably want to go on with the work Parliament has 
already started on several issues. I am sure those hon.é members 
will want that work to go ahead.
<P>
	As the House knows, we will proceed. The Minister of Labour 
has proposed a motion today to allow us to proceed without further 
delay with this motion.
<P>
	I invite all hon. members of this House to do what the 
government House leader and the House leader of the Reform Party 
asked us to do some time ago, although it seems the latter has had 
time to resonsider his position. Of course, this surprises us. 
Nevertheless the initiative proposed by the hon. member for 
Lethbridge was an excellent idea and it still is. This is why we 
intend, on this side of the House, to adopt this measure. We have 
improved it. We invite all members to vote in favor of the proposal 
made today in this House by the government House leader.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is rather strange to listen to what the member has to say 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="193"> 193 </A></B>
<P>
now that he is on the government  side. All the same, his approach 
is a little better, in the sense that he uses new words.
<P>
	He talks about innovation, discrimination, savings and backlogs. 
It is strange because in the speech he made in 1991-I was reading 
it as he was talking-he never spoke of innovation. He never spoke 
of discrimination. If discrimination was one of his primary 
arguments in 1991, he should have mentioned it then. But no, it is 
nowhere to be seen. The clincher he made at the time was that it 
went against tradition, that we never had proceeded this way, that it 
was unparliamentary. That is what he was saying then.
<P>
	He raised all sorts of extremely important questions. Now that he 
is a member of the government, he no longer raises them. He has 
changed his tune. Such an about-face on such a fundamental 
question as prorogation is dreadful.
<P>
	He talked about savings. If the government had negotiated with 
the official opposition, there would have been unanimous consent 
regarding some bills. We would have agreed to keep some bills on 
the Order Paper for consideration during this session. But we 
would not have agreed to keep bills like the one on unemployment 
insurance. We want a new bill. Canadians are protesting. This bill 
does not please them. But the government does not care, it is 
washing its hands of the whole mess, and everything is thrown in 
together and presented to Canadians. Hey, we are the government, 
we are in power.
<P>
	That is why we are against this motion.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	It is impossible to proceed this way under the current system.
<P>
	I conclude with a question that the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell asked the Conservative government 
in 1991, in identical circumstances. Perhaps he will say the 
circumstances were not the same. The difference is that the motion 
was brought in by a Conservative member at that time whereas now 
it is being put forward by the Liberals. But, basically, it is exactly 
the same thing.
<P>
	I ask the member to answer the same question he asked the 
government in 1991, that is: ``If the motion is accepted in its 
present wording-I ask question rhetorically-if one can 
resuscitate five bills with this motion, or four bills, what stops one 
from resuscitating all legislation from the past?''
<P>
	If the government can resuscitate all the bills from the previous 
session, what will prevent it from going further, if it wishes so, and 
reinstating bills which died on the Order Paper in previous 
Parliaments? What prevents it from deciding that today is the third 
reading for such and such a bill, and that this is so because it holds 
a majority of seats? What would stop the government from acting 
in that way?
<P>
	In the end, does the motion they want to us to agree to today in 
the House of Commons not simply cancel any effect of 
prorogation, of Royal Assent and of the whole tradition of the 
House? I
<P>
would like to hear what the member has to say on these critical 
questions, to see just how far he is willing to go in making a fool of 
himself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the questions of the hon. 
member for Berthier-Montcalm. First, he asked about the bills. 
He says that they would have been willing to reinstate the bills they 
like, but not those we like.
<P>
	This is faulty logic, as you will understand. I assume that, by 
extension, the member means that only the bills he introduced 
should be allowed to be reinstated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> By extension, that is what it means. Mr. Speaker, 
as you said yourself, this does not make sense.
<P>
	Second, the member reminded me of what I said some time ago, 
in 1991, during a previous Parliament, when I sat on the other 
side-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> In a previous life.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Not in a previous life, but at a time when I am 
supposed to have said: ``If one can resuscitate several bills with one 
motion, what stops the governement from resuscitating others?''
<P>
	In fact, this question is rather important, since in itself the 
motion we introduced does not reinstate bills. It provides a means 
for reinstating bills from both sides of the House at the stages they 
were at in the same Parliament.
<P>
	The difference is, of course, that the other proposal, the previous 
government's, applied exclusively to certain government bills, not 
to all the bills, not even all the government bills, and further 
provided that consideration of the bills would be resumed at the 
stage they were at. These are three significant differences.
<P>
	Third, I would remind you that, in spite of what I said in 1991, I 
lost the argument.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell made a statement that I 
want to clarify and put on the record because it is very serious.
<P>
	The government House leader did not contact our House leader 
or the assistant to our House leader, the member for Lethbridge, on 
this issue. We saw it for the first time on the Order Paper. I just 
want to let the member know that is why we are quite upset about 
the timing.
<P>
	In addition, the usual custom is that when the House is 
prorogued, as a courtesy, the government consults with opposition 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="194"> 194 </A></B>
<P>
parties about the deputy speakers. That was  not done either. There 
are a lot of things this government is just trying to bully through.
<P>
	The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell was concerned 
and tried to sell the motion that a private member's bill is the same 
as a government bill. That is not the case. He wants to know why 
we support reinstating private members' bills but not government 
bills. They are trying to use the motion of the hon. member for 
Lethbridge as a bargaining chip. They are trying to use Private 
Members' Business as a trade off, a quid pro quo. We cannot accept 
such a deal, especially when all the members opposite when in 
opposition so vehemently argued against what the Conservatives 
were doing, which is the same thing this government is doing.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member asked what was the difference between Private 
Members' Business and reinstating government business and I 
would like to answer that and then he can comment after that. 
Private members cannot set the agenda. They have no control over 
the business of the House. They are at the mercy of the process 
which takes a great deal of time and makes it extremely difficult to 
see their bills past.
<P>
	In the last session 165 members' bills were introduced and only 
two were past into law. They need a helping hand. On government 
business the government controls the legislative agenda. It can 
summon bills for debate for whatever reason, whenever and 
however it wants. If the government wants to pass a bill it can do 
so. There is nothing we can do about it. It can place it on the Order 
Paper day after day. It can invoke time allocation or closure. It can 
steamroll it through a committee. If a bill has not passed it is 
because the government chose not to pass it, and it chose not to 
pass a whole bunch of bills in the last session.
<P>
	Bill C-7 was on the Order Paper for over two years. Rather than 
call it for debate the government held take note debates and 
adjourned early. Now it wants the opposition to bail it out and 
reinstate it.
<P>
	The government has the control over government bills. Private 
members do not have that control. That is the difference. There are 
some good private members' bills that were pulled and which 
should be reinstated, but those are private members' bills, not 
government bills.
<P>
	What is the purpose of prorogation? The hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands said it best when in opposition. He 
pointed out what is happening today is unprecedented in that the 
government is moving a motion under Government Orders for 
debate to reinstate bills in this session. He searched precedents 
back to 1938 and did not find one where a motion of this kind was 
moved for debate. It was always agreed to by unanimous consent.
<P>
	Never before has the government moved to suspend the rules in 
effect and put bills back into their position at the time of 
prorogation of a session. If royal prerogative is to mean anything, 
the prorogation ended those government bills. They have to be 
reinstated in the usual course but they ought to have been 
introduced and dealt with as new bills in this session. This is the 
proper procedure in the absence of unanimous consent.
<P>
	Now why are these two members, the member for Kingston and 
the Islands and the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
both of whom know the standing orders and the rules and so 
vehemently opposed what they are now proposing when they are in 
opposition, contradicting themselves and why do they not see the 
difference between private members' bills and government bills? 
Why are they persisting in playing this game instead of getting on 
with the business of the new legislation, of the new throne speech 
and of the new vision for Canada that this party is supposed to 
have?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not know if I would make mincemeat like that out of 
the proposal given to us by the hon. member for Lethbridge, the 
boss of the hon. member who has just spoken. After all, I thought 
the suggestion by the hon. member for Lethbridge was quite 
reasonable.
<P>
	I contacted the hon. member for Mercier and the hon. member 
for Lethbridge personally. I could later today rise on a point of 
order if the House so desires and indicate the precise date and time, 
which I have logged in my office, that the conversations took place.
<P>
	The hon. member across says it was okay to reactivate the 
private members' bills but not the government bills because some 
of the private members' bills were good. This is his argument. 
Some of the government, I would even say all government bills, 
and all private members' bills on this side of the House are good, 
not just some of them like the members across the way say.
<P>
	After all, as the people of Canada's newest province sometimes 
say, what is good in Goose Bay is good in Gander.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government motion we are debating now is very 
special. This week, the government focused largely on the throne 
speech, saying that it signalled a new beginning for this 
government, which would now adopt a new approach based on jobs 
in various sectors.
<P>
	At the same time, the government presents a motion which will 
guarantee business as usual and allow the reinstating of old bills. 
The government is acting like those who make resolutions on New 
Year's day and break them the day after. We have a hard time 
understanding that, especially since it goes against parliamentary 
tradition.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="195"> 195 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	It is a well-known principle, and I feel it is important to mention 
this for Canadians who are listening, that prorogation of the House 
is a political decision which means we start all over, and that all 
bills die on the Order Paper. In this way, we make sure that all new 
government positions are different from past ones. For the sake of 
efficiency, we can exceptionally reinstate bills, normally those that 
have been favourably received in the House.
<P>
	In this case, the government is upsetting the rules. It is 
establishing the principle that anything can be brought back, at any 
time, and that, whether there is a throne speech or not, the situation 
we had in the previous session can being carried over into the new 
one.
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of citizens and hon. members 
to the fact that, by proposing this motion, by using this approach, 
the government is really telling us: ``When we bring back Bill 
C-111 on unemployment insurance, it will be business as usual''. 
Yet, during the previous session, the government was told in all the 
Liberal ridings in the Maritimes, in all the ridings in Eastern 
Quebec, that the unemployment insurance reform, as introduced, 
was not acceptable.
<P>
	If the government has the right to reinstate Bill C-111 without 
any changes, arguing that it is for the sake of continuity, why did it 
prorogue? Why did we decide to put an end to current business? 
Was it to let the Governor General have a good party where those 
who so desired could go? Was it only for the sake of decorum? It is 
rather puzzling.
<P>
	Moreover, it is the wrong message to send to the people, because 
it seems to indicate that we did not listen to them. In my own riding 
I had meetings with groups of employees and citizens, sometime 
50, 75 or 150, on the question of unemployment insurance. 
Whether in Saint-Pascal, Pohénégamook, La Pocatière, 
Saint-André de Kamouraska, Rivière-du-Loup or elsewhere, 
people told us: ``The government has to go back to the drawing 
board''. The motion that the government tabled would allow it to 
ignore this message from the people, and this is unacceptable.
<P>
	I could give you another example: Bill C-96, which establishes 
the Department of Human Resources. It has given rise to a major 
dispute between Quebec and Canada. This bill would allow the 
Government of Canada to interfere in all the areas concerning 
manpower training. It flies in the face of the whole debate on 
decentralization of manpower training.
<P>
	Why does the government insist on saying that it wants to bring 
back a bill like this one, with a simple majority, and that the 
minister, anytime he sees fit in his political strategy, could bring 
this bill back? I think that this is contrary to parliamentary rules, to 
the very nature of the  speech from the throne, and to the obligation 
the government has to introduce new policy thrusts.
<P>
	If the government can come back with bills of a similar nature, it 
should have the courage to start the debate all over again and to 
steer the legislation through all the stages.
<P>
	All the more so because, in the case of the unemployment 
insurance bill, in December, the government avoided the debate on 
second reading and referred the bill to the committee immediately, 
under the pretence that there was an urgent need. The government's 
strategy is very clear: it wants to try to bring back the bill in 
committee without a debate on second reading, because I am sure 
that several Liberal members from the Maritimes would have a lot 
to say about this bill if it were reinstated in second reading as it 
stood last fall.
<P>
	In fact, the government is trying to avoid taking into account 
what its own members want, which is something I find 
unacceptable.
<P>
	It is often said that the opposition opposes measures for the sake 
of it, because of the nature of its responsibilities. I would like to 
mention two bills that the opposition could have agreed to 
reinstate. They are Bill C-66 on grain transportation and Bill C-78 
on witness protection, that were dealt with in the last session.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Why was there no consultation between the government and the 
opposition parties, as is traditional in Parliament, to find a common 
ground on bills that could be reinstated? For instance, we certainly 
would have been in favour of reinstating the bill to prevent 
excision, which was introduced by the hon. member for Quebec. 
We are certainly in favour of that and I think we could find that 
there is unanimous consent in the House on that subject.
<P>
	There are the two bills that I just mentioned, Bill C-66 on grain 
transportation and Bill C-78 on witness protection. We could have 
done the same thing with these two bills and, at the same time, the 
government could have brought in the bills that had been received 
favourably in the House. It was very clear from the outset that there 
was no way we would accept to reinstate a bill such as the one on 
unemployment insurance reform, but perhaps some agreements 
could have been reached.
<P>
	I am thinking, in particular, of Bill C-68 on the reform of 
electoral boundaries, about which the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine and Bloc Quebecois members 
from eastern Quebec ridings were in agreement and made 
representations at all stages to be able to protect the five existing 
ridings in eastern Quebec. That is a bill that perhaps we would have 
been able to agree on, with the consent of the Senate, so that it 
could be brought back here and we could deal with it without 
ending up where we are now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="196"> 196 </A></B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, there was no such consultation. The government 
prefers to hide behind the fact that it would have the advantage 
of bringing the bill back at any time, at the minister's request. I 
think the government has made a very bad choice.
<P>
	Now, let us turn to the amendment the Bloc Quebecois has 
moved. This amendment would let members respect the privilege 
of every other member in this House by giving notice of their 
refusal to allow a bill to be reinstated when the minister asks for 
leave to introduce his bill. In this way we would be sure that there 
would be a minimum of respect for members' responsibilities. It 
would be a mark of a very great respect for democracy and it would 
conform to the true meaning of prorogation of a session.
<P>
	The new throne speech having set out a different vision on most 
things, it is imperative that members ascertain that the new 
legislation reflects this throne speech and that this throne speech is 
not only old formulas under a new guise, which very clearly seems 
to be the case, given the government motion.
<P>
	The government should have more courage and say to us: ``Yes, 
among bills we have brought forward in the past, there are four or 
five that we absolutely want to have passed, so we will bring back 
them to this House''. We could even debate the motions. It would 
be more democratic than the present approach, whereby the 
government to reinstate by the back door bills that had not been 
received favourably by the House.
<P>
	Once more I come back to the unemployment insurance bill. You 
know, we listened to what Canadians and Quebecers said last fall, 
during the holiday season and in January, and we could take the 
opportunity offered by the fact that we have a new Minister of 
Human Resources Development to take note of certain things, to 
notice that the government measure has one very important 
element missing, that is an active policy on employment. The 
previous bill singled out seasonal workers, and prevented young 
Canadians from being eligible for unemployment insurance in 
order to save about $2 billion per year in an unemployment 
insurance program funded entirely by employees and employers. 
That was what Bill C-111 did.
<P>
	If the government gets its way and manages to bring back this 
bill directly at committee stage, without any debate in the House, it 
will be an admission that it has no intention of correcting it. The 
government will be admitting that it did not listen to what 
Canadians had to say, and that it is still going to try to push all its 
cuts through and to continue in the same direction that was 
condemned everywhere across the country and even more so in the 
Maritimes.
<P>
	Let me give you another example, Bill C-96. In this case, the 
government is really saying: ``Business as usual''.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	While the federal government is trying for instance to negotiate 
an agreement on manpower training with the Quebec government, 
although Bill C-96 was denounced in the past as not respecting 
areas of jurisdiction, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, in his negotiations with Quebec, would certainly 
have a much stronger negotiation tool if he would say: ``Yes, we 
realize that our Bill C-96 did not really respect current areas of 
jurisdiction and what we want for the future in Canada: that the 
federal government be responsible for some things and that it be 
made clear; that provincial governments be responsible for other 
things and that be made clear, and that in the future we not have 
spheres of activity where the two governments get involved and try 
to have the biggest poster or the biggest Canada flag on 
advertisements''.
<P>
	When we see statements like the ones made by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, who says that every time the 
Government of Canada will be spending money, we must ensure 
that there will be a federal government identification to make sure 
people will know where the money is coming from, it is very clear 
that there is no logic between Bill C-96, the new image that the 
federal government wants to project of its willingness to negotiate 
in good faith with the governments, and these statements saying 
that the federal government will make sure that its investment is 
visible everywhere.
<P>
	There is a major contradiction there and, instead of trying to 
sneak bills by us, the government should have the courage to make 
a list, to table it and to tell us: ``These bills will come back because 
we think they are essential and the House will decide if the 
proposition is relevant''.
<P>
	The present debate is also a major precedent in the evolution of 
the parliamentary process. In that regard, I think we would better 
go back to the basic principle of British parliamentary government.
<P>
	Earlier, my hon. colleague quoted excepts from Beauchesne that 
clearly show how important the basis for proroguing sessions is, 
because this has always been a rather basic decision for a 
government to make. This means that the government's intention 
when proroguing a session to start a new one is to change its 
agenda, change its outlook on things, introduce new bills. This 
sends a message to the public about the government's new 
approach, as well as that of the opposition, and serve as a basis to 
assess the relevance of its actions.
<P>
	Now, this clarity would be lost. By allowing any bill from the 
previous session to be brought back at any time, we are not giving 
the people the chance to pass judgement on the government's 
actions. I think this will have a major impact in the years to come, 
on future Parliaments and on the kind of relationship the people 
will have with their representatives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="197"> 197 </A></B>
<P>
	It is complicating matters, providing information that is not as 
clear as the information provided in the past. This certainly is not 
the way to go to ensure the well-being of Quebecers and 
Canadians.
<P>
	To conclude my presentation on this subject, I would like to say 
that the government seems to want to enjoy all the benefits of 
prorogation without the drawbacks. They have changed the 
wrapping. They have packaged differently what they are trying to 
sell, but the product itself has not changed. The same old toys have 
been tossed into the box; only the wrapping has changed. And the 
person opening this box is expected to shout: ``Oh, this is great, all 
new, really different''.
<P>
	But that is not the message being conveyed, not at all. The 
message people are receiving is that old bills, bills that came under 
much criticism, that did not go through quickly in the House, that 
never made it past consideration in committee because of some 
snag, will be given a second life totally artificially.
<P>
	Under the motion, as moved, any outstanding bill could be 
brought back before this House. This seems unacceptable to me, 
and definitely not in keeping with what is expected from a 
Parliament like the one in which we are sitting.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The government must review its actions in several respects. It 
must make proposals that are in line with the throne speech. It must 
tell us what ``social union'' means and what the impact of its new 
policies will be. Above all, its bills must be consistent with that 
because, according to what we have heard so far, the Canada social 
transfer will be a general fund that the provinces will be free to 
manage at they see fit.
<P>
	The throne speech shows a different approach. It refers to a 
guaranteed minimum level of financing for each province. These 
elements directly contradict legislation such as Bill C-96. We 
would then be debating old bills in accordance with the 
government's new approach. The first thing we as opposition must 
say is that we should no longer be debating these bills since they 
are not in line with the government's proposed policy.
<P>
	We feel this is unacceptable and hope that the government will 
agree to our proposed amendment, which would allow a minister to 
bring back any bill, but members of the House would have an 
opportunity to explain why they object to it. This would make 
Parliament more effective, which is something that people 
everywhere are asking us. I hope Parliament will follow our 
suggestion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé: </B>Mr. Speaker, I had a question, but I will let the hon. 
member for-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Everybody knows that if an hon. member 
from a political party objecting to the speech  wishes to ask a 
question or make a comment, generally, the Chair recognizes that 
other party. Does the hon. member wish to put a question?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has the floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup has 
made a very interesting point on this motion. He would like to be 
selective in what he brings back to the House. This motion does not 
have selectivity in the sense that we can bring in one and leave out 
the other. It is all inclusive.
<P>
	The opportunity lies in the motion that every government bill, if 
the minister so chooses, and every private members' bill can come 
before the House.
<P>
	I believe we were all elected in 1993, including the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, to bring forward efficient, 
progressive legislation.
<P>
	I would like the member for elaborate a little further on why he 
would consider selectivity of government business in the motion 
not to be part of the process of moving forward for a more efficient 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for a question 
that will enable me to elaborate on how we see things.
<P>
	Usually, when Parliament prorogues, all the bills die on the 
Order Paper and the government must come up with a new 
legislative agenda. That is the very reason for proroguing.
<P>
	We accept that view, but we propose that only as an exception 
should a number of bills, over which the government and the 
opposition parties would agree, be maintained. The government 
should do some consulting, rather than trying to forcefully bring 
back all the bills. Let us look at a list of bills from the last session. 
Which ones does the government want to bring back? Which ones 
does the official opposition want to bring back? Which ones does 
the third party want to bring back? Let us make a list of all the bills 
for which there is a consensus.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	If the government absolutely wants to bring back a piece of 
legislation for which there is no consensus, it should come before 
the House and say: ``We are asking the House to take this bill back 
under consideration''. Then a debate would take place. The UI bill 
is an excellent example. If we agreed that Bill C-111 should be 
brought back before the House, it would be much more democratic, 
much more elegant for the government to table a proposal to the 
effect that it wishes that Bill C-111 be maintained, even if this may 
involve a few  amendments. Then the House would debate the 
relevance of such a proposal. In this way, Quebecers and Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="198"> 198 </A></B>
<P>
would see very clearly who, between the government and the 
opposition, takes into account the opinions expressed through 
consultations, as well as the mood prevailing across the country.
<P>
	We are not asking that the opposition be the one to decide. 
However, there has to be some kind of an agreement on that issue. 
Right now, the government is acting like someone who wants to 
buy a new car, while also wanting to keep the best things from the 
old one. This is not logical. There is no continuity in the 
government's action. The government should take into account the 
logic in these arguments. It should at least accept the amendment 
tabled by the Bloc, or the idea of some agreement or negotiation 
between the parties regarding a list of bills from the previous 
session. It should not adopt the view that all the bills should be 
brought back. That would defeat the purpose of proroguing, while 
also significantly reducing the importance of the speech from the 
throne. And if the speech from the throne becomes meaningless 
because all the bills from the previous session can simply be 
brought back, the government itself will have drastically reduced 
the impact of its new agenda.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
the kind of debate that I think causes the public to scratch their 
heads and wonder a little about what we do here.
<P>
	I am interested in the remarks of the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup because for the last two years he 
and I worked together on the unemployment bill. We travelled 
across the country. We heard from hundreds and thousands of 
people through the mails, through surveys sent out and through 
personal representations on that bill.
<P>
	We spent hundreds of hours looking at each clause and debating 
the provisions of that bill. We spent millions of dollars. If I 
understand what he is saying it is that we should be allowed, 
because of a technicality, to throw out all that work and start over.
<P>
	How does he justify passing off all that expense and all that 
time?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is indeed using a very 
good example. Let us look, for instance, at the Unemployment 
Insurance Act. People asked us to vote against the bill as tabled. 
Thousands of people sent postcards to the Leader of the 
Opposition. Probably over 20,000, 25,000 or even 30,000 asked us 
to vote down the bill. Today's debate is not useless as far as my 
fellow citizens are concerned, because they have asked me to do 
everything I could to see to it that this bill dies on the Order Paper 
and that the government takes its  responsibilities and introduces 
another bill more in line with the real needs of Quebecers and 
Canadians.
<P>
	This is why I do not have any qualms about turning a debate on 
what seems like a procedural issue, which it is not, into a debate on 
a substantive issue.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne, the government said that the 
unemployment insurance reform would be based on the same fiscal 
parameters which applied before. In other words, it stated that it 
would stick to its philosophy on this issue. This is what we heard 
from people from all over Canada, people from eastern Quebec and 
Atlantic Canada. Talk to the people in the maritimes. I am sure that 
the Liberal caucus has talked about this. At least, I hope so, because 
if they have not done so, they are not doing their jobs. I am sure that 
they are doing a very good job and that they are trying to make the 
government take action on this issue. The best way for hon. 
members to play a positive role is by debating these issues here in 
the House as much as possible.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	The work of the parliamentary committees is to put the finishing 
touch to bills, to try to improve them, by coming up with 
amendments that would ensure that we have, in the end, the best 
possible bills.
<P>
	However, we are not yet at that stage with the unemployment 
insurance bill; we are not working out the details, we are still 
considering substantive matters. As long as we do not have a 
reform proposal which includes an active policy on employment, it 
would be pointless to approve anything. We will keep doing the 
best we can. We will put forward all the amendments needed to 
improve the bill, but, in this instance, what Quebecers and 
Canadians are asking for is a debate on the substance of the bill. If 
we let the government reinstate the bill in its previous form 
whenever it feels like it, we are not doing Quebecers and Canadians 
any favour.

	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
point I want to make enlarges upon the question I asked the 
member from Rivière-du-Loup. In his response he has admitted 
that what he is attempting to do, and assuming he is representing 
his party, what his party is attempting to do is to use any device 
possible to delay further work on the bill.
<P>
	If one stops to think about that for a moment, it contravenes one 
of the principles upon which the last election was fought. All 
parties and all politicians were told very clearly by the public that 
they wanted to see a change in how this House conducted itself. 
The public wanted to see reforms to the rules of this Chamber. 
They wanted to see politicians focusing more on issues than on 
technicalities. They wanted to see us focusing on the things that 
affected the lives of people and not simply playing the many games 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="199"> 199 </A></B>
<P>
that we can play within an  arcane set of rules to disrupt the 
proceedings of the Chamber.
<P>
	What has occurred here? The government came into office, laid 
a plan before the people and began to enact legislation that 
reflected that plan. After two years, which is the normal midpoint 
in the life of a government, it wanted to once more put before the 
people its plan for the next two years. This is quite common and is 
looked forward to. It is an opportunity for the government to reflect 
on what it has done and to come forward and state what it has 
learned, what it feels has worked and where it wants to go from 
here.
<P>
	However, at any time when we reach that point, because of the 
processes that we use and the extensive consultations that we have 
undertaken, there are bills that are not complete. They may also not 
be unanimous, which is a fact of life in this Chamber, but at some 
point we come to a decision. We cannot simply say that because we 
had not come to that point on a particular piece of legislation that 
we should throw it on the rubbish heap and start over again 
particularly in light of the enormous cost. No bill represents that 
better than the unemployment insurance bill.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite who spoke just before me was on 
challenged air, that old plane we flew in across the country. He sat 
in on the hundreds and hundreds of hours of consultation as people 
from every community across the country, including 
Rivière-du-Loup, came and spoke to us. Are we simply to say that 
all that work was for naught or are we to pick up where we were in 
the debate and continue to debate, continue to fight and continue to 
ask the government to move?
<P>
	The member will have to admit that the government has moved a 
long way. The bill that is before a committee is very different from 
the initial thinking of the government. In fact, it is a bill that 
demonstrates very clearly this government's willingness to consult, 
to listen and to act on the wishes of people. It is because of the 
interventions from the member opposite as well as interventions 
from thousands of people across this country that there have been 
very significant changes. I would ask the member to remember that 
process.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	The government put a green paper in front of the people of 
Canada and asked them to respond to it. The government in that 
green paper set out a number of proposals that represented its 
thinking about the reforms to UI.
<P>
	We consulted broadly. The people gave us their responses and 
we put recommendations in our report that contradicted what was 
said in the green paper because we respected the consultations we 
held and we valued the input we received. It went on from there for 
further work by the minister. He worked very hard and struggled 
very diligently over the summer to work  through each one of those 
issues and to present even further changes before he introduced the 
bill.
<P>
	The bill he introduced was vastly different from the green paper 
because of the hundreds and thousands of hours of work by 
Canadians and by members of this House. Now we are in 
committee on that bill consulting on the details, looking at some 
final reforms. Even now we hear the new minister talking about 
further changes, further amendments, further refinements. That is 
the process of evolution of a very complicated piece of legislation. 
It is a good process and one that has stood us well.
<P>
	What we should not do and I think people would not accept is to 
simply because of a technical game that is played within the House, 
throw out all of that work, go back to the drawing board and hold 
the unemployed in this country in limbo for another one or two 
years. Is that fair to the unemployed? Is that fair to seasonal 
workers? Is that fair to employers?
<P>
	It is time to get on. Yes, I respect the hon. member very much. I 
have valued his input on the bill. I think he has a lot to say in the 
area of social services and I want to hear him say it. I want him to 
debate the bill strenuously and I want to benefit from his input. But 
what I do not want is to spend a lot of time on a procedural debate. I 
do not want to spend a lot of time arguing how the rules of the 
House run so that we can disrupt the order of business, or we can 
throw the government off track by what, one day?
<P>
	We just saw an example of that with the Reform Party. Reform 
members refused to allow the tabling of the list of committee 
members. What nonsense. What has that accomplished? My gosh, 
it has disrupted the agenda of the government for a day. Is this the 
kind of message members are going to put in their householder and 
run home and say: ``Look what we did. We disrupted the business 
of the government for a day. Aren't we heroes''.
<P>
	That is not what people came here to do. People came here to 
debate, to represent their constituencies, to see that the wishes of 
Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario, 
Quebec and the maritimes were placed before the House. They 
came here to question the government, to ask ministers why they 
are doing what they are doing, and to hold them to account. They 
came here to vote, to represent their constituents.
<P>
	That is why we are here. It is not to play silly games, not to spend 
our time, our energies, our talent and our creativity looking for 
little ways to put a stick into the spokes of government 
momentarily. Does that enhance any of us in this House?
<P>
	If members want to debate the unemployment insurance bill, let 
us debate the unemployment insurance bill. If they want to debate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="200"> 200 </A></B>
<P>
Bill C-7, if they want to debate changes to health legislation, let us 
debate changes to health legislation. If they want to oppose it, 
oppose it. Let  us have a vigorous, hard fought debate. Let us hold 
the government to account and let us vote. But let us stop the 
procedural nonsense. Let us get on with the work of this House.
<P>
	Let us do what the Reform Party campaigned on, what we 
campaigned on, what the Bloc, the Conservatives and the New 
Democrats campaigned on. Let us bring some order here. Let us 
show people that we are spending their money wisely. Let us show 
people that we take the business of this country seriously. Let us get 
on with the debates on the issues people want us to debate and stop 
the procedural bickering.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with some intent and some interest to the 
member opposite. He raised some good points about putting up 
procedural roadblocks for the sake of procedural roadblocks. We 
have not done that as a rule. I agree in that I do not think the 
Canadian people want to see this being done. However, the 
principle at stake here is whether or not we should simply 
acquiesce to whatever the government decides it is going to do and 
whether we should in our role as opposition stand up for what we 
think is right.
<P>
	In this case the situation is that since the 35th Parliament started 
the government has supported the view that the nomination and 
election of vice-chairs for all committees should go to the Bloc, 
period. It has not been an open and free election. It has been a set 
up job from the very beginning. It is a sham of an election. Our 
intent is to bring this to the attention of Canadian citizens 
everywhere.
<P>
	We would have no problem with the Bloc being elected to both 
vice-chairs or the vice-chair or the second vice-chair if it were a 
free and open election, if it were a secret election within the 
committee, but it is not. At every single committee I have attended, 
the chief government whip has sat in the committee room, watched, 
presided over, pointed fingers and said: ``This is what you are 
going to do in this vote''. This is a mockery of democracy.
<P>
	Our point is not to be obstructive but to point out to the 
government and to Canadians that the government cannot be 
hypocritical. The Prime Minister cannot when he is in western 
Canada go on a radio or television program and say that it makes 
him sick when he looks across and sees the official opposition is a 
separatist party that will break up the country. Then when he gets 
back to Quebec he says exactly the opposite and at every possible 
opportunity he mollycoddles and appeases the Bloc and is so afraid 
to offend them. We are not afraid to offend them and if that offends 
the Liberal government, it should be offended.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his point. I 
listened and considered carefully what he said until his last couple 
of sentences. If he will permit me I will start there.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of this country and this government does not 
go into western Canada and say one thing then go into eastern 
Canada, Quebec or any other place and say something else. That is 
a fact. The Prime Minister has not been afraid to take any battle 
anywhere in this country at any time in the some 30 years he has 
been in this House. I have seen him do it over and over and over 
again. I very strenuously reject what the member has suggested.
<P>
	The fact is there are laws and there are rules and there are ways 
of procedure in this House that we respect. The member is simply 
not going to gerrymander his way out of that. The fact is whether I 
like it or not, the Bloc is the official opposition. We heard a very 
lengthy ruling by the Speaker who considered that question very 
carefully. That is a fact.
<P>
	Having established that, let us get on with the business of the 
House. The tabling of a list of committee members is a trivial 
point. How does preventing the tabling of the list of committee 
members by one day further his cause or make him look any more 
intelligent or make his debate seem any more fulsome? If he wants 
to make the point about vice-chairs, make it. He should stand up in 
this House every time. On the many, many occasions he has to 
debate substantive issues he should stand up in the House and make 
that point. He should stand up in question period and ask those 
questions. He should make his case.
<P>
	I am sure every member knows, particularly every western 
member, and I am sure all the members sitting there right now 
know the difficulty of finding a life within the travel and the time 
we have to spend here. So let us spend the time here to its 
maximum value. Let us not waste it.
<P>
	I do not want to take an extra day away from my family and my 
children because somebody has played around with a procedural 
motion, but I will do it. I will come into this House to debate any 
issue I possibly can, but let us not play those games. Members of 
the Reform Party came into this House so full of the lofty 
principles of government and were so prepared to defend the rights 
of the people and honour what the people wanted to hear. I am 
appalled to see you playing those kind of silly, trivial games.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask all members to not refer to other 
members as ``you''. Third person singular or third person plural, 
please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to refer to my hon. colleague's comment about not wasting 
our time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="201"> 201 </A></B>
<P>
	If he were really serious about this, which I think he is, at least 
he certainly looks sincere, the important thing is to get procedural 
motions like this off the table. They are on the table and we are 
now obligated to get involved in the debate. However, there is a 
very big issue at stake here.
<P>
	The point I want to register was made very effectively by the 
hon. Pat Nowlan when he was in the House. He did it on the 
occasion of the 1991 debate. I refer rather extensively to some 
things he said. At that time he said to me: ``In the years that I have 
been here it would boggle the mind in terms of the effective 
working of Parliament to do what is being projected here''. It is 
exactly the same thing the previous government did in the House in 
1991.
<P>
	He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What really disturbs me, having spent a good many years on the opposition 
side, is that we know, and my former friends across the way know from when 
they were on the opposition, that the prorogation date is sometimes used as the 
negotiating lever to get bills to move along. Under the tradition and history of 
the British parliamentary system come prorogation everything on the Order 
Paper died. It was then incumbent on the government and the responsibility of 
the government in the new session to reintroduce the bills and/or try to work 
matter matters out by consent, as they so often did.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have a good memory also. There were many times in this Chamber in which 
a deal was made before prorogation. Sometimes by unanimous consent bills 
which were on the Order Paper, certain ones being difficult to agree with 
perhaps, were nevertheless put together as a package so they could get through 
and could be reintroduced later.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If the government brings in an omnibus motion which has the 
effect of lumping all the bills together that were all at the same 
stage in the previous session of a Parliament through a formal 
motion of the House where it knows it has the numbers to have a 
fait accomplis, if you like, of the passage of that kind of a motion, 
that puts into jeopardy any future debate on the floor of the House. 
That is what the issue is all about.
<P>
	The question is why would a government, including this one or 
any other, that will use this kind of lever really worry about the 
concerns of the opposition? It does not care about what the 
opposition thinks. It knows that come prorogation the debate will 
be cut off and since it has the majority in the new Parliament the 
government knows it will not lose anything.
<P>
	What in the world is this all about if we do what is proposed 
here? I cannot help but refer to the hon. Don Boudria. I am pleased 
he is here to hear himself quoted again.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Members, we are all rusty. Present sitting 
members of the House have to be referred to by their riding and 
ministers by their portfolio.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> I apologize. I stand corrected. I was referring to 
the hon. member for  Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. I believe 
other members have mentioned this today. I refer to a second 
paragraph which I do not think has been read. The hon. member 
will hear himself quoted again, from May 28, 1991.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That was then.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Yes, that was then and he has learned extremely 
well. He has learned to debate cleverly on both sides of the issue. If 
it were not so serious, it would be a nice game. To become a skilful 
debater one must be able to debate both sides of an issue.
<P>
	He said: ``What we are doing is amending completely the rules 
of the House by adopting this motion. Were we to do so or were this 
motion to be ruled in order, the implications of the ruling of this 
motion in order would be such that I fear we could render this 
House of Commons totally irrelevant and redundant''.
<P>
	He went on to say: ``We would simply deem everything and 
anything to have been passed, to have been at third reading or to 
have been at any stage or for any reason the government did not 
want to proceed with other stages of the bill''.
<P>
	Is that not exactly what the hon. member told us 20 minutes ago? 
It is most interesting what happens when one walks from this side 
of the House to that side of the House. When they have all the 
numbers on their side, they begin to think anything they do has to 
be right.
<P>
	At that time the government won the debate. Of course it did, 
had the numbers, exactly as Pat Nowlan put it so clearly. It reminds 
me very much of what Gordon Gibson said in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
on Tuesday of this week: ``Our system effectively provides for a 
four year elected dictatorship with an astonishing concentration of 
power in the Prime Minister's office and the cabinet. Not 
unnaturally, those enjoying this power think it is a pretty good 
system''.
<P>
	That is the seriousness of the issue before us. We really should 
be reflecting the wishes of the people. Sometimes procedural 
motions are brought to the floor of the House to give advantage to 
levering certain bills to move things faster or slower, the 
suggestion being that somehow the opposition side has a say in 
these things.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague from Calgary Centre said so clearly, we do 
not have a say. It is in the hands of the government. Gordon Gibson 
said very clearly that in the final analysis the Prime Minister can 
decide whatever he wants.
<P>
	Now I refer to the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands. Let 
him hear what he had to say on May 28, 1991. This is excellent. 
The hon. member will have his memory refreshed. He could 
probably say the very same thing today. He should. If he were on 
this side of the House I am sure he would. This is really interesting. 
The hon. member said: ``A new definition of democracy has  been 
introduced. That is what this government is trying to introduce to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="202"> 202 </A></B>
<P>
Canada. Frankly, it is time we exposed the-''-do you remember 
what you said?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Fraud.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Fraud. He called it a fraud but today it is good 
stuff. He goes on. It gets better: ``I want to deal with the propriety 
of the motion the government introduced. I suggest it is contrary to 
all the practices of this House for the last 124 years. It is a breach of 
the proprieties of this place. While the Speaker has ruled that the 
motion is in order and I respect that ruling, I suggest that it is still 
morally wicked''.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	What a statement. That is what he said when he was on this side 
but now that he is part of the government he says that is okay. It is 
as morally wicked today as it was then. The morals have changed. 
It is amazing. One walks across the House and the morals become 
different. Is it not interesting? What has happened in this place?
<P>
	Then he drew his conclusion: ``I suggest that this is wrong and it 
is wickedly wrong. It is a gross violation of the constitutional 
principles on which the House has operated since Confederation''. 
Listen to the loftiness of these phrases. ``Indeed it is contrary to the 
whole practice of British parliamentary tradition for 900 years and 
nothing like this has ever been tried before. I suggest it is wrong. 
The government knows it is wrong''.
<P>
	It is very interesting that at that time the hon. member was joined 
by the now premier of Newfoundland who said: ``The government 
party of the day regrettably for the country, a country in desperate 
need of leadership on the constitutional front and on the economic 
front, does not have the confidence of the people''. Even as a 
member of the opposition, one wanting to replace the governing 
party, he made those kinds of comments. What does the 
government do? Yesterday the Prime Minister indicated to the 
House that the back of the deficit had been broken. That is an 
interesting conclusion when the Prime Minister, the Minister of 
Finance and the speech from the throne said very clearly that the 
deficit shall be at least or not more than 2 per cent of the gross 
domestic product.
<P>
	That does not suggest the deficit's back has been broken. It has 
not made any indication either of how seriously the fiscal situation 
of the country has been damaged and continues to be damaged.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is a lot more progress than your Tory 
friends made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt: </B>This is interesting. The hon. member says that is 
more progress than the Tories made. I draw to the member's 
attention that since he and his colleagues came into the House they 
have added to the debt $76 billion plus. That is their contribution to 
the fiscal health of the country. It is on the backs of the people that 
the deficit and the debt ride, and they are getting heavier and 
heavier. I suggest to the Prime Minister and to my colleagues 
opposite that the back that is being broken is the back of the 
taxpayer, not of the deficit.
<P>
	There comes a time when one almost has to say that what we 
have here is a tyranny of the majority. It is not the interests of the 
people that are being addressed in this motion but the convenience 
of a particular group of people who not want to live by the 
procedures that we have all agreed to. They want to change them.
<P>
	It would be one thing to say this will simply bring back the bills 
the government wants back on the table. Then it ties that with this 
sort of noble condescending attitude, almost patronizing, saying it 
will also allow private members' bills to come forward. That does 
not change the principle one iota. It seems the government wants to 
get some kind of prestige, or to drain some credibility from the fact 
that yes, private members' bills will also be able to come to the 
table. If it was morally wicked before, if it was a fraud before, it is 
no less wicked and no less a fraud today than it was then.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	I suggest that the sooner we get on with the business of the 
country and deal with things like the deficit, justice issues and 
keeping criminals off the streets, we will be far better off than 
wrangling here on whether we should bring back all that stuff that 
was really supposed to have been stopped by prorogation at the 
whim and fancy of the government whenever it wishes to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was wondering if my hon. colleague would want to share his views 
on the cost issues. I am not talking about financial costs. I am 
talking about the human costs of the various committees that 
participated throughout the previous session. I know that many of 
our constituents throughout the country have invested a great deal 
of time and effort in coming forward to share their views on various 
matters before committees at various stages.
<P>
	I was curious about what are the hon. member's views or his 
party's views on the subject of costs and whether it is something 
that should be given consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am so happy that my colleague 
across the way asked that question. It really gives me a chance to 
say something about the speed with which legislation is introduced 
to the House and the substance of the legislation that is introduced. 
It is almost like having a car that is trying to go uphill but the ice on 
the highway is so slick that the car cannot move at all. It is spinning 
like crazy but it is not going anywhere. That is what is happening 
here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="203"> 203 </A></B>
<P>
	If the hon. member is really concerned about the costs that were 
incurred, then the legislation should have been pushed through the 
House on a regular basis, instead of trying to force it all through 
at the end.
<P>
	Let us take as an example the internal trade agreement. The 
agreement was signed on July 1 the year before. A whole year later 
the bill finally came to the House. We would told we should pass it 
into law so that it can be put into operation. What was the delay? 
Certainly the opposition did not delay it. The standing committee 
did not delay it. Somebody else delayed it. I wonder if it is not the 
same group that has the opportunity to bring bills back to the House 
if this motion is passed.
<P>
	The concern I have is this. How much time has the government 
wasted by not moving faster than it did? If the government wanted 
to bring all these bills forward, why did it not just keep on going? 
We lost a whole month.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Why did you prorogue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate, as I often do, the views of 
my learned colleague. The only difficulty I have is this. What about 
the human investment in time, energy and the quality of the debate 
that was advanced prior to prorogation?
<P>
	I would like to ask my hon. colleague if he would comment on 
that one specific issue. Is it not a valid comment that there were 
significant investments made in bringing people to Ottawa or 
having our committees travel throughout the country? Would it not 
be a pity to lose all of the very good work that was done by all 
members on all sides of the House and particularly at the 
committee level? I ask my hon. colleague to comment on that 
aspect.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to comment on the 
human investment. The sad part is that so much of the human effort 
has been completely ignored by the government.
<P>
	All kinds of witnesses come before committees, not only the 
industry committee but a number of other committees, and what 
effect has it had on legislation? What effect has it had in bringing 
about any amendments? The hon. member should recognize that 
that kind of thing is much more debilitating than for the 
government to take the position that if it prorogues it can bring that 
stuff back because some of that investment of time and energy is 
significant and should not be lost.
<P>
	It is not lost. We have heard all those things. If the government is 
really serious it will bring forward that legislation very quickly and 
very clearly. It will not have to go through all of that debate again. 
We know that and I believe the hon. member knows that.
<P>
	If there were ever a time when we should be sensitive to the 
human element it is now. We should recognize the  terrible position 
that people are put in when they are not sure about what is going to 
happen to the criminal who is incarcerated for committing a violent 
crime, who has raped their daughters and is now out on the street 
again without any restriction whatsoever. That is the concern. That 
has a far greater human cost than the debate that has happened, that 
has not been forgotten and does not have to be repeated even if the 
bill is presented at first reading. That is the human cost.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very interesting to hear the laughter and the jesting 
going on this afternoon, looking back at the history of what has 
been said and leaving a very distorted picture of what this motion is 
all about today.
<P>
	When the government House leader brought this motion in this 
morning it was clear and simple. It serves all members of this 
House. It gives an opportunity of bringing any legislation of the 
government and any legislation of any private member back to the 
floor of this House as long as it is identical to the way it was 
presented prior to prorogation and as long as it has passed second 
reading. That is very simple and very appropriate for the public 
who are listening today to understand what this motion does.
<P>
	The opposition has been misleading the public this afternoon. 
They talked about anything and everything. They talked about the 
deficit and about changing policies. This legislation was brought 
forward where you have the opportunity if you have a voice, 
Reform members and Bloc members, you have an opportunity in 
debate-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sorry to be such a bore, 
colleagues. I know it is early in the session but please just delete 
the word you and say they or he.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I have been 
a little distracted with some of the history on this debate. I have no 
history in this place except as a 1993 member so it is interesting to 
be reminded of what has gone on in the past, however boring I 
think it was.
<P>
	The point of this legislation is to give us the opportunity to 
proceed efficiently in the business of government. Each and every 
member of this place was elected in 1993 to pass legislation that 
works effectively and efficiently for our society. Legislation that 
was in progress, for want of a better word, that was left on the 
Order Paper before prorogation, is to come back for debate. There 
will be opportunities to add amendments and make changes. It does 
not mean that any hon. member in this House must remain silent.
<P>
	We have talked about many things here today. Some bills, such 
as C-111, the employment insurance act, has been debated and the 
public has talked about it for several months. However, that is what 
legislation is all about. It is to seek consensus not only from 
members in this House but from the public as well. The hon. 
member  for Okanagan Centre talked about the debt. He said that 
we have added to the debt. This is misleading. This government has 
reduced the deficit. As the Minister of Finance brings in the budget 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="204"> 204 </A></B>
<P>
next Wednesday afternoon at 4.30 p.m., the public will see how we 
have reduced the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	In terms of the debt, it is out there; it exists. However, this will 
be part of our longer term legislation and the debt will be taken care 
of once we have dealt with the deficit. I must remind the hon. 
members of the opposition of first things first and keep our 
priorities straight.
<P>
	When we talk about the Unemployment Insurance Act, about 
Bill C-111, the public has advised us of what it would like to see in 
that bill. We have listened to the public. As it goes into committee 
for more discussion those amendments, those considerations will 
be listened to. We have the interest of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development as well as his expression of opportunity to 
hear those recommendations and see if they can be fitted into this 
legislation. The opportunity lies in the meetings in committee to 
present those views.
<P>
	I would suggest this misleading of the public here today is a 
distortion of what this House is about. It is a distortion because we 
came here promising the public we would act more responsibly, 
more maturely and not spend our time on issues of procedure.
<P>
	We bring many motions to the floor on House procedure, but was 
that not also a promise to the public, that we did not have to look 
back to 100 years ago, that it is time we updated some of the 
legislation, some of the standing orders, some of the House 
procedures. The House procedures committee is a committee of all 
parties in this House.
<P>
	There is the opportunity and I would challenge any member. If 
an hon. member believes they do not have that opportunity, it lies 
there for each and every one of us, whether we are backbenchers on 
the government side or whether we are in opposition.
<P>
	The motion presented this morning by the government House 
leader is very clear. I believe the public, in the interest of 
efficiency, in the interest of money that has been spent in hearing 
public views, in holding public hearings across this nation, would 
be in support of progressive motions that see legislation move 
forward.
<P>
	If the hon. member believes this is not the wish of the public, 
that it is not the wish of the Canadian taxpayer, then I believe the 
opportunity lies that those views, those statistics, those numbers of 
convincing, of otherwise, could be brought forward in committee.
<P>
	The opportunity to carry legislation forward is a reality and it is 
part of a credible government's mandate. Some of the bills will 
come forward if the members so choose,  but this is all inclusive. 
Any member has the opportunity to bring a bill forward as long as 
it is identical and has passed second reading; that is private 
members' bills as well as government bills.
<P>
	There is not selectivity, as some members have suggested. It is 
an opportunity for all bills. As we sat here last year there was a bill 
from the Reform member on grandparents' rights and of 
grandparents' accessibility to their grandchildren. As their 
offspring go through divorce or separation there can be problems of 
keeping the children at a distance from grandparents.
<P>
	The gallery was full of grandparents that day as I spoke on that 
bill on behalf of the Reform member. That bill has excellent 
content that serves the children of this country, that serves them in 
a way such that they will have that support morally, lovingly, with 
nurturing and financially from grandparents who are a little more 
distanced from the situation. That was a private member's bill from 
the Reform Party. I would suggest this is an opportunity for every 
member in the House to support this motion today to see that it 
does pass which would bring these bills back for debate and for 
passage.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	There is an opportunity as well when we talk about deficits, 
debts and the cost that we forget that and think of what we have 
been through. I am convinced the public does not want us to delay 
in time and cost in not passing this motion which was brought 
forward today and not bringing those bills back here to debate but 
they want us to continue on to get them off the slate.
<P>
	We have a responsibility and we have taken that. Every member 
in the House has an opportunity through the standing committees 
which are broad committees representing all parties in this House. I 
think it is misleading when we tell the public before the cameras 
today in the Parliament of Canada that we are doing anything but 
practising good government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have listened carefully to the comments of my 
colleague, and I have a question for her. I am not very familiar with 
House procedure, but I do know that according to the statutes 
prorogation means all bills die on the Order Paper.
<P>
	The government knows it. This has always been the case since 
there is a government. The government is free to prorogue or not, 
but it knows very well that when it does, all bills automatically die 
on the Order Paper. This very government, when it was sitting on 
the opposition benches, was very critical of the Conservative 
government because it did not abide by the rules of this House.
<P>
	How can the government take such a position now? Is the hon. 
member trying to tell us that the government is  free to ignore our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="205"> 205 </A></B>
<P>
procedures for the sake of convenience? That is the fundamental 
question. Do we have procedures or do we not? My colleague is 
telling me procedures can be changed-and I agree with her-but 
let the government change them, then. But as long as they stand as 
they are, it should not ignore them just because it is more 
convenient. That is the fundamental question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to 
address that very interesting question. I find it interesting that the 
hon. member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies whose purpose here 
is to separate the country refers to the origins of the Queen, the 
King and the reign of British rule, that it is so great and this House 
has no opportunity to change those historic perspectives as they 
were.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member that as part of the Liberal promise, as 
part of the 1993 election platform, this government took the 
responsibility and the obligation to the Canadian people to manage 
the Parliament of Canada more efficiently. Also, in the name of the 
Canadian taxpayer we would introduce procedures that seemed 
fitting of 1996 and the progress we should be making as we move 
toward the 21st century.
<P>
	I have the greatest respect, as all hon. members do in the House, 
for the historic value and the traditions, but I believe it is not the 
absolute rule that we live within the monarchy. We know the views 
of the separatist members and their purpose and intent here.
<P>
	This House does have the responsibility to serve the Canadian 
people and to bring forward legislation that is progressive and 
efficient. In the name of the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs governing this place, in which all members, even 
separatist members are a part of that committee, then we do have 
that responsibility. I believe we are only serving the Parliament in a 
wise, efficient manner using House procedures.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a very simple question for the hon. member. Could 
she tell me the specific reason the Liberal government prorogued 
the House? Could I have a simple answer?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is part of this government's 
platform, part of its promise to the Canadian people to deliver good 
government. Part of it was to restructure the Unemployment 
Insurance Act, part of it was to restructure the standing committees 
and all procedures in this House, and it was to make the House 
deliver legislation more efficiently and economically.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member knows the red book promise. He 
probably knows the red book as well as any other member in the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Probably better.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Yes, perhaps the hon. member does know it 
better than some.
<P>
	The legislation was introduced according to what the Canadian 
people requested. Canadians have requested additional 
commitments from the Government of Canada, that we would 
respect the five principles of the Canada Health Act; to ensure 
health accessibility at no charge except through the public purse for 
all Canadians; to ensure that we would provide the kind of 
compassionate, caring society; to ensure that we would maintain 
the Old Age Security Act and the guaranteed income supplement; 
to ensure to the Canadian people that we would do the things that 
our government promised.
<P>
	That is part of why we had a red book. It is part of why we had a 
throne speech and it is part of why we have the numbers to run the 
Government of Canada today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question for the member is probably the same question my 
colleague just asked which she did not answer, the purpose of 
prorogation.
<P>
	To get on to that issue, is it not to wipe off the slate and start over 
with the throne speech to set the new direction for the government 
with its new vision, with its new hope, with its new ideas for 
growth and opportunity? Is it not to go forward instead of going 
backward in the first piece of legislation the government 
introduces?
<P>
	The first motion the government has introduced is to bring back 
all those old government bills it does not want to leave behind. 
Those bills are supposed to die on the order paper.
<P>
	Prorogation is the cause of this motion and the cause of the 
undemocratic use of this Chamber. What is the purpose and why, in 
her opinion, did her government prorogue?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has suggested 
that we are bringing back all the old government bills, to use his 
words. The hon. member forgets that we are bringing back Reform 
private members' bills and private members' bills from the Bloc, 
the NDP and the Conservatives. We are bringing back all bills that 
were in session prior to the break.
<P>
	The hon. member recognizes that this legislation is excellent 
legislation which must be carried through. This legislation needs to 
be completed. Canadians want this legislation back on the Order 
Paper and they want it passed.
<P>

<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
getting to the main part of my speech, perhaps I should answer the 
question asked by two Reform members. What these two members 
and many other people are wondering is why prorogue the session 
if the government wants to reinstate everything that was being 
considered during last session.
<P>
	Probably all that has happened in the last few months, 
particularly in connection with the Quebec referendum, is one of 
the reasons why the government wants to start afresh, to show 
Canadians that it has regained control of the situation. But I want to 
get back to the main point, because I am not speaking in reply to 
the speech from the throne, but rather on Motion No. 1.
<P>
	This is a motion to reinstate bills that were at various stages 
when the session was prorogued. That would appear logical, up to a 
point, but tradition has it that when a session ends and another one 
begins, we make a fresh start. Otherwise, we should have continued 
in the same parliamentary session without having a new speech 
from the throne and a new beginning.
<P>
	This behaviour annoys me for two reasons: it shows a lack of 
respect for parliamentary tradition and practice, and-this annoys 
me even more, as it does many other people who are interested in 
politics-it proves that very often one says something when on one 
side of the House and something else when on the other side. I will 
get back to this in a while, since many members who now sit over 
there criticized the then Conservative government when it put 
forward a motion very similar to the one we are debating this 
afternoon. Just wait and see what their positions were then. It is 
rather difficult to understand how they can support this motion 
today after all they said against it then.
<P>
	Let us go back to the first point, which is the lack of respect for 
tradition and practice. I agree that some things must be changed, 
improved, in the parliamentary system. The problem is that each 
and every time changes are made, the opposition parties or the 
backbenchers lose some of their powers so that the government, the 
executive, can have more power and be able to break or alter a rule 
as it pleases to go ahead undisturbed with its agenda.
<P>
	This is rather disappointing, since all 295 of us here were elected 
to represent the people. Our constituents do not want to see our 
rights and responsibilities as members of Parliament trampled on; 
they want us to play an even bigger role and have an even greater 
influence on the parliamentary system.
<P>
	Of course, my Liberal colleagues will say: ``Motion No. 1 also 
enables members to reinstate private members' bills and to carry 
on with their consideration in the current session''. But one has to 
be aware of one thing:  how many private members' bills, and we 
can go back as far as we want, actually became law? How many 
private members' bills actually went through the whole legislative 
process? Very, very few of them.
<P>
	If the government is proposing this motion authorizing the 
reinstatement of measures at the stage they were before in 
Parliament, it is to pursue its agenda on bills which it sets great 
store by; it is not to please members whose private bills had 
completed a stage in the process. This rarely happens.
<P>
	So, the purpose of motion No. 1 is to deal with government 
business, basically everything that comes from cabinet and the 
executive branch. Thus, it is not a major argument for the 
government. Of course, it sweetens the pill.
<P>
	If these bills are so important for the government and if they are 
so good for Quebecers and Canadians, why did it not introduce 
them earlier during the last session? Since it was elected two and a 
half years ago, why did it not hurry to introduce these legislative 
measures so vital to the operations of the Government of Canada 
and to the federal administration?
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	We wonder why. And when we search for answers, we find some 
clues. We notice that there has been an atmosphere of panic in the 
last few months. That was obvious in the speech from the throne. 
The government does not have clear directions for the second half 
of its mandate and it is even alluding to the possibility of an early 
election to avoid the constitutional agenda of 1997.
<P>
	I will talk about the second part. I would like to quote some 
Liberal members who were in the opposition not so long ago. 
Maybe they will go back to the opposition seats. Not all of those 
who are here now, but some of them. The hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier, now in the Senate, speaking to the Conservative 
motion, declared this: ``I cannot understand why this government, 
these government bullies now want to impose their will on the 
House of Commons''.
<P>
	He was talking about government bullies imposing their will. I 
would be curious to know if the same bullies now work for the 
Liberal Party and if the hon. senator still thinks the same way. He 
was not alone to speak. There were several of them. There is one I 
just saw. He is the Liberal member for Kingston and the Islands. He 
declared: ``They have to be reinstated in the usual course, but they 
ought to have been introduced and dealt with as new bills in this 
session''. That means that a bill must be moved as a new bill and go 
through the normal legislative process. He quoted from 
Beauchesne, saying that any irregularity of any portion of a motion 
renders the whole motion irregular. He fought hard and even 
contested the legality of that motion. He presented many arguments 
to that effect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="207"> 207 </A></B>
<P>
	One of his colleagues, the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, who is still with us, was a lot 
harsher. He said: ``The implications of ruling this motion in order 
would be such that I fear we could render-if a government 
wanted to-this House of Commons totally irrelevant and 
redundant''.
<P>
	To render the House of Commons totally irrelevant and 
redundant. That is what the member said. He is not a sovereignist, a 
separatist, but a member who sits on the other side of the House 
and who occupies a very important position within the government. 
Why has he changed his mind now that he is in a position of 
authority? How can that be explained? People become very cynical 
about politics when they see individuals change their mind so 
drastically in a relatively short time span.
<P>
	How can a politician who says that he is working for the 
well-being of Canadians and wants to improve their social and 
economic standards of living have credibility when he contradicts 
himself constantly. People do not know when we are telling the 
truth. They do not know who among us is telling the truth. It is very 
serious. It is a lack of respect for the office we hold, for the 
institution for which we work, which, ultimately, is there to serve 
the people.
<P>
	It is surprising to see those people, who claimed to champion the 
cause of integrity and transparency in their red book-which, by 
the way, they threw away as soon as the took office-suddenly 
adopting the agenda of the previous government in many areas.
<P>
	Look at what is happening with the reform of social programs 
and think of the lack of respect for the institution. They are not 
even able to take a position that would be seen as their own, to 
promote the role of members of Parliament and to respect the 
institution.
<P>
	If we really wanted to make the institution more efficient, as my 
Liberal colleague said, we could evaluate how really efficient 
committees are and examine the way they operate. There are many 
issues to examine.
<P>
	The government tries to control everything: House committees, 
procedure and all the rest and this is why we have now almost 
reached the point where we have a sham of democracy. Some were 
complaining about the monarchy earlier, but it is simply disguised. 
The real power of individuals in this House is relatively small when 
we face actions like those of the government.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois wants to be constructive. If I remember 
rightly, my colleague for Laurier-Sainte-Marie or my colleague 
for Berthier-Montcalm introduced an amendment whereby a bill 
could be returned to the stage it was at. Under certain 
circumstances, a prorogation can be very useful.
<P>
	If a minister or a member introduces business from the previous 
session requesting the unanimous consent of the House to continue, 
he will have it, if the measure is in everyone's interest.
<P>
	This would avoid having the government simply bringing back 
its own agenda, but also all the measures that are, to all intents and 
purposes, uncontested, approved by all the members and must be 
approved by all Quebecers and Canadians, given that we are from 
very different parties. In this regard, the amendment would 
therefore be constructive.
<P>
	In the few minutes I have left before question period, I would 
like to mention that the member preceding me referred to the fact 
that we were sovereignists or separatists, whatever your 
preference, and that she was surprised at our interest in following 
parliamentary rules, because this is the British parliamentary 
system.
<P>
	Since our arrival here, we have shown respect, probably even 
more than the government, for parliamentary institutions and rules. 
We are fighting democratically. We are seeking major change, 
major change in the future of Quebecers and of Canadians, because 
we want to build a relationship between peoples.
<P>
	That does not prevent us from respecting institutions and from 
waging a democratic struggle. Thus this sort of remark reveals a 
considerable lack of understanding of our action and role here. I am 
pleased to be able to tell her that we are not attacking institutions. 
We are not attacking individuals, we are not attacking Canadians. 
We are leading a battle for Quebecers, because we think it is the 
best road for the future for the people of Quebec and the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	When we are told that, in the end, it is in our interest to block the 
process-I remember that, when we first came into the House of 
Commons, everybody said that the Bloc would be doing anything 
to block the conduct of business of the House. People had fun 
making puns. It did not happen that way. We allowed for an 
improvement of the conduct of business. We co-operated a lot. 
There was much co-operation between House leaders of all parties 
to ensure that the House may conduct its business in the most 
efficient manner, to avoid using procedural technicalities to 
prolong debates late into the night and achieve nothing. We 
allowed for an improvement in the conduct of business of our 
institution. That is how we want things to be.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 does not improve the functioning of the institution 
and, I am convinced, will not go down in history as a measure 
having furthered the British parliamentary system in the best 
interest of Canadians. On the contrary, it gives more power to the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="208"> 208 </A></B>
<P>
executive, to cabinet which is really in charge of the government 
and controls MPs, who, when they protest in caucus-as is now the 
case-are threatened with a general election to keep them in line.
<P>
	In that sense, it is a threat. I find it interesting when they threaten 
to send certain MPs from their own party to the slaughter house. 
Personally, I am not against the fact that you could call an election. 
The only danger is that you may lose your Prime Minister in the 
battle, but we shall see. When the time comes, voters in 
Saint-Maurice will be the judge.
<P>
	I am quite sure that there are Liberal members in this House who 
are thinking, in their hearts of hearts: ``This is true; this is another 
thing we are doing which does not make any sense.'' Let them keep 
it up.
<P>
	If they cannot publicly side with us to defend the rules and the 
role of members, at least, when they meet in the privacy of their 
caucus, let them raise the issue with the cabinet members, who 
control this Parliament, and with all those behind the scene, who 
yield some power, and tell them: ``Listen, there are limits to how 
far you can lead us; when you decide to make a new speech from 
the throne and start a new session, it is to make a fresh start in 
several areas and the same should apply to the bills introduced 
during the last session.''
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to point out that the unemployment 
insurance reform is among these bills, and nobody will convince 
me that it is not controversial and cannot be improved. Why not 
take advantage of a new session to put this unemployment 
insurance reform on a more solid footing? This way, at least, 
everybody's interests would be served.
<P>
	Let have some self-respect and not change one's mind when 
changing side in the House; let us not make an about-face as did the 
member for Kingston and the Islands who has completely changed 
his minds on this motion. Furthermore, let us follow parliamentary 
procedure and try to make the role of member of Parliament as 
efficient as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite 
obvious that the purpose of prorogation of the government was 
strictly to introduce a new throne speech.
<P>
	Between now and Christmas there probably will not be any new 
substantive pieces of legislation introduced by the government. 
That is why it wants to reintroduce through Motion M-1 all of the 
previous bills without any notification to the opposition members. 
We will not know what bills it wants to bring back. It will be able to 
put them back at whatever stage it wants. This is a contravention of 
the democratic process in the House.
<P>
	The current Minister of Health, the member for Cape 
Breton-East Richmond, had this to say about this type of action 
taken by the previous government: ``I contend that the motion is in 
principle unacceptable and that it seeks to circumvent, indeed to 
subvert, the normal legislative process of this House. In the past 
this kind of thing has only been done by unanimous consent. Now 
the  government is seeking to establish an ominous precedent by 
attempting to force this procedure on the House. This is an 
offensive and dangerous departure from the practices of all 
parliamentary bodies''.
<P>
	The current premier of Newfoundland, the former minister of 
fisheries in the government, had this to say about this type of 
activity which the government is now doing: ``We see the decision 
by the government today to put this motion before the House as a 
confirmation of the destruction-and that is what it is-of our 
parliamentary system of government''.
<P>
	Another Liberal member of the House from Halifax had this to 
say about the Conservative government on this same issue: ``I can 
only say that the government should hang its head in shame. One 
wonders today why the government prorogued the House of 
Commons last time''.
<P>
	I agree wholeheartedly with the words of the member for 
Kingston and the Islands. When in opposition he had this to say 
about this very action taken now by his government which he 
criticized. I could not say it better. I will have to use his words and I 
express my support for his conviction, his integrity, his intelligence 
on this issue: ``If the royal prerogative is to mean anything, the 
prorogation ended those bills. They have to be reinstated in the 
usual course but they ought to have been introduced and dealt with 
as new bills in this session. That is the proper procedure in the 
absence of unanimous consent, not this fiasco that we are wasting 
taxpayers' money on and doing now. What the government is doing 
by this, and let us make it perfectly clear what is happening here, is 
short circuiting the legislative process''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Calgary Centre found 
some very interesting points in the position of the member for 
Kingston and the Islands. I also found some very eloquent 
comments of his. He said: ``A new definition of democracy-That 
is what this government is trying to introduce to Canada-I suggest 
it is perhaps one of the worst outrages that has been perpetrated in 
this House in many years-it is still morally wicked of the 
government to proceed with this motion''. We could go on and on 
with quotations like that. There are many.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="209"> 209 </A></B>
<P>
	He is not alone. The current finance minister, the member for 
LaSalle-Émard, once declared: ``We find ourselves in the 
situation we are now in. The bill died on the Order Paper. In its 
supreme arrogance and lack of understanding, this government 
comes to us and says: `we would like to reinstate it'''.
<P>
	These are the same people who today are tabling this motion. 
Nothing further needs to be said, to know that such actions 
contribute largely to the results of polls showing a 7, 8 or 10 per 
cent credibility rating for politicians. Some opinion polls even give 
figures as low as  2 per cent. I believe these people should feel 
responsible for that situation and should stop changing direction 
constantly.
<P>
	They still have an opportunity to retain their credibility if they 
change their position and withdraw their motion so that the 
situation can go back to normal. They only have to return all those 
bills they want passed to the first reading stage. This is all I had to 
say.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 2.30 p.m., this House stands 
adjourned until Monday next at 11 a.m.
