</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on March 6, Marcel Pepin, a giant of the contemporary 
trade union movement in Quebec, passed away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marcel Pepin began his union career in 1948.  He was president 
of the CSN from 1965 to 1976 and also held the position of 
president of the World Confederation of Labour.  He was, without 
a doubt, one of the most talented union leaders Quebec has ever 
produced.  In his own way, Marcel Pepin was one of the key 
architects of Quebec's quiet revolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For close to 50 years, he energetically defended the principles 
of equity, justice and dignity on which our society is based. 
He had strong beliefs and never hesitated to take a stand on 
prevailing trends and practices.  In short, Quebec has lost a 
great worker and a great trade unionist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all Canadians, I wish to pay tribute to Marcel 
Pepin for his great contribution to improved labour conditions 
and the progress of Quebec and Canadian society.

Canadians have seen only the tip of the HRDC financial 
mismanagement iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the Surrey Aboriginal Cultural Society complained to 
me about mismanagement of HRDC funds.  The Sto:Lo nation receives 
HRDC funds to provide services in Surrey.  Its apparent failure 
to honour contractual obligations has left aboriginals living in 
Surrey without employment and training programs since 1998.  The 
society is now considering legal action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous to that a member of the B.C. Metis community and a 
former provincial Metis compliance officer came to me with 
complaints of waste and favouritism, for example, HRDC money for 
a university law course for a council director and a trip to 
India for the son of another director.  The complainants want 
nothing less than a full forensic audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know of 19 police investigations into the government's 
mismanagement.  It could be 20 but the RCMP told the Metis that 
it lacked the resources to investigate.  I hope the solicitor 
general is listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development is aware of both 
complaints, so why is there no investigation?

Bernard Landry wrote that Quebec's budget reflected the strong 
increase of 16.3% in federal transfer payments in 2000-2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This probably means that he will cash the money set aside in the 
trust put in place by the Liberal member for LaSalle-Émard, the

thus helping to maintain the growth in federal transfer revenues 
for Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its recent February 28 budget, the federal government 
announced a $2.5 billion increase in Canada. 
In the case of Quebec, this translates into a $600 million

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, Bernard Landry, the Quebec Minister of Finance, 
delivered his budget for 2000-2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking on my own behalf, as well as that of my colleagues of 
the Bloc Quebecois, I would like to congratulate him for this 
budget, which gives Quebecers what they had hoped for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's budget, with its more limited resources, includes 
investments in health and in education that are far greater than 
those announced in the last federal budget. 
What is more, the tax cuts announced by Minister Landry are 
immediate, and 33% higher than those announced for Quebec by the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday's Landry budget demonstrates one thing: if Quebecers 
had total control over the $31 billion in taxes they send to 
Ottawa every year, the Government of Quebec would clearly be 
more efficient in managing it according to its real needs and 
aspirations.  That is what Quebec sovereignty is all about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister cannot hide from the fact that her own departmental 
briefing notes, the very papers that she uses for her 
departmental officials state: “We were told to be flexible.  Now 
we are being told to obey the Financial Administration Act and 
Treasury Board guidelines.  Why doesn't management make up its 
mind?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, officials were told that it was okay to break 
the rules and only after she got caught did the minister slam on 
the brakes. If the audit had not caught the minister red-handed, 
would she have ever stopped the rule breaking? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

supporting us to continue to have a system of service delivery

it”.  On March 13 the minister said “We are still studying the

time developing slogans than on actually developing a response to 
save medicare, will he act today?  Will he give Canadians a

contribution to preserving medicare by working with us to renew 
it for the 21st century rather than aligning herself with the

changes that are necessary, rather than playing into the hands of 
the Reform Party and others who would destroy medicare in the

given the situation in which we find ourselves, a

me right, where the House must deal with a most urgent issue, 
namely the tabling of a substantive motion by the leader of the

with now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we can simply move on to Government Orders as if 
nothing had happened when, in fact, the Chair of the House of 
Commons is being called into question. It would be much better, 
not only for the sake of all the members of this House, but also 
for the Chair itself and for parliament, to give absolute 
priority—and I thought there would be no doubt whatsoever about 
this—to the non-confidence motion moved by the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would not understand if you were to agree to

that the order paper contains a notice of motion under the 
heading of motions, which will be debated today in the House, in 
a debate that is rather serious to everyone and certainly to 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until we get to motions, however, this is only a notice of 
motion and the motion is not before the House.  If it is put 
before the House, it will no doubt be a motion of great 
importance, with a certain priority over other matters we may 
discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a motion before us at this time, which was moved by the 
hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and which is 
acceptable from the point of view of procedure and practice in 
this House.  I believe I am obliged, regardless of the notices 
of motion in the order paper, to continue with the business 
before the House. The motion has been presented and we need to 
consider it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the motion is not passed, we shall no doubt move on to 
another matter under Business of the House.  We shall probably 
then have an opportunity to discuss this very important motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the moment, I believe it is my duty to put to the House the 
motion of the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, could I ask a question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the impression, given the special nature of the 
substantive motion by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, that the 
48 hour period provided by the standing orders permitted and 
inevitably led to a debate on this substantive motion at the end 
of this period.  This means today, now, as we speak. 
make !sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put the following question to you. Are we to understand that 
if, through a motion, a political party raises the very serious 
matter of the credibility of the Chair and questions one of the 
foundations of the House of Commons, of parliament in Ottawa, 
the motion will be brought to the attention of the members only 
if the government wishes to debate the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That amounts to saying that, by giving precedence to a proposal 
by the parliamentary secretary, the Chair of the House of 
Commons accepts that if the government does not wish to debate a 
substantive motion such as confidence in the Speaker, we will 
not discuss it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is so basic that the members of the Bloc Quebecois 
unanimously want to debate this urgent matter now.  A lot of 
opposition party members are interested in debating the matter 
of the Chair and— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I have a great deal of 
respect for the hon. member for Roberval. It often happens in 
the House that some parties unanimously wish to discuss certain 
issues, while others do not. This is why we sometimes have votes 
concerning the order of business and the order of motions or 
bills in the House. We are now at Routine Proceedings.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>AN ACT TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR CLARITY AS SET

SECESSION REFERENCE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK124">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-20, an act to give effect to the requirement for 
clarity as set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada 
in the Quebec Secession Reference be read the third time and 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, now that the House of Commons has reached 
the last stage of its work on Bill C-20, I would like to take 
this opportunity to recognize the important work done by members 
of the legislative committee and the witnesses who contributed 
to the examination of this bill which is fundamental to the 
rights of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity to salute the vision 
of the Prime Minister of Canada, whose sense of duty has given 
Canadians this essential guarantee of their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every citizen of this country will be guaranteed two fundamental 
rights if, as it is desirable, the House of Commons and the 
Senate pass Bill C-20, the clarity act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, every Canadian will have the guarantee that the 
Government of Canada will never enter into negotiations on the 
separation of a province unless the population of that province 
has clearly expressed its will to cease to be part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the clarity act will guarantee to all Canadians that any 
such negotiations on secession, should they occur, would take 
place within the Canadian constitutional framework, respecting 
the principles identified by the supreme court: democracy, 
federalism, constitutionalism and the rule of law, and respect 
for minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clarity act will protect the rights and interests of all 
Canadians, but especially Quebecers, because it is in Quebec 
that the provincial government is contemplating a secession 
attempt in an atmosphere of confusion and outside the legal 
framework.  Quebecers want no part of that disturbing prospect. 
The clarity act is pro-Quebec and pro-democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is convinced that Bill C-20 complies 
fully with the supreme court's opinion.  Renowned legal scholars 
testified to that effect before the committee, including Dean 
Yves-Marie Morissette, former Quebec Justice Minister Gil 
Rémillard, and Dean Peter Hogg, who stated as follows. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote Professor Hogg: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, I think Bill C-20 is completely consistent with the Supreme 
Court's judgment, and I think it would be difficult to both 
support the decision of the court and reject the bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also convinced that Bill C-20 ensures that the 
House of Commons and the Government of Canada fulfil their 
obligations without infringing in any way on those of the 
provinces.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is noteworthy that no sitting provincial premier, with the 
exception of Quebec's, has criticized the clarity act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the legislative committee, in addition to Mr. Rémillard, who 
stated that, and I quote  “this bill respects Quebec's 
jurisdiction”, another former minister of the Government of 
Quebec, Claude Castonguay, stated “I have not seen anything in 
this bill (C-20) that limits the jurisdiction of Quebec's 
National Assembly, nor Quebecers' right to decide on their own 
future”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Ontario Premier Bob Rae stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I'm perfectly satisfied that the level of consultation that is 
provided for in the clarity bill is certainly adequate and 
nothing in the clarity bill takes away from the jurisdiction of 
any province. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may all have read in today's Calgary <I>Herald</I> the same 
unequivocal support for Bill C-20 of a former premier of another 
province and another political allegiance, Mr. Peter Lougheed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, it will be recalled that some witnesses, including 
Claude Ryan, told the committee that even if the federal 
government has the right, if not the duty, to assess the clarity 
of support for secession and to conduct itself accordingly, the 
House of Commons would not have the right to make a determination 
as to the clarity of the question before the referendum result 
were known,  The hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry, the 
Bloc's intergovernmental affairs critic, also shares this 
opinion. The House of Commons would have the right to make a 
determination, but only after the referendum, and to conduct 
itself accordingly.  So there is not that much distance 
separating us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In point of fact, however, as Professor Patrick Monahan has 
noted, if it is legal and legitimate for the House of Commons to 
express its opinion on clarity after the referendum, it is hard 
to see how it would be unable to do so beforehand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in purely practical terms, it is hard to imagine how 
the House of Commons and the Government of Canada could go 
through the whole referendum campaign without ever answering the 
simple question: Do you think the question is clear?  Voters 
would press them for an answer, and rightly so.  They would have 
the right to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the clarity of the question, and I will begin 
with two quotes. The first is this “We don't need to dress it up 
with a partnership”.  The second goes as follows “These 
institutions are just nonsense, it's just window dressing to sell 
it to people. I think we have to be straight with people if we 
want to sell our option”.  These calls for straight talk were 
made by PQ youth members at their meeting at the beginning of 
this month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be acknowledged by everyone that the question in 1995 
lacked in clarity, and that it could not lead to any 
negotiations as worded.  Anyone who still has any doubts on this 
would do well to consult the document submitted to the 
legislative committee by Professor Maurice Pinard.  It contains 
abundant evidence that the 1995 question gave rise to a great 
deal of confusion.  To give just one example, and I am quoting 
Professor Pinard “In 1995, only around 50% of voters knew that 
sovereignty-partnership was divisible.  The rest believed that 
there would be no sovereignty without partnership at the same 
time”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The separatist leaders would do better to aim for maximum 
clarity.  So why is it so difficult to acknowledge that only a 
question on secession can give rise to negotiations on 
secession?  With clarity, everyone wins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, let us talk about the clarity of the majority.  In Canadian 
federal law as in Quebec law, a referendum is a consultation 
whose results must be evaluated by the political authorities. 
There is no legal majority threshold at which point a referendum 
would lose its consultative nature to become a decisive one 
binding governments.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The separatist leaders accept this rule of law for municipal, 
and they accept it for  held by aboriginal peoples, but they do 
not accept it for a referendum on the secession of Quebec.  They 
say it is undemocratic to challenge the threshold of 50% plus 
one in determining whether a majority is sufficiently clear to 
trigger negotiations on secession. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that anyone can question Mr. Ed Broadbent's 
deep-rooted commitment to democracy.  He has devoted his life to 
it.  This is what he had to say to the legislative committee. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be misleading in my view to describe democracy as simply 
a system in which all decisions are reached on a 50% plus one 
basis.  In fact I would argue that...the more serious decisions 
require much more than 50% plus one, and some require unanimity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the separatists say that Mr. Broadbent is anti-democratic? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Claude Ryan reiterated to the committee his preference for a 
minimum threshold of 50% plus one of all registered voters. 
Will he have to be called undemocratic as well? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone knows, the clarity bill does not set a threshold. 
The clarity bill provides that the majority will be the subject 
of a qualitative assessment following a referendum.  In actual 
fact it is very difficult to set a minimum threshold in advance 
which would guarantee a clear majority in all circumstances. 
Indeed, setting a threshold in advance would likely be contrary 
to the spirit of the supreme court's opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Dean Hogg told the committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just don't think there is a constitutional basis for doing that 
and that is why fidelity to the court's judgment requires us now 
to wait until after the referendum. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not setting a threshold in advance is consistent with our law 
and with Canadian tradition regarding referendums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Government of Canada did not commit itself in 
advance to accepting Newfoundland as a province of Canada on the 
basis of a 50% plus one majority in the 1948 referendum. 
Instead, the Government of Canada proceeded exactly as provided 
for in Bill C-20.  It waited for the referendum result before it 
came to a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about international practice, including the United 
Nations, the separatist leaders ask? Again, I must reiterate that 
the UN generally supervises referendums held in the context of 
decolonization, in which the UN recognizes right to independence 
and expresses a strong preference for this political solution, as 
professor Jean-Pierre Derriennic so eloquently told the 
legislative committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than in cases of decolonization, the UN has shown no 
sympathy for secession whatsoever, and has even opposed it 
completely, as in the case of Katanga.  It does not make 
secession a right, and certainly not a right that can be 
exercised on the fragile basis of 50% plus one of the ballots 
cast in a referendum held only in the territory where secession 
would take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To believe that the Government of Quebec could obtain 
international recognition under such circumstances is to display 
a profound misunderstanding of state practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the clarity bill does nothing undemocratic in establishing, 
in accordance with the supreme court's opinion, that the clarity 
of a future referendum majority in favour of secession be 
subject to assessment.  On the contrary, Bill C-20 displays an 
unusual openness, in a democracy, toward the widely opposed 
phenomenon of secession, as professor Robert Young, the author 
of a major book on secession, told the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all on the subject of the clarity of the majority.  I 
will now consider the aboriginal issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the negotiation of secession raises many issues, it was 
the issue of aboriginals that dominated a good part of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking to the committee, Quebec's Canadian intergovernmental 
affairs minister, Mr. Joseph Facal, maintained a position and 
the opposite at the same time.  On the one hand, he cited 
international legal texts recalling that, although aboriginals 
are nations, and I quote the minister, “aboriginal rights must 
be exercised within sovereign states”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, he stated that accessions to independence for 
nations such as Quebec were, and I quote, “purely a factual 
matter”, a political rather than a legal issue—an allegation 
incidentally contradicted by the supreme court, which states in 
paragraph 83 of its opinion that “Secession is a legal act as 
much as a political one”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, he and his government believe themselves to be 
free to act outside the law, but aboriginal populations, for 
their part, would have to submit to the law.  Clearly a double 
standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must surely be somewhat embarrassing to give oneself a right 
and deny it to others.  We know that the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, the Bloc's intergovernmental affairs 
critic, was of the opinion, before he entered politics, that the 
aboriginal peoples could remain in Canada in the event of 
Quebec's secession.  And, the esteemed witnesses invited by the 
Bloc to appear before the legislative committee have maintained 
that point of view: professors André Tremblay, Andrée Lajoie and 
Guy Lachapelle and the head of the Confederation of National 
Trade Unions, Mr. Marc Laviolette. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-20 the Government of Canada commits itself to 
addressing in negotiating secession the rights, interests and 
territorial claims of the aboriginal peoples of Canada.  The 
Assembly of First Nations, the Grand Council of the Crees and the 
Inuit Tapirisat of Canada called for stronger guarantees before 
the legislative committee.  Several other witnesses, including 
Mr. Jack Jedwab, made proposals to better take into account the 
rights of aboriginals, and of minorities in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal and NDP members of the committee showed strong support 
for amendments that would make guarantees for aboriginals more 
explicit.  The validity of these suggestions led the Government 
of Canada to support two amendments proposed by the NDP and 
supported by the Liberal members of the committee.  The scope of 
these amendments is to explicitly mention representatives of the 
aboriginal peoples of Canada among those whose views would be 
taken into consideration by the House of Commons when assessing 
the clarity of the question and of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Mr. Phil 
Fontaine, indicated that he was satisfied with these 
modifications, but was disappointed that the role of aboriginal 
representatives in negotiations on secession had not been more 
clearly defined.  On this matter, and I want to stress this, the 
reason subsection 3(1) of the clarity bill mentions among the 
participants in possible future negotiations on secession only 
the governments of the provinces and the Government of Canada is 
that these are the only political actors to which the court 
assigned an obligation to negotiate in the event of clear support 
for secession.  However, neither the court nor Bill C-20 rule out 
the possibility of other political actors participating in those 
negotiations, including representatives of the aboriginal peoples 
of Canada.  Simply put, it was not for Bill C-20 to go beyond the 
court's reference by creating an obligation for actors other than 
those to which the court assigned such an obligation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to add that, according to the Constitution Act, 1982, the 
federal and provincial governments are bound by an agreement in 
principle by virtue of which representatives of the aboriginal 
peoples would be invited to participate in discussions on any 
constitutional amendment that would affect the provisions of the 
constitution that are mentioned in subsection 35(1).

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clarity act respects that principle by clearly stipulating 
that negotiations on secession would include at least the 
governments of the provinces and the Government of Canada.  I 
stress “at least”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, complying with all points of the supreme court's 
opinion and giving effect to it, the clarity bill guarantees to 
all Canadians that their federal government will never negotiate 
the secession of a province, unless the House of Commons has 
determined that the population of that province has expressed 
its will to cease to be part of Canada.  The clarity bill 
guarantees them that any such negotiations, should they occur, 
would respect the rule of law and constitutional principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, who ferociously opposed 
Bill C-20, have merely succeeded in creating the impression that 
they know full well they are incapable, through straight talk 
and clarity, of convincing Quebecers that secession is the best 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that Quebecers, and indeed all other Canadians, have 
a right to clarity rather than ambiguity and to the protection 
of the law rather than anarchy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that Quebecers and indeed all other Canadians have a 
right to clarity rather than ambiguity and to the protection of

</I></B></P><P align=left>The time for ambiguity has passed.  I call on all members of the 
House to vote in favour of the clarity act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. There has been consultation among the parties and if you were to 
ask, I think you would find unanimous consent for the motion that 
the 18th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs presented on Wednesday, March 1, be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> 
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent of the House to 
move the motion?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
give the official opposition's comments at third reading of the 
clarity bill, Bill C-20. We approached this bill with some broad 
principles in mind.  I would like to list those broad principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition supported the issue of clarity of the 
question.  We undertook to try and pin down the majority.  We 
felt that broad consultation on an issue like this was best.  We 
felt that there were many more issues on the table than were 
listed in the bill.  We also felt there were a significant number 
of positive changes to the federation that would be more useful 
than rules for a battle. 
Today I would like to report on how we did with those broad 
principles.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of a clear question, this is where I believe the 
bill has been a success.  The old question, the question asked 
previously was ambiguous and open to misunderstanding.  It was a 
two pronged question.  It asked about partnership on one hand and 
sovereignty on the other hand in the same question.  It made it 
difficult to say yes or no to that question and be certain what 
one was saying yes or no to. I listened carefully to one of the 
senior Quebec politicians, Claude Castonguay, as it related to 
the question.  He felt as I did that the question was not clear. 
It was not unambiguous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also used a pollster's comment to bolster that statement. The 
pollster told me that a question such as this could not be asked 
and get a legitimate result.  He felt that if the question were 
split in two, it could legitimately be considered clear.  In 
other words:  do you want to have an improved partnership with 
Canada, yes or no, and if that failed, do you want to leave 
Canada, yes or no.  The pollster guided me in the sense that the 
question prior was not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will result in a clear question.  I sincerely hope the 
House of Commons never has to pass judgment on a question.  I 
believe that a question coming from a province on this issue will 
never ever be as ambiguous as the last one.  Surely for something 
as serious as secession, the least we can expect is to have a 
clear unambiguous question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of majority, how did we do?  We just listened to 
the minister opposite say that setting a threshold would be a 
mistake and so a threshold has not been set.  I would say that we 
have failed on that issue.  Our position was that 50% plus one of 
the votes cast was the threshold.  I did listen to the debate on 
that and there were good arguments on both sides.  I must say I 
found some of those arguments persuasive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would however like to use the example of Massachusetts as it 
parted from Maine as to how a particular threshold that was set 
to prevent secession did not succeed.  This was a fairly low 
threshold.  In 1786 independence became an issue for 
Massachusetts trying to secede from Maine.  This was a state. 
Maine was a district.  Massachusetts wanted to become a state. 
They went through seven referenda, each time asking for secession 
from Maine.  When it looked like it was close to Massachusetts 
succeeding, Maine raised the threshold to five votes out of nine, 
or 55.6%.  The vote subsequently did not reach that threshold. It 
reached 53.6% but public pressure resulted in secession of 
Massachusetts from Maine with a very low threshold of 53.6%. 
Artificially raising the threshold, leaving the threshold 
ambiguous in my view is not wise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third issue was broad consultation.  We felt that broad 
consultation was better than just a small group of people coming 
to Ottawa.  We failed on that issue as well.  There was no 
travelling.  We had but one week of committee hearings. Many 
witnesses were unable to attend. No amendments were put forth at 
committee.  There were internal reasons that no amendments were 
put forward.  We did gain one thing.  The proceedings were 
televised.  That was one concession, one tiny victory on the 
issue of broad consultation so I would have to say that we failed 
on that score as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the fourth issue of broadening the issues, the bill mentions 
debt and assets, boundaries, minority rights and aboriginal 
concerns.  We felt and still feel that there are many other 
issues here: citizenship, passports, the Canadian dollar, 
international recognition, an Atlantic corridor particularly 
relating to Quebec, defence issues including military assets. 
There is also the issue that was never discussed, the one of 
rejoining Canada in the event a province seceded and then decided 
it had made a mistake. 
All those issues could have been discussed at least.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I make comments on a bill or process I always like to say 
how we would have done things differently.  How would Reform, if 
we were the government, have had a different impact on the 
clarity legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would have been broader consultation.  Not just one 
province but every province would have had input at the committee 
level.  There would have been more issues on the table. I have 
mentioned those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our bill would not be proclaimed.  In other words the bill we 
would have passed would have gone through all the legislative 
processes and then would have been set on the shelf as an 
unproclaimed bill only to be used in the event of a secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our bill would have had a 50% plus one threshold in it.  That 
threshold of course would have also been used for that part of 
Quebec that wanted to stay in Canada in the event of secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The haste we went through in relation to this bill was 
unnecessary and unwise.  It gives those who would fight against 
Canada a little bit of a tool to say that we were not as 
democratic as we could have been.  That is a legitimate 
complaint.  I am afraid that I as an ally of the government on 
this bill still feel that the haste was unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that the official opposition will continue 
to support this bill.  I have mentioned areas that could have 
been improved.  We support it on the basis and the premise that 
an informed vote is a powerful vote.  I have a simple statement 
for Quebecers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I 
rise in this House, I usually say I am pleased to do so. I am 
not in the habit of rising in this House without any pleasure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that it is with some sadness and a great deal of 
frustration that I rise now, at the end of this day, after we 
have debated the proposed amendments to this bill for the past 
few days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I chose to become a member of this parliament where I was 
elected, together with my colleagues from the Bloc 
Quebecois—those who were elected in 1993 and those who were in 
1997—to adequately represent the citizens who elected us to this 
place, and to do so with a democratic mandate to act and speak 
up in this House on behalf of our constituents who elected us to 
defend their interests and promote sovereignty, a plan very dear 
to a great many Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this debate, I noticed that we were dealing not only 
with foes of sovereignty, but also with people, members and 
ministers on the government side, who had become foes of Quebec 
democracy. Through their comments and reactions regarding our 
plan to turn Quebec into a sovereign state, they were not trying 
to respect neither this plan nor the citizens who elected 
sovereignist MPs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole process surrounding Bill C-20 has demonstrated how 
little respect there is in this country, in this Parliament, for 
what we stand for in this House and for the people we represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 is undemocratic. We will keep on repeating it. We will 
have many opportunities to do so after it has been passed by the 
House and the Senate and given assent by the Governor General. 
We will no doubt have an election campaign where Bill C-20 will 
be a major issue and where Quebecers will have a chance to pass 
judgment on the conduct of a majority, the Liberal Party, that 
did not show even the most basic respect for the members of this 
House and the citizens they represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleagues, I would like to tell you how sitting 
in the House of Commons, whose traditions, customs and practices 
we have always respected, has become difficult and will probably 
be made more difficult yet by the introduction of Bill C-20 and 
its possible passage by the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one thinks about it and in spite of the assurances, 
guarantees and suggestions by the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, with the passage of Bill C-20, this country is becoming 
a pioneer in the area of secession, a democratic country 
unrivalled anywhere in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members look very carefully at this bill, at its provisions and 
at its purpose, if they read the speeches that the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs made when he appeared before the 
committee, they will realize that this bill is ultimately an 
instrument to prevent, and I quote the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, “a separation threat from Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need a bill telling us that we are a threat to Canada. 
That is not what it is all about. We have the right, and the 
supreme court recognized it in its opinion dated August 20, 
1998, to promote sovereignty for Quebec. 
This is a legitimate initiative according to the supreme court. 
To pretend that we pose a threat to Canada, that we are 
threatening it with secession or break-up, as mentioned in the 
preamble of this bill, does not respect this legitimacy 
recognized by nine justices of the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But more than anything, it does not respect Quebecers who 
consider the sovereignty project as an option for the future, an 
option they are entitled to consider and to support when 
consulted on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the committee hearings, there was a striking testimony 
that left the Liberal members of the committee quite lost and 
disappointed, which the minister quoted earlier in the debate, 
and that is that of Mr. Claude Ryan, a previous leader of the 
opposition in Quebec's legislative assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While debating or discussing with some of us, here is what he 
had to say regarding the behaviour of the Liberal government, of 
the ministers and of the government members of this House: 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said “You know, in Quebec, sovereignists and federalists are 
adversaries, but they respect each other. Here in Ottawa, 
however, sovereignists and federalists are enemies. They do not 
respect each other”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always believed that those who do not necessarily think 
as we do and who promote federalism and its renewal deserve our 
respect. As far as I am concerned, I have always respected those 
who propose or would like to propose this project to Quebecers, 
a project which, if it were renewed, could promote a greater 
following than the present federalism. But theses views are not 
shared by all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that respect for the sovereignists that we are does not 
exist here in this House since we are considered as enemies of 
the Canadian democracy, when we are in fact, by our mere 
presence here, participating in this democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are undoubtedly the ones who have the most respect for 
parliamentary democracy in this House. We have so much respect 
that we try to protect not only our rights—and we had to do so 
repeatedly during debate on Bill C-20—but we also want to ensure 
that the rights of all the parliamentarians in this House are 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see before us enemies of democracy in Quebec and enemies 
of those who, in the name of democracy, promote sovereignty, it 
is difficult not to consider those who make such a harsh and 
dangerous judgment on what we represent here as enemies of 
democracy in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 is an eloquent example of the fact that this government 
tries, as the minister said earlier in his speech, to protect 
Quebecers against themselves or against sovereignists, their 
representatives and their independentist leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers do not need to be protected against themselves or 
against their independentist leaders. They vote for 
independentist leaders and they put their confidence in them. 
They have done so on numerous occasions in the past by electing 
successive governments of the Parti Québécois. They have put 
their trust in independentist leaders by electing, in the last 
two consecutive federal elections, a very clear majority of 
members of the Bloc Quebecois to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To think that this House can stand in for independentist leaders 
and the national assembly, where sovereignists have the 
majority, and that it can ignore the opposition of the members 
of the Bloc Quebecois shows a lack or even an absence of respect 
for Quebec's democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 would stand in for our institutions and give the House 
of Commons the power to decide on something that has always been 
determined by the national assembly, namely the question and its 
clarity in a debate which might take place and which has 
actually taken place in the National Assembly during two 
previous public consultations on sovereignty. The House of 
Commons will never be able to substitute itself for the National 
Assembly when time comes to formulate a question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This House will never be able to impose on the national assembly 
and its members a question which would exclude a partnership, a 
question which would prevent us to ask for a mandate to 
negotiate, a question which would be imposed because the issue 
here is about the future of Quebec as it is promoted by members 
who were elected to the national assembly by Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 precisely purports to give members of the House of 
Commons, of which a large majority comes from English Canada, 
the power to decide on the clarity of a question asked by the 
national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the bill is unacceptable and undemocratic to the 
point where it would allow the House to make a judgment on the 
clarity of the question even during a referendum campaign. The 
House of Commons could say, while the campaign is under way, 
that the question is not clear. Would this not be a totally 
unacceptable intrusion in a democratic process that was launched 
by the national assembly and the elected representatives of the 
Quebec people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions concerning clarity in this bill are undemocratic, 
despite what the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs thinks, 
because they give the House a right of disallowance on a 
decision made by the national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Claude Ryan, to quote him again, thought this was somewhat a 
trusteeship system. It was giving the House a trusteeship over 
the National Assembly when it came to the question and the 
assessment of its clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does this provision on the question and its clarity 
reveal the undemocratic nature of this bill, but the provisions 
on majority infringe even more adversely upon Quebec democracy 
as it was developed and fashioned by many generations of people 
who have exercised the highest political functions in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claims that the 50% plus one rule has not been 
applied or considered applicable during the referendums on 
sovereignty association or sovereignty partnership, because it 
is not written in the Referendum Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Undoubtedly it was not included because it was so clear and 
obvious that it was the applicable rule. In fact, that rule had 
never been generally challenged by Canadian leaders. It is 
universally accepted. Since that rule no longer seems acceptable 
to the Government of Canada and the Liberal Party of Canada, it 
must be enshrined in Quebec legislation, which is the purpose of 
Bill 99 now before the National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 50% plus one rule is acceptable and accepted. The Liberal 
government did not have the courage to include it in this bill 
despite the insistence of the opposition parties. Three of the 
opposition parties thought this bill should have contained a 
reference to the clear majority rule of 50% plus one vote. This 
lack of courage shows fear on the part of the government with 
regard to the 50% plus one rule.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fear that Quebecers will make the decision because 
sovereignty is an option that can be negotiated, that must be 
negotiated as soon as a majority of voters have decided to 
choose that option. So it has been suggested that this is an 
irreversible and serious decision, because we are told that 
these majorities are unstable. But that is supposing and stating 
that they are, that is supposing that any decision on a people's 
future is irreversible and is binding on future generations, and 
that is prejudging the decision future generations will make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20, which will be enacted, is unacceptable to Quebecers, 
as it should be to all Canadians. 
Moreover, Canadians in other provinces abide by the rule of 50% 
plus one; it is the case in British Columbia and Alberta for 
example.  That rule is universally applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the minister and others claim that the last few 
accessions to independence, whether in a colonial or non 
colonial context, were accomplished with considerable 
majorities, we must not forget that the rule that applies to 
accession to sovereignty is still the 50% plus one rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That rule is universally accepted. It is accepted by the United 
Nations, it was accepted during the 1980 and 1995 referendums 
and, even if we were told repeatedly that Prime Minister Trudeau 
and the present Prime Minister claimed that it was not the 
applicable rule and that it was not sufficient for them to feel 
bound to negotiate after a vote in favour of 
sovereignty-association or sovereignty-partnership, we must 
recall that these prime ministers were deceiving the public.  As 
they were saying this rule did not apply or would not bring them 
to negotiate, they were also telling Quebecers “You must 
understand, either you stay or you leave.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few days before the May 20, 1980 referendum, Mr. Trudeau 
put the seats of all his MPs at stake.  Quebecers, who are said 
to be confused by the questions of sovereignists, understood the 
question quite well. 
We called on the intelligence of Quebecers with complex 
questions, not confusing ones, as several witnesses before the 
legislative committee on Bill C-20 pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prime Ministers Trudeau and Chrétien themselves confused 
Canadians when they told them that a no vote in the referendum 
meant yes to the renewal of federalism. It was not clear. The no 
vote of Quebecers in 1980 and again in 1995 was not clear. 
Maurice Pinard, a colleague of mine from McGill University, had 
to admit he himself had not conducted any study or analysis on 
the possible confusion created in the minds of Quebecers by 
prereferendum promises made by federalist leaders. Odd, is it 
not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only confusion around is supposed to be in the sovereignist 
camp. 
But what about the confusion created by generations of 
federalist leaders claiming this federation can be renewed, can 
be changed to meet Quebec's demands and expectations? They have 
never been able to carry out their plan to renew the federation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When they tried to carry out a reform, be it the one proposed in 
the Meach Lake accord or in the Charlottetown accord, they were 
defeated by Canadian public opinion, in the case of the Meech 
Lake accord, or by people or provincial leaders who refused to 
ratify the accord. They were again defeated in 1992 by the 
Canadian people, who refused to change the Canadian federal 
system because of irreconcilable differences of opinion on 
federalism both in Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will never really persuade Quebecers that they did 
not understand the questions in 1995 and 1980, because they 
understood them perfectly well. They voted to maintain the 
federation and we, as democrats, respected their decision, but 
that decision is not immutable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers who keep their options open witnessed and examined 
what was going on in the House. They will be persuaded that Bill 
C-20 curtails their freedom, and is some kind of yoke, or a new 
padlock act, passed by Ottawa this time. They will also realize 
how this government and the Liberal Party of Canada wanted this 
legislation to be passed in a hurry, even if that meant ignoring 
the most basic rules of parliamentary democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To create an artificial and partisan deadline for the benefit of 
one political party, the Liberal Party of Canada, showed a total 
lack of respect for this House. The Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and the Prime Minister want to go 
before not all Canadians, but their own party members with Bill 
C-20 in their pockets. They want to stand tomorrow in front of 
the members of the Liberal Party of Canada and say “We have 
succeeded in bringing Quebec to heel. We have managed to pass 
legislation that will give us the last word on the question and 
on the majority”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the government majority party, Quebec should no 
longer be master of its own destiny. That party shall rule 
Quebec. And Quebecers will never agree to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Bloc Quebecois was created, Quebecers have not trusted 
the Liberal Party of Canada. 
I should remind those who are watching the debates that, in the 
1993 federal election, the Liberal Party of Canada had only 19 
candidates elected out of the 75 members representing Quebec in 
this House. In 1997, only 26 Liberals were elected to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party of Canada does not represent Quebecers. It 
does not represent the interests of Quebec. Today, with Bill 
C-20, it is showing it clearly. What it does with Bill C-20 is 
trample on the democratic rights of Quebecers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers saw how eager it was to flout not only Quebec's 
democracy and democratic institutions, but also the rules of the 
parliament in which it is abusing its majority. That is what it 
has been doing since the day in December when the minister 
used a trick to introduce a draft bill, flouting right from the 
beginning of the consideration of Bill C-20 the rules of the 
House and parliamentary traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It flouted them again following a few interventions in the House 
in December and February. It imposed closure and allowed only 
seven members of our party to speak to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party limited to 45 the number of witnesses the 
legislative committee could hear and the committee was able to 
hear only 39 of those witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also imposed closure to end debate and stop the hearings all 
opposition parties would have liked to continue. These parties 
all wanted the committee to travel throughout Quebec and Canada 
and the Bloc was more than willing to hear the views of other 
Canadians on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the committee was not to travel. It had to hear 45 witnesses 
here in Ottawa. What was the minister afraid of? Why did he 
oppose the committee travelling around Canada and Quebec with 
his Bill C-20? Was he afraid to be told in all the cities of 
Quebec, in Quebec's national capital, in Montreal, the 
metropolis, and in all the regions that we from the Bloc 
represent that his bill was antidemocratic? He did not have the 
courage of his convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he was convinced that Bill C-20 was an acceptable bill, why 
did he refuse to go to Quebec to defend it? Why did he refuse to 
go to Quebec to hear those who are in favour of it, those he 
talks to when he goes to chambers of commerce and elsewhere, but 
also to hear those in the civil society, the unions, the 
teachers, the young and the students who oppose it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While claiming to be afraid of nothing, he did not have the 
courage of his convictions. He told the committee he was afraid 
of nothing, yet he was afraid to go to Quebec. He was afraid to 
hear Quebecers tell him that this bill is an undemocratic 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was afraid of the opposition parties, which wanted a full and 
meaningful debate to take place, instead of cutting it short on 
the eve of a Liberal Party convention, putting a premature end 
to testimonies and actually preventing dozens if not hundreds of 
people from appearing before the committee. There are people who 
sent in briefs but were not heard, in spite of the fact that 
they had contacted the clerk to indicate they were interested in 
testifying before the committee. No, debates had to be limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, the proceedings of that committee had to be made very 
partisan. 
There were witnesses for the Liberal Party and witnesses for the 
Bloc Quebecois and the other parties. My colleague, the 
minister, believes, I suppose, that meaningful and in-depth 
debates are necessary, and that bills require proper 
consideration if we want good legislation. According to many of 
the people who came to talk to us about the rules that should 
apply if we were to go ahead with the sovereignty plan for 
example, legislation should reflect consensus. They said there 
should be a consensus to hold a referendum on sovereignty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has often said “Do not organize a referendum if 
there is no consensus to that effect in Quebec. Unless there is 
a consensus, do not hold a referendum even if you were elected 
with a mandate to organize one and the possibility to hold one, 
if this was the choice of the democratically elected party”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose this requirement should apply even more to a bill 
aimed at regulating referendums which are required to be based on 
a consensus before being organized. There is no consensus in 
Quebec concerning Bill C-20. Three political parties from the 
National Assembly are against this bill. The minister knows it. 
He has made representations to political parties that see more 
eye to eye with him, and they have said this project is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The civil society of Quebec is clearly opposed to this bill. 
When we rise later to vote on Bill C-20, presumably 49 out of 
the 75 members from Quebec will be against it. Over 60% of the 
members of parliament will vote against this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will have no legitimacy. It will not stop Quebec from 
deciding its own future. 
Contrary to what the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
thinks, it will not be binding on the Quebec government. The 
minister was caught in a contradiction when Minister Facal 
appeared before the committee. Mr. Facal said that the 
government would not feel bound by this illegal bill, after 
having heard the minister and all those promoting this bill say 
that it only concerned the federal government and the federal 
institutions. And yet the minister has said that the Quebec 
government would have to comply with this bill, a contradiction 
eloquently brought to light by the editorial writer for <I>Le 
Soleil</I>, Michel Venne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate will not end here. It will continue as long as Bloc 
Quebecois members sit in this House, and they will be here for a 
long time to defend the interests of the people of Quebec and of 
democracy in Quebec. 
This is our mandate, one that we must take more and more 
seriously, because there are people in this House who want to 
hold this democracy hostage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to add this on behalf of Bloc Quebecois 
members. We Bloc Quebecois members having been democratically 
elected to represent Quebecers in the Parliament of Canada, 
holding the majority of Quebec seats and defending the interests 
of the people of Quebec and of democracy in Quebec, affirm that 
Bill C-20 is undemocratic and that it has no legitimacy 
whatsoever on the territory of Quebec.

C-20 fits within a history marked by full-fledged attacks against 
the Quebec nation, particularly the Union Act of 1840, 
conscription in 1918 and 1944, the War Measures Act of 1970, the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP began the consideration of Bill C-20 with a number of 
concerns, but we supported the bill in principle and supported 
the view that in any future referendum in Quebec there needs to 
be a clear question and that the House of Commons has a right to 
have a say in whether or not that question is clear. 
We supported the view that there needs to be a clear expression 
of the will of the people of Quebec or any other province, and we 
recognize the value of the supreme court opinion that the 
judgment, in some respects, can only be made qualitatively after 
the fact of the referendum, although we did raise concerns with 
respect to whether or not there could be amendments which would 
have at least fixed the numerical aspect of the judgment that 
needed to be made.  We therefore moved amendments having to do 
with 50% plus one—

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I apologize to the 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona, but in the spirit of 
co-operation, I would ask for unanimous consent that the

Winnipeg—Transcona to make a 15 minute intervention without

that the time allocated both to my hon. colleague from the NDP 
and my hon. colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party be 
extended? Does this apply to both? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> That is right. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I express my thanks to the 
government and to my colleagues for extending my time as the NDP 
spokesperson and also the time of my colleague from the 
Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying that we had a number of concerns about the bill.  I 
cited the fact that we were concerned about an aspect of the bill 
that left open the possibility of some abuse on the part of the 
federal government after a referendum in jacking up the numerical 
majority that might be needed in order to justify the decision 
that there was a clear mandate.  We moved amendments in that 
respect and we moved them in a way that I thought was consistent 
with the fact that there was still a qualitative judgment to be 
made after the referendum.  However, the government rejected 
those amendments for reasons of its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also had concerns about the role of the Senate.  We moved 
amendments in that regard and those amendments were defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and I think most importantly from my point of view, we 
had a number of amendments dealing with the role of aboriginal 
peoples in the process that the bill sought to set up with 
respect to how this House would determine whether or not there 
was a clear question and a clear majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we sought was to move amendments which would have done the 
following:  they would have added to the list in those sections 
of the bill that listed those institutions or those parties which 
the government would have to take into account the views of; and 
on that list there was the House of Commons, the Senate, the 
provincial governments and the territories.  Our amendments were 
to the effect that the aboriginal peoples, in particular the 
aboriginal peoples of the province which was seeking to secede, 
would be added to that list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a number of other amendments that were of concern to 
aboriginal peoples, in particular the aboriginal peoples listed 
as those who would be represented in any talks or any 
negotiations having to do with secession, and some other 
amendments having to do with the fiduciary responsibility of the 
federal government with respect to aboriginal rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We worked on these amendments all through the process.  It was a 
matter of great disappointment to me that I did not actually get 
to move these amendments in committee because of the process, 
although in the end it may have been a blessing.  They probably 
would have been defeated in committee at that time and then the 
government having once defeated them might have been even more 
reluctant than it was to have consented to some of those 
amendments in the final analysis.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it turned out, in the hours just before the amendments were 
to be voted on, discussions were continuing with the government. 
The last time I rose in the House to speak at report stage, I 
have to say that I rose with the impression that no amendments 
were going to be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members may remember that I was a bit angry and that I 
spoke in anger.  I might say that it was justified anger.  I felt 
that none of the amendments were going to be accepted and, 
frankly, that would have had the effect of making it very 
difficult for the NDP to have continued to extend the support to 
the bill which we extended at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of our amendments were accepted.  They were important 
amendments.  Indeed, they have been recognized as such by the 
Assembly of First Nations, the Grand Council of the Crees, the 
minister himself and members of the committee from the Liberal 
Party, the Conservative Party and the NDP who supported them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was unfortunate that the amendments could not have received 
the unanimous support of the House.  The Bloc Quebecois and the 
Reform Party did not support those amendments, but nevertheless 
the amendments are there.  They do not add any new status for 
aboriginal people, but they make sure that in this very important 
bill a status which they already have is recognized.  The danger 
was that by not having them on that list, and listed in that way, 
then that could have been seen as a way of diminishing or not 
recognizing the status which they already have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these amendments having been accepted, I think I can say 
with great certainty that the NDP as a caucus will be supporting 
Bill C-20 at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has not been easy.  There are many in my party and 
elsewhere who feel that somehow Bill C-20 is an attack on or 
contrary to the principle of Quebec self-determination. 
Particularly within the New Democratic Party there are people who 
feel that somehow Bill C-20 is contrary to our traditional 
position of support for the self-determination of Quebec.  If I 
thought that was so, I would not support Bill C-20 and neither 
would my colleagues behind me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view not only does Bill C-20 recognize the right of 
Quebec to self-determination, it entrenches and recognizes in law 
the right of Quebec to self-determination.  However, it says that 
this has to be achieved by virtue of a legitimate process that 
was outlined by the supreme court in its opinion.  What this law 
attempted to do was to give legislative incarnation, if you like, 
to the supreme court's opinion.  I believe that Bill C-20 meets 
that test.  I do not think it is contrary to the principle of 
self-determination for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also a lot of people with whom we normally agree who 
feel that this bill is a violation of their commitment to what is 
sometimes called plan A; that is to say, keeping Quebec in 
the federation and resolving problems of national unity by 
renewing the federation in a way that Quebecers feel that some of 
their longstanding aspirations and grievances can be met within 
the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, all of us here are plan A types.  We have had one 
plan A after another plan A.  We urge the federal 
government and the minister to come up their own plan A. 
One of our criticisms of the Liberal government has been that we 
do not feel it has a sufficient plan A.  Not everybody 
feels this way, but we also feel that to be committed to a plan 
A is not to take the view that there cannot be a plan 
B.  We do not take the view that there is no plan B, 
if you like, in Quebec among separatists, among sovereignists; 
that is to say, a plan which may try to configure events in such 
a way that Quebec could be led into a situation of secession or 
negotiations on secession which are not the result of a clear 
question and a clear majority.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot come at this innocently.  I think there is a 
legitimate means to self-determination and to secession.  I hope 
that day never comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we will have a plan A.  Even if we never have a 
plan A that works and is implemented, I think we have a 
country worth belonging to and a country worth keeping, no matter 
what.  However, I would urge the government to get busy on having 
its own plan A. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois that I do not see 
anything undemocratic about requiring that there be a clear 
question and requiring that there be a clear expression of the 
will of the Quebec people.  If I was a separatist I would say 
that would be the minimum condition I would want anyway before I 
sought to take my province out of the confederation.  I have to 
say that I do not understand that objection, at least when it 
comes in the form of accusing Bill C-20 of being anti-democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it comes in the form of saying that the House of Commons and 
the federal government have no jurisdiction, I can at least 
understand that claim.  I do not accept it because I think that 
the rest of Canada does have some say and is entitled to some say 
in what will bring them to the table and on what conditions we 
would agree to talk about secession; that it is not just up to 
Quebec to say what conditions should bring two parties to the 
table.  Quebec can say what conditions would bring itself to the 
table to negotiate secession, but if there are two parties to a 
negotiation, the other party has the right to say what would 
bring it to the table.  That, in my view, is what Bill C-20 does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all those reasons, the NDP caucus has decided to support the 
bill at third reading.  We have been very unhappy with the 
process.  I still say to the minister that I do not think it 
needed to be rushed like this.  I think we could have done a 
better job than we did, but I am very happy that we succeeded in 
the final hours of this debate in getting the amendments we did. 
I hope that Bill C-20 is a bill which none of us ever has the 
occasion to use.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the government and all the parties for their 
kindness and broadmindedness in giving my NDP colleague and 
myself a last chance to speak to Bill C-20. For the Progressive 
Conservative Party, the debate is only beginning in the other 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill  C-20 was extremely difficult, frustrating, disturbing  and 
alarming. Because of the possible failure of the country's unity 
of the country, the Prime Minister and his government have gone, 
in a few years, from indifference to constitutional matters in 
1993 to the whip. That is what the government just did. 
After Bill C-20, what happens? It will be the government's 
the latent period. All will be settled, there will not be any 
changes. I often say that a country evolves at the same pace as 
his citizens. Legislation absolutely must evolve also.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important legislation in this country, one that affects 
us every day, which is the basis of everything, is the 
Constitution Act.  But the government is budging very little if 
at all.  Why not strive constantly to keep up with developments 
in the country?  It is not doing anything.  It says “We do not 
want to talk about it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government does decide to talk about it, it turns up 
with a bill that is going to settle what exactly in the end? 
Nothing, absolutely nothing at all.  This is a false comfort 
zone, false security.  Just look at the Reformers' argument: the 
vast majority of their basis for supporting the bill or not is 
to say that they are 90% in disagreement but they will support 
it anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They voted against an amendment concerning the first nations, 
but they support it anyway.  Where is the logic in that?  It is 
a political logic.  According to the polls, everyone wants a 
clear question and a clear majority.  Running a country requires 
principles and guidelines.  Yet the bill is not clear.  We are 
trying to explain that to people, and we are trying to explain 
that to ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that this has been difficult for our party and our 
caucus.  Nevertheless, we are not going to give up just because 
it is difficult.  It is not because a problem is hard to 
overcome that we will not overcome it.  That is not the way we 
operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not clear. 
Is the question clear? Where can we see, when we read the bill, 
what the question will be, what its major thrust will be? I 
tested it with people who will have to vote yes or no. They do 
not know. They do not understand. Will we have a battle between 
legal experts? I asked people who have read the bill “What do 
you think would constitute a majority?” Their answer was either 
“It has to be clear” or “I don't know”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, could it be 50% plus one, 60% plus one? Let me give 
you a figure that no longer applies today: 91%. The Prime 
Minister got that majority two years ago. Now, that majority has 
been eroded, and even his own Liberal members are questioning 
his leadership. The majority was 91%. One can see how faulty the 
logic is. It is clearly illogical. 
Bill C-20 is illogical, it does not make sense. It is a short 
term political gain designed to prevent true long term 
improvements in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the question, the minister tells us there are guarantees 
for Canadians. This is another comfort zone, a marketing 
operation. The federal government is guaranteeing Canadians 
that, if another referendum is held in Quebec—even though the act 
does not refer to Quebec because, technically speaking, the 
amendments that we proposed to make the bill clearer have been 
rejected—negotiations will take place. How logical is that? The 
federal government is saying that, in a future referendum on 
sovereignty, Canadians can be sure that it will demand a clear 
question and a clear majority before any negotiations can bet 
under way. Thank heavens, we are saved. For now, but there will 
be other referendums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do people not realize that, if it has come to this, it is 
because something is wrong? Yet the government claims that 
Canadians will now have the guarantee that, in the event of a 
referendum, before entering into negotiations, it will make sure 
that the question is clear and that there is a clear majority. 
That is illogical, Liberal logic with regard to the future of 
this country. It would mean getting ready for the country not 
working and providing for it in legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is that this country deserves to be saved, most of 
all from the Liberals. We guarantee that if ever—by the grace of 
God and of this country's voters—we form the government, that 
legislation will be repealed. We will send a message to 
everybody: this country does not need such legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A country is not some kind of marriage contract. What is a 
marriage contract? It is a contract for divorce. That is not 
what a country is about. I wonder if that is why there is such a 
drastic drop in the number of marriages across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make sure that a signal is sent. This government has 
been in office for seven years. What message has it sent to 
Quebecers, Albertans and everybody else as to how this country 
can be improved. We have gone from indifference to the whip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Finance now say “Let us dig into our purses 
and open our wallets”? Who knows? He has not done a great job at 
it. It will be at least two years before we see the difference 
in our pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what message is being sent?  In one-on-one conversations with 
Liberal MPs, and even some ministers, when we really talk about 
Bill C-20, what do they say?  “Something had to be done.  The 
order has come down”.  That is not much of an argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask them “How do you feel about perhaps making some small 
improvements?  How would you feel if there were a bill that 
improved certain relationships or a Constitution for the 21st 
century?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not have a collective project?  In addition to getting this 
country on the Internet, since the desire is to have everyone 
wired in to the high tech world and to have everyone right up to 
date on what is going on, might the collective project not also 
be right up to date as well?  The answer is “Oh no, that is not 
a good idea politically speaking, because people's reaction will 
be that it will be another blessed conference on some island out 
in the ocean, with Mounties everywhere and journalists trailing 
20 feet away from any politician.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But that is not what needs to be done. 
We in the Conservative Party would also have some proposals for 
future solutions, but the first thing is a matter of attitude. 
After seven years, nothing has been done.  They have gone from 
indifference to the whip.  We have a clarity bill that is not 
clear in the least, that is only divisive, one that in my humble 
opinion settles absolutely nothing and is against the spirit of 
the supreme court opinion, against the letter even. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where in the supreme court opinion have they found the right for 
the federal government, which is barely mentioned in the 
opinion—the reference is to political actors—to intervene at the 
start of a referendum process?  That is not what the supreme 
court said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP proposed an amendment relating to the first nations. 
When the minister came before the committee, I asked him “can 
the bill be amended?”  His answer “No, it is a perfect bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg—Transcona must have thrown a few fits. It 
took the three groups of first nations to convince the 
government to change its mind, and not even that much. Is this 
the message we want to send first nations? We are telling them 
“Everything is fine, no problem, do not worry”. It took fits and 
pressure from these groups for the government to even consider 
taking the first nations into account. If I were in their shoes, 
I would be scared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the honour of being a member of the second nation to come 
here, and I am very proud of it. But I am worried about the 
first one. I am even more scared for those at the provincial 
level because the political actors are not involved at the 
federal level. Unfortunately, the provinces are letting their 
big federal brother decide what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a referendum, the country might break up, but their 
message to the federal government is “Take care of things. You 
are so good. For the past seven years you have accomplished a 
lot. You have not done a thing with regard to the Constitution, 
but you have ideas. Do it.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People across the way know the government has no plan to improve 
the rules governing relationships in this country. It has no 
plan. It has absolutely nothing to offer.

some members will vote with the government. We have tried to 
explain our position. It was not easy and it has left scars 
within the party. We do not hide that either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, people should know that our team is still there and 
that we will keep on. In spite of all that and in spite of Bill 
C-20, we will not stop. The Progressive Conservative Party will 
break new ground in relationships within this country. In spite 
of all the difficulties, the Progressive Conservative Party will 
deal with the situation, something the government has refused to 
do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 26, 1999 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-223, an act to to amend the Witness Protection 
Program Act and to make a related and consequential amendment to 
another act (protection of spouses whose life is in danger), be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Calgary Centre has eight minutes remaining. 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to this very important bill, 
Bill C-223.  For the clarification of the House, I want to drive 
home a point I was leading to when we last debated this private 
member's bill which was some time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill focuses on protecting people who are in relationships 
when one person becomes violent and puts the other person at 
risk. The bill is an innovative and very needed approach to 
better protect spouses who are in abusive situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the HRDC ministry there is a new identities program. It is 
intended to give a new identity to a person who was in an abusive 
relationship so that the person can protect himself or herself 
and get away from that abusive situation and not be harassed and 
chased by the abusive partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the current program in HRDC is on an ad hoc 
basis.  It has been thrown together by some well meaning 
bureaucrats. 
It has no real mandate.  It actually has no funding.  Not 
surprisingly it has very limited structure. For people who have 
need of this kind of program, something that would protect them 
when an abusive partner is putting their lives and health at 
risk, it is obscure.  It is hard to find out about it and to 
access it.  It has had very limited application.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223 intends to address the problem by moving the new 
identities program that is very loosely structured in HRDC over 
to the RCMP witness protection program.  It already exists in 
Canada and is structured and funded.  In a sense it would be a 
subprogram of the RCMP witness protection program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By combining the new identities program within the witness 
protection program, participants would be registered with the 
police and under the direction of the commissioner of the RCMP. 
Participants would also benefit from the knowledge and expertise 
of the RCMP and the witness protection program.  We have taken it 
from an obscure ad hoc program with no funding to something that 
is structured, already works and has the oversight of the RCMP. 
This is critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can relate it to a story in my riding which involves a 
personal acquaintance of mine.  We will call her Sally to protect 
her name.  She is the mother of four children.  She was married. 
Early in her marriage she realized that her husband—in this case 
it was the husband but it is not always the husband but I use 
this as an example—had become abusive to her.  It got worse and 
worse.  It got to the point where her life was literally at risk. 
Of course she had to remove herself from that situation but he 
pursued her and actually traumatized the children.  It was a 
tragic story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually charges were laid.  He was out on probation for a 
while. She lived in fear when she went shopping. Even at home at 
night sounds in the house would traumatize her because of the 
abusive nature of this relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went to the authorities.  There was some limited support and 
guidance but there was not much she could do except sweat it out 
for well over a year.  I think it was almost two years before 
charges were finally laid, a conviction resulted and the 
individual was incarcerated for a period of time. During that 
time she had some relative peace of mind. Of course he will get 
out one day and she will continue perhaps to live in the fear of 
being pursued by an abusive mate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223 as put forward by my hon. colleague would give a 
person like Sally some badly needed peace of mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that we put forward this kind of legislation. 
There are some statistics that will drive this point home.  A 
simple change like this one would mean so much.  It would save 
lives. Between 1977 and 1996 there were 2,048 spousal killings in 
Canada.  In over 56% of spousal homicides, investigating police 
officers had knowledge of previous domestic violence between the 
victims and suspects.  In 56% of the spousal killings, the police 
knew there was a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just like the case of Sally to which I referred.  She 
thankfully is alive and well at this point in time.  I suggest to 
the House that she will stay that way, but 2,048 people—and they 
are not always women because it goes both ways, let me be clear 
on that—were killed by their spouses and the police knew about 
the situations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In situations such as those, Bill C-223 would have allowed the 
individuals to apply to the RCMP witness protection program which 
would have under it the new identities program which is currently 
hard to access. They could have applied to that.  They could have 
taken on a new identity and perhaps could have relocated. Details 
such as the cost of relocation would be worked out in the 
regulations, but certainly they could have had a new identity and 
could have established a life free from the threat of physical 
violence. Many people have actually died, but we would save lives 
with a simple fix to the structure that is in place today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that light I close by saying that it is time the new 
identities act be moved under the RCMP auspices.  I encourage all 
members in the House to support this private member's bill. I 
encourage a speedy passage of Bill C-223.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak to Bill C-223, which seeks to amend the Witness 
Protection Program Act to include the protection of people whose 
life is threatened by their spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In practical terms, this bill would provide greater security for 
women who are victims of domestic violence. We all know that the 
majority of those victims are in fact women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violence often occurs within a domestic relationship. Indeed, 
80% of violent crimes against women are committed by a spouse or 
an ex-spouse. Moreover, domestic violence is rarely reported to 
the police. 
The women who are victims of domestic violence feel trapped and 
often cannot see a way out. They are often stalked and sometimes 
killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223 wants to deal with this and avoid such tragedies. To 
understand the purpose of this bill, it is important to ask 
ourselves what measures there are to help those women who live 
in a dangerous domestic situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its initiative against family violence, the federal 
government has adopted a number of measures to help such women, 
including shelters for battered women, psychological services 
and other social measures offering protection and prevention. 
The criminal code has been amended to provide more ways to 
protect the victims of domestic violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of example, the commitment under section 810 of the 
criminal code makes it possible to order a violent spouse to not 
enter into communication and to keep the peace with the other 
spouse on pain of criminal charges.  These measures to prevent 
violence against women are vital and provide long term 
solutions.  However, despite these measures, tragedies continue 
to occur all too often still.  This initiative seems lacking in 
our opinion therefore and should also provide a safety hatch in 
the event of extreme and emergency situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would see the safety hatch in the program for victims of 
spousal violence called “New Identities”, which is run by 
officials of National Revenue and the Department of Human 
Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, women and the police do not seem very familiar 
with this program.  In addition, the assistance provided is very 
limited. 
It provides a name and social insurance number change, but not 
all measures are in place to effect an identity change.  For 
instance, cases are cited in which the person benefiting from 
the program had been located by her spouse because old 
information had not been destroyed.  The program has no specific 
mandate and no statutory or regulatory basis.  For all these 
reasons, it appears quite inadequate to protect threatened 
individuals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe Bill C-223 would be an effective way to help these 
women in difficulty. It will not solve the problem of domestic 
violence, but it will be an essential measure to deal with the 
most serious cases. This improvement must be viewed as an 
indispensable tool within the arsenal of measures available to 
deal with the problem of violence. This bill will make it 
possible to gather the resources to help the spouse whose life 
is in danger in a more structured and effective way than 
currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Witness Protection Program Act that Bill C-223 would amend 
provides for the protection of witnesses whose security is 
threatened because of their involvement in a criminal case. This 
is what is currently in place. 
The act sets out the procedure to follow to determine if a 
person can be admitted to the program. The act says, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protection, in respect of a protectee, may include relocation, 
accommodation and change of identity as well as counselling and 
financial support for those or any other purposes in order to 
ensure the security of the protectee or to facilitate the 
protectee's re-establishment or becoming self-sufficient. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, it provides full protection. Women living in a 
situation of domestic violence can find themselves in situations 
as dangerous as witnesses for the prosecution. Therefore, they 
should benefit from the legislative and regulatory measures 
under this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223 adds new criteria to deal with the tragedy of spouses 
who are victims of violence. The commissioner responsible for 
determining whether a spouse should be admitted to the program 
will consider the facts of each situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will take into account the nature of the physical harm and 
psychological damage caused to the victim and the criminal 
record of the threatening spouse. The commissioner will also 
take into consideration a more subjective criterion. In that 
regard, he will consider the circumstances that make the spouse 
believe that his or her life is in danger. The commissioner will 
also consider the nature of the risk and all the other factors 
that he deems relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all these factors together that will allow the 
commissioner to arrive at a fair and informed decision. The 
commissioner will also consider other possible forms of 
protection outside the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures provided in Bill C-223 are extreme and apply to 
exceptional circumstances. It is necessary to ensure that the 
protection provided is offered to those whose life is truly in 
danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also adapted the concept of spouse to contemporary 
situations, to include a former spouse or any person who has 
lived with another person for a period of not less than one year 
in a conjugal relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exceptional nature of these measures leads us to believe 
that the adoption of Bill C-223 will not require additional 
resources. The annual report to be submitted by the commissioner 
to the solicitor general under the bill will allow the latter to 
monitor the effectiveness of that extension of the scope of the 
witness protection program to include women whose life is 
threatened by their spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports Bill C-223. 
This bill is not the solution to the problem of spousal abuse, 
but it is an essential measure for cases of extreme conjugal 
violence. It is an improvement as an effective contemporary tool 
to protect women who are victims of spousal abuse.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
at the outset I want to say that I very much appreciate the 
opportunity to speak tonight and also to share some of the 
concerns of the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River with 
respect to victims of abuse. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1850"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a long history when it comes to issues such as this.  I 
spent 10 years on the police services board and as chairman of 
the Waterloo regional police.  We worked very closely with 
victims of crime and tried to do the kinds of things that are 
necessary to ensure that people who have found themselves in that 
kind of position and in that kind of situation were given every 
assistance in a way that was meaningful not only to them but to 
their families as well, and to ensure that an effective method of 
dealing with them was in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that we were pioneers in this area and tried to do 
it in a way consistent with the values not only of our community 
but also in terms of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that while Canada's equitable and effective 
justice system is one of the reasons this country remains a very 
successful place and a very attractive place in which to live and 
raise a family, no system is perfect.  It is a sad fact that 
despite criminal code measures, broad preventive initiatives and 
assistance from shelters and transitional homes, vulnerable 
Canadians still have not found the solace and protection they 
need in society.  Often, and unfortunately, these people are 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223 attempts to assist the victims of violence and the 
threat of violence in the home or from a spouse.  I commend the 
member for taking the initiative in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I also point out that violence in the home affects not 
only women but children as well.  It is insidious and it tends to 
be self-perpetuating, transferring from one generation to the 
next.  It is very sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A woman who leaves an abusive relationship must often move out 
of the province, moving from one safe haven to another, living a 
life of fear of discovery and fear for the safety and lives of 
not only herself but her children as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House we are all concerned with this very 
important issue.  For far too long society has tended to ignore 
the facts of violence in the home.  Because we have ignored it, 
it is more prevalent than it should otherwise be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so it is that I respect the hon. member's intentions in 
introducing Bill C-223.  I believe it is right and proper that we 
should be focusing our attention on the issues of domestic 
violence and the protection of our children, and the victims 
associated with that violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I think we must consider that Bill C-223 may be 
the wrong instrument in this case.  Bill C-223 recognizes that 
even after relocation some victims continue to be stalked, 
threatened or even killed.  Sometimes the only remaining last 
resort and course of action is a change of identity.  Bill C-223 
would therefore extend the provisions of the witness protection 
program to victims whose lives are in danger because of domestic 
violence.  That may be far from a perfect solution.  I would 
argue, given the experience I had with the police in the Waterloo 
region, that it would be the wrong solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the objectives of the witness protection program are 
wrong for these victims.  The program is run by the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police as an aid to law enforcement, in 
particular against organized crime.  Participants are people who 
have information that could incriminate themselves, but who would 
risk their lives by testifying.  The program to provide 
protection to them is administered by the police, for police 
reasons.  This is a far different group of people from that of 
the victims of violence and domestic violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a group of people who are desperate for help and, 
aside from protection, need counselling, self-esteem building and 
psychological help.  I believe it would be a mistake, therefore, 
to lump these very much at risk and vulnerable people in with a 
quite different group of witnesses to organized criminal 
activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be effective a program to assist victims in life threatening 
relationships must be quite different from the witness protection 
program.  Such a program must involve provincial and territorial 
partners, because of the jurisdictional issues, to address the 
issues of security, health, counselling, safe housing, employment 
and the future of the children.  In fact we should be assured by 
the fact that the Government of Canada has for some time been 
working toward such a program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In previous discussions of this bill mention has been made of 
the ad hoc process begun by Human Resources Development Canada 
some time ago, of the experience gained and the evolution toward 
a national federal-provincial-territorial program for providing 
new identities to victims in life threatening relationships. 
This process, initiated by HRDC and the Canada Customs and 
Revenue Agency, helps victims and their children, providing them 
with new social insurance numbers and re-created federal social 
benefits. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1855"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience from this process has taught us some very valuable 
lessons.  A change of identity is definitely a last resort.  In 
the beginning there were not many cases.  For example, from 1992 
to 1997 there were 52 victims who were helped, but growing 
awareness has since increased the number to a total of 206 
victims, with more than 300 children involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ad hoc process was meant to be a compassionate government 
response to an obvious need, but the lack of formal co-ordination 
and interjurisdictional complications of changing a person's 
identity has made it necessary to seek a permanent solution.  The 
government, therefore, is working with stakeholders to do 
precisely that in looking at the possibility of a more effective, 
specifically mandated national program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultations have begun in this very important area.  During 
these consultations there was unanimous agreement on the need for 
a co-ordinated new identities program.  Governments everywhere 
that were involved were praised for bringing the issue to the 
forefront.  Provinces and territories seem to be looking to the 
federal government for leadership in this area and that is 
precisely what we will be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A federal-provincial-territorial working group has been 
established and is working in consultation with victims' 
representatives, operating under the umbrella of the social 
services ministers in consultation with the justice ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike many other fields of endeavour, there is a willingness to 
co-operate and get on with the job in this important area.  That 
makes sense.  Surely we should wait for it to complete its work 
before any legislation on these issues is put into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, while we respect the hon. member's intent, and we 
know that he has the best of intentions in bringing this to the 
forefront, we on the government side think that it is premature 
at this time.  I would urge all hon. members to vote accordingly, 
knowing that there are other ways and other venues to approach 
this very, very important issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK148"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me great pleasure to rise on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada and also on behalf of the 
constituents which I have the privilege to represent, the 
citizens of Madawaska—Restigouche, New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by stating that the PC Party will be supporting 
Bill C-223.  I agreed with my colleague who, when this bill was 
last debated in November, felt that this bill might not be 
necessary, given the current criminal harassment laws and the 
protection given under the witness protection program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Logically I would like to see increased spending on policing to 
protect spouses who suffer from domestic abuse.  I would like to 
see more meaningful sentences handed down by the courts to send a 
message that the abuse of a spouse will not be tolerated.  I 
would also like to see more funding directed to counselling 
programs for the abusive spouse and for the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only through addressing these problems and correcting the 
behaviour that this type of behaviour can be dismissed and 
hopefully eliminated.  However, the Liberal government has 
consistently shown that it will not commit to allocating the 
necessary funding to protect society from violent predators. 
Sure, the Liberals will proudly state that the recent budget 
allocated an extra $810 million for policing and protection, but 
it will neglect to mention that this allocation will be over the 
next three years and that 62% of the new money will not be 
available until 2001-02. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, although I agree with my colleague that under a 
responsible government Bill C-223 would not be needed, I must 
agree that the government's dismal record in protecting the 
public, especially the most vulnerable in society, has made this 
legislation necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, abused spouses, most often women, endure a living 
hell as they try to protect themselves and their children from 
the wrath of their abusive spouses. 
We hear stories of victims moving into shelters or trying to 
escape to another city, province or even another country to get 
away from abusive relationships.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, these victims cannot remain anonymous and are eventually 
found by their abusive spouses.  The result is often violent.  In 
recent years we have heard of too many incidents where the 
results have been death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government will not take meaningful action to deal 
with these violent predators, Bill C-223 is a necessary means to 
protect these victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223 is an act to amend the Witness Protection Program Act 
and to make a related consequential amendment to another act 
(protection of spouses whose life is in danger).  It is an act to 
provide for the establishment and operation of a program to 
enable certain persons to receive protection in relation to 
certain inquiries, investigations or prosecutions and to enable 
certain certain spouses whose lives are in danger to receive 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada supports the bill. 
We have been consistent in our support of law and order, 
protection of society and victims' rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that most of the amendments brought forth by this 
legislation already exist under the current witness protection 
program.  However, I agree with the hon. member that the witness 
protection program is currently only mandated to protect crown 
witnesses and is not used for abused victims.  Broadening the 
mandate is a welcome change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also agree that Canada's anti-stalking law can do nothing to 
protect a victim who is confronted by a violent spouse who has 
refused to desist or who has violated a restraining order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my colleague that stronger laws to protect these 
people would be a better alternative than having the abused 
spouse change his or her identity and flee.  Nevertheless, this 
alternative would require more meaningful, well placed funding 
which the Liberals have shown they are unwilling to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, if a change of identity is the only viable solution 
for the protection of the victim, then I feel that all members 
should be supportive of this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When dealing with a program such as this, one must also be 
cognizant that certain individuals may attempt to use the program 
in an unlawful manner.  For example, some could try to use the 
program to obtain a new identity while trying to escape 
creditors.  This will not be the case with Bill C-223 as there is 
a detailed list of factors that the witness protection program 
will have to consider before determining whether a spouse should 
be admitted to the program.  These considerations include the 
nature of the risk to the security of the spouse, the 
circumstances that cause the spouse to believe his or her life is 
in danger, the nature of the injuries, psychological damage, 
whether the other spouse has a criminal record and whether 
alternative methods exist for protecting the spouse without 
admission to the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example of how the program could succeed can be seen through 
the success of new identities for humanitarian reasons.  This 
unofficial program, which began in 1992 and works through HRDC 
and Revenue Canada, does not reveal the names of those who 
conduct the program.  As well, Revenue Canada ensures that the 
income tax history and child tax benefits of the victims follow 
them into their new lives without linking them to their past 
names.  HRDC provides them with a new social insurance number and 
transfers their pension benefits. 
Police and women's shelters refer candidates for the program so 
there is no formal application process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently the criminal code states that one cannot force someone 
to testify against his or her spouse.  In many cases the victim 
of spouse abuse can give damning information that police and 
prosecutors need to obtain a conviction of the spousal abuser. 
Yet, as spouses cannot be compelled to testify against each 
other, spousal intimidation can play a factor and create problems 
in securing a conviction against the abuser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intimidation of witnesses in general, and spouses in particular, 
has had an adverse effect on the justice system for years.  As 
the witness protection program is mandated to protect crown 
witnesses and not abuse victims, this intimidation could continue 
to occur in spousal family situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new identities for humanitarian reasons program helps in 
this process but lacks needed funding and recognition in policing 
and counselling circles.  If this type of program were allowed to 
be incorporated under the witness protection program, as 
suggested by Bill C-223, some of these problems could be 
regulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to thank the hon. member for Prince 
George—Peace River for bringing this bill forward.  I feel that 
it is a sound bill that will offer further protection to victims 
involved in the most severe cases of spousal abuse.  Indirectly, 
it also brings attention to the lack of funding from the federal 
government for matters of public safety.  Public safety has 
always been a priority of the Progressive Conservative Party of 
Canada and thus we will be supporting this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to enter into this debate.  I will begin by 
congratulating my colleague from Prince George—Peace River on 
this initiative.  It is one that he has worked on for a long time 
and one that is wrapped around a personal story as well, which is 
what makes it so very important.  This is not just an abstract 
piece of legislation that talks about facts or statistics.  It is 
a piece of legislation that has been developed to address a very 
serious need of individuals in need of protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Prince George—Peace River had an individual 
in his riding who was affected by this type of situation.  He 
explained that in his speech in the previous hour of debate.  It 
caught his attention.  It was a need crying out.  Something had 
to happen because there was a vacuum, a void, within our current 
justice and legal system that put mainly women, who are involved 
in domestic violence and being abused by their spouses, at risk. 
The reason my colleague was compelled to bring this bill forward 
was to address this serious need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment on a few of the statements made by the Liberal 
member for Waterloo—Wellington who spoke earlier and rebut some 
of the statements he made.  He gave some encouragement for the 
notion and the idea of this bill.  He then went on to say that 
this was the wrong solution and that this bill would not solve 
the problem.  He went on to say that we needed to wait and that 
we needed to consult or work with stakeholders. These are 
unacceptable solutions that he offers to a very serious need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill that puts together a concrete plan to address a 
very serious situation.  It is well thought out.  It has some 
flexibility designed into it.  My colleague has looked at the new 
identities program, which was an ad hoc program developed to 
address this need.  It is a good start but it certainly is not a 
viable solution to continue on with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague also looked at the witness protection program and 
saw it as a vehicle by which spouses being affected in this type 
of terrible abusive situation could be incorporated into the 
program.  It would obviously need to have some legislative 
changes happen and that is what this bill is about. 
The motivation for it is to fill a void and to help those 
individuals who are facing this really serious situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the 100 individuals who will die in our country 
this year—statistics hold out on this terrible tragedy that is 
occurring across the country—will take any solace in the fact 
that the government is looking at this and waiting.  This is 
simply unacceptable.  Individuals are being abused and murdered 
by their spouses in our country.  It is a sad situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we as legislators see a situation that is crying out for a 
solution and do nothing about it and say, “oh well, we will just 
get the stakeholders together”, well the stakeholders in this 
situation may not be around in a year if we do nothing.  My 
colleague has brought this bill to the floor of the House because 
it puts together a plan to address a need and will save people's 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a plan that could be passed in the House within a matter 
of weeks or months before we leave this place at the end of this 
session.  It could be passed into legislation and individuals 
could work on administering this program and making it work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Liberal side mentioned that the current 
witness protection program was put together to protect 
individuals who provide information to the RCMP, and that this is 
the wrong solution.  I think he lacks foresight or creative 
flexibility if he does not see that this is a program that could 
be adapted to include individuals who are being abused.  Who is 
better to make this type of decision than the RCMP officers 
themselves who are the ones who respond when there is domestic 
violence.  These situations are often very difficult for them to 
deal with.  Sometimes they are the first officers on the scene 
after someone has been beaten to within an inch of his or her 
life or even killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who better to bring forward recommendations than the RCMP 
officers who deal with these cases?   They are in the inner 
circle and on the front line of what is happening.  Who better to 
make some recommendations to the commissioner who would then 
decide whether or not a person should enter this protection 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As legislators, this bill gives us a perfect opportunity to make 
a change that will affect people's lives.  It will also save 
people's lives.   We would be remiss if we let this opportunity 
slip through our fingers simply because we trust the government 
to meet with stakeholders, to wait and to develop some other kind 
of program.  It is not working now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new identities program moves in the right direction but it 
does not address a bigger need and concern that this bill 
specifically addresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my Liberal colleague to discuss with his colleagues the 
practicality of this bill and that it will work.  I was 
encouraged when colleagues from the Progressive Conservative 
Party and the Bloc mentioned that they will support this bill. 
That is positive.  If we do not move ahead now on this issue we 
will in many regards be held accountable for those individuals 
whose lives will be lost this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We come to this Chamber day after day, talk about different 
issues and policies and have votes.  Sometimes there may even be 
abstract notions. 
People who are out in the general public have a hard time 
identifying with some of the things we do here.  This is a very 
specific idea, a very specific answer to a very big problem. That 
is why we need to understand as members of parliament who have 
been sent here by our constituents that this is something we 
could do.  It would be a very simple thing to do.  It would be a 
shame if we let partisan direction from our party leadership or 
from any other source influence our decision, or that we would 
even have such a small vision that this is a particular program 
that cannot be expanded to solve the problem, reject it out of 
hand and not bring anything else forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Liberal colleague did not bring forward any constructive 
alternatives, apart from saying that they are going to meet with 
stakeholders and we should wait.  Why in the world should we wait 
when we have something here which would work, which could do the 
job and save lives?  Why in the world would we wait any longer? 
For each year that goes by another 100 individuals will be 
murdered.  We would be remiss if we were implicated by our 
inactivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I strongly support the proposed legislation.  I 
congratulate my colleague from Prince George—Peace River for 
bringing it forward.  He has been sensitive to seeing a need and 
to looking for a compassionate solution which would saves lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my colleagues from all parties to support this 
legislation so that it could move forward and the program could 
be developed, implemented and put in place.  Let us do it.  Let 
us do it together.  Let us make a positive solution to a very 
serious problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I join with 
my colleague from Dewdney—Alouette in congratulating my 
colleague from Prince George—Peace River who introduced Bill 
C-223 in the House of Commons for debate and for a vote.  I am 
very pleased to support the bill.  I think it is not only 
important, but imperative that we support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two Canadians, mostly women, every week lose their lives to 
their spouses in domestic situations.  I ask members of the House 
and I ask people who are watching at home to remember the deep 
sense of shock and outrage that we all felt across the country 
when Marc Lépine went on his murderous rampage and took the lives 
of 15 young women in Quebec some years ago.  Imagine, Mr. 
Speaker, two women every week in this country lose their lives to 
spousal abuse.  In the House of Commons we have just over 301 
seats.  It would mean that one-third of the seats in the House 
would be vacant every year as a result of murder through spousal 
abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the shock?  Where is the outrage?  Why is this not 
something that we are being compelled to deal with?  Why is it 
that we feel this sense of shock and outrage over the Marc Lépine 
incident but we are doing virtually nothing to address the issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the reason that this does not have the sense of 
urgency that it deserves is because these spouses, mostly women, 
are not dying en masse.  It is difficult for the TV cameras and 
people in the media to get their heads around it.  It is 
difficult for Canadians to understand the depth of the problem 
because it is not immediate, it is spread out over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that it is just as important and as urgent, and we 
should be as equally distressed and concerned about the lives of 
these women as we were for those 15 young women who lost their 
lives at the polytechnique some years ago.  We should be taking 
strong measures, within the ability of this place to take strong 
measures, to protect these women.  We should do everything within 
reason to ensure that we protect the lives of Canadians where we 
have the ability and the responsibility to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the Liberal member who spoke some time ago making 
comments.  He suggested that we are taking the wrong approach. 
I really do not want to be partisan on this issue, but I cannot 
resist.  The member suggests that my colleague from Prince 
George—Peace River is on the wrong track with this legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us compare what this legislation attempts to do with, for 
example, the Liberal's gun registry, the $1 billion boondoggle 
that is supposed to save lives.  We were told by the government 
when this legislation was introduced that if it saved even one 
life it would be worth it.  Yet we have the ability with this 
proposed legislation to enact protection that would really save 
lives and we have the Liberals across the way saying that we are 
on the wrong track.  Frankly, I do not buy it.  I think that 
Canadians should do like Bill Clinton—do not inhale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that we cannot come together as 
parliamentarians and see the need and understand that there is 
something we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people might argue that this would be an expensive measure. 
Let us not forget that we are talking about two people per week. 
We are talking about people who might take advantage of this or 
who might seek protection under this legislation.  This is not 
going to be something that is going to be taken advantage of by 
many people.  To enter this kind of protection program people 
have to divorce themselves not only from friends but from family, 
their lives and everything they know, and start over again 
somewhere else with new identities and challenges, and no support 
from family and friends.  It is a very difficult choice that 
people who might take advantage of this program would have to 
make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On two occasions women came to see me in my riding looking for 
assistance because they were scared out of their wits.  It is a 
shame that in this country in the year 2000 we have women who 
feel they have to go underground to protect themselves and to 
preserve their lives, but that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the case of a young lady in my riding, her name is Tammy, 
who was in a relationship with a man.  She ended the 
relationship.  The man went into her house, commando style, in 
the middle of the night, forcibly raped her and threatened her. 
She pressed charges.  The man went to jail for 18 months.  He has 
now been released, but when she came to see me he was on the 
verge of being released.  She was frightened.  She said “I did 
everything that I was supposed to do to protect myself.  I did 
not do anything to bring this on.  The guy came into my house in 
the middle of the night”.  He went to the extraordinary measure 
of taking masking tape, rolling it up and putting it on his vest 
so that he would have it handily available to wrap around her 
wrists and mouth.  He broke into her house in the middle of the 
night, violated her space and forcibly raped her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She did what she was supposed to do.  She went to the police and 
made sure that he faced retribution.  But our criminal justice 
system is such a laugh in this country that he was only 
incarcerated for a relatively short period of time, and when he 
was on the verge of getting out she came to me and said “What am 
I supposed to do?  This guy is a little bit angry with me. 
Surprise, surprise.  What am I supposed to do?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tammy considered at great length going underground. 
She considered at great length changing her identity and 
relocating to another part of Canada, starting a new life with a 
new career and divorcing herself, cutting the ties with her 
family and friends in order to protect her life. Had this 
legislation been in place at the time that Tammy came to see me, 
it would have given her the option and opportunity to do that 
without her having to do it herself.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are women right now in the country who are going 
underground.  They are being forced to do it because our justice 
system is not protecting them.  They are having to do it with 
their own resources and in a haphazard manner because they do not 
have the expertise and the ability. This legislation would 
provide them with an option, a way out.  It would provide 
protection.  It would save lives in contrast to the billion 
dollar boondoggle known as Bill C-68 which the Liberals brought 
in a few years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I urge all members of the House to carefully consider 
what is being contemplated here.  It is nothing less than saving 
the lives of Canadians, in particular Canadian women.  It can be 
done.  This legislation provides the tools to do it.  I urge all 
members of the House to take the opportunity to vote yes.  Vote 
in favour of this legislation. Let us protect Canadian lives. 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this should be a non-partisan debate. Clearly this is an 
exceptionally serious issue that crosses all gender lines.  It 
crosses all geographic and demographic lines within the country. 
It is unfortunate that the member for Waterloo—Wellington has 
decided to kibitz from the other side of the House.  We treated 
him with respect.  I would expect that he would treat our side of 
the debate with respect as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Dewdney—Alouette and my colleague from Skeena 
were trying to make the point, which I will underscore, that the 
government not only has an opportunity but indeed it has a 
responsibility to the people of Canada to begin to act, to be 
acting now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing some research prior to coming to this debate, I was 
interested to read the comments of the parliamentary secretary to 
the solicitor general.  His comments were particularly revealing. 
After he used the same kind of words that the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington has used tonight, he came up with exactly 
the same point, that the government for whatever reason seems to 
be petrified to take any action that would actually go toward the 
saving of lives of the women of Canada who are embroiled in and 
sucked into this kind of situation.  Not only women but children 
are involved in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the parliamentary secretary had completed his comments 
that yes this would be a good idea, he said “We can and must do 
more. Education, counselling, prevention and other social service 
measures are essential if we are to do away with family violence. 
When all else fails, we must take steps against the violent 
partners.  The federal, provincial and territorial partners have 
already worked on the development of a new identity program. 
There is always room for improvement but we do not need to 
reinvent the wheel.  We need to build on what is already 
established. There are a number of unsettled questions”. Because 
of the time tonight I will not complete his quote except to say 
that all he could talk about is the fact that there are problems, 
there are opportunities, and they are working on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mantra from the Liberals is that because Bill C-223 was not 
their idea it is the wrong vehicle.  If this is the wrong 
vehicle, why does the government not come up with the right 
vehicle?  It has 2,000 lawyers in the justice department.  What 
are those lawyers doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government not giving direction to the justice 
department to come up with the solution to the problem? Why is 
the government just saying that the proposal of the member for 
Prince George—Peace River is not the right vehicle?  If it is 
not the right vehicle, then what is the right vehicle and when is 
the government going to come forward with it?

be done legislatively, there are problems even with existing law.

continuation of this debate. At that time I will talk about some 
of the problems with the existing witness protection legislation 
and then try to marry the two things together, what the member 
for Prince George—Peace River is trying to accomplish and what 
improvements are needed even within the existing legislation, the 
Witness Protection Program Act.
