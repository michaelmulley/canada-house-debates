	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-14, an act 
to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal year beginning on 
April 1, 1994, as reported (without amendment) from the 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved 
that the bill be concurred in.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that the bill 
be read the third time and passed.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak on 
third reading of Bill C-14, the borrowing authority bill.
<P>
	The bill has been approved by the House finance committee 
and it is vitally important that the House proceed with it as 
quickly as possible. Without borrowing authority in the new 
fiscal year severe constraints will be placed on the government's 
financial program, constraints that could prove costly to the 
government and to Canadian taxpayers. The federal government 
would be restricted to short term funds. This would expose the 
government to an additional rate risk and could disrupt the 
capital market, potentially resulting in higher debt and servicing 
charges.
<P>
	We do not put forward this request for borrowing authority 
lightly. We know there are real costs involved in adding to the 
country's debt burden. The amount of borrowing authority 
requested in the bill is directly connected to the financial 
requirements set out in the 1994 budget. The budget takes 
concrete responsible action to bring the nation's finances under 
control.
<P>
	Our ultimate goal is to eliminate the deficit. Our interim 
target is to reduce it to 3 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. The 
budget puts us on a course to meet that target. We will reduce the 
deficit to $39.7 billion in the coming fiscal year, to $32.7 billion 
in 1995-96, and, with only a moderate growth, to $25 billion in 
1996-97. Our financial requirements are lower: $30.2 billion in 
1994-95 and $22.7 billion in 1995-96.
<P>
	Let me be very clear. No future action is required for us to 
meet our three-year deficit target. This will happen as a direct 
result of the actions contained in the 1994 budget in and of 
themselves.
<P>
	To achieve this we have proposed the most substantial saving 
reductions by a government in the last 10 years. Debt 
expenditure cuts will total $17 billion over the next three years. 
Over that period there are $5 in spending cuts for every $1 in 
new revenue.
<P>
	Some people have expressed disappointment that the deficit 
for the first year is not lower. The government shares that 
disappointment. However the reasons for this are quite 
straightforward.
<P>
	First, there is a lag time before the full effects of spending 
cuts show up in the nation's books, for example with 
unemployment insurance a change in legislation is required.
<P>
	Second, we have carried through on all of our election 
commitments including a major national infrastructure 
program, and they are paid for up front.
<P>
	There is a third reason the deficit is not lower for the first year. 
We have scrapped many of the practices of the past. In previous 
years, governments would set targets based on rosy economic 
projections. Our budget is based on very prudent assumptions.
<P>

year. We have scrapped many of the practices of the past. In 
previous years, governments would set targets based on rosy 
economic projections. Our budget is based on very prudent 
assumptions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2472"> 2472 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Moreover the budget provides full accounting for all new 
program costs. Nothing is hidden. We have built in substantial 
reserves so that we can respond to unforeseen contingencies 
without altering our fiscal targets.
<P>
	Finally, we have not offloaded the federal deficit on to 
Canada's provinces. We firmly believe that the two levels of 
government must approach their respective challenges through 
co-operation.
<P>
	Now let me return to Bill C-14. Like borrowing bills in 
previous years the bill contains three basic elements. I would 
like to touch briefly on each one of these elements.
<P>
	First, the bill provides for $30.2 billion of authority to cover 
anticipated borrowing requirements to meet the net financial 
requirements set out in the budget.
<P>
	Second, there is provision in the bill to cover $1.1 billion of 
exchange fund account earnings. These earnings give rise to 
additional borrowing requirements because these earnings, 
although reported as budgetary revenues, are retained in the 
exchange fund account. They are not available to finance 
ongoing government expenditures.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Third, there is a $3 billion borrowing reserve, the same 
amount requested in borrowing bills in the last six years. This 
reserve provides for unforeseen contingencies such as foreign 
exchange transactions, seasonal swings and borrowing 
requirements, and delays in passing the future year borrowing 
authority legislation.
<P>
	The bill also contains a provision for an additional borrowing 
authority of $3 billion to provide for borrowing conducted in the 
fiscal year under section 47 of the Financial Administration Act.
<P>
	In summary borrowing authority is a normal part of 
government operations and the bill contains no unusual 
provisions. All the information needed to deal with it is before 
the House in the budget, the main estimates and related 
documents.
<P>
	I therefore urge the House to proceed today with the 
legislation so that the government's regular borrowing program 
can proceed as the fiscal year begins and the risk of hard debt 
servicing charges can be avoided.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since the budget was brought down in this House, I have 
witnessed a great deal of praise being heaped on members on the 
other side of the House. First, the Prime Minister praised his 
Minister of Finance as if he held the keys to eternal truth. The 
other ministers also showered him with praise and thanked him 
for slashing their own departmental budgets. And to top it all 
off, the minister even congratulated himself. I have never seen 
so much flattery before, all designed to mask a flood of useless, 
futile words.
<P>
	A number of my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois have 
denounced this budget, and rightly so. I too would like to join 
with them in saying that there is nothing in this budget to give 
some hope back to the least fortunate members of our society. 
This budget was devised by sons of darkness, whose father is 
none other than the Prime Minister himself.
<P>
	A son of darkness is someone who always thinks in terms of 
his party and his career. Many of my colleagues here in this 
House hail from rural areas. There are some young Turks on the 
other side of the House who, outside the chamber, have said: You 
are right, but we are only starting out in our career and we want 
to move up. Sometimes, we have to keep quiet. Some other 
members who have been around longer and who are more adept 
at expressing themselves say this: Why not protect our career 
and maybe some day get appointed to the Senate.
<P>
	A son of darkness is someone who never admits his mistakes. 
It was announced here in this House that the military college in 
Saint-Jean, a francophone college, will be closed. Everyone 
concedes that the government is making a monumental mistake, 
but the government is not willing to admit it.
<P>
	A son of darkness is someone who protects the wealthy, 
family trusts and large corporations, someone who never gives 
any real answers here in this House. The answer is always 
maybe, or perhaps, but never anything specific.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	A son of darkness is someone who accepts a double standard. 
The poor are asked to tighten their belts, while a minister can 
take off and spend $160,000 on a trip.
<P>
	A son of darkness is someone who exploits the poorest among 
us and surrounds himself with wealthy friends during election 
campaigns. He has no problem with spending $1,000 or $3,000 
on meals with his friends. He is also someone who is prepared to 
bleed our senior citizens dry, to tax their income above $24,000 
or $25,0000. He is someone who does not put any value on 
workers and who makes life hell for the unemployed.
<P>
	I do not have any examples to give you, but I have toured my 
riding several times and workers as well as the unemployed 
understand what I am saying. A son of  darkness is someone for 
whom the end justifies the means.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs says one thing in the House, 
and something quite different outside the chamber. A son of 
darkness is someone who does not care about the people. We 
have had some very sincere federalists in Quebec. There was 
Jean Lesage who coined the expression ``masters in our own 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2473"> 2473 </A></B>
<P>
house''. He sat here in this very House. Did anyone listen to 
him?
<P>
	Immediately after him came Premier Daniel Johnson, Sr., 
who said ``equality or independence''. Did anyone listen to him, 
Mr. Speaker? No. His son, now the Premier of Quebec, did not 
listen. He is even worse than the others.
<P>
	Then there was René Lévesque who spoke of sovereignty 
association. At one point, he talked about the ``beau risque'', the 
``fine risk''. Did anyone listen to him? No.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will have recognized the people behind the 
latest budget. Furthermore, I have christened the Prime Minister 
the father of darkness. Why have I done this? You will recall that 
the Constitution was patriated unilaterally. Quebec was not 
there in the London fog. You will recall Meech Lake. Well, the 
Prime Minister was there in spirit. And finally, you will recall 
Charlottetown. This episode will help him to write his 
posthumous memoirs.
<P>
	There is not a thing in this budget which would give some 
hope back to the small communities in my riding grappling with 
serious social and economic problems. If I were forced to live on 
temporary and seasonal unemployment insurance like most of 
my fellow citizens, I too would have a strong desire to rise up in 
protest.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Where are these secure jobs in rural areas and in our small 
towns? If I had voted for the Liberal Party, I would feel betrayed. 
What was said during the election campaign, Mr. Speaker? They 
said, ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. Where are these jobs? Other than the 
infrastructure program, where they will be put in place as soon 
as possible. In Quebec, particularly if there is an election, we 
will see bulldozers all over the place, to give the impression that 
jobs are being created, the illusion that temporary jobs are being 
created, only for that reason.
<P>
	If I were the mayor of a small rural municipality, I would be 
convinced that this government has simply let rural people down 
once again. The nice promises this government made to 
Canadian voters in the last election campaign on 
underemployment, unemployment, and housing have all gone 
up in smoke.
<P>
	Not only is there nothing in this budget for the least fortunate, 
but it picks the pockets of the poorest once again. It bleeds dry 
the old people who built this country. These people have worked 
hard to save a little money and now they will have to return part 
of their savings, put together over 50 or 60 years. They will have 
to give  money back to the government, after doing everything to 
build this country.
<P>
	What I heard in this House on February 22 is what I fought 
against during the last election campaign in my riding. It is 
urgent that we in this country understand once and for all that we 
will not solve the deficit problem by going after the poorest and 
the elderly. It is a funny way to thank these people who worked 
hard and put their health on the line to build Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	This government must begin, and this is urgent, creating 
long-term jobs, not temporary jobs, not pre-electoral jobs, not 
sporadic jobs, not jobs that will make the party look good, but 
jobs for people who want to work. The Minister says he is 
counting on private enterprise to create jobs, and I agree with 
him.
<P>
	Development depends to a large extent on small and 
medium-sized business-I am sure of that-which represent 
about 99 per cent of all Canadian businesses, great! However, 
small and medium-sized businesses are facing new problems 
that prevent them from effectively playing the role of job 
creators under the impulsion of the economic recovery.
<P>
	Small and medium-sized businesses are having trouble 
getting the money to fund their development from financial 
institutions. Administrative requirements from the different 
levels of government are unnecessary burdens that take up the 
energy needed for production activities.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Small and medium-sized businesses complain about their tax 
burden and see the need for squandering and duplication to be 
eliminated in governmental programs and services. Is this 
government prepared to identify and reduce tax, administrative, 
social, economic and other barriers to small business starting up 
and remaining in operation? This is a clear, precise message 
from over 75 per cent of business leaders in this country.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance reform, to be initiated in the near 
future, parliamentary committee on alternatives to the GST and 
a task force on the economic situation, which will take a timid 
look at what could be done to facilitate access to conventional 
financing and explore new funding sources at the local and 
community level. In other words, studies and more studies. But 
studies do not create jobs, except perhaps for a few civil servants 
and especially for some consultant friends of the Liberals.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will argue, and rightly so, that man does not 
live on bread alone. Maybe so, but man does need bread. In my 
riding, the good courageous parents who cannot afford to buy 
food could not care less for study committees. When a single 
mother has no money to pay rent at the end of the month, she too 
could not care less for committees. What does the other side 
suggest? Let us strike committees to solve the problems. That is 
not what people are asking for in my riding. There are urgent 
needs that have to be met. When an unemployed individual, one 
of the many in my riding,  sends out 200 resumes and does not 
get one single response, he too does not care for committees. I 
am using polite language out of respect for this place, but that is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2474"> 2474 </A></B>
<P>
not the language they use when talking to me. Cuss words are 
flying these days.
<P>
	When the great minds of our region, in Matapédia-Matane, 
have to migrate to find work, they could not care less for study 
committees. I met former constituents of mine in Vancouver 
who told me: ``It is not that Vancouver is not friendly, 
welcoming and all, on the contrary, but we did not move here 
with a light heart. We did not have a choice. There are no jobs 
back home''.
<P>
	What measures does the Minister of Finance intend to put in 
place to help businesses, the small and medium-sized 
businesses, create jobs? Help is urgently needed. Is this minister 
or any other prepared to help the Business Development Centre, 
BDC for short, invest more in share capital and venture capital? 
So far, most BDCs have been granting 80 per cent loans. They 
are almost like the banks and credit unions. That is not what I am 
asking from the minister. I am asking the ministers to take some 
risks. That is what they are there for. Now we hear that BDCs 
must become profitable. Of course, but not by ruining people in 
the process. Some businesses do need support.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Is this government prepared to invest more in the forestry 
industry? You are probably aware of the major role played by 
forestry in Canada's economy and trade. Listen to this! One job 
out of every 17 created directly or indirectly in Canada is in 
forestry. That is 729,000 jobs. But the minister never said a word 
about natural resources, not a word, at least not so far. That is 
really sad. In Quebec, forestry creates one job in 13. Still, not a 
word from the minister.
<P>
	Furthermore -and I find it somewhat insulting that this fact 
has gone unnoticed- natural resources are the key element of 
the trade balance, with $19 billion a year. Yet, they seem to be 
relegated to the second, tenth or twentieth position. That is 
incredible!
<P>
	Figures from 39 joint management groups show the impact 
the economic activity of small and medium-sized businesses in 
that area has had on the economy in 1992-93. In source 
deductions and taxes alone, these groups have paid back close to 
half the funds received. Governments have recovered in part the 
seed capital provided, all the while helping enhance capacity, 
creating thousands of jobs and supporting a regional and 
provincial economic activity.
<P>
	Budget cuts in that area will not only result in job loss. The 
companies that woodlot owners have struggled to set up over the 
past 20 years, going as far as pooling resources and forming 
co-operatives to create jobs by allowing individuals who did not 
own lots to work them, are threatened. They have made huge 
sacrifices. I could give you a list of examples a mile long.
<P>
	To contribute to the management of their forests, these 
owners have taken risks. They have taken risks for forests now 
threatened with disappearance. Joint management groups are 
seriously concerned. RESAM, which represents 39 groups, 
struggles along from one year to the next, while all it would need 
is a little boost. We do not even have the-generosity is not the 
word- the heart to say that it is the government's job to create 
jobs. Why not do it?
<P>
	It would seem that natural resources are not valued in this 
House. Forestry alone brings in $19 billion, more than 
agriculture, fisheries, industry and energy. But here, in this 
House, it apparently has no importance whatsoever.
<P>
	I hope that my colleagues from rural areas will set party 
politics aside for a moment and say: ``Let us do it for rural 
Canada''.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	There are many ministers from big cities, but the rural areas 
do not have a voice, and I would like to be that voice for the 
voiceless, the spokesman for those who go unheard. Of course, 
if I am alone, it is not a partisan issue, I can do very little.
<P>
	I come back to these small forestry businesses, which as you 
know, Mr. Speaker, are scattered all across Quebec and Canada. 
They are real tools for regional development. Without them, 
what would become of our resource regions? What would 
become of the forest industry? What would become of this 
country's positive trade balance?
<P>
	This year, development corporations in my riding are asking 
for more aid to operate. They are simply asking the Canadian 
government to invest, because it is an investment; it is not a loan 
or a grant but an investment that they request, and they very 
often are turned down. I hope that this year your government 
will not refuse. For the government, it is a long-term investment 
that will pay off.
<P>
	I ask this government to respond positively as soon as 
possible, because the Société des Monts, which prepared a very 
large brief-last year, the forestry workers and the employees of 
that outfit, led by the company president, Mr. Malenfant, had 
their salaries cut 10 per cent so that the company could survive 
and create and maintain those jobs. If you earn $20,000 a year, a 
10 per cent pay cut means taking bread and butter from your 
children. When the school year begins, you cannot pay your 
children's back-to-school expenses, and we know what that 
costs, especially if you have three or four children.
<P>
	The Société des Monts, the Société de la Vallée and the 
Scierie Métis sawmill must plan their work as soon as possible. I 
know hundreds of forestry workers who in early March-I do 
not want to dramatize-are getting stomach ulcers because they 
do not know if they will start to work. They do not know. We are 
waiting while the whole cumbersome government bureaucracy 
takes one or two or three months to answer. That is easy for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2475"> 2475 </A></B>
<P>
someone who  is not thinking of the people, the parents who 
have nothing or almost nothing to feed their children.
<P>
	Maybe you have not seen that but I have. I come from a poor 
community, one of the poorest ridings in Canada. People talk 
about the east end of Montreal; yes, it has tragic problems too. 
Our cities also have tragic problems. But in my area, it is even 
worse. I am not speaking on my behalf; I am speaking for those 
who voted for me and those who voted against me. It makes no 
difference to me; those people have a right to work and do not 
have a job, and for some reasons that are hard to identify, they 
are insecure every year.
<P>
	The people of Matapédia-Matane are fed up with seeing 
their wood leave with only basic processing. We used to be 
called drawers of water. I say that today we are bearers or even 
eaters, a more apt description, of sawdust.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	There is only sawdust left in our yards. That is all there is left. 
Our wood is being taken away; trucks carry it everywhere, and 
we cannot even process it at home.
<P>
	Let me give you an example. Back home, there are many mills 
that make wood laths. We wanted to build lobster crates, but I 
was told that it was not possible because transportation costs 
were too high. And we just learned this week that the CN might 
no longer provide a service to our area, because there is not 
enough freight to transport. It seems to me that the state should 
help regions such as ours and give them a chance. If the train 
keeps serving our area, it will not cost any more and it will 
enable us to send out finished products.
<P>
	People in my riding want to work; they want to give an added 
value to the forest resources which would help develop their 
region.
<P>
	We need a little help, but not in three years. We need just a 
little bit of help because our people are resourceful. That is all 
they need. If you give them that little break, you will see a series 
of new, dynamic and job-creating small businesses emerge.
<P>
	But for that to take place, there must be a firm political will to 
apply technology to natural resources. The Eastern Quebec 
Development Plan must be maintained beyond 1995. It must be 
improved and adjusted. We must invest even more. All those 
involved agree on that.
<P>
	In my region, the per capita income is 25 per cent lower than 
the Quebec average. That is right: 25 per cent. At the same time, 
the Minister of Finance is going after unemployment insurance 
benefits and old age pensions. People in my riding would like 
nothing more than to work. As I said earlier, the job market must 
provide stable employment.
<P>
	The only thing I am convinced of is that, in my region as well 
as in all rural areas, this budget will only generate more hardship 
and poverty. More people will have to rely on income security. 
How can you expect people in my region to believe in profitable 
federalism when this regime leads us to such a state of 
dependency and poverty? Yet, the budget will perpetuate this 
situation.
<P>
	When ministers and government members opposite ask us: 
You want sovereignty, but how are you going to manage? I have 
a ready answer: Mr. Speaker, things can never be worse than 
now.
<P>
	Development corporations are in serious trouble. Moreover, 
our population is aging and our young people are leaving. In my 
riding, there is only one CEGEP and no university. It is not 
federalism which supported our regions: It is our municipal 
representatives, our small parishes and our mayors who worked 
very hard. It is also our entrepreneurs who often risked 
everything. And it is especially those men and women in the 
field who worked relentlessly seven days a week. On Friday 
afternoon, my neighbour in a small village had a heart attack and 
was taken to the hospital, where the doctor told him he would be 
all right. Monday morning, he went back to his chain saw-this 
was a Mr. Morrissette-to work to support his family, because 
he had to. I want to thank him and the many Mr. Morrissettes in 
our region. There are hundreds and thousands, and of course I 
cannot name them all, who are like that.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	I also want to thank all the mothers who were prepared to raise 
their families in a rural community. l want to thank these unsung 
heroines who are the salt of the earth. I especially want to thank 
the young people and professionals who came back and accepted 
a drop in salary, to try to help us. We can use more young people. 
If this means making a sacrifice, make it, but you will be 
rewarded by living in a community that has the strength to pull 
together.
<P>
	I want to thank the older people. Their grandparents ploughed 
their fields with ox and horse teams. They worked very hard. Do 
we have to get rid of all these rural communities? That seems to 
be the trend. I always say that a village is worth as much as a 
town. Is the government going to get rid of them? It has no rural 
policy. It is cutting back on forestry and agriculture and 
practically everything. Our small businesses are very 
vulnerable. I know the Minister of Finance said that the 
government would try to do something, but the infrastructures 
project means that sewers will be built, plus a few temporary 
projects, but after 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2476"> 2476 </A></B>
<P>
that, what happens? Temporary has been the name of the game 
for 20 years in my region. The government has created 
temporary jobs but that does not help. We need a much more 
vigorous approach to these problems.
<P>
	Actually, federalism has kept our regions poor, giving the 
impression that they were only good for producing raw 
materials to give this country a trade surplus. Just provide the 
labour, and we will collect the money. Great!
<P>
	What does this budget have to offer rural areas? There is 
nothing for agriculture and forestry agreements have been cut. 
And on top of that, the government increased the number of 
insurable weeks for unemployment insurance and is not creating 
jobs. If this government bothered to listen to the needs of rural 
communities, it could create hundreds of jobs. If it only gave us 
a chance to process our own raw materials, we could create 
thousands of jobs. That is a niche in which the Minister of 
Finance could have invested.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and most ministers here in the House 
are absolutely ignorant of rural needs. Even if he was born in a 
big city, and good for him, it seems to me he should try to 
understand the most vulnerable and the poorest members of our 
society. They are the people, the men and women, who built this 
world, who built our regions, but at the international level, at the 
level of this planet, people are prepared to let small 
communities die. Just shut those six small communities down! 
Do we have to organize to defend our rights? We had Operation 
Dignity, and we took to the streets. There was Ralliement 
populaire, and we took to the streets as well. And both times we 
had something to show for it. When we took to the streets, we 
got something. If we do not take to the streets, we get nothing. 
Will we have to take to the streets again? It is hard work-in fact 
it is exhausting-but we will if we have to.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Even a minimal investment in our regions would yield major 
dividends for the state. Rural communities are not asking for 
charity. Do you know what they want? Their fair share! A dollar 
invested in forestry operations yields the government $7. Is that 
charity? One has to be completely cut off from the real world not 
to realize this.
<P>
	We do not need all kinds of benefits. We do need start up 
money, and it is high time the government decided to invest in 
durable jobs and sensible projects.
<P>
	I have met a lot of people in my riding. They are very 
disappointed in this budget. They are also very worried about 
what will happen to their families. They talked to me about their 
concerns. I met them not long ago, and their first question was: 
Will we still have the right to live in this region of lakes and 
mountains? Matapédia-Matane is one of the most beautiful 
ridings we have-everybody says so-but you should come and 
see for yourself.
<P>
	Their second question was: Can we expect to live out our lives 
in dignity in this peaceful and tranquil area? What kind of future 
will our children have in this region? What kind of future can 
they expect?
<P>
	During the election campaign, the members opposite, those 
sons of darkness, had more or less become, Mr. Speaker-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, order. I hesitated 
for some time before interrupting the hon. member from 
Matapédia-Matane during his speech, which he gave with 
great eloquence and conviction, but I have some trouble with the 
terms ``sons and father of darkness''. This is the third time those 
expressions crop up.
<P>
	Quite frankly, I hesitated because I was not sure I grasped the 
significance of these terms, because if I understand correctly, 
``sons of darkness'' means ``sons of hell''. I certainly do not 
wish to impugn the eloquence and conviction of the hon. 
member's speech, but I would ask him to consider whether he 
wishes to use those terms, which I find rather extreme.
<P>
	We are now over forty minutes. Perhaps the hon. member 
could give the Chair some indication of when he will to finish 
his speech, and the Chair could ask for unanimous consent to let 
him continue, because four or five minutes from now, we will 
have to start Question Period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Mr. Speaker, when I say ``sons of darkness'', I 
mean ``sons in darkness'', which is to say who cannot see 
clearly. That is what I meant.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I hope that is in order, because obviously what was meant is a 
lack of clarity, and I do not think that was insulting to my 
colleagues.
<P>
	Today, aside from the infrastructures project, there is nothing 
for rural communities. The people in my riding and other 
Quebec ridings no longer believe in federalism. Conservative 
and Liberal governments are always hand in glove with the 
multinationals. They will never go along with the principle of 
individual political donations, so there is always a <I>quid pro quo</I>: 
I contribute to the party's coffers and you invest in my company.
<P>
	To hell with rural communities! To hell with planning 
corporations! To hell, or almost, with the plan for Eastern 
Quebec! To hell with the poor! Hurray for the rich! And above 
all, do not touch family trusts. Do not touch the multinationals. 
Many do not pay taxes. Many companies manage to avoid 
paying taxes.
<P>
	Friends are friends. The Minister of Finance has the nerve to 
tell us to wait till 1996-97 to see any benefits as a result of his 
budget. Mr. Speaker, I can tell you this: people do not have time 
to sit there waiting for the dreams of a Minister of Finance to 
materialize.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2477"> 2477 </A></B>
<P>
	When in my riding and other ridings, farms are auctioned off, 
and there are farms for sale practically every week, do you 
know what happens afterwards? The forest starts taking over. 
Rural communities die off gradually. Our farm workers are 
earning less than they did ten years ago. I have a lot of people 
in my riding, who are earning less than they did back then. The 
middle class is becoming the under class, and the poor in my 
riding are going to the local soup kitchen. All this is 
heartbreaking.
<P>
	There is no light at the end of the tunnel, no political will, no 
social vision; there are no enlightened solutions. Rural 
communities are worried, and they are concerned.

	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Fundy-Royal):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
speak today about access to capital by small business.
<P>
	From 1979 to 1989, small business created 87 per cent of the 
new jobs in the country. Small business is the key to future job 
creation. In order for existing small businesses to grow and new 
businesses to develop, we need to ensure that they have adequate 
access to capital.
<P>
	The House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry is 
holding hearings to determine what government can do to 
increase the flow of capital to small business. We will be 
looking at what role the banks play in small business financing 
as well as new sources of financing.
<P>
	I salute all small business owners throughout the country. 
There is a tremendous sense of goodwill by all parties on our 
committee to find solutions. I encourage all Canadians who wish 
to contribute to come forward and make their views known to 
our committee. I am confident and encouraged by these 
initiatives and I know that the needs of small business will be 
met.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very happy to rise in the House today to mark the 
75th anniversary of the Canadian Jewish Congress. This 
organization is well-known among Quebecers and Canadians; it 
is a pillar of our Jewish community.
<P>
	Founded in Montreal after World War I, the Canadian Jewish 
Congress has participated in all major political and social 
debates in Quebec and Canada. Its fight for religious freedom 
and against all forms of discrimination was then taken up by all 
Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	On the occasion of its 75th anniversary, I would like to thank 
the Jewish Congress for its important contribution to our society 
and to wish it a long life.

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am speaking today about the proposed takeover of 
Maclean-Hunter by Rogers Communications Inc.
<P>
	I am here to speak neither for nor against such a move because 
in my party we encourage the entrepreneurial spirit which built 
this great country.
<P>
	When this matter goes before the CRTC for approval I submit 
it is important that this commission take into consideration the 
effect this deal may have on small town Canada.
<P>
	In my riding of Mission-Coquitlam there is a labour dispute 
at the local Rogers Cablevision outlet. This dispute has hurt 
families that are involved in a lockout and inconvenienced many 
who do not cross lawful picket lines. It is my belief that the 
interests of small town and rural Canada must always be front 
and centre when we consider the effects of corporate 
manoeuvring.
<P>
	A large percentage of Canadians have little choice concerning 
the source of the news they receive. Let us be cautious when we 
are put in a position of limiting these choices even further.

	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government will soon determine the site for the headquarters of 
the North American Commission for Environmental 
Co-operation.
<P>
	Winnipeg would be the most appropriate location as the city is 
already home to the International Institute for Sustainable 
Development and the Secretariat for the Canadian Council of 
Ministers of the Environment.
<P>
	Aside from the certain benefits that will result from the 
proximity of these offices with closely related functions, 
Winnipeg provides easy access to transportation.
<P>
	Winnipeg's rails run through the United States to Mexico and 
it is linked directly to Mexico via the most heavily used trucking 
route into that country.
<P>
	As well, there are a number of direct and frequent air flights to 
Ottawa, Washington, D.C., and Mexico, the three capitals of the 
three signatories to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
	I urge the government to choose Winnipeg, which has long 
stood at the forefront of promoting sustainable development, as 
the natural site for the North American Commission for

	Mr. Iain Dunlop and Mr. Darrell Turnbull are being

Association for their superior contribution to basketball.
<P>
	Both men had to meet six requirements including team 
success as well as player-coach relationships to qualify for their

night how the Prime Minister was welcomed to New Brunswick.
<P>
	To thank the people of Beauséjour for re-electing him in 
1990, the Prime Minister in effect gave them a nice poisoned 
gift: a reform of the unemployment insurance program that cuts 
deeply into the benefits of thousands of recipients in New 
Brunswick, as everywhere else in Canada.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians have no intention of bearing the 
brunt of a strategy that tries to solve the deficit problem at the 
expense of the unemployed and of low-income people.
<P>
	The people of New Brunswick, through their hostile reaction, 
are saying no to the proposed reform of social programs, just 
like the people in Toronto who said the same thing to the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	It is obvious that the government must thoroughly review how 
it intends to reform social programs.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canada has a proud tradition of honouring our war 
veterans. There is a fast dwindling group of veterans, however, 
who have been poorly treated by us. I speak of the merchant 
navy vets who were held prisoners of war for as long as five 
years. They had to contend with terrible conditions and 
treatment at the hands of their captors. Yet we currently 
compensate them for only 30 months of incarceration.
<P>
	We have many programs that are less urgent than fair 
treatment for those few vets whose numbers are dwindling 
because of their age. This is not a request for the government to 
spend more money but to get its priorities straight.
<P>
	Some distinguished members of this House defend the current 
cash for life MP pension plan. Instead, I call on those members 
to support fair treatment of these vets by paying the debt we owe 
them for up to the 50 months they suffered in defence of Canada.

challenge

<P>
confronting our country will not be without pain and that  all 
segments of our country have been asked to share the burden.
<P>
	I would point out, however, that the announcement in the 
budget of a two year legislated extension of the existing three 
year salary freeze for the public service as well as a two year 
suspension of pay increments within grade has adversely 
impacted on our loyal, industrious, dedicated public sector 
workforce.
<P>
	I would ask the government to closely monitor the savings 
secured by these initiatives with a view to shortening or lifting 
these freezes as soon as possible.

	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the purpose of the corporate and bankruptcy laws of 
Canada is to stimulate initiative and investment in our economy 
while avoiding the possibility of total personal financial ruin.
<P>
	It is unfortunate when business ventures fail through no fault 
of the individuals concerned, but it is outrageous when business 
failures are used as a means of defrauding creditors, investors, 
employees and governments.
<P>
	I would, therefore, propose that Parliament amend the 
corporate and bankruptcy laws of Canada so that any individual 
who is convicted of an offence under those laws, or of fraud, or 
who has had a decision of a civil court against him or her with 
regard to any bankruptcy cannot be an incorporator, director, 
officer, shareholder or creditor of any corporation for a period of 
five years from the date of the final decision of the court.

Week and many more will be celebrated during this the 
International Year of the Family.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the 
contribution of one woman who has brought national attention 
to a very important issue in Canada. Priscilla de Villiers, a 
woman of vision and courage in the aftermath of losing her 
daughter in the most painful and unbearable circumstances, 
found the inner strength to launch a movement aimed at 
preventing the same pain being experienced by other Canadian 
families.
<P>
	She has clearly demonstrated how one person can make a 
difference. To bring about changes in the justice system she 
began a petition that has been signed by two and a half million 
Canadians and founded CAVEAT which promotes the creation 
of a just, peaceful and safe society.
<P>
	By turning tragedy into a positive force for change, Priscilla 
de Villiers can claim to have achieved a unique success which 
has touched us all. I am pleased to add the name of Priscilla de 
Villiers to the list of women we honour and whose contribution 
continues to affect the lives of so many.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
most recent annual report of the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission, its chief commissioner, Mr. Yalden, was quite 
blunt. The government urgently needs to change the Canadian 
Human Rights Act and the Employment Equity Act. It is 
imperative that the Liberal government take some measures to 
address the issues of poverty in aboriginal communities, wage 
disparity between men and women and non-recognition of gay 
couples.
<P>
	The Commission has repeatedly called on previous 
governments to act, and the time has now come for the Liberal 
government to put its words into action.

convicted of premeditated murder of RCMP constable Brian 
King. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility 
of parole for 25 years.
<P>
	He has appealed his sentence under section 745 of the 
Criminal Code. If he is successful he will be eligible for parole 
in spite of the restriction imposed by the trial judge.
<P>
	On January 20 the judge hearing his appeal in Saskatoon 
declared a mistrial because he felt that the presence in court of 
the victim's family and a group of police officers created an 
emotionally charged atmosphere for the jury.
<P>
	When capital punishment was abolished in Canada the public 
was led to believe that the minimum time served for first degree 
murder would be 25 years. Twenty-two first degree murderers 
who were successful in getting their reviews have been granted 
parole or day parole. This has been a cruel deception on the 
families of murder victims.
<P>

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to be the purveyor of good news for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada the composite leading 
indicators continue to show a healthy pace for the second 
consecutive month in February. Nine of the ten indicators rose 
and the other stayed on a flat line.
<P>
	That augurs well for the continued growth pattern in our 
economy. Certain things do turn up and are very important in the 
broad based growth. A surge of 60,000 new jobs in February 
gave an added impetus and we are looking more to that impetus 
going on through March. New manufacturing orders for durable 
goods showed a 2.7 per cent increase, the highest since 1988, 
despite the widespread retooling of the auto plants. Several 
industries reported growth rates in excess of 10 per cent.

who received contaminated blood products. The provincial 
packages expired and all with the exception of Nova Scotia did 
not recognize their responsibility to family members who 
contracted HIV indirectly. Finally, the Krever commission 
continues to raise more questions than it answers about who 
knew what and when and what action was or was not taken.
<P>
	I call today on the Minister of Health to reopen the federal 
compensation package to include family members who 
contracted HIV indirectly from those who received 
contaminated blood.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. In 
answer to a question from the opposition, the Prime Minister 
said that his government did not intend to extend the GST to 
food, health care and medicine. Questioned as he left the House, 
the Prime Minister pretended that he misunderstood the 
question and went back on his statement by refusing to oppose a 
new tax on health care, medicine and food.
<P>
	Could the Deputy Prime Minister tell us the government's real 
position? Is it the categorical no in the House or the Prime 
Minister's openness to new taxes when he met journalists on 
leaving the House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 
indicated very clearly that there would be no new GST, so the 
question of extending the GST to food and medicine is pure 
speculation, because we are committed to replacing the GST.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have the same problem as yesterday, because that 
was precisely the question raised in the House yesterday. We 
were told that there would be no new GST, but on leaving the 
House, he told us that he misunderstood the question.
<P>
	Now the question is very clear today: we are not talking about 
the GST; we are talking about a new tax. The Prime Minister told 
us yesterday that he misunderstood the question he was asked 
about the GST, that he was not talking about other taxes. That is 
why we are asking the question again today. I think it is very 
clear.
<P>
	I would like the Deputy Prime Minister to give us an answer, 
because there will be no new GST, there will be no old GST, we 
agree on that, we understand that. But are we to understand that 
the government's preferred option is to tax more products, 
including health care, medicine and food, in some other way, 
perhaps a hidden tax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the basis of our mandate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2481"> 2481 </A></B>
<P>
of October 25, the government promised the full participation of 
the House of Commons. The hon. member knows very well that 
some of his colleagues are now working on how we can replace 
the GST.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said outright that this government's 
policy is not to have a new GST. Now, as for what the committee 
studying the question will produce, I think that he should talk 
with his friends and colleagues who are on the committee so that 
they can produce a unanimous report recommending a strategy 
to replace the GST.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have indeed spoken with my colleagues and with my 
leader. On this side of the House, we are very clear. We want no 
tax, not the old GST, not a new GST, not an XYZ tax, no hidden, 
half-hidden or unhidden tax. We want no tax on medicine, food 
and health care. The other side's position on that is not clear.
<P>
	I would like the Deputy Prime Minister to be as open as this 
side of the House and to speak out. I ask her if she does not admit 
that the first victims of a new tax, hidden or not, on medicine, 
health care and food would be low-income people, especially 
single parent families and seniors?

<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

	The committee agreed to a motion several weeks ago to study 
all aspects of the tax to make sure the tax is made more fair for 
all Canadians. We have opened up the discussions so that all 
members can question all witnesses. The committee is 
beginning to travel to other provinces to talk to provincial 
ministers about how they would like to see it integrated.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Deputy Prime Minister. This morning, we learned that the 
Minister of Finance has disclosed wide-ranging business 
holdings and this raises a number of important questions. The 
Minister of Finance, who is also responsible for regional 
development in Quebec, cannot take part in cabinet discussions 
relating to shipbuilding, shipping, whether by rail or by sea, the 
St. Lawrence Seaway and rail and bus transportation systems.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Considering that the Minister of Finance has primary 
responsibility for economic policy, will the Deputy Prime 
Minister not recognize that her colleague's diverse holdings 
pose a major problem in so far as cabinet operations are 
concerned, since he cannot become involved in a number of 
major economic issues?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, even the Bloc Quebecois 
should not be so presumptuous as to suggest that a person with 
business holdings in Quebec has no right to be a member of the 
federal cabinet. That would be ridiculous.
<P>
	If the hon. member wants to discuss the ethical behaviour of 
the Minister of Finance, he should note that in 1989, the minister 
was the first person to disclose the full extent of his business 
holdings to all Canadians. I think that there is a place in 
Parliament for members like myself who do not have any 
holdings, as well as for others who do have such holdings. This 
makes for a sound democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like the 
Deputy Prime Minister to understand that we are not attacking 
the minister's credibility, integrity or honesty.
<P>
	I am simply asking her if she is prepared to concede that the 
Minister of Finance could be faced with a very delicate, 
conflict-of-interest situation since one of the companies he 
owns has three lawsuits pending against the federal government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the finance minister has put 
the dealings of his companies into a trust which is not in any way 
influenced by any of his actions.
<P>
	To follow through on the hon. member's implication, which I 
find extremely distasteful, the implication is that because the 
finance minister has had past successful business dealings he 
should not be sitting in the cabinet of the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	It seems to me if one wants a balanced approach one needs to 
have people in cabinet, in caucus and in government who have 
some strong connections with the labour movement, with the 
business community and with social activists. That is what 
democracy is all about. For heaven's sake, I think Paul Martin is 
an excellent addition to a cabinet team.

is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, yesterday you encouraged this House to be more 
civil. The Reform Party has promised to bring civility to this 
place. However, as early as three years ago a member opposite 
was referring to our leader as the David Duke of the north. 
Supporters of the Liberal Party were encouraged to refer to 
Reformers as racists or bigots. Even when we had only one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2482"> 2482 </A></B>
<P>
member in this House derogatory comments were made about 
Reformers by members opposite when they were in opposition.
<P>
	My question is direct and simple. Is the Deputy Prime 
Minister prepared to stand in this place today and promise to 
persuade her colleagues that the rat pack days are over?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all the statements 
attributed to me were never made.
<P>
	The member should know the statement I made three years 
ago was very specific about the nature of Reform Party policies 
passed at its 1990 convention. I stated that those policies were 
racist. In fact the party decided subsequently to withdraw those 
policies.
<P>
	Second, I may be wrong but I thought I saw the hon. member 
or one of the hon. members who lays claim to the label of 
redneck standing and bowing in the House yesterday, happy with 
the fact that he personally calls himself a redneck.
<P>
	If the member has a problem with the term redneck I suggest 
he should address his difficulties to his own colleagues in his 
own caucus. Obviously there are a number of them who are 
proud to be called rednecks.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the 
prevailing attitude that we are addressing.
<P>
	We on this side of the House are here to do a job on behalf of 
Canadians and contribute to the debates on the great issues of 
the day.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister if we can end this week with a 
promise to all Canadians that the personal insults hurled from 
the government benches will stop.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certainly the wish of the 
people of Canada that this place get down to serious business.
<P>
	I read comments attributed to the hon. member's leader in the 
newspaper this week where he suggests he feels compelled to 
introduce a code of conduct on drinking and running around. 
That is because he had personal knowledge that people in the 
energy industry used this information to influence the political 
positions of members of Parliament. I must say I find that 
position rather reprehensible and abhorrent.
<P>
	I hope everyone in this House realizes that the job of this 
Parliament and this government is to get Canada working again 
and not to spend time passing slurs on members of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I might interject there is no one in this House 
and there is no one in Canada who would be happier than your 
Speaker if we could agree on if not a code at least an agreement 
that we would not be going back and forth with insults of any 
kind.
<P>
	With that in mind I call on the hon. member for Simcoe 
Centre.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform 
Party is quite capable of looking after its own members. In no 
way are we trying to impose that on members of the other side.
<P>
	I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for her comments. If we are 
to end this week on a civil note, I would ask if the Deputy Prime 
Minister will ask the minister of aboriginal affairs to offer an 
apology to the member for Athabasca.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, all hon. members will agree 
that the real business of this House is the problem of the literally 
thousands of Canadians who are without work and who are 
looking to us for some leadership.
<P>
	It seems to me there has been a fairly vigorous exchange of 
comments in this House. I have to tell the member that over my 
years in Parliament I have been called many things. Frankly, I 
am not going to spend the time of this House worrying about 
what somebody said about me yesterday, the day before, last 
week or last month.
<P>
	I would tell the hon. member that the job of the House today is 
to start giving some thought to the crucial issues, for example 
the unemployment situation across this country.

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
directed to the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	In his annual report tabled yesterday, the Canadian Human 
Rights Commissioner sternly denounced the treatment inflicted 
upon native communities in Canada.
<P>
	While taking a stand in favour of self-government, he warned 
the government that this was not a miracle cure and urged it to 
put an end to the segregation and paternalism fostered by the 
Indian Act.
<P>
	What strategy, including concrete actions, does the 
government intend to put in place to implement the Human 
Rights Commissioner's recommendations and bring an end to 
the economic dependency created by the Indian Act, which is at 
the origin of the severe social problems gripping several native 
communities in Canada today?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite 
right when he says that there are no miracle cure for native 
communities' problems. There is not only one but several native 
communities in Canada, just as there are several anglophone 
communities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2483"> 2483 </A></B>
<P>
	I think that the strategy adopted by the Department of Indian 
Affairs, which even tried to have its name changed because this 
paternalistic overtone did not reflect the place, the equal place 
native communities must have in our society, takes that into 
account. As the minister mentioned earlier, he is negotiating 
native self-government agreements to ultimately put his 
department out of business.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I would say that these are the two pillars of a great policy to 
advance the cause of equality for all natives peoples of this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that the 
government should be especially diligent seeing that the Indian 
Act presently in effect was sponsored by the current Prime 
Minister back in the early 1970s.
<P>
	Does the government not realize that it can give a real positive 
indication of its willingness to improve the status of native 
people by ensuring, as promised, the prompt return to the 
mainland of the Innu community in Davis Inlet?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is statements like that, 
obviously based on an incomplete knowledge of the facts, that 
lead people to get the wrong impression.
<P>
	The member says that the Prime Minister is author of the 
current policy on Indian Affairs. The Indian Act was around 
approximately 75 years before the current Prime Minister came 
to the House of Commons. To suggest that somehow he is 
responsible for all the problems that face the aboriginal 
communities is absolutely false.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the Minister for Indian and Northern 
Affairs are working extremely hard to move toward 
self-government. His personal commitment, the commitment of 
the Prime Minister to abolish the department of Indian and 
northern Affairs, is a real reflection of his understanding that we 
do not need paternalism in government policy. What we need is 
equality and that is what we are moving toward.

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is also for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday the Liberal Government of Newfoundland 
announced that it would balance its budget next year. In a budget 
distinguished by the absence of any new taxes or job creation 
programs, Finance Minister Winston Baker stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We must not make commitments today that will place an unmanageable 
financial burden on the taxpayers of tomorrow. We can no longer mortgage our 
children's future for short term political gain. That was the way of the past.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The economic challenges facing Newfoundland are certainly 
as serious as those of the federal government. If Newfoundland 
can commit to a balanced budget, why can the Government of 
Canada not do the same?
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is very appropriate. I think 
we should all congratulate the Newfoundland government on its 
fine effort.
<P>
	I point out to the hon. member that the principal reason the 
budget is so close to being balanced, according to its finance 
minister, is the generous treatment under equalization by the 
federal government.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are saying that steps need to be taken now to quit 
living on borrowed money. One of the signals many Canadians 
are telling their elected representatives they want to see is a 
reform of the gold plated pension plan of members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	When will the government respond to public outrage over a 
plan which gives MPs a pension for life after only six years in 
office?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe it is because it is 
Friday; pensions seem to be a Friday question.
<P>
	The fact is that the government has committed itself to reform 
of the pension plan. The Prime Minister has stated 
unequivocally during the election, after the election, in the 
House and outside the House that he feels the age for receiving 
the pension should be reviewed. That is part of an overall review 
which includes the issue of double dipping.
<P>
	I know the member would want to reflect on the fact that 
several members in her caucus are currently receiving pensions 
from various departments of the Government of Canada at the 
same time as receiving their salaries.
<P>
	Obviously the pension issue is a complex issue. We will be 
introducing some very specific changes, but to suggest that the 
Government of Canada is going to solve its financial problems 
by a review of the pension system for 295 MPs is not a fair 
reflection of the fact that our financial problems are much more 
significant. They require some structural changes to the 
economy which we intend to carry out.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question, which is for the Deputy Prime Minister, 
has to do with an everyday problem, since it concerns the tragic 
situation of unemployment.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development was strongly 
criticized by a number of people representing social groups, 
during a discussion on the reform of social programs, in 
Toronto. Several participants accused the government of 
wanting to fight our country's economic problems on the back of 
the poor and the unemployed who need social programs. The 
Prime Minister was also criticized in New Brunswick on this 
issue.
<P>
	Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree that, as one participant 
put it to the Minister of Human Resources Development, ``the 
problem is unemployment, not unemployment insurance and not 
social security programs'', adding that ``the government tries to 
solve economic problems through social programs''? Does the 
Deputy Prime Minister share that view?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that changes in 
Canada's industrial sector are triggering major disruptions. In 
my riding, some workers are directly concerned because the 
steel industry can now produce a lot more steel with far fewer 
workers. Traditional jobs, which we were very proud of, are 
disappearing, in the steel industry as well as in other industries. 
These jobs must be replaced.
<P>
	What the Minister of Human Resources Development is 
trying to do, with the co-operation of every department and 
province, is to set up a support system for those who will never 
be able to work again. The minister also wants to give those who 
are capable of working, and who are looking for work but cannot 
find any, the necessary tools to adapt to the new industrial 
reality.
<P>
	Let us take the case of a 40 year old person who had always 
worked in the steel industry before being laid off. This person 
needs to be retrained to develop new skills and have access to 
new opportunities. This is what we are trying to do by bringing 
in changes which are very hard to make but also very necessary 
to ensure our competitiveness in the 21st century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now that she is sitting on the other side, the Deputy 
Prime Minister seems much less sensitive to the plight of the 
unemployed.
<P>
	Does she agree that, instead of targeting the poor by 
reforming social programs, the government must implement a 
real job creation program, in compliance with the consensus 
reached during the G7 Summit on Employment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think that as a 
member of the government I am any less sensitive to the people 
in my riding who have lost their jobs than the member opposite. 
I accept the fact that every member in the House hurts when a 
person in their riding loses a job.
<P>
	The fact is that we need to put in place specific strategies on 
the one hand to make sure we are protecting the aged, the sick, 
and those people who have no chance, no means or no need to 
re-enter the workforce. They must have their income levels 
protected. At the same time we have to ensure that those people 
of my age who see the old jobs disappearing have the tools they 
need to get back into the productive workforce.
<P>
	It is a delicate balancing act. It is going to cause some pain, 
but we will have to do it because without the pain of the change 
in the workforce we will end up in the 21st century with no new 
jobs for those people in my age group who need to get back into 
the productive workforce.

the United States and awaits an extradition hearing in Canada.
<P>
	Meanwhile serious questions have been raised about the

over $3 million.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as minister responsible for amateur sports I may be in a 
better position than the Deputy Prime Minister to answer the 
question.
<P>
	It will be appreciated that the matter is the subject of court 
action and therefore it is inappropriate to comment on it. Quite

been provided under the Canadian Heritage program to Hockey

Canada. There is no evidence that any of that money could have 
been misallocated and therefore cause a source of concern.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
if the minister recognized parts of that question it is because it 
was a question essentially put to the House 15 months ago by a 
present cabinet minister of the government to the previous 
government. The problem has been ongoing and the same 
essential evasion of an answer has been ongoing for quite some 
time.
<P>
	Be that as it may, my supplementary question would be to the 
Minister of Justice. Would the minister assure the House of the 
government's full legal co-operation in pursuing the extradition 
of Mr. Alan Eagleson to face trial in the United States?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the extradition proceedings 
provided in the Extradition Act contemplate an application to 
court which may or may not be made if extradition is sought and 
ultimately a procedure by which I may be asked to pass upon the 
application for extradition proper.

recommendations on defence and security. It recommended 
among other things, that Canada builds three support ships for 
humanitarian aid and peacekeeping.
<P>

good question.
<P>
	The Canada 21 report the hon. member refers to was the result 
of a blue ribbon panel that looked at the overall security of 
Canada. I tell the hon. member the department has reviewed the 
recommendations at first blush and is still looking at them in 
detail. Some of the recommendations are not necessarily 
conducive to the Department of National Defence because they 
refer to security in the overall sense.
<P>
	We are looking at all the recommendations. While I would not 
want to comment on this one specifically, I would take this 
opportunity to say that one of the strong recommendations with 
respect to defence is that a defence policy review be conducted. I 
am pleased to report to the House that it is well under way.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask 
the Deputy Prime Minister a supplementary question regarding 
the MIL Davie shipyards. Could the Deputy Prime Minister tell 
us who in the government will be in charge of putting the case 
for the MIL Davie shipyards, one of the most important in 
Quebec, since the Minister of Finance, also responsible for 
regional development in Quebec, will not be in a position to 
uphold the campaign commitments of the Liberal Party due to 
his personal interests in marine transportation and to his 
reluctance to even talk about it to his Cabinet colleagues?
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that marine 
transportation policy is a responsibility of the Minister of 
Transport. Indeed, he has answered questions on the matter, in 
the House, on several occasions. The hon. member said, as did 
his colleague, that the Minister of Finance did not have the right 
to act in certain areas or to set policy because he was formerly in 
business. This is a disgrace.
<P>
	When you talk to Ghislain Dufour, he asks that more 
businesspersons come to Parliament. This is the second time 
that the hon. member tries in one way or another to suggest that

<P>
	I spoke by telephone this morning with the United States

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The budget calls for spending $163 billion in the upcoming 
fiscal year, some $40 billion of which will have to be borrowed. 
Spread out across the population of Canada this works out to 
spending about $1,500 per family per month of money that is 
collected in taxes and other revenue and spending an additional 
$500 per family per month of borrowed money.
<P>
	My question for the minister is this. In view of the fact that 
there are thousands of families who do not even make $2,000 per 
month and many more for whom that is away too much, will the 
minister acknowledge that this level of spending is away higher 
than we can sustain in the long run?
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, the 
borrowing bill C-14 is in front of the House today and the 
figures quoted in his question are substantially off. If he refers 
to the debate that is taking place, and to his members who are 
participating in the debate, he will get his figures correct.
<P>
	The government is, as is every Canadian, very worried that 
there is such a fiscal demand on the government. We have a very 
clear plan over the next couple of years. The member will be 
happy to see the plan succeed so our deficit will be under 
control.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was using the 
number $39.7 billion as the deficit. I was aware that $35 billion 
is the amount that is in the current request for borrowing.
<P>
	Will the government undertake to formulate some achievable 
goals for deficit and debt reduction and state them, and to 
challenge the people to work together? In other words, I would 
like to know whether we can expect, sometime in the

meaningful consultation.
<P>
	In response to the hon. member's question, may I point out 
that the 1 per cent of population immigration figure, which is

place by the last government during 1993 when eight public 
meetings were held across the country involving hundreds of 
Canadians from all segments of society.

indicated that the flammability of cotton is significantly 
increased with the use of household fabric softeners.
<P>
	What measures have been taken to publicize and correct these 
hazards?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am aware of the incident that the hon. member has brought up. A 
woman wearing a terrycloth robe leaned across a lit candle and 
there was a flash flame across the terrycloth. Fortunately there 
was no injury although it was a frightening experience.
<P>
	I am also aware of the report that says a fabric softener may 
increase the flammability of certain types of material. 
Unfortunately only one kind of material was tested in this report 
so we cannot draw definite conclusions.
<P>
	We are continuing our study of the matter. Let me reassure 
Canadians through you, Mr. Speaker, and the hon. member as 
well, that textile flammability regulations under the Hazardous 
Products Act which were brought in in 1971 have been 
extremely effective in preventing flammable textiles from 
staying on the market.
<P>
	We certainly intend to continue enforcing-

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice. In his annual 
report, the Commissioner of Human Rights reveals that the 
federal government goes against several of its own legislative 
provisions by allowing Revenue Canada to deny homosexual 
couples access to various fringe benefits given to heterosexual 
couples.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice intend to propose amendments to 
applicable Canadian legislation in order to put an end to this 
type of discrimination against homosexual couples?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, in its campaign for office, in 
its throne speech and in statements made subsequently in the 
House, the government has committed itself to amendments to 
the Human Rights Act which will add sexual orientation as a 
ground on which discrimination is prohibited.
<P>
	We intend to follow through on that commitment.

project has the ability to devastate wild salmon in the Fraser 
River system.
<P>
	Currently the effect of this project is being monitored and is 
under review on the Nechako basin alone by the B.C. Utilities 
Commission hearings. The Rivers Defence Coalition, a 
coalition of groups opposed to the project, have expended their 
resources and are being forced to withdraw from the hearings.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today with good news. 
I wish to advise the House that the Government of Canada 
intends to lift the sunken oil barge <I>Irving Whale</I> in order to avoid 
environmental disaster.
<P>
	People living on Prince Edward Island will be happy that this 
cloud hanging over their heads will finally be lifted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The people of the Magdalen Islands will also be glad to know 
they will no longer be threatened with pollution from the time 
bomb that is the <I>Irving Whale</I>. As well, the tourism industry and 
the lobster fishery will be threatened no longer.
<P>
	My colleague, the Minister of Transport, and I have carefully 
assessed all available information and we have decided to put 
forward a proposal to raise and salvage the <I>Irving Whale</I>. This is 
an excellent example of co-operation between our two 
departments. Transport Canada and Environment Canada have 
worked together in a prompt and efficient manner to solve an old 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2489"> 2489 </A></B>
<P>
problem. The <I>Irving Whale </I>has been lying on the bottom of the 
sea for 8,593 days, threatening to spill its oil at any moment.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am quoting from a report of a former 
Environment Minister, who is now Leader of the Opposition. 
This report, tabled in September 1990, called for immediate 
action to deal with the <I>Irving Whale</I>. The report was released by 
the Minister of Environment of a previous Conservative 
government, namely Lucien Bouchard. Since then, it is obvious 
that nothing has been done to raise the barge. It took this 
government only 135 days to find a solution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The <I>Irving Whale</I> has been lying on the bottom of the ocean 
for 8,593 days. Those 8,593 days did not pass without comment 
and outrage from the people of Atlantic Canada and the 
Magdalen Islands.
<P>
	More recently, in 1989 the Leader of the Opposition while 
Minister of the Environment with much pomp and circumstance 
commissioned the Brander-Smith report. It reviewed tanker 
safety and marine spills response capability.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	In meetings throughout Atlantic Canada during his tenure in 
1989 the commission was repeatedly warned about the threat the 
<I>Irving Whale</I> posed. It was warned in Halifax. It was warned in 
Saint John. It was warned in Charlottetown by Prince Edward 
Island's Minister of the Environment. Unfortunately, the 
minister of the day did not act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The review report announced, as I mentioned earlier, by the 
former Environment Minister, says, on page 127, and I quote: 
``The barge <I>Irving Whale </I>sank in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. No 
attempt was made to salvage the barge or its cargo''. Despite the 
condition of the barge, nothing was done.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the same report recommendation 613 on page 131 states 
that a decision must be made as to whether or not to remove the 
oil or raise the barge. However nothing was done.
<P>
	It took this government only 135 days to listen to the concerns 
of residents of Atlantic Canada and the Magdalen Islands and to 
make a decision to find a solution to this problem.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The <I>Irving Whale </I>sank in September 1970 and lies in 70 
metres of water off North Point, P.E.I. It contains an estimated 
3,100 tonnes of Bunker-C oil. We are taking this action today 
because we know that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of 
cure.
<P>
	Of course, the proposal to raise the <I>Irving Whale </I>will undergo 
an environmental assessment and the public will have the 
opportunity to comment before a final decision is made.
<P>
	Public consultations will begin shortly and will include the 
fishing and tourism industries, environmental groups, 
municipal officials and the general public. Public meetings will 
be held in Quebec, as well as on the Magdalen Islands.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Public hearings will also be held in Prince Edward Island, 
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland. We will begin 
immediately with the preparatory work including planning, 
contracting and the environmental assessment review. If the 
government's proposal is supported by the environmental 
assessment and the public meetings, the lifting will take place 
this summer if possible, but the summer of 1995 at the latest.
<P>
	Raising the <I>Whale</I> could be completed in about 40 days, half 
the time it would take to pump the barge. This option will 
remove all possibility of future pollution. Once the <I>Whale</I> has 
been raised it will then be moved to a suitable location to be 
pumped and cleaned under controlled conditions.
<P>
	This site has been regularly monitored by air and surface for 
years and still is. Last September a combined operation by the 
Canadian Coast Guard and the Canadian Navy successfully 
capped leaking vents and reinforced the tank hatches.
<P>
	As soon as the weather permits, divers will be going down to 
verify the condition of the barge. This will ensure that the <I>Irving 
Whale</I> will not leak until it is lifted.
<P>
	The private sector has completed three reports on the removal 
of oil from the <I>Irving Whale</I>. As promised in this House, I am 
happy to table them today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Based on the best technical and scientific information 
available at this time, and taking into account the report's 
findings, the Minister of Transport and I believe the best option 
is to raise the barge and remove its cargo.
<P>
	Analysis by the Canadian Coast Guard shows that raising the 
barge is safe, technically easier and more cost-effective. 
Raising it will cost about $10 million while the cost of pumping 
the oil from the bottom would cost $27 million.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Lifting also presents the least risk to the environment and to 
the safety of those involved in the operation. As well a lifting 
operation uses known technology, leaves no residual oil and is 
less prone to uncontrolled cost escalation and time overruns.
<P>
	I want to publicly acknowledge the work of the Minister of 
Transport on this important issue. I particularly want to 
acknowledge the dedication of the public servants in both 
depart-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2490"> 2490 </A></B>
<P>
ments who worked very  hard to pull this package together from 
the perspectives of financing and the technical applications.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not also publicly acknowledge the 
leadership role played by the minister responsible for Prince 
Edward Island, the Secretary of State for Veterans. As we speak 
he is on the island viewing this presentation. Also there are the 
members of Parliament from the respective regions, including 
the hon. member for Egmont who worked very hard on this issue 
and the hon. member for Malpeque who particularly brought a 
new perspective to the issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And also the hon. member from Îles-de-la-Madeleine, who 
worked very hard to resolve this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member laughs. The member should not 
laugh because this government can be darn proud of the fact that 
in the short period of 135 days it has been able to solve a 
problem that had been hanging around his government for 
almost nine years.
<P>
	I am quite proud of the fact that we got our act together. We 
found the financial tools necessary and we are going to raise the 
<I>Irving Whale</I>.
<P>
	Based on the assessment of all available information, the 
Canadian Coast Guard and Environment Canada are proposing 
to raise the <I>Irving Whale</I>. This solution is the best suited to fully 
resolve the problems. This solution also poses the least risk in 
terms of the environment and human safety.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that the government is committed to a 
thorough and complete environmental review of the proposed 
action. We will give serious consideration to all new 
information brought forward during the environmental 
assessment and consultation process.
<P>
	Finally I want to thank my hon. friend, the Minister of 
Transport, for his commitment and co-operation in helping 
develop this solution. I also again want to thank my colleagues, 
the hon. Secretary of State for Veterans and the hon. members 
for Egmont, Malpeque and 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine who have been working 
so hard to find a solution to this potential disaster.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, as an 
ecologist and a recognized environment specialist, I can only 
welcome this announcement. As a matter of fact, I took an 
interest in the <I>Irving Whale</I>, a potential ecological time-bomb, 
as soon as I became the opposition's environment critic.
<P>
	On January 21, I had the honour to ask my very first oral 
question in the House. It concerned the <I>Irving Whale</I>. Since 
then, both my constituency office and my Ottawa office have 
been receiving phone call after phone call, and numerous faxes, 
either from the Magdalen Islands or Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	All these messages told me something very strange. People in 
that part of the country are concerned about two things. First of 
all, they want this carcass to be emptied of its content ASAP. 
And second, they wonder who will pay for the clean-up 
operation on this time-bomb. That is not even mentioned in the 
minister's statement.
<P>
	As far as my first question is concerned, we were told this 
afternoon that the barge was going to be raised. This proposal 
will go ahead provided it clears the public hearings process and 
the environmental assessment review.
<P>
	My understanding is that the three reports tabled here at noon 
are aimed at finding the best solution to get rid of this danger. 
How is it then that the environment factors were not taken into 
account?
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	There is a chance that the proposed solution, which is to raise 
the barge, will not pass the environmental assessment review 
process, in which case we will be back to square one.
<P>
	Those three studies have already cost a significant amount of 
money. It is fine and dandy to hold public hearings, but if they 
lead to different conclusions from the ones in the report, does 
that mean that the latter are skewed and that we must start all 
over again?
<P>
	We are running out of time. Therefore, I suppose that the 
hearings in question will be more like briefings, especially since 
the Easter-Gagnon committee already consulted people two 
weeks ago. And then the minister comes in this afternoon and 
announces that there will be further consultations. Well, if the 
Easter-Gagnon consultations were so efficient, why do we need 
more? To spend more money? To stage a show for the media? I 
wonder.
<P>
	I now wonder about the work carried out by the 
Easter-Gagnon committee, which held two series of hearings at 
the beginning of March 1994 with more than 25 groups, 
associations, municipalities, political parties and individuals, 
since the minister just announced with much pomp and 
circumstance yet another series of public consultations. Is this 
another way to postpone, I repeat, to postpone action? Setting up 
committees and undertaking reviews is fine, but a government 
that takes action is even better.
<P>
	As for the second solution, not a word. Irving, which still 
owns the barge, gets off scot-free once again. Twice in 24 years, 
with the same party in power.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2491"> 2491 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe, like most residents of that region and like all 
members of the Bloc Quebecois who are asking serious 
questions, that taxpayers should not have to pay for this 
cleanup. Bloc members will keep their eyes open to track the 
real costs directly related to this wreck.
<P>
	True, the <I>Irving Whale</I> has been lying off the islands for 8,593 
days, but let us not forget that, of these 8,593 days, 3,450 were 
spent under the Conservatives and 5,308 under the Liberals. To 
these 5,308 Liberal days, we must add all the days to come until 
the summer of 1995.
<P>
	If the minister is proud of herself and her colleagues, I know 
many people earning their living from the sea who want this 
<I>Irving Whale</I> business to end as quickly as possible.
<P>
	The problem is simple. For a quarter of a century, a barge 
containing 3,100 tonnes of bunker C has been lying on the 
bottom of the ocean 70 meters below the surface, off the 
Magdalen Islands and Prince Edward Island.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Rust is doing its work slowly but surely.
<P>
	The Irving family was compensated for the loss of its oil 
tanker by its insurance company. Someone must be bright 
enough to decide that this wreck cannot be left on the bottom of 
the ocean for another quarter century, and someone must take 
the initiative to raise it while there is still time.
<P>
	As the Minister of the Environment said, we have decided to 
raise the barge because we know that an ounce of prevention is 
worth a pound of cure.
<P>
	Indeed, every day that the minister spends on reviews and 
consultations increases the risks. The Bloc Quebecois urges the 
government to move quickly to make those responsible pay and 
to act safely because we do not have the right to cause an 
environmental disaster in that beautiful part of Quebec and 
Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to thank all the people of the 
Magdalen Islands and Prince Edward Island who regularly 
contacted my riding office or my office here in Ottawa to give 
me information, but mostly to share with me their main concern. 
I am aware today, Mr. Speaker, that if the government acted so 
quickly after only 135 days, it is because there was on the 
opposition benches someone who-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> And I will end on this, Mr. 
Speaker, there was on the opposition benches a critic who cared 
about the environment and about this issue, and even in the 
Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development, I rose at every meeting just to be told, ``Wait, 
wait, we are going to do something''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We can tell it is Friday!
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the minister on her announcement today. <I>Irving 
Whale</I> has been a ticking environmental time bomb since it sank 
in 1970 and another Liberal administration allowed it to remain 
there.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the minister should be congratulated for this 
action. At the same time she should be condemned for her 
inaction on another issue in the gulf area, namely, the proposed 
pumping of waste water from Scott Maritimes Limited pulp and 
paper plant two kilometres into Northumberland Strait.
<P>
	Nearly 30 years ago area residents were told the treatment 
system for effluent from the Scott Maritimes mill would result 
in water suitable for swimming or even drinking. The results 
today include a dead, stinky lagoon and area fishermen say a 
mile long area of dead bottom near Powell's Point where no 
plankton grow and no fish swim.
<P>
	Nova Scotia's current proposal for remedying this situation 
includes a $17 million upgrade of the effluent treatment system 
which it operates, the bypassing of the existing stabilization 
lagoon and extending the effluent pipeline two kilometres into 
the Northumberland Strait.
<P>
	In a letter to you, minister, dated November 8, 1993, to which 
you have not replied, Mary J. Gorman and Percy Hayne Jr. 
informed you that fishermen were fed up-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would just like to 
remind members to not forget to pass their comments through 
the Chair and not directly to one another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> My apologies, Mr. Speaker. Mary J. Gorman 
and Percy Hayne Jr. informed the minister that fishermen were 
fed up with the daily dumping of 87 million litres of effluent into 
Northumberland Strait by Scott Maritimes Limited.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	One, they asked the minister how the federal government can 
justify agreeing with the Nova Scotia government's recent 
proposal to pipe Scott's effluent to MacKenzie Head, long 
considered by fishermen to be a vital spawning area.
<P>
	Two, they asked whether the federal government can 
guarantee that the chemicals which have not already flowed into 
this strait over these past 30 years but which have been 
accumulated in Boat Harbour settlement ponds will not now be 
inadvertently piped to MacKenzie Head.
<P>
	Three, they asked whether the federal government and all 
parties involved in these negotiations consider it justifiable to 
diffuse and disperse toxic, bioactive chemicals into our oceans 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2492"> 2492 </A></B>
<P>
which influence sexual  maturity and reproduction in fish when 
alternate technology exists.
<P>
	Four, they asked whether the federal and all parties involved 
in these negotiations will lobby Scott Maritimes whose 
multi-million dollar profits have been subsidized by the 
taxpayers of Nova Scotia for the past 30 years to consider an 
alternate bleaching process and once and for all stop polluting 
Boat Harbour and Northumberland Strait.
<P>
	The Halifax <I>Chronicle Herald</I> called for a full scale public 
review of the proposed upgrading of the effluent system. The 
province's $17 million plan should be tested in the fire of 
informed debate, they claim.
<P>
	They go on to say that Atlantic Canada's offshore banks have 
few enough rich spawning grounds left and the region cannot 
risk sacrificing more on the altar of political expediency.
<P>
	We congratulate the minister on the <I>Irving Whale</I> 
announcement but suggest that she not be too self-satisfied 
because there is another ecological disaster in the making and 
she should do something about it.

Question No. 12-<B>Mr. Easter:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Who were the members of the Canadian government's GATT negotiating team 
from June 1992 through to January 1994, what are their backgrounds and the 
positions they held prior to becoming members of the team and the dates of their 
appointments?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
The negotiating agenda of the Uruguay round of the GATT 
encompassed a wide range of issues. Accordingly, government 
officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade, Department of Finance, Agriculture 
Canada, Industry Canada (incorporating the former department 
of consumer and corporate affairs and Investment Canada), as 
well as Department of Canadian Heritage, Ministry of 
Transport, Government Services and Justice, took part in the 
negotiations.
<P>
	Given the number of officials involved over the two year 
period covered in the request, it is impractical to track down and 
list each individual. As such, listed below are the names of our 
chief negotiator and ambassador to the GATT and the assistant 
deputy minister, multilateral trade negotiations, Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
<P>
	Ministers of the crown assume full responsibility for all 
policy decisions taken by the government during the GATT 
negotiations.
<P>
	Ambassador G.E. Shannon, Canadian ambassador to the 
GATT and chief negotiator, Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade; appointed 1990
<P>
	Mr. Germain A. Denis, assistant deputy minister, multilateral 
trade negotiations, Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade; appointed 1988
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The question mentioned 
by the parliamentary secretary has been answered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all remaining 
questions be allowed to stand.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Shall the remaining 
questions be allowed to stand?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wish to inform the 
House that pursuant to Standing Order 33(2)(b) because of the 
ministerial statement, Government Orders will be extended by 
25 minutes.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-14, an act to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal year 
beginning on April 1, 1994, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising to speak on third reading of Bill C-14, the borrowing bill. 
I will not waste the time of the House in saying that we are 
opposed to this bill and opposed to the general budgetary and 
borrowing policies of the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-14, an Act to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal 
year beginning on April 1, 1994, will make the national debt 
increase again in the coming year, with the deficit reaching $40 
billion and the borrowing authority $34.3 billion. This means 
that the national debt will grow by nearly $100 billion over the 
next three years. That is why we from the Reform Party continue 
to oppose this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary for finance said in his statement 
earlier today that generally speaking, and I quote: ``this 
borrowing is a normal part of government operations''. That is 
correct. It certainly has become normal for the Government of 
Canada to borrow sums of this kind. It is not just a normal part of 
the Government of Canada, but it has become a normal part of 
the operations of crown corporations. It has become a normal 
part of the operations of provincial governments, a normal part 
of the operations of municipal governments to borrow millions 
and even billions of dollars.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	What is the consequence of this? The consequence is that at 
the federal level we owe half a trillion dollars of debt that will 
increase under the current budgetary policies by another $100 
billion over the next three years. As a nation we owe publicly, all 
levels of government, approximately the value of our entire 
economic output in a single year. That is the consequence of the 
normal activity of borrowing.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said earlier this week we borrow from the 
left, we borrow from the right. We borrow from Canadians. We 
borrow from foreigners. We borrow for today. We borrow for 
tomorrow. We borrow to pay interest on what we borrowed 
yesterday. We certainly do borrow. That is the one thing that 
governments do. That is the one thing the government does, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2494"> 2494 </A></B>
<P>
that Conservative governments have done. They borrow, 
borrow, borrow.
<P>
	Having said that, let us look at the amount of money involved 
in this particular act of borrowing. The bill requests authority 
for fiscal year 1994-1995 for $34.3 billion borrowing 
representing a deficit estimated to be at this point, $39.7 billion.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary in his statement in question 
period suggested that the hon. member for Elk Island was 
incorrect in his analysis of this, that we are not borrowing any 
more than $34.3 billion. That is not correct. We are asking for 
borrowing authority to go into the marketplace to borrow $34.3 
billion but as I will discuss later in my speech we are borrowing 
on top of that. We are borrowing from a number of 
non-budgetary accounts, particularly government 
superannuation accounts, which themselves represent liabilities 
of the government.
<P>
	The member for Elk Island was entirely correct in his analysis 
although the technical borrowing requirement in this bill is 
somewhat lower than the borrowing stated in the deficit. I will 
discuss that at some length.
<P>
	As I said in my speech at second reading it is hard for ordinary 
people to get a handle on exactly what these kinds of numbers 
mean, but let me try to do that. I did that before but let me try to 
do it again and be a little clearer.
<P>
	When we talk about borrowing or a deficit of $40 billion we 
are talking about the equivalent of enough money to eliminate 
the goods and services tax entirely and pay it back twice. We are 
talking about enough money to not only pay our current old age 
security system but to pay it two more times to every single 
recipient. Another way of putting it, with money like this we 
could talk about increasing the budget of every single federal 
program by over 30 per cent.
<P>
	That is the consequence of the kind of borrowing and 
borrowing policies that governments of all stripes and 
governments at all levels have been pursuing for the past 
generation.
<P>
	What are we doing with the money? What is the alternative? 
One of the reasons we are borrowing as much this year is we 
have the famed infrastructure program that now is turning into a 
program for just about anything any municipality wants to do. 
The federal government is encouraging other levels of 
government also to borrow additional money to fund new 
infrastructure projects.
<P>
	What does infrastructure include? There are traditional and 
clear economic definitions of what an infrastucture program is. 
Infrastructure is not simply investment or capital. Infrastructure 
is those kinds of capital investments that have a use for a wide 
range of future economic activities.
<P>
	We began to see the broadening of this definition when we 
saw convention centres funded under this program. In the city of 
Calgary the current controversy is the possible funding of the 
expansion of operations and seats within the Saddledome in 
order to persuade people to keep the National Hockey League 
franchise in Calgary. It is part of the bargaining between the 
Saddledome Corporation, the Calgary Flames and others.
<P>
	Many Canadians are hockey fans, including myself. Many of 
the people calling my office to protest this are also hockey fans. 
But is this really an infrastructure program? Is this the kind of 
project we want our money to be spent on?
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I know it annoys other members who have served more than 
six years but our party puts a lot of emphasis on the need to 
reduce spending on things like MPs pensions and some of the 
other perks and even some of the salaries. In particular, we talk 
about the tax free expense allowances that are extremely 
generous, non-receiptable, that are included in the pay of every 
member of Parliament. Why do we talk about them? Not because 
we believe the deficit could be eliminated by cutting them but 
because of something I read on an airplane recently.
<P>
	I cannot remember who said it, but it was an interesting 
phrase. He said that what concerned him about fiscal policy is 
that he wished fiscal policy was framed by people who had a 
stake in its outcome. That is the whole point with the pensions of 
members of Parliament and why it is a concern when we talk 
about how we are using the money we are borrowing.
<P>
	Very shortly, and we will have a debate on this, and it will not 
be long before the value of the pensions of former members of 
Parliament will exceed the total amount of money that Canadian 
taxpayers are spending on current members of Parliament. 
These are the people who made the decisions that put us where 
we are today financially. They have made themselves permanent 
wards of the state so that we borrow, borrow, borrow to support 
this extravagant scam endlessly. That is why Canadians are 
concerned about these kinds of expenditures and this level of 
borrowing.
<P>
	Let me turn to the red book. The government always insists 
that we read the red book. Of course we always take those 
suggestions to heart. Let me spend a little bit of time to talk 
about what the red book said about borrowing.
<P>
	I quote from pages 19 and 20 where the government talked 
about balanced policies for jobs and growth. One quotation is 
from track two of its economic strategy.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will reduce the deficit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Under this budgetary policy and the borrowing bill the deficit 
will be higher than was planned last year. It is supposed to come 
down after we make accounting changes. It is supposed to come 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2495"> 2495 </A></B>
<P>
down but it is higher than it was projected to be during the time 
we were  debating the red book in the election. In fact it is $10 
billion higher. We have not reduced the deficit.
<P>
	It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We will implement new programs only if they can be funded within existing 
expenditures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I admit there has been some cutting and reallocation but 
expenditures are increasing. In fact program expenditures are 
increasing so not all new initiatives are being funded within 
existing expenditures.
<P>
	The red book said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nine years of Conservative government have seen Canada's debt almost triple, 
from $168 billion in 1983-84 to $458 billion today. Despite repeated promises to 
reduce the deficit, the government has turned in deficits in the $30 billion range 
every year: the latest was $35.5 billion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Of course that was all accurate. That was the best information 
at the time the red book was written. But what is the policy 
today? The policy today is to increase the deficit another $150 
billion in the life of this Parliament. We are going in the same 
direction the Conservatives had been going in the last 10 years.
<P>
	Does the budget project a deficit below $30 billion? Not quite. 
It says that in the third year we will finally go below $30 billion 
but we do not publish the data for the third year or show the 
columns where we can see the deficit going to $30 billion. We 
are merely told to accept that as an act of faith and as an 
extension of the boom times which we assume are coming.
<P>
	On page 20 of the red book-the red ink book. I like the red 
ink book expression.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>After nine years of Conservative budgets, the federal government's deficit is 
5.2 per cent of gross domestic product. This is too high.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What is the projection in the budget for this year? It is a deficit 
GDP ratio higher than 5.2 per cent. Off hand I cannot remember 
but I believe it is close to 6 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The next statement concerns the 3 per cent target and as 
advocated by the member states of the European Community 
and the Maastricht treaty, that of course is not entirely accurate. 
I discussed that in previous debates and I will discuss it today if I 
have some time.
<P>
	In any case this budget and these borrowing proposals are 
very different than the promises outlined in the red book. I 
would also note, as I have noted before, this is the highest 
planned deficit and the highest planned borrowing in our 
history. We have had higher deficits and we may in fact have a 
higher one after the accounting changes. Last year's deficit may 
still prove to be higher than this year's. This is the first time we 
have ever started with a deficit and with borrowing requirements 
this high.
<P>
	The tendency has been in the past years for us to be 
underestimating our requirements and to be exceeding those 
requirements in the course of the year. Last year's borrowing 
authority for fiscal 1993-94, Bill C-117, that was given royal 
assent on May 6, 1993 had requested at the time borrowing 
authority of $31.5 billion based on a $26.5 billion estimated 
financial requirement. That was for last year. We see in fact that 
under this bill the borrowing requirement has increased.
<P>
	The government justifies these policies, this particular level 
of borrowing, by saying that it really can justify it through two 
objectives or two goals. One is that it will help us achieve a 
lower deficit later and that it will help lead the government in its 
plans toward economic growth and job creation. Let me just 
express the scepticism as both a taxpayer and an economist that I 
have about deficits today achieving lower deficits tomorrow and 
in particular an interim target of 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	I was a supporter at one time of the previous government 
when it first came to office which used much the same kind of 
rationale for not dealing with the problem quickly. What did we 
see in the eighties and early nineties? We saw that as 
governments refused to deal quickly with their debt and deficit 
problems they accumulated deficit on top of deficit, debt on top 
of debt and we have the situation today in which the biggest 
factor behind the long term deficit and the growth of debt in 
Canada is not in fact the recession. It is the accumulated debt 
and the interest payments on that debt.
<P>
	When we have that kind of a dynamic it makes it very difficult 
for deficits today, which will add to debt and add to debt charge 
burden, to lead to lower deficits in the future.
<P>
	Some members of Parliament of the governing party are apt to 
refer to the great early 20th century economist, Lord John 
Maynard Keynes, in justifying this kind of economics. I wonder 
how many of them have in fact read what Mr. Keynes wrote on 
this subject and what kind of analysis he used and what kind of 
circumstances under which he justified these kinds of budgetary 
policies.
<P>
	I know the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound has, as I 
have in the past, read these things. We can certainly say that 
these were not the policies advocated by a learned man such as 
that. I do not agree with everything he wrote but he never 
advocated permanent, ongoing structural deficits, not at all.
<P>
	It is also important to say that he wrote at a time when 
governments had very little permanent financial obligations of 
their own. Governments were in fact a source of funds rather 
than a drain of funds. It was a very different situation and one 
that cannot be justified at this point.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	The second point the government has made is that these 
borrowing policies will lead to economic growth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2496"> 2496 </A></B>
<P>
	Just as an alternative opinion-our party has a very different 
economic philosophy-let me read what the job creators of this 
country said about economic growth and job creation. We know 
that with governments being as insolvent or increasingly 
insolvent as they are jobs will come in the future from the 
private sector. I think the Liberal Party generally acknowledges 
that fact.
<P>
	The Canadian Chamber of Commerce in a news released dated 
February 14 said a million jobs can be created according to 
preliminary results from entrepreneurs in a study the chamber 
had conducted. It had 658 responses so far from employers 
representing a range of sizes of firms, all the way from very 
small firms to some of the very large firms. It indicated that with 
the right kinds of economic policies there were capacities within 
these firms for a total increase of employment of one million 
Canadians.
<P>
	The kinds of economic policies it said were necessary, if the 
debt and deficit were reduced, if payroll taxes and corporate tax 
rates were lowered, if the government regulatory burden were 
eased and training and education of the labour force improved, 
could create an average of 14 jobs per firm in the next three 
years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Ask it to give back the 
grant it got to do that study.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> The member says ask it to give 
back the grant that it received to do that study. I think it would 
probably be willing to do that. In fact, our party has advocated, 
with the support of the business organizations of this country, an 
elimination of most, not all, the major business and industrial 
subsidies. I know individual firms will fight that but we found 
no resistance to that policy from business organizations. In fact, 
it is one of the reasons why many of them have been supporting 
the Reform Party and, I would add, in increasing numbers since 
the budget came out.
<P>
	Those were the policies. What I did not see in that list of 
policies that the business community said were needed to 
increase jobs was any mention of an infrastructure program. I 
did not see any mention of increased spending. It was precisely 
the opposite. It did not say it needed an extra $40 billion in 
borrowing this year and $100 billion over the next three years. 
There are a few things in here that are the same as the track the 
government is on, but the things here are a very different policy 
than what the job creators say need to be done to create the jobs 
in this country.
<P>
	Let us go back for a second to the budget which underlies this 
particular borrowing bill because it is important to review that 
and I know I have done this before. The budget is based on a 
series of economic assumptions. In particular are the following 
first year assumptions of growth at an annual rate of 3.0 per cent; 
that interest rates will range in the neighbourhood of 4.5 per cent 
for the short term benchmark to 6.4 per cent long term; that 
inflation will remain low in the 1 per cent to 2 per cent range; 
and that the ability of the tax system  to generate income for the 
government will recover as the economy recovers. It fell last 
year from about 17.7 per cent down to 16.1 per cent.
<P>
	These are all important assumptions and most of them are 
defensible. However, what happens in the subsequent year 
assumptions to justify these kinds of targets? Growth is 
projected to increase permanently to about 3.8 per cent. 
Inflation will continue to stay at record lows. The revenue GDP 
ratio that the tax system establishes will rise. Unemployment 
and job creation will increase. Interest rates will not only fall but 
stay at record lows.
<P>
	I would point out, as I did in my earlier comments, that these 
assumptions are somewhat better than the Progressive 
Conservative assumptions but very much reflective of the same 
kind of thinking. After a very short time period we are 
reasonably pessimistic in the first year but after that we can be 
more optimistic. What we have is a pattern of record low interest 
rates, record low inflation, a return to growth, not as high as the 
Conservatives project, and job creation.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	What is interesting and I emphasize it again is that overall the 
government's estimates are more honest than the Conservatives, 
although still along the same pattern. What is very interesting is 
the job creation estimate. It is the most realistic estimate in the 
budget, given the policies of this government.
<P>
	It is estimated that the unemployment rate will fall from about 
an 11.2 annual average to 11.1 per cent this year and to 10.8 per 
cent next year; in other words, an extremely modest, almost no 
change policy on the total state of the labour force in the 
country. I say that is a very interesting projection for a 
government that claims that job creation is its primary purpose.
<P>
	What this government has done and I commend it for that, 
although I wish it would be more frank in it, is admit that there is 
a link between ongoing high deficits and high spending and high 
levels of unemployment. It has admitted the link for the first 
time.
<P>
	Previous governments said that they could keep these high 
deficits and could engage in gradual reduction strategies, keep 
deficits very high but the unemployment rate would fall. This 
government has admitted that as long as it keeps the deficit high, 
the unemployment rate is going to stay high.
<P>
	The reason for that is the simple economic fact that the funds 
needed for job creation are created through private sector 
investment. Those are the same kinds of funds that governments 
hit when they go into the marketplace to borrow sums of money 
in the range of $40 billion a year.
<P>
	One problem in the government's projections not just for 
future years but even for this year-it has come up in the House 
and I want to raise it again-is the projection on interest rates. In 
my initial speech on Bill C-14 I had indicated to the House that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2497"> 2497 </A></B>
<P>
interest rate projections were  already about half a point above, 
on the long term, what they had been projected to be in the 
budget.
<P>
	I said that they were between 6.8 and 6.9 per cent. I apologize 
to the House if I mislead the House on that. I had written that 
speech a few days before and by the time I had written it, interest 
rates were then over 7 per cent on 10 year government bonds.
<P>
	It is interesting in that context to look at the pattern. There is a 
very definite pattern that has occurred in the financial markets 
since the budget was tabled and since we had our prebudget 
debates when the government gave an indication of its direction.
<P>
	On February 1 and 2 we hit basically a trough not seen in a 
long time in interest rates in this country. Let me quote interest 
rates on government securities. We had a bank rate of 3.87 per 
cent. We had a rate on six month treasury bills of 3.76 per cent 
and we had a rate on 10 year government long term bonds of 6.4 
per cent.
<P>
	The government projected in its budget that for this year, 
1994, the long term rate, the rate on 10 year bonds, would fall to 
6.4 per cent which is actually what it was at on February 2 and 
that it would fall further in subsequent years to around 6.1 per 
cent.
<P>
	It projected that the short term rate, and it used as its 
benchmark the rate on 90 day commercial paper, would actually 
rise slightly this year to 5 per cent, which is indicated by the 
term structure, and would stay there for the next several years. 
Those numbers are actually identical to the projections that the 
former government used in framing its last budgetary policies.
<P>
	The rate on commercial paper continues to be below the rate 
of the government's projection, that is true, but that rate has 
been continually rising. It has not been rising as fast as the rate 
on key government securities.
<P>
	According to today's <I>Globe and Mail</I> from the period from 
February 2 until today the bank rate has gone up from 3.87 per 
cent to 4.22 per cent. That is an increase of 35 basis points. The 
rate on six month treasury bills has increased from 3.76 per cent 
to 4.58 per cent. That is a three-quarter of a full percentage point 
increase in the time period every single week, most of it is since 
the budget was tabled. On 10 year bonds there has been an 
increase from 6.4 per cent to 7.38 per cent. It has been hovering 
around 7.4 per cent for the last several days, or a full percentage 
point above what the government had projected.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	The government has not published all of its interest rate 
projections for this year, only two. The government continues to 
insist it can live with numbers like this and come in at the same 
target that was projected in the budget. I really question that.
<P>
	What the government certainly cannot have is a continued 
increase in the rates over the next several weeks. Even since the 
bank rate was set last week we have had another quarter cent 
drop in the value of the Canadian dollar.
<P>
	That is occurring. We know it and we know why. We know it 
as individual Canadians when talking to our friends and 
neighbours. We know it as public policy analysts looking at 
some of the financial newsletters in this country. People are 
taking their capital out of this country. They are taking their 
capital out of Canadian government bonds because they are 
denominated in Canadian dollars. They are putting it elsewhere 
because there is an increasing insecurity about the financial 
state of this particular institution, the Government of Canada.
<P>
	This lack of caution on interest rate projections is the most 
serious error by this government in its financial planning. We 
have a debt structure where a huge percentage of our debt is 
loaded at the front end. The average term of government debt in 
Canada is two and a half years. The average term excluding 
treasury bills is four and a half years. These are very short 
timeframes and very sensitive to unforeseen increases in 
interest rates.
<P>
	The government also provides information in the budget 
which underestimates the sensitivity of its borrowing to changes 
in interest rates. It is important to note the sensitivity analysis.
<P>
	People ask me why if all interest rates went up 1 per cent the 
government says its debt charge would only go up $1.7 billion. 
Why not $5 billion? Why not 1 per cent of the debt load?
<P>
	The reason of course is that the debt rolls over. It does not roll 
over 100 per cent in a single year, but over a very short period of 
two, three or four years most of it will roll over. The real 
underestimation in that kind of sensitivity analysis is it does not 
take into account the fact that the debt itself compounds, not just 
the interest payments. The debt itself compounds when the level 
of interest payments and the level of the deficit are 
underestimated. That is a very serious issue. It is one of the 
reasons we got ourselves into these kinds of problems.
<P>
	I remind the government of the importance of real deficit 
targets. An article in yesterday's <I>Financial Post</I> said that the 
government does in fact have figures for the third and 
subsequent years of its financial planning period and it is 
prepared to table those in August. Why in August? Why do we 
not see them now? I suspect we will get the same story in August 
as we got in the budget: The situation is much more serious than 
government thought and it needs to re-evaluate it. We have 
heard that story before.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2498"> 2498 </A></B>
<P>
	Not only do we have to have a deficit target. Any country 
in financial problems has to have a debt target. I go back to the 
fact that the Maastricht treaty does not speak simply of a 3 per 
cent deficit-GDP target. It speaks of a 60 per cent debt to GDP 
target. If it is over 60 per cent debt to GDP the only way to 
achieve that target would be to run zero deficits or even 
surpluses.
<P>
	Canada's debt to GDP ratio under this budget even under the 
government's own assumptions is estimated to rise to a level of 
75 per cent of GDP by the end of the planning period. Once again 
that is only for the federal government and is on a net basis, not 
on a gross basis which the Maastricht treaty talks about. It talks 
about gross basis and about all levels of government in the 
country. These are unsustainable levels.
<P>
	With respect to the committee and report stages, we agreed to 
bypass report stage because we are anxious to have meaningful 
debate and we did not have amendments from committee. 
Nevertheless I want to mention some things that could have been 
mentioned in a report stage debate. I did not want to hold the bill 
up for that, but it is important that we mention it.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Once again there are problems in the process and in some 
technical aspects. We agreed not to have a report stage debate. 
However we thought that before we had the third reading debate 
we would at least have the published minutes of the committee 
hearings. This is another problem. I point out once again how 
much the government views this entirely as a rubber stamp 
process.
<P>
	I do not have those in my hands and I doubt I will today. Just 
before I spoke I received a transcript of our hearings on this bill. 
However the public and we do not have published minutes of the 
committee hearings and debate on the technical aspects of this 
bill although we went through report stage and are now on third 
reading.
<P>
	That is inexcusable. We are not in so much of a rush here that 
there is not the right of Parliament and the public to have final 
published minutes and proceedings of the committee that are 
relevant to the debate we are now having in the Chamber.
<P>
	Because of that I am going to take a few minutes to outline 
some of the technical aspects of the bill. I will indicate quickly 
some of the discussion in committee and how it might be helpful 
to the government in the future.
<P>
	The budgetary deficit is projected to be $39.7 billion. Against 
that the government is borrowing through internal accounts a 
sum in the neighbourhood of $9.5 billion. That is the temporary 
surplus we have on non-budgetary accounts, mainly 
superannuation accounts.
<P>
	The government must cover exchange fund earnings of $1.1 
billion which are included in budgetary revenue but in fact are 
not available for normal budgetary purposes and a reserve of 
contingencies for $3 billion. This is one of the ways the 
government gives itself some  leeway. Although it commits to 
keep the deficit within bounds it allows for considerable reserve 
so that it can have access to more borrowing without going 
directly to Parliament in this fiscal year. That is how we reached 
the total borrowing authority of $34.3 billion, which the public 
will note is different from the budgetary deficit.
<P>
	This is not the greatest control system. The budgetary deficit 
itself includes $2.4 billion reserves for as yet unplanned 
expenditures. It is true that Parliament would have to authorize 
additional expenditures if they were of a non-statutory nature. 
However these various contingencies of $2.4 billion within the 
budgetary deficit and $3 billion within the borrowing authority 
itself provide the government with considerable flexibility to 
err not only in its interest rate projections but also in various 
other aspects of its financial planning.
<P>
	There is nothing wrong with a little bit of leeway. However I 
would think if we got into errors of that magnitude it would be 
appropriate for the government to have a system whereby it 
came back to Parliament. It would explain those errors and ask 
Parliament for the appropriate authority and discuss why it had 
erred.
<P>
	One of the problems with the present reserve and contingency 
requirements is that they are actually open to multiple 
justification for their usage. We do not have simply a margin of 
error on an interest rate or a margin of error on statutory 
spending. Most of these things can be used in one way or 
another. That is a serious deficiency of this particular process.
<P>
	There is another important issue raised in committee which 
the government should examine. That is the nature of its debt 
management.
<P>
	There were some technical questions concerning not only the 
term structure of the debt but also the tendency of the 
government to borrow almost exclusively in Canadian dollars. It 
does so at a time when the value of the Canadian dollar is 
increasingly unstable and there are risk premiums involved. 
This will increase the cost of this borrowing to the public, to the 
government and to the taxpayer.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	It also encourages the government in a somewhat less than 
responsible attitude toward borrowing. By borrowing in 
Canadian dollars there is a sense of greater flexibility should 
there be a financial crisis. With the lower yields offered on other 
currencies it should consider diversifying and of course 
reducing that borrowing.
<P>
	I will end very quickly by reminding everyone of the 
budgetary situation. The government faces a $40 billion deficit. 
It was higher than we had believed even during the election 
campaign. The government's response has been the smallest of 
expenditure cuts, even smaller tax measures and the adoption of 
various programs that are something probably less than 
effective in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2499"> 2499 </A></B>
<P>
getting economic recovery. As well it will only add needlessly to 
our burden.
<P>
	I oppose the bill. I urge the government once again to 
reconsider this borrowing and some of the expenditure plans 
which underlie the borrowing. I promise we will continue to 
fight this bill and these kinds of policies.
<P>
	I urge the government to look at its counterpart, the 
Democratic Party in the United States, which reconsidered in 
particular the strategy of adding additional spending programs 
on top of a deficit management situation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The first three speakers at 
third reading of Bill C-14 had 40 minutes without questions and 
comments. We will now go to the next stage of debate which is 
20 minutes and 10 minutes of questions and comments.
<P>
	In recognizing the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Industry would he indicate to the Chair at the beginning of his 
remarks whether he will be taking the full complement of 20 
minutes or sharing his time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am splitting my time equally with 
another member. I understand I cannot question the previous 
speaker, but I will begin my remarks by making a comment.
<P>
	I listened to the hon. member talk about all of the budget cuts 
the Reform Party would wish for and the cuts in terms of grants 
to business.
<P>
	The hon. member even went so far as to suggest that the 
Chamber of Commerce might be willing to return to the treasury 
the $400,000 it received for doing its study on what business 
recommends in terms of fiscal reform. First I want to say that I 
in no way, shape or form have anything other than respect for the 
work the chamber does, but I am not sure that it would return the 
$400,000.
<P>
	I wonder sometimes if the Reform Party realizes that the real 
challenge for fiscal reform is in the tax act. When the time 
comes to tackle that problem I wonder whether the Reform Party 
will remain steadfast to its principle of a single tax system.
<P>
	With the $40 billion or $50 billion worth of tax grants to 
business, mostly foreign and multinationals, a lot of them in the 
energy sector, I am wondering whether the Reform Party will 
remain as committed to the cuts. When I asked this question of 
the leader of the Reform Party he began to shy off on cutting 
those tax expenditures. In due course we will really test the 
Reform Party's commitment to comprehensive tax reform.
<P>
	I listened to members opposite today talk one after the other 
about gloom and doom and how there was not anything in the 
budget that would inspire some hope for Canadians. I could not 
help but think that a lot of the members had deserted their earlier 
commitment to try to be constructive in this House. We have 
only been here a couple of months and it amazes me that 
members opposite could not acknowledge anything positive in 
the budget.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	I would like to raise something I believe is most meaningful to 
the small business sector. We heard from members opposite 
today that we must support small and medium sized businesses. 
We heard members opposite agree that our greatest hope for 
putting people back to work rests with the small business 
community. We all know, because we have all knocked on the 
same doors and we have all heard from many small business 
people across the country, that the greatest problem they face 
today is access to capital.
<P>
	On pages 4 and 5 of the budget the Minister of Finance 
announced that for the first time ever we would have a 
committee of Parliament take on a study of access to capital by 
small business. This is not a study that includes only 
government members. This is a study that includes members of 
the Bloc Quebecois and members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Members opposite should have told Canadian people that the 
government should be applauded for the way in which it has 
acted so speedily in setting up this study in the industry 
committee. We have been studying the matter for four weeks. 
We have heard over a dozen intelligent business people from 
many regions of the country confirm what all of us have heard 
about the difficulties of small business. We are already 
beginning to see signs that the bankers are responding to this 
very difficult problem that exists in our country today.
<P>
	It is important that we as members of Parliament not criticize 
just for the sake of criticizing. By the way I accept constructive 
criticism. There are some areas in the budget that are tough for 
all of us. We have never had a perfect budget. It is tough. We 
have a tough fiscal situation. At the same time we have to 
acknowledge the fact that we are starting to see some movement 
in access to capital for small business. All members of 
Parliament should be delivering that message of hope to their 
constituents.
<P>
	We can be tough on the banks in the House of Commons, but at 
the same time we should acknowledge when banks and bank 
managers begin to respond. I am not saying the process is 
complete. Last week the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce 
announced the appointment of an ombudsman for its bank. 
Small and medium sized business people who are having 
difficulty at the branch level could go to the ombudsman to seek 
fairer treatment. Today the Toronto-Dominion Bank set up a 
three-person ombudsman system. It is almost like a court of 
appeal for people who are having difficulty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2500"> 2500 </A></B>
<P>
	These are only beginnings but I believe they are important 
beginnings. As members opposite have said repeatedly, small 
business represents our greatest hope. We must support small 
business. The biggest thing it has asked for is help in changing 
the attitude of banks and financial institutions and help in 
finding new sources of capital so entrepreneurial spirit can flow 
again. We have begun the process.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	I must also say that the members of the Bloc and the Reform 
parties on the committee are working hard and are working 
co-operatively. By the end of June we will be able to bring solid, 
constructive recommendations to Parliament and to the Minister 
of Finance, recommendations for amendment in terms of 
regulation and recommendations for banks to change their 
process and attitude. I believe we will be able to bring in new 
sources of capital through mutual funds, pension funds.
<P>
	Even though the process is not complete today, I believe it is 
incumbent upon all of us as members of Parliament to tell our 
constituents that it is under way, that we have only been at it for 
a month but in another two months they should see even more 
dramatic results.
<P>
	I do not believe that when we go back to our ridings we should 
only bring bad news. I listened to a Bloc member this morning 
refer to our party as a party of darkness, as if members of the 
Bloc were the only ones who feel the pain of students, fathers or 
mothers who do not have work. We feel that same pain. We are 
trying just as hard and are just as concerned as members 
opposite to get the country back to work.
<P>
	When something in the budget is constructive and 
hopeful-and I believe changing the attitudes of banks is a very 
meaningful exercise for all of us in the Chamber-we should not 
be shy in acknowledging it or in saying that in that particular 
area the government is moving forward and the government is 
on the right path.
<P>
	It is not that we are looking for an accolade. That is not the 
point. The point is that we have a responsibility in the House to 
inspire and show some hope for the 1.3 million small business 
men and women out there who are having a very difficult time 
right now.
<P>
	Other projects were announced in the budget on behalf of 
small business. The officials in all departments are interacting 
with small business in terms of the paper burden. They are all 
but locked up in a room right now trying to simplify the forms 
and consolidate the paper small business has to deal with when it 
comes to interacting with government: all the various forms in 
Revenue Canada and in Consumer and Corporate Affairs. There 
is an intense effort by officials and people from business. They 
are working together to try to reduce the paper burden. It is 
important for our constituents to know we are working 
vigorously on that. That is another result of the budget.
<P>
	I also mention the fact that the finance committee working on 
comprehensive tax reform is another hopeful signal or hopeful 
sign for small business. It is very important to challenge the path 
we are taking the country down at this moment. We accept their 
challenge on any issue.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	It is Friday afternoon. Hon. members will be going back to 
their ridings. I tell them not to be shy in telling their constituents 
about some of the good things the government is doing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always a pleasure to exchange comments with the 
parliamentary secretary, but I think I ought to tell him, with 
respect, that his speech contained two contradictions. I want to 
point out that his impassioned defence of small business has 
always been well received by my party. I know that some of my 
colleagues here today are working very hard with him in 
committee.
<P>
	He is probably aware that Montreal is the poorest city in 
Canada; the Montreal area has the largest number of poor 
families and poor people in this country. In East Montreal, we 
had a program called the PRIEM program, which was set up five 
years ago. All parties involved in this program asked the 
government to extend it. The program gave small businesses 
access to capital to update their facilities, and it created about 30 
per cent of the new jobs in East Montreal.
<P>
	If the minister and his government had been serious about 
using small business as part of their economic recovery strategy, 
it seems to me Montreal would have received a favourable 
answer to its request for an extension to this program. It did not, 
however. We and other members had a meeting with the 
Minister of Finance. We made certain representations, as did the 
community of Montreal, but unfortunately, the program will not 
be extended. That was the first contradiction I wanted to point 
out, and I would appreciate it if the minister would comment.
<P>
	I would also like to hear his comments on a second issue, the 
technology question. On several occasions the minister has said 
in the House, with considerable eloquence, that his party was 
prepared to go all the way with technology and that this was a 
major priority. Unfortunately this was not reflected in the 
budget, and the scientific community got even less than it 
expected. There is not much in the budget that would point to a 
genuine national strategy on technology.
<P>
	I wish he would offer some thoughts on the information 
highway. All parties concerned agree that if we are to have a 
national information highway some day, government funding 
will be needed. It is not true that only private capital is needed. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2501"> 2501 </A></B>
<P>
However, we can find no indication in this budget that the 
government will help implement this information highway.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I say to 
the member that I welcome his spirit in debate. I always have.
<P>
	First, I cannot speak to the specific example the member has 
given. I am not aware of it. The member can send me the details 
on it and we can study it.
<P>
	Second, I cannot make a commitment, which sounds strange 
because of our commitment and our special sensitivity to the 
city of Montreal.
<P>
	The third point concerns the information highway. Two days 
ago the Minister of Industry announced the new chairman of the 
national advisory committee on the information highway would 
be the former vice-chancellor of McGill in Montreal. The 
member should know the whole process of studying the 
information highway will be contrary to what we read in the 
newspaper. It is going to be one that is very open. We will be 
listening to experts from every region of the country. These 
meetings will be in public. Naturally when we have committees 
some of them have to be private but there will be an extensive 
consultation process and this government and our Minister of 
Industry have made the information highway a priority.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	As the Prime Minister said earlier this week in the House, our 
commitment to this sector of the economy is most important in 
terms of job creation and I think the member will see in time that 
in no way, shape or form will we feel shy or cut short our 
participation in that very important sector of the economy.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The parliamentary 
secretary had given an indication to the Chair that he was 
sharing his time.
<P>
	If not I would be in the hands of the House as to whether there 
would be unanimous consent to allow an additional five minutes 
for questions and comments to the parliamentary secretary. I 
know a good number of members have been seeking the floor. Or 
we could simply resume debate.
<P>
	If there is no one from the government side who is going to be 
sharing the time and if the House wants to consider unanimous 
consent, is there consent to an additional five minutes of 
questions and comments for the parliamentary secretary?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
every year after the happy holiday season the people of Canada 
and Quebec enter a period of fear. In fact, at this time of year, 
people fear two kinds of disasters: snow storms and the federal 
budget.
<P>
	In both instances, they are unable to forecast the extent of the 
impending disaster and they feel they have no control over what 
is going to happen. The only thing they know for certain is that 
the two events, whether of natural or ministerial origin, can be 
costly and have an impact on their quality of life.
<P>
	To a certain extent, we can protect ourselves against the 
meteorological vagaries of winter, and we can be philosophical 
about them, knowing that everything will melt away in the 
Spring anyhow. The storm raised by the federal budget is 
another story. The fiscal and budgetary whims of Canadian 
Finance Ministers are getting less and less predictable and more 
and more painful.
<P>
	This year, people were expecting a very severe winter and a 
very hard budget. In both instances it is as if the sky had fallen. 
We can get used to the snow and the cold, as we known it is going 
to end eventually, but the budget has inflicted severe injuries to 
the country's economy and the scars could be permanent.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and the government he represents 
have demonstrated a total lack of imagination and creativity. 
Once more the axe fell on the unemployed and the aged who are 
submitted to dreadful cutbacks by this budget. The reason of this 
is that the Minister of Finance did not want to tackle the real 
economic problems of the country and cut into useless spending 
by the government.
<P>
	Yet, the Minister of Finance had only two responsible things 
to do before preparing his budget. First, he should have used the 
long cold evenings of January to read the report of the Auditor 
General, and I doubt he did.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Second, he only had to listen carefully to the concrete and 
progressive proposals brought forward by the Official 
Opposition. This would have prevented him from racking his 
brain in search of a scheme that would allow him to attack once 
again the poorest people in our society.
<P>
	The Auditor General tabled his report to the House of 
Commons for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1993. All 800 
pages of it! Eight hundred pages of horrible findings on the 
appalling management of public funds in Canada. Eight hundred 
pages of concrete recommendations on ways to better manage 
the Canadian government machinery. I will say it again, I doubt 
that the Minister of Finance took the trouble to go through such a 
valuable document as the report of the Auditor General, because 
the provisions contained in the budget do not reflect in any way 
the expectations expressed in the Auditor General's annual 
report for 1993.
<P>
	The auditor managed to summarize in one sentence the 
expectations and aspirations of the Canadian people, and I think 
it is important to quote it in this House so that the government 
cannot plead ignorance when the time comes for it to find out the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2502"> 2502 </A></B>
<P>
effects of such a pitiful budget on the economy. Here then is the 
Canadian taxpayers' message that the Auditor General wanted 
to  convey to the government, and I quote: ``Today it is clearer 
than ever, to both public servants and parliamentarians, that 
Canadians expect them to demonstrate sound and prudent 
management rather than finding new ways to spend borrowed 
money''.
<P>
	I must admit the Report of the Auditor General of Canada is 
not an appealing document. I can see why the Minister of 
Finance would try to keep away from it as much as he can since 
the truths we find in there do not always make for pleasant 
reading. Journalists call them the Auditor General's horror 
stories and rightly so. Indeed, his report is full of pathetic 
examples of mismanagement and particularly unwarranted 
government expenditures which are all equally reprehensible. I 
will mention only two such stories, two unfortunate situations 
which show how careless the government can get when it comes 
to spending public funds.
<P>
	One of the great government extravagances noted by the 
Auditor General concerns the use of Challenger planes by 
ministers or other parties close to government. Flying these 
airplanes costs almost $20,000 an hour. In 1993 alone, the total 
bill for these travels came up to $54 million and the example 
given by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs in that 
respect is certainly not comforting. Just imagine. For one day in 
the United States, not six months in Japan, but one single day, 
the travelling expenses of the Minister for Intergovernmental 
Affairs were in excess of $170,000. Our ministers are travelling 
in flying palaces while the government takes away a wheel from 
the inexpensive scooters of the unemployed. Such a situation is 
totally absurd!
<P>
	Speaking of absurdities, how can they explain that the new 
President of Investment Canada has refurbished her office for a 
total of $132,000? That is the outrageous cost of the new 
bathroom and new kitchen in the office of Madam President of 
Investment Canada.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Was there no one in the government who could have put a stop 
to this foolish waste of money? While the government is busy 
installing deluxe toilets in the offices of senior officials, it is 
also literally taking the toilet paper away from senior citizens. 
Do these two groups not have the same needs, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	In all, the Auditor General identified in excess of $5 billion 
annually in overspending and shameful waste. It was really not 
necessary for the Minister of Finance to raid the pockets of 
ordinary taxpayers in order to recoup these billions of dollars. 
But, that is what he did and the people feel betrayed by this 
Liberal government which had nevertheless stated in its red 
book, and I quote: ``We want a country whose governments are 
efficient and innovative''.
<P>
	When we see the results, it is not surprising that this 
government has already lost all credibility in the eyes of the 
public. In a mere six months' time, the Liberals have managed to 
alienate Canadian and Quebec taxpayers, a feat which the 
Conservative needed many years to accomplish. That is saying 
something! Were the Liberals really expecting to maintain their 
popularity rating by leaving family trusts alone, while at the 
same time targeting the unemployed and seniors and doing 
nothing to eliminate instances of administrative overlap?
<P>
	I find it rather alarming that expressions such as ``overlapping 
jurisdictions'', ``federal interference'' and ``administrative 
duplication'' have become commonplace, even the norm in 
Canadian political jargon. We have come to trivialize these 
expressions because the federal government has, over the years, 
used its famous discretionary powers to excess to interference in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. This has been going on since 
Confederation and has slowly become the traditional way of 
conducting federal-provincial relations.
<P>
	This year's budget carries on this nice Canadian tradition. The 
Minister of Finance strove to perpetuate the federal 
government's great centralizing tendency, whereby this 
government has the power and the duty to interfere more and 
more in provincial jurisdiction or at any rate never to withdraw 
from provincial jurisdiction, all in the name of maintaining 
Canadian unity, of course.
<P>
	This façade of national unity is starting to cost us dearly. A 
study by Treasury Board in 1991 showed that 67 per cent of all 
federal programs overlap provincial programs to some extent. 
Besides the tens of billions of dollars spent unnecessarily every 
year, we have a huge bureaucratic and administrative machine 
that is so complex that these federal and provincial programs 
become redundant and inefficient when they are not simply 
incompatible.
<P>
	The Canadian bureaucracy is like a big beached whale and the 
federal government is doing nothing to save it. The most 
striking proof of this lack of federal will is still the issue of 
manpower training in Quebec. While the Conservatives at the 
end of their term recognized the need to return all powers for 
manpower training to Quebec, the Liberals have stopped the 
process under way. For the Liberals, it is unthinkable to take any 
action which would reduce the federal government's prestige, 
even if it meant saving $250 million a year. I think that the 
federal government's ego is as big and immovable as the 
beached whale mentioned earlier. We well know that even a 
dying whale is not easy to deflate.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Yet, the Bloc Quebecois had asked the government to cut the 
fat. Unfortunately, the government has once again opted for a 
miracle diet which promises results without pain. Putting our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2503"> 2503 </A></B>
<P>
financial house in order will require real austerity measures, 
accompanied by painful cuts that are inevitable if we are to 
achieve our economic aims.
<P>
	The federal government continues to get into debt, and gets 
away with it. One fourth of this debt is incurred in Quebec's 
name. But beware, Quebec will not wait for liposuction to 
become necessary before doing what it must to ensure its future 
economic development. The only way for Quebecers to get rid 
of all these horror stories is still sovereignty for Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member of the Bloc Quebecois 
on his reading the report of the Auditor General, particularly as 
regards the ministers' expenses. I sat for five years on the 
Committee of Public Accounts, and I know what he is talking 
about. But I am not sure he does. I think he forgot to mention that 
the Prime Minister and the Auditor General have undertaken a 
study on travel by ministers.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois member referred in jest to the 
Challenger. Does the hon. member know where the Challengers 
are made? Should we stop manufacturing Challengers? What 
other means of transportation should the ministers use?
<P>
	In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member quoted 
something to this effect: ``Some people-I do not know exactly 
to whom he was referring-said that the Liberal government 
betrayed them''. I found such a comment rather strange, coming 
from the Bloc Quebecois, which, as a separatist party, is a traitor 
to this country, in my opinion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I heard correctly, the 
hon. member for Carleton-Gloucester did refer specifically to 
treason, and I believe that is unparliamentary. I would ask him to 
please acknowledge the fact that the Chair has to see that our 
debates are conducted in accordance with our Standing Orders 
and that we respect the spirit not only of the Standing Orders, 
but also of the House of Commons. I would ask him to withdraw 
the expression he used. The hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, are you suggesting that the member of the Bloc 
Quebecois has the right to say that the members of the Liberal 
Party have betrayed Canadian society, but that I, on the other 
hand, do not have the right to conclude, Mr. Speaker, by saying 
that anyone who spies, for example-
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. To my knowledge 
the last member who spoke, the hon. member for the Bloc 
quebecois, did not make the remark to which the hon. member 
from Carleton-Gloucester referred. I believe the hon. member 
for Carleton-Gloucester was referring to a comment made 
earlier in this House by another member.
<P>
	Of course, I do not have before me the blues of all debates that 
took place today in the House. I would therefore ask hon. 
members to show some understanding for the problems facing 
the Chair, under the circumstances. Of course, the Chair cannot 
let members on either side call someone a traitor.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Finally, I will take time to 
review the blues and, if necessary, I will get back to the House as 
soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. This is about the term the hon. member just used, 
and it is not the first time the hon. member referred to betrayal or 
mentioned the fact that we have no democratic mandate, or have 
no right to sit in this House because we are members of the Bloc 
Quebecois. He has said this both inside and outside the House. 
The right to sit in Parliament is not a matter for debate. It is not a 
matter for political debate, either inside or outside the House. 
We are talking about the basic right of people to elect the 
representatives they want to elect.
<P>
	Voters elected certain members of Parliament, and it is not up 
to the hon. member to question our right to sit in this House, as 
he did last week or as he did today, when he used the word 
traitor.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sorry, but this is 
debate, not a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the Chair's proposal to look 
at this problem and get back to the House next week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on a point of order. I have no objection to the Chair 
postponing any further discussion on the terms used earlier in 
the day by a member of the Bloc Quebecois. We will check the 
blues.
<P>
	However, the Chair did hear what was said by the hon. 
member for Carleton-Gloucester. He used the terms traitor and 
betrayal, and the hon. member should withdraw immediately, 
because what he said was quite clear. After that, we will see if 
any members on our side used terms that were unacceptable. We 
will have to look at them in context. If I say that you betray your 
mandate, I am not saying that you are traitors to the nation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. The hon. member 
for Carleton-Gloucester.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2504"> 2504 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, could the Chair perhaps take the dictionary and read 
out the definition of betrayal, and then-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. To end this 
discussion, I promise members on both sides of the House that 
the Chair will make a full review of the blues and get back to the 
House as soon as possible.
<P>
	It being 1.55 p.m., the House will now proceed to 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's 
Order Paper.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should bring in legislation 
limiting solely to individuals the right to donate to a federal political party, and 
restricting such donations to a maximum of $5,000 a year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> On a point of order, the 
member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the member recognizes having used the terms 
traitor and betrayal. Earlier-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I want to say to the 
hon. member that I have indicated that I will review the text and 
check the words used and see if they were aimed at one member 
or the other. In other words, I want to know the full context in 
order to give this House the most accurate ruling possible under 
the circumstances.
<P>
	I would like the House to proceed now with private members' 
business. The hon. member for Richelieu has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to present this 
motion to this House and to launch the debate on the following 
motion: ``That, in the opinion of this House, the government 
should bring in legislation limiting solely to individuals the 
right to donate to a federal political party, and restricting such 
donations to a maximum of $5,000 a year''.
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member for Frontenac for 
seconding the motion, and thank also all members of the Bloc 
Quebecois who asked to be heard in this debate.
<P>
	I hope to get a favourable and co-operative hearing from the 
Reform Party, as well as the Liberal Party and independent 
members of this House, so we can move a step closer to better 
democracy by dealing with the financing of political parties.
<P>
	This motion is extremely important, because it goes to the 
roots, to the foundations of democracy. It reminds us that the 
real bosses are the voters and not the big backers.
<P>
	Over the last few years, several public financing experiments 
have been successful. The socio-political context has also 
demonstrated the need for a real reform of the financing of 
political parties. The Lortie Commission, set up by the previous 
government, was supposed to look into the matter, but it barely 
touched on the problem of financing, opting for the status quo 
rather than real reform.
<P>
	Less than 20 years ago, several political parties in Canada 
were financed only by large corporations or unions. Today, the 
share of companies in electoral financing is about half of all the 
money collected by the various parties, according to 1991-92 
data from Elections Canada.
<P>
	Although the proportion has changed, the amount provided is 
still significant and a potential source of conflict. Since the 
reform of 1974 and the ensuing evolution of fundraising, small 
contributions from private individuals account for a larger share 
of the financing of political parties. Such democratization is 
very much due to the institution of a federal tax credit on 
political contributions, which was adopted in 1974.
<P>
	Some may believe that present measures are sufficient to limit 
undue influence and that it is in no way necessary to cap 
donations. Yet, during the last ten years, charges of 
influence-peddling made against Senate and House members 
tend to prove the contrary.
<P>
	I believe that party fundraising must be reorganized on the 
basis financing by the public. Legislators and politicians can 
only benefit from such a change.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	Why am I positive about this? Because of two basic and 
fundamental principles which should influence all political 
activity: transparency and democracy. Canadians and Quebecers 
now demand absolute transparency from their elected 
representatives. Greed is certainly a very human instinct, but it 
is incompatible with the political ideal of serving the common 
good. In this context, the role of governments is to deter 
anything which could prompt someone to seek public office for 
personal interests. The fact is that all federal political parties 
felt the need to clarify their position on this issue, and made it 
one of the main themes during the last election campaign.
<P>
	Numerous examples come to mind. For instance, some 
candidates and former members lost their party's official 
support for them, and that was bitter medecine indeed. Political 
organizers were publicly criticized. Some political decisions 
were reversed, contrary to all expectations. Whether lobbying, 
patron-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2505"> 2505 </A></B>
<P>
age, or conflicts of interest were involved, we found out, mostly 
through the media, whenever people had tried to influence those 
entrusted with public funds, in order to get some  personal 
benefit for themselves or their agents. Money, of course, is 
always the great motivator.
<P>
	As long as a significant proportion of party revenues comes 
from corporate or union sources, ordinary citizens will have to 
ask themselves whose interests we are looking after. As elected 
representatives, it is our duty to do everything we can to 
improve our image. So many people have a negative opinion of 
politics, which they view as a dubious, immoral and obscure 
activity in which it is better to not get involved. Reorganization 
of party fundraising would certainly solve part of the problem. 
Such an initiative would create a new climate of transparency 
which would restore some credibility for political parties and 
politicians.
<P>
	How can a worker in my riding who barely makes $15,000 or 
$20,000 a year seriously believe that an engineering firm, a 
major bank or a contractor is prepared to give $50,000 to a 
political party without any hope of obtaining a return on that 
investment? How can that worker seriously think that his 
opinion carries as much weight as that of the engineer? To ask 
the question is to answer it. One would really have to have one's 
head buried in the sand to refuse to admit that there are interests 
involved in those public-minded donations.
<P>
	And now what about the big fundraisers? Smokes and mirrors 
is often the answer. Good connections in the business 
community lead to access to the inner sanctum, the Senate, or to 
the possibility of demanding some sort of payback.
<P>
	Restricting financing of political parties to the public would 
send a clear message of transparency and be an unequivocal sign 
that companies, unions, big fundraisers will no longer exert 
undue influence over the political decision-making process. 
Are we going to tolerate any longer the fact that Canadian 
chartered banks, which are the most important sources of capital 
for campaign funds, run political parties behind the scenes?
<P>
	Financing by the public not only sends a message of 
transparency but, if adopted, sends a message of democracy. 
Since firms, associations and unions do not vote, there is no 
reason for them to play a predominant role in our electoral and 
political system by funding more than half of the activities of 
the Canadian political parties. In fact, they have many forums 
other than the political channels in which to articulate their 
views and their needs.
<P>
	Canadian citizens are the ones who must control our electoral 
system. They constitute the foundation of our democracy. 
However, democracy is more than the right to a free vote and a 
secret ballot, it is more than holding elections every four or five 
years.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	Democracy is many things and the financing of political 
parties is an important part of the democratic process, as 
important as the redrawing of electoral boundaries several years 
ago to ensure a better distribution of seats according to popular 
vote.
<P>
	Obviously, it is easier for political party fund raisers to collect 
a $5,000 contribution than 100 contributions of $50. However, 
this fact, which could be indicative of some laziness on the part 
of fund raisers, results in parties which are highly centralized 
and where ordinary members have no place.
<P>
	By giving in to this lazy attitude, political parties are agreeing 
to make themselves available to corporate contributors, turning 
their backs in the process on thousands upon thousands of 
Canadians. It may be an easier way to raise money, but it is 
surely less democratic.
<P>
	Contrary to what some people claim, we are not breaking new 
ground in Canada as far as regulating the financing of political 
parties goes. At least seven provinces, in addition to the federal 
government, have laws governing contributions to political 
parties.
<P>
	Four provinces, namely Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick and 
Alberta, already limit the size of contributions that can be made 
to political parties and to candidates. Three other provinces, 
namely Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, as well 
as the federal government only require parties to disclose the 
source and size of contributions made. Moreover, seven of these 
eight jurisdictions allocate public funds to political parties that 
meet specific criteria.
<P>
	It is obvious, however, that Quebec's legislation is the most 
progressive of all, not only with regard to political party 
financing but also all aspects of the electoral system, including 
provisions relating to political parties.
<P>
	Quebec passed the Act to govern the financing of political 
parties in 1977, but the first reforms date back to 1964, under 
Jean Lesage.
<P>
	Quebec completely redesigned voting rules, decriminalizing 
the whole process and placing electoral activities under the 
strict control of the chief electoral officer, whom they call 
director general of elections.
<P>
	It is particularly interesting to note that the Quebec Liberal 
Party, which had relied heavily on corporate sponsors up until 
then, adjusted very well and very smoothly to the new rules. Its 
annual revenue in Quebec is in excess of $7 million. That is two 
and a half times more than the Liberal Party in office in Ottawa.
<P>
	Statutory requirements regarding the source and amount of 
contributions have now become a standard of life in Quebec. 
This experiment has demonstrated beyond any doubt that 
financing by the people is feasible.
<P>
	At the federal level, the Bloc Quebecois also proved 
conclusively that it could be done. Since its inception, the Bloc 
has never been funded by anybody other than the voters. No 
dona-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2506"> 2506 </A></B>
<P>
tions can be accepted from any  corporation, union or 
organization. Yet, we won 75 per cent of the seats in Quebec.
<P>
	Ottawa already has a piece of legislation providing for the 
disclosure of sources and amounts of donations received by 
political parties. The same legislation also governs party 
expenses. The purpose of this motion is to limit solely to voters 
the right to donate to a party and to restrict such donations to a 
maximum of $5,000 a year. This may be a difficult choice, but it 
is necessary.
<P>
	The foundation of a political party is its membership. It is on 
this basis that parties succeed or fail.
<P>
	A revamping of the financing process will put new life into 
the parties. It will replace establishment-controlled parties with 
truly popular, truly democratic parties.
<P>
	I remind you in closing that the Quebec legislature 
unanimously endorsed such a bill when it had to make a decision 
on the funding of political parties by the people. It unanimously 
embraced the basic goal of democratizing political institutions. 
To take the same position here in this House would be a nice 
gesture for unity, a clear message that would be very well 
received by all citizens.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to pay tribute to a member who spoke 
up and fought a long battle on this issue, namely François Gérin, 
the former member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead who, 
within the Conservative Party, fought a six-year battle for the 
funding of political parties by the people. He pursued his 
campaign with the Bloc Quebecois as he was the one who 
proposed, when the Bloc was founded, that political parties be 
financed only by individuals with the right to vote.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	So this former member who sat for nine years in this House, 
François Gérin, was a pioneer on this issue-the funding of 
political parties by the people-in Canada. I am happy to thank 
him for this and to carry on his fight by taking this issue not to 
the parties themselves but directly to the House. I hope that the 
Liberal and the Reform parties as well as the independent 
members will give their unanimous support so that we can take 
another step toward democracy.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on a point of order. I can see that some of my 
colleagues believe that my words were unacceptable and, after 
due consideration, I think that some hon. members may have 
found what I said to be insulting. Therefore, I want to withdraw 
the words ``traitor'', ``treason'' and ``betrayal'', and I do so 
unequivocally.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to thank the hon. 
member for his decision, which I respect. I know that, from time 
to time, our debates can be very intense and will continue to be 
so, but I hope that the people in the Chair will be able, with the 
co-operation of all members, to keep our discussions at a 
respectful level,  because we have all been elected here to serve 
Canadians in this 35th Parliament.
<P>
	We will now revert to private members' business. The 
parliamentary secretary of the Leader of the Government in the 
House has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the hon. member for Richelieu and I am 
pleased that he put this motion before the House, because it is 
very important. I know that there are several such private 
members' motions before the House, and I hope that we will be 
able to hold many debates on these issues in the coming weeks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to mention the hon. member's very careful review of 
the situation in respect of election contributions that has 
maintained itself in the province of Quebec now for some time. 
While I recognize the validity of some of the arguments he has 
put forward, there are more compelling arguments for perhaps 
considering that while the situation may be a fair or reasonable 
approach there are other fair and reasonable approaches. The 
Canada Elections Act has taken that approach. Obviously it is 
different from what the hon. member has proposed. That is why 
he made the proposal he put before the House.
<P>
	I note other people than myself have expressed views on this 
question. It is important for the hon. member to recognize that 
those views have been put forward by people who are fairly 
experienced and competent in the field.
<P>
	The Canada Elections Act, as the hon. member stated, does 
not currently have a limit on the size of contributions. Nor does 
it limit who may make those contributions aside from 
non-Canadians. The language of the act in my view is a little 
loose on that point.
<P>
	The hon. member is aware that during the last Parliament the 
special committee on electoral reform was struck to review the 
recommendations of the Royal Commission on Electoral 
Reform and Party Financing. I had the honour to be a member of 
that committee. I know we spent a considerable amount of time 
discussing the question of contributions to political parties. I 
believe a report to the House on the subject was made by that 
committee, which report was not acted upon by the previous 
government.
<P>
	I am optimistic that during this Parliament we will have an 
opportunity to look over the provisions of the act once again and 
possibly come up with some recommendations to change the 
existing law. I have no doubt we will be looking at the proposal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2507"> 2507 </A></B>
<P>
the hon. member has put forward. However looking at it and 
accepting it are two different things.
<P>
	In its deliberations the committee considered a limit because 
some members of the committee were enthusiastic about the 
prospect of a limit such as is suggested by the hon. member in 
his motion. However, it was not one that found favour with the 
majority of the members and accordingly was not in the report.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	Why was it not there? The place to look is the report of the 
royal commission itself. The royal commission did an extensive 
review of political donations in Canada. It went over not only 
the volume, that is the total number and the number of people 
who contributed, but it also looked at their source.
<P>
	I would like to read a brief passage from volume I of the royal 
commission report. The page number does not appear on my 
photocopy, but it follows table 7.1. The report reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Large contributions from individuals are even less important as a share of total 
party revenue. In 1988, contributions of $2,000 or more from individuals 
accounted for 11.3 per cent of the total value of contributions to the Progressive 
Conservative Party and 7.9 per cent of contributions to the Liberal Party; only 14 
individuals contributed more than $10,000 to the three largest national parties 
that year. The largest contribution from an individual-$103,000-was made to 
the New Democratic Party by Irene Dyck, and the largest donations to the 
Progressive Conservative and Liberal parties from individuals were $40,000 
each.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The largest single contribution in 1988 was just over $1 million; it was made 
to the New Democratic Party by the Canadian Labour Congress.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	One suspects perhaps that they are not going to be so generous 
in the future.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Contributions exceeding $10,000 from trade unions accounted for 11 per 
cent of total contributions to the New Democratic Party in 1988.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In reviewing the situation, the commission recognized that 
limiting contributions to individuals to $5,000 would have been 
very damaging to what was then one of Canada's three larger 
political parties. I would not call it one of the major parties, but 
it was one of the larger ones. To change the law, to restrict it in 
this way, would have serious repercussions.
<P>
	I should note for the record what the recommendation of the 
royal commission was. I will quote recommendation 1.7.10:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recommend that the Canada Elections Act not impose limits on the size of 
contributions to registered political parties, registered constituency 
associations, candidates, nomination contestants and leadership contestants.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think it is very fair to point this out. The vital thing about this 
part of the commission's report is that they did say, and I will 
quote from the page a little higher up:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recommend that disclosure requirements be broadened to cover registered 
constituency associations, as well as nomination and leadership campaigns. We 
also propose that twice a year, registered parties and constituency associations 
report on contributions, including the date each was received, and that their 
reports be filed within three months of the end of the reporting period.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The commission was recommending far greater reporting as 
an obligation on parties and constituency associations so that 
the members of the public could see who was making 
contributions to these organizations. The commission took the 
view-and I submit it was a correct and good view-that 
transparency in the process would make up for the lack of a limit 
because the limits can be got around altogether too easily.
<P>
	The hon. member for Richelieu was a member of the 
Progressive Conservative Party before he fell by the wayside. 
He knows very well that the members of his party on the election 
reform committee, of which I had the honour to be a member, 
reviewed the situation of the Quebec law and discussed it fully 
in the committee. They were of the view that the $5,000 limit 
was one that was easily avoided by either corporations or trade 
unions, by those organizations making gifts of money to 
members who could then pass the money along as political 
donations to political parties.
<P>
	In other words, a corporation that had $50,000 or $100,000 it 
wanted to give to a party could do it either by giving it to 20 
different constituency associations in lumps of $5,000 or-the 
hon. member laughs. I regard that as a bit of coach and horses. 
Through the intent of his motion he may think it is legitimate, I 
am not so sure.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	The other possibility is to hand the money out to directors or 
officers or members of the corporation and have them make the 
donations to the political parties involved. The money can be got 
there if a labour union or a corporation is intent on doing it.
<P>
	It is quite unreasonable to put this restriction on these bodies 
so long as they have to disclose the amount of their contributions 
and that is exactly what the royal commission proposed.
<P>
	It is exactly what our party proposed in the discussions in the 
committee. It is what we would have preferred to have and had 
we not run into so much obstruction from the now-gone Tories 
we would have achieved a law that would have done exactly that 
and brought about the disclosure.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member will accept these comments in the 
spirit they are intended, will look at his motion in a new light 
and maybe withdraw it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments the hon. member just made. It 
indicates a debate and perhaps a bit of a difference of opinion on 
this matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2508"> 2508 </A></B>
<P>
	I am pleased to add my comments to the debate. It represents 
an opportunity for the government to begin to help restore the 
faith of Canadians in the electoral process.
<P>
	In the past we have seen Parliament held hostage to a variety 
of special interest groups by their contributions. They have 
found support in some or all of the recognized political parties 
of the past. My comments are really intended on a non-partisan 
basis.
<P>
	Special interest groups have found support in some or all of 
the recognized political parties. The interests of Canadians have 
been neglected by politicians appeasing the demands of large 
financial contributors. A wide spectrum of demands from 
business, unions and even federally funded special interest 
groups are regularly brought to members and to the government 
itself.
<P>
	In politics one soon learns that nothing is free. Whatever is 
accepted will have an invoice following along sooner or later. 
The larger the gift the larger the price tag on it.
<P>
	The premise of this motion is not new. As the hon. member for 
Richelieu has already pointed out, the province of Quebec has 
had similar legislation in place for over 15 years. There is a 
difference. Quebec's contribution limit is $3,000. Even with this 
$3,000 limit Quebec's provincial Liberal Party was able to raise 
$6.5 million during the 1986-87 campaign.
<P>
	Shortage of campaign funds has not been a problem. Instead 
Quebec has been able to add real credibility to its legislature in 
these reforms.
<P>
	John Parisella, director general of the Quebec Liberal Party at 
the time supported this contribution limit by claiming: ``There 
is no way a government is going to sell its soul for $3,000. No 
individual company has a hold on us. Nobody owns this 
government''.
<P>
	One has to look no further than the current New Democratic 
Party government in British Columbia to understand the danger 
of political manipulation. Unions have been major supporters of 
NDP campaigns. Since the last provincial election the unions 
have really hit pay dirt. Only unionized companies are permitted 
to bid for most government contracts. Also businesses that have 
solid records of treating their employees fairly are now being 
forced to accept union intervention without their employees 
even having a vote. We cannot permit special interests to 
dominate the political agenda simply because they give money 
to a political party.
<P>
	François Gérin, who the member has already mentioned, a 
Quebec Conservative during the last two terms of government 
was the main advocate for federal reform of political 
contributions. He argued that a party's acceptance of large 
contributions was a conflict of interest that brought the whole 
political process into question. He understood the perception of 
his constituents as he said: ``Someone who works all year to earn 
$15,000 and has a family of three cannot understand that 
somebody will give $25,000 and ask  nothing for it''. The 
average family income in his riding at that time was only 
$15,000.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	François Gérin demonstrated in his own riding the capability 
to run a campaign without huge contributions during a 
non-election period. With only 23 per cent party support on the 
national opinion polls, his constituency association was able to 
raise three times as much money as he needed to fund an 
election. In his case he used a strict limit of $1,000 maximum 
contribution.
<P>
	Despite his many attempts, Mr. Gérin was never able to 
convince the Conservative government to change the Canada 
Elections Act. He did convince the Quebec caucus of the 
Conservative Party to adopt this policy. In the 1988 general 
election every member of the Quebec caucus took a vow to 
accept only personal contributions.
<P>
	The results were quite surprising: Conservative candidates 
won 62 of the 75 seats, a greater success than even the Bloc 
Quebecois received in the last federal election. While the 
Conservatives received only 43 per cent of the popular support 
in 1988 across Canada, in Quebec that percentage was 51 per 
cent. In his own riding Gérin received a decisive 60 per cent of 
voter support. A significant amount of this additional voter 
support resulted from the increased interaction he had with his 
constituents.
<P>
	Limiting the size of contributions means depending on 
broader support; depending on a broader support base requires 
more interaction with the voters. With that, financial support 
becomes a more significant demonstration of an electoral 
mandate.
<P>
	As matters now stand, voting at the polls can often be a last 
minute decision resulting in a luck of the draw election win. In 
such instances those voting may give little real consideration to 
the value of their vote.
<P>
	The opposite can be true by candidates and their parties 
reaching out to include even those who can make only the 
smallest contributions. Those considering supporting a 
campaign with their money will take the time to develop an 
understanding of the issues, the local candidates and the 
political parties they represent.
<P>
	Corporate and personal tax considerations may vary greatly. 
Regardless of who makes the contribution, the same tax credit is 
realized. But this tax credit is of limited value to an individual, 
whereas after claiming a tax credit a corporation can, and 
corporations have, written off larger amounts as advertising or 
promotion expenses.
<P>
	This has resulted in leaders of business, unions, special 
interest groups and lobbyists using their influence and other 
people's money to contribute to political campaigns instead of 
using their own personal money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2509"> 2509 </A></B>
<P>
	The intention of this motion is to prevent this abuse. A few 
powerful individuals are often in positions to make decisions 
that are paid for by using other people's money without their 
consent.
<P>
	Trade unions have freely spent money raised through 
membership dues to support particular parties. In the case of 
publicly held corporations, what could have been shareholders' 
profits have been used to support a particular political party. 
Money donated to special interest groups for special purposes is 
sometimes re-routed to fund political campaigns.
<P>
	This motion would allow only individual constituents the 
opportunity to make a political contribution to any legitimate 
party or nominated candidate to a limit of $5,000.
<P>
	Elections are intended to democratically elect governments 
that best represent the desires of the people. We must not permit 
powerful individuals using other people's money to dominate 
the political agenda or the democratic process.
<P>
	Limiting the amount any individual can contribute will give a 
truer representation of a political party's popular support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am having a hard time believing what I just heard 
from the hon. member from the Reform Party.
<P>
	The hon. member tells us that political party candidates 
should be restricted in the amounts they receive. However only 
days ago his leader advocated that non-political parties should 
have the right to campaign, to contest and to challenge MPs and 
others with no restrictions at all.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	There is something wrong when that kind of mindset sets in. 
There are rules for MPs and there is no rule for the National 
Citizens Coalition to campaign against him and yet he has to be 
subject to rules far more strict than the ones we have already.
<P>
	I have another difficulty with the propositions advanced by 
the member. He said in his opening remarks the larger the gift, 
the larger the price tag. That is an insult to every Canadian who 
contributes to the electoral process. No one is going to tell me 
that my constituents who are making $20,000 or $25,000 a year, 
who come to my annual fund raiser and give me $100 are doing it 
to get something in return. I do not think my constituents 
deserve to be insulted by the likes of that. Neither do the 
member's.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Nobody said that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I was quoting the original remarks of the 
member from the Reform Party who just spoke-the larger the 
gift, the larger the price tag-referring to Canadians who gave 
their hard earned money to make sure that they have quality 
Canadians running for public office. No Canadians need to be 
insulted that way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Qui te paie pour parler comme ça?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to spend a couple of 
minutes to tell this House how I raised money during my 
election campaign or otherwise. There is an annual fund raiser in 
my constituency at which people contribute $100. Last year 400 
people attended the event. Granted, it was an election year. 
Normally approximately 300 or 325 people show up for this 
event. Many Liberal MPs attend the function in question as well. 
I know people who have attended the event who make $15,000 a 
year. I also have three other events a year to which people come 
and pay $5 for a spaghetti dinner.
<P>
	Then I hear the member from the Reform Party who just spoke 
making these kinds of broad accusations that everyone who 
contributed toward the political process is some sort of a 
sleazebag.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Those comments on the part of the member 
should be withdrawn. People contribute toward the process 
because they want good government. People who contributed to 
the member's campaign felt that he would do a good job and I do 
not believe that his constituents had a self-interest in 
contributing or helping him to get elected. They wanted good 
government just like the people who contributed to getting me or 
you elected, Mr. Speaker. The same thing applies. They do not 
deserve to be insulted because they took their holidays to work 
on an election campaign or took a couple of days from their pay 
cheques to contribute or because they took 15 minutes of what 
they would have spent on their coffee breaks to contribute.
<P>
	I go back to the rest of the issue at hand, the motion by the 
member for Richelieu.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member knows that the Lortie commission did in 
fact recommend that no restriction be put on contributions. Of 
course, there should always be restrictions on contributions 
from foreign sources, to ensure that the Canadian system 
remains accountable to Canadians. I agree with that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The Conservatives did not agree with the 
proposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> We know that others did not agree with the 
proposition, as the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
just mentioned so appropriately and eloquently.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is also the whole issue of the application of the charter 
to this kind of limitation.
<P>
	Finally, I want to draw to the attention of this House how the 
application of such a rule as the member for Richelieu is 
advocating would be implemented.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2510"> 2510 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are aware that similar rules exist in some jurisdictions, for 
example at the provincial level in Ontario, where I used to be an 
MPP, as most of you know. That legislature puts a cap on 
contributions. However, if an individual wants to give more than 
the limit which, I believe, is set at $1,150 per year in Ontario, 
that person simply gives the extra money to his or her spouse or 
son, so as to circumvent the rule-
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Point of order, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Richelieu on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has just 
suggested that people from Ontario are dishonest. People from 
Ontario are not dishonest. They are not cheats.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> This is not a point of 
order, but this is leading to debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, as you have said it yourself, this is 
not a point of order. This is not even a good point, as the hon. 
member should know.
<P>
	The point I want to make is that rules like this one, which can 
be so easily violated that it becomes absurd in a way, should 
never come into force.
<P>
	I believe that it is more up to members of this House to stop 
saying that all those who contribute to a political system expect 
something in return, as was pointed out by the member from the 
Reform Party. However, I commend the member for Richelieu 
for putting the issue to the House. I know his intentions are 
honourable. He moved this motion because he too wants public 
standards of behaviour to be high.
<P>
	Our party and our government made a commitment in this 
regard and, in the last few months, we noticed that Canadians 
realize that the government is there to serve them and not to 
serve its own interests.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken: </B>True.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>I would say the same about my colleagues 
opposite and I will say that the old ways of doing things are 
gone. Canadians got rid of all but two of those responsible for 
the situation we were in.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by saying that I do not intend to 
support this motion. However, I congratulate the hon. member 
for Richelieu because I know that he meant well. But I want to 
warn all members of the House against making absurd 
accusations against people who want to contribute to the 
democratic process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I support wholeheartedly this motion 
regarding the funding of political parties through individual 
contributions brought in this afternoon by my friend and 
colleague, the hon. member for Richelieu.
<P>
	I want to point out to the House that this is an historic moment 
since it is the first time that such a motion calling for federal 
political parties in Canada to be funded only through individual 
contributions is introduced in the House of Commons.
<P>
	The concern of my colleague, the hon. member for Richelieu, 
for this issue is nothing new. He has been working on this 
initiative since 1988 and it is very important to him since 1988. 
He is convinced that attitudes have evolved and that Canadians 
are ready for a major change in the area of political party 
financing.
<P>
	Canada, like other modern countries, must keep up with the 
times. It must follow the example set by the province of Quebec, 
which was not afraid to do away with questionable and 
anti-democratic electoral practices. It is obvious that the 
Constitutional Act, 1791, gave us not only a parliamentary 
system of government, but certain electoral practices as well.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	History shows that individuals and organizations have always 
made self-serving contributions, giving a lot to control a lot. 
Even in its early days at the end of the 18th century 
parliamentarism had its champions of influence-peddling. 
Political parties and their sponsors would often offer an election 
favour to a hoodlum in exchange for beating up a stubborn voter.
<P>
	There are numerous examples of notables who were in 
constant conflict of interest with political parties. A serious 
analysis will show that the the government's decisions were 
undoubtedly favourable to those who controlled the ruling party, 
who controlled democracy as the member for Richelieu said so 
well.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it has to be recognized, and the House will agree, 
that election mores and practices have changed in Canada.
<P>
	Indeed some practices have disappeared while others remain. 
Some new practices meet obstacles, namely the financing of 
political parties by voters only. This would concern the whole 
electoral system.
<P>
	Not so long ago I was a young man living a quiet life in the 
small town of Coleraine located in the beautiful riding of 
Frontenac. My father, a well-known businessman and 
experienced merchant was a Liberal Party member and 
organizer. Of course, that was back in the 1940s and 1950s and at 
that time, the Bloc Quebecois did not exist as a political party in 
Quebec. My father had a decisive influence on me and I 
inherited from him my interest in politics. The only thing I could 
have faulted him 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2511"> 2511 </A></B>
<P>
for at the time, given the political experience I now have, would 
of course be that he was a Liberal.
<P>
	At the time, I had been amazed by some electineering tactics 
that Liberal organizers were practising in the riding of 
Megantic, Quebec. It took me some time to understand the 
connection between a refrigerator or a Bélanger electrical stove 
and a constituent. Later on I understood the meaning of the 
slogan: ``Give the party a buck and you will get it back with a 
1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000 per cent interest''.
<P>
	I have seen this with my own eyes, Mr. Speaker. I know what I 
am talking about. However, in 1994, these days are gone. This 
should not exist any more, and my colleague, the hon. member 
for Richelieu, expressed it very well when he proposed in his 
motion a principle that should allow constituents to control our 
electoral system and thus respect democracy and become the 
true possessors of that democracy.
<P>
	The urgency of reform is recognized by every party. The 
previous speaker on the government side did say that his party 
was considering a reform of funding for political parties, but we 
will see how much courage they show and, especially, how fast 
they act. Will we have a committee or a sub-committee? I am 
anxious to see.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	In November 1988, the leader of the Conservative Party, 
Brian Mulroney, promised to bring in public financing of 
political parties. Recognizing the effectiveness of Quebec's 
legislation on this subject, Mr. Mulroney thought it necessary to 
end financial contributions from corporations and unions.
<P>
	For some time, people have been talking about credibility and 
trust and the government and the governing party are talking 
more and more about openness. We will see. Now is the time to 
prove this openness. They remember the sorry errors committed 
by members of the former government. They remember the 
conflicts of interest, the resignations, the dismissals and so on.
<P>
	There must be no hesitation when the integrity of the 
government is at stake and especially when the integrity of 
Parliament is at stake. This House must show exemplary 
honesty. Those who have been elected to lead the nation must 
show the way. Very early in his first mandate, René Lévesque 
understood the need to clean up election practices by forbidding 
any corporation to contribute to the election fund of political 
parties. The 1977 Quebec Bill, to which several of my 
colleagues have referred, remains a model of financing by the 
people and of how to clean up the electoral system itself.
<P>
	Those who doubt that it can work need only come to Quebec to 
see how it works. As was just said, the Quebec Liberal Party has 
collected much more just from the voters in Quebec than the 
Liberal Party of Canada has collected in that province from big 
companies, banks, etc.
<P>
	In 1977, the press at the time was categorical and here I quote 
from <I>La Presse</I>: ``Although the Parti Quebecois has rushed the 
process, this legislation is absolutely necessary; it is shaking up 
fund-raisers, upsetting many vested interests and destroying 
hidden influences that are unhealthy for the proper functioning 
of democracy''. What was true in Quebec in 1977 is even more 
so in Canada in 1994. This motion means the end of slush funds 
and of influence peddling and the beginning of healthy 
democracy.
<P>
	I close on this point: public financing remains the way of the 
future for our political parties. The present government must be 
concerned about it and accept the motion of the member for 
Richelieu. Canadian democracy-I repeat-Canadian 
democracy will be much better for it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened with great intensity to the debate, both 
in the lobby when I had some phone business to do and in the 
House as much as I could.
<P>
	I am here today because I am very interested in the motion of 
the hon. member for Richelieu. It affects all of us in the House. 
There is not a member sitting here who is not affected by the 
issue. If there is any issue that affects us all, it is this one.
<P>
	I come here with an open mind. I have listened attentively and 
objectively to the arguments that have been put forth on both 
sides of the House. Quite frankly I take a certain comfort in my 
view of democracy. We have already studied the issue. We have 
looked at the issue. We have looked at other alternatives. To 
analyse it properly, as I understand the motion of the hon. 
member for Richelieu there are two aspects to it. One is that the 
donation should be made by an individual. The second is that the 
donation should be not more than $5,000.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	The Lortie commission looked at the whole business of 
contribution to parties. In the last Parliament it was studied with 
great seriousness and was the focus of an awful lot of discussion 
both in committee and in the House.
<P>
	In the hon. member's opinion his view of the world and 
democracy would improve the situation. The only reason for 
putting forward his private member's bill is to provide another 
form of control of the business of electioneering in Canada. As I 
say, we have already looked at this item and it has been studied.
<P>
	There are existing controls on contributions and spending 
with respect to federal elections. Probably the greatest one is the 
very clear and explicit directions to members of Parliament and 
candidates on (a) how much they can spend, (b) how they can 
spend it, (c) the maximum limit that they can use to the cent and 
(d) how that has to be accounted for. If we are looking for  
<P>

<B><A NAME="2512"> 2512 </A></B>
<P>
control, how money is spent in an election is very clearly 
defined.
<P>
	There is another aspect which does not necessarily pertain 
only to the responsibility of the candidate, that is that a donation 
has to be reported. Any donation over $100 to a federal political 
organization has to be reported publicly. I feel fairly confident 
that with those two measures in place, if the hon. member's 
intent was to be concerned about control, there is excellent 
control. I do not think we need any more control. I have already 
raised the point that this has been studied democratically, 
debated democratically and decided on democratically.
<P>
	There are other aspects as well. If we are to agree with and to 
approve what the hon. member is suggesting, there are other 
aspects we must look at. We cannot take the bill in its singularity 
and in isolation of other aspects.
<P>
	The following aspects have been looked at. I am referring now 
to the source of donations, the amount of donations and other 
contributions to parties and their candidates, the definition of 
election expenses, limits on third party expenditures and tax 
deductions. If we open the door again we have to open it fully.
<P>
	The underlying current I have heard alluded to a couple of 
times is very disturbing. The concern, somewhat obliquely 
stressed, is that there is a return other than the participation in 
democracy. I find that quite antagonizing. I find it disruptive. I 
do not find it democratic. I have not seen in my time in politics a 
return in any form other than the election of a member to 
represent people.
<P>
	As one of the 295 members of the House I find it quite 
offensive for one of my hon. colleagues to suggest that those 
people who give freely of their time, their money and their 
resources do so for any other reason than to contribute to the 
democracy of this great country.
<P>
	To summarize, I have taken into consideration the points 
made by the other side of the House, some of which are good 
points. However I come down on the side of saying that I do not 
see any compelling argument for me to support the bill as it 
stands or if it were considered in the larger context.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 98(1) the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence.
<P>
	Before closing the day, I know the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam is seeking the floor. A few weeks ago, if I 
recall correctly, she shared with us the good news that she was 
expecting to be a grandmother. I wonder if she could bring us up 
to date on that matter before we adjourn for the rest of the week.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Speaker. I 
have a seventh grandchild. He is a boy. His name is David 
Michael Jennings. He weighed in at 9 pounds, 5 ounces.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 2.55 p.m., the 
House stands adjourned until Monday next at 11 a.m., pursuant 
to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.55 p.m.)
