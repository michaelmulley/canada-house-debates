RULING</A></H4>
<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I am now prepared to rule 
on the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley on Friday, March 21, 
concerning the actions allegedly taken by officials of the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	I would like to thank the Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, as well as the hon. 
member for St. Albert for their comments in this matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley 
claimed that on the morning of March 21 officials of the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration refused to allow her to 
attend a briefing on changes to the immigration investor program. 
The hon. member argued that, by making this information available 
to the media before members of Parliament, the department acted 
in a way which constituted a contempt of Parliament as well as a 
breach of her parliamentary privileges.
<P>
	I have reviewed the facts surrounding the incident, and after 
further consultations, my understanding of the matter is as follows: 
a notice was issued to the media by the office of the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration announcing that the minister would 
be holding a press conference regarding the immigrant investor 
program in the National Press Gallery theatre at 10.15 a.m. on 
Friday, March 21. The notice further specified that the press 
conference would be preceded by a technical briefing by 
departmental officials at 9 a.m.
<P>
	It was also confirmed to me that the National Press Gallery 
applies certain restrictions on the number of people permitted to 
attend a press conference in the theatre. Yet no such restrictions 
exist for briefings which,  I am told, are frequently held in the 
theatre by government departments. Finally, the Chair was 
informed that the briefing in question was ``off the record,'' which 
meant that it would not be televised in the closed circuit system of 
the House of Commons and, consequently, could not be viewed by 
members of Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the case which is presently before us, the Chair must address 
two issues. I will first deal with the issue of whether or not there 
has been a breach of privilege insofar as the member was denied 
access to information by departmental officials. I will then 
examine the claim that the actions of the department constituted a 
contempt of Parliament.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On December 1, 1992 when a member complained that the 
media had been given information by the government concerning 
financial assistance to Canadian Airlines when the same 
information was denied to members of Parliament, Speaker Fraser 
ruled page 14360 of the <I>Debates</I> there was no question of privilege. 
He also reminded the House that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Privilege is properly raised only when something has happened that makes it 
impossible or nearly impossible to carry out the obligations that a member has as a 
member of this House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On December 15, 1987, a member objected to the fact that the 
government had established a press lock-up and briefing regarding 
a proposed agricultural program and that members were denied 
access to the information. Speaker Fraser's ruling which can be 
found at page 11788 of the <I>Debates</I>, stated that this was not a prima 
facie question of privilege because it did not impinge on the 
member's ability to carry on his duties as a member of Parliament.
<P>
	In the matter submitted by the member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley, the Chair cannot find that she has been 
obstructed in the performance of her parliamentary duties. The 
question raised did not involve access to parliamentary 
proceedings, either in the Chamber or in a committee meeting 
room. Ultimately, as the hon. member pointed out in her 
presentation, the officials offered to give her the same briefing after 
question period.
<P>
	On the issue of contempt, I would refer again to Speaker Fraser. 
In a ruling given on October 10, 1989,  Speaker Fraser said: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9590"> 9590 </A></B>
<P>
``Broadly speaking, contempts are offences against the authority or 
the dignity of the House of Commons''.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	Does the fact that the media was given information before it was 
going to be made available to the member constitute a contempt of 
the House of Commons? At page 125 of the 21st edition of Erskine 
May, in chapter 9 dealing with contempts, it is stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The House will proceed against those who obstruct members in the discharge of 
their responsibilities to the House or in their participation in its proceedings.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It seems to me that members of Parliament were not denied 
information or obstructed in their duties in the House. There was, 
after all, a press conference scheduled for that same morning and it 
was broadcast on the closed circuit television system of the House, 
making it accessible to all members. The Chair finds it difficult to 
conclude that the actions in question were an affront to the 
authority and dignity of the House.
<P>
	For the reasons previously stated and in light of the precedents 
dealing with similar matters, I do not consider that this is a prima 
facie case of privilege.
<P>
	The Speaker has no control and should have no control over such 
events, whether it be the manner in which they are organized or 
how access to them is managed.
<P>
	The hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley may 
have a valid grievance which she may wish to pursue elsewhere; 
however, procedurally the matter has been settled in that it does not 
amount to a breach of parliamentary privilege, nor does it 
constitute a contempt of Parliament.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for having brought this matter to the 
attention of the Chair.

	The House resumed from April 8 consideration of Bill C-17, an 
act to amend the Criminal Code and certain other acts, as reported 
(without amendment) from the committee; and of Motion No. 2.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to a justice bill. It is nice to see a plethora of 
justice bills coming in here at the last minute because of the 
cacophony of noise that has been raised out in the field. That is for 
the benefit of the minister who, I am sure, is attempting now to fix 
some of the things that somehow slipped through in his department 
with loopholes that have had some very negative results.
<P>
	I think the minister knows about those and is aware that there has 
been a botch-up in the drafting. We brought in a couple of 
amendments to try to fix some bills last week after we were well 
into the process. Somebody in the department was not doing the 
work and we have been trying to fix things up.
<P>
	We are, as we get closer to the election, trying to deal with issues 
such as victims rights. That has suddenly become a priority item. 
We are trying to deal with fixing the conditional sentencing 
provisions of some bills now. We have always realized that 
conditional sentencing should not be an option for a judge who is 
considering a serious violent offence. It is still an option, which is 
unfortunate.
<P>
	However, the minister is bringing in all these bills: C-17 now, 
C-27 likely on Monday, debating the victims bill of rights in 
committee this week, and dealing with all the issues that have been 
on the table for two or three years. Finally, on the cusp of the 
election, the epiphany has struck. The conversion is a bit on the 
road, not of Damascus, but perhaps to the next election. I think we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9591"> 9591 </A></B>
<P>
are going to see quite a bit of this discussion about the  justice 
system, how to fix it, what should it entail and so on.
<P>
	We have been trying to emphasize in these debates on the justice 
system the need for some guiding principles. Whether it is called 
the charter of rights for victims, it should be a guiding set of 
principles that would direct judges, parole boards, people drafting 
legislation, on what should be considered as they draft legislation 
or directives for their employees. The justice system should make 
sure that victims have the standing they require and make sure they 
do not fall through the cracks.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	In my riding a lady beaten unconsciousness and her body was 
further beaten for a couple of hours. It was actually the noise of the 
beating that got the police involved. Thankfully the woman 
survived. Her eyes were swollen shut for a couple of weeks. She 
was black and blue. It was a wonder she survived.
<P>
	The fellow was charged with attempted murder but then charge 
was dropped because it is so difficult to prove. It was a sad case. 
The guy got off with nine months in jail.
<P>
	The woman felt her rights had been compromised. I sent a letter 
to the minister about the need to do something about the part of the 
code dealing with attempted murder. I also wrote to the attorney 
general of British Columbia who agreed with me and asked to have 
the issue put on the agenda of the joint meeting between the 
attorneys general and the minister to see if there was some way the 
charge of attempted murder can be proven. It almost never 
successfully prosecuted. It is very disturbing.
<P>
	This lady came to see me in my office pointing out that 
something needed to be done. The guy got nine months in jail for 
beating on an unconscious body. What tipped off the police was the 
blood stains on the ceilings and walls when they got to the door. 
That is how much he beat on her. Attempted murder could not be 
proven even though he used every conceivable object to beat her.
<P>
	I raise that case because it is a horrible one. I had to deal with it. 
The guy was sent to prison and a red tag was put on his file saying 
that the victim should know where he is at all times. I guess the red 
sticker fell off the file and the guy was transferred to a minimum 
security prison 20 miles from the lady's home in the Chilliwack 
Valley in my riding. It is about a three or four hour walk to the 
lady's home from that jail. She found out about it only because a 
guard tipped her off. She immediately went into hiding. There are 
no fences. It is a minimum security institution, not a federal 
institution, that I am talking about.
<P>
	The woman has been in hiding, has changed her name and done 
everything she could to try to protect herself. She says that every 
time she asks for assurances from the justice system that the man 
will not have access to her, or  at least she will know where he is 
incarcerated, she is assured it will happen and then it does not 
happen. He phones her from jail.
<P>
	The woman needs some protection. When we talk about the 
guiding principle of protecting the rights of the victims that is what 
we are talking about. She needs that assurance. She should not have 
to come to see me. She should know that her rights are being 
protected so that she is not endangered and not in fear.
<P>
	She is in absolute, hopeless fear for her life. I need to assure her 
that we are working on it and that we will push forward with some 
sort of bill of rights for victims which tells them that we more 
worried about them than anything else and they do not have to live 
in fear. When she comes to me for that assurance and I cannot give 
it to her she is very discouraged.
<P>
	Another case which was raised in question period in the last 
while was again in my area, in Abbotsford. The Ursel case has been 
well thrashed out here. It was about someone who was abused 
sexually and the justice system did not seem to provide a straight 
punishment clause for that guy. We are not worried about 
rehabilitation here. We want that guy punished and society 
protected. It did not happen in that case.
<P>
	The justice minister should know there are approximately 
10,000 signatures of people who are upset about that rapist and are 
now lobbying day and night with petitions and letters to editors and 
so on trying to have that judge removed from the bench. Now they 
are attacking our justice system. That again is a very negative 
trend. We need to deal with issues that protect our judges. We have 
to give them the tools and restrict them from using the freedom 
they have been given to so misjudge a case that the whole justice 
system has fallen into disrepute. I like to think I could protect our 
judges, leave them with their autonomy and not get into that fray.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	What do I say? That lady has been in my office too. She is 
distributing the petition. She has a very active group of people. 
Thousands and thousands of people have signed the petition saying 
that the judge has to go. That is not the right way to do it. We do not 
want to start petitioning against judges and kicking this one out 
because we did not like his ruling. The judge needs his autonomy. 
We cannot give him the degree of freedom we have under 
conditional sentencing which allows him to do that.
<P>
	There is another case in the Peace River area. A fellow 
threatened to kill his wife. He was estranged from her. They had 
lived common law for some time and had a couple of children. 
They separated. He moved away, got together with another lady 
and had some more children. They were well separated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9592"> 9592 </A></B>
<P>
	He was not paying his child support and there was some 
acrimony about that. Finally he got disgusted and drove 300 or 
400 kilometres to her home. He broke down her door, raped her, 
beat her and left her unconscious on the floor in her kitchen. Of 
course they caught him. They knew who had done it because they 
had a history of squabbles. The judge ruled under conditional 
sentencing-and Bill C-41 gave him the right-no time in jail for 
that crime because he might miss a child support payment.
<P>
	What are we supposed to say to that? What would the 
parliamentary secretary have me tell the woman? The man drove 
300 miles with malice aforethought to kick in her door, rape her, 
beat her and leave her on the kitchen floor. Then the judge said that 
if he put him in jail he would miss child support payments. He was 
given no time in jail, a conditional release. There is something 
wrong with a system that does not put the rights of the victim ahead 
of the rights of the guy who is making child support payments. 
There is something wrong in our system that it does not provide for 
some sort of protection, a victims bill of rights or something to 
allow people to know that when some heinous violent sexual 
assault happens they can be sure minimum time will be served.
<P>
	What about community protection? That lady is part of the 
community. The guy beat her, raped her and left. He is 300 
kilometres away, exactly where he was the night he got drunk and 
did it to her the last time.
<P>
	What are we supposed to say? I say the justice system needs to 
give a guiding set of principles to the whole mishmash of the 
justice system, whether it is the code, the legislation, the 
regulations, the parole board or whatever. The guiding principle 
should be that the rights of the victim have to be protected. It is not 
happening yet. It has been talked about. I am tantalized by the talk 
just before the election, but I have not seen it in 3.5 years. It has not 
received the emphasis we need. We will be on the campaign trail 
soon. It will be raised at those meetings.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
just spoke on report stage and was happy to detail some of the 
broad concerns I have with the justice system and some of the 
emphasis I would like to see changed within the whole application 
of justice in Canada.
<P>
	All too often I am hearing a very disturbing trend in coffee shop 
talk that they are going to take matters into their own hands. It is 
our job as parliamentarians to make sure that does not happen. 
Vigilante justice is not the answer to injustice in the land. A proper 
justice system is the answer.
<P>
	I have been a member of a party that has raised the mantra of 
victims rights to a new level in Parliament. We have talked about 
the need for that change in emphasis. The emphasis should not be 
on the rehabilitation of criminals. It should be on the rights of 
victims.
<P>
	I find myself time and again having to calm people down. I could 
inflame the situation easily in my riding. I could go over the deep 
end. It is easy to do. It is easy to get angry. There are any number of 
cases in which I can do that. I find myself trying to calm people by 
saying vigilante justice is not the answer. They will get themselves 
in trouble. This is not the wild west. We have to move past that. 
However they are right to be annoyed with the system.
<P>
	The other day Clifford Olson was asking for some changes to his 
situation. He wanted more access to the media and so on. The 
ruling of the judge in denying the application was that he felt it was 
in the best interest of Mr. Olson's rehabilitation that the right not be 
extended. That was his concern in the ruling. He said it was best for 
the rehabilitation of Mr. Olson that he not have access to the media 
because it gets him into a kind of demagoguery situation and all 
that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9593"> 9593 </A></B>
<P>
	The rehabilitation emphasis in the system has gone a bit 
overboard. Clifford Olson will never see the light of day. He is 
in there forever. He will die in jail. He will not get out. That is 
not the concern. The concern of the judge, because of the guiding 
principles that have come through the justice system in the last 
20 years or so, was rehabilitation of the guy: what kind of 
education he needed, what kind of courses he could take and so 
on.
<P>
	Mr. Olson will not get away with it. He will not be able to 
manipulate his way out of jail. We all have seen cases of people 
who go to their case workers and ask what hoops they have to jump 
through to get out. They are not concerned about rehabilitation. 
They are concerned about their access to the outside. They will 
work down the list. They will go to peer counselling. They will join 
AA. Many people in jail say they will become religious-and I am 
of the Christian faith-if it means a red star or a green star. They do 
not care much what religion it is. Sometimes they are very 
insincere, but they will do what they can to jump through the 
hoops.
<P>
	It is very sad to watch, when we are hoping for true change and 
true rehabilitation not only of their actions but of their hearts, them 
manipulating the system to see if they can please enough parole 
officers and enough boards to get themselves out the Pearly Gates 
or through the Pearly Gates depending on their stage of life. The 
emphasis has to change because society demands it.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Recently I saw a documentary on a South American country 
about the middle class suburbs. Every single one had bars on the 
windows, a wall around the house, the broken shards of glass 
embedded in the concrete on the top, spools of wire and so on.
<P>
	In my community there are alarm systems, there is a community 
watch, people are putting extra locks on their windows and so. It is 
now incremental at an incredible rate what people are doing to 
protect themselves.
<P>
	In North America private police and private security firms now 
outnumber government paid police officers. There are more people 
paying privately for protection than we can provide to them 
through the federal provincial systems. They are saying they 
cannot trust the government to do the job anymore. When they 
protect themselves charges will be pressed against them.
<P>
	Three or four weeks ago in British Columbia there was a case 
where an elderly Kelowna man was in his house with his wife and a 
young man in his twenties came to the door and proceeded to try to 
kick the door in. The elderly couple in their seventies were about to 
become the victims of a house invasion. Do we tell the man to dial 
911 and put his chin strap on his bike helmet and sit there and get 
ready to take it? That is what the justice system says.
<P>
	This man stepped out and said ``I am not going to take it. My 
wife is here, she cannot run. I am 72 years  old''. He got the 
baseball bat out and he took it to this guy. We all say let the police 
do it, try not to be alarmed and sit in your easy chair and hope he 
does not kill you in your retirement. Enjoy your retirement years.
<P>
	He did not do that. This 72-year old man said he was not going to 
take because this guy was coming in to his house in broad daylight 
to beat the ever lovin' snot out of him and his wife. And so he took 
a baseball bat to the guy, and good for him. I do not encourage 
vigilante justice but what are we suppose to tell people when their 
lives are in danger?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Then he is charged with assault.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> That is right. Then he is run through the wringer of 
the justice system and people say ``maybe this guy is a bad apple 
and we have to prosecute the guy who is protecting his home and 
his wife from a 20-year old home invader''.
<P>
	I have another case in my riding, and I am sure all members deal 
with these. A lady and her father came in to see me. She is about 30 
years old. An ex-husband, common law relationship, stalked this 
lady for two years after the break-up of their relationship. For two 
years he sent threatening letters. He said: ``I'm going to get you. 
I'm going to kill you. You'll never see the light of day''. He 
kidnapped her once, took her down to the river to shoot with a gun 
he had in his hands and he took the rifle butt to her. She wrestled 
the gun out of his hands and flung the gun into the Fraser River. So 
he just beat on her for a while. I am sure he was going to shoot her 
and throw her corpse in the river. He was convicted and he is doing 
time and he may be getting out next month.
<P>
	While he was stalking this lady he phoned her, threatened to kill 
her and followed her around from work. That is terrifying to any 
person and especially to a single woman. At night he would come 
to her home with a butcher knife and tap on her plate glass window. 
She opens the drapes and there is this guy tapping on the window 
with a butcher knife, smiling at her.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	This went on for two years. She reported every incident to the 
police. Nothing happened. The police said that until he actually 
assaulted her they could not do anything. The police tried. I will 
give them credit, but the laws are so weak that they could not do 
anything about the situation.
<P>
	After the assault, the man got out and caught her again going to 
work. Thankfully her children were at their grandparents' home. 
He chased her around and around the car, in front of 50 witnesses. 
She was screaming for her life. He caught her and he stabbed her 
repeatedly. The onlookers did not know what was going on. He 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9594"> 9594 </A></B>
<P>
stabbed her until her body went limp. The onlookers finally jumped 
the guy and wrestled him to the ground.
<P>
	He was charged with attempted murder. The charges were 
dropped. They could not prove that he had tried to kill her because 
he only stabbed her seven times. She lived through the attack. I do 
not know how she lived. He must have missed all of the vital 
organs.
<P>
	Imagine this. The woman and her father came to see me in my 
office. She had her act together surprisingly well. She could talk 
about the incident. She told me the story. I did not know what to 
say. I was without words. The justice system had not protected the 
woman. Worse than that, I did not know what to say to her father. 
He was a regular guy. He was about 55. He was a regular Joe. He 
was a nice guy off the street. He sat across from me and he said: 
``Mr. Strahl, in July this guy is going to get out. When he gets out 
he is probably going to assault my daughter again. When he gets 
out and taps on my daughter's window with a butcher knife, I will 
kill him''. I said: ``Sir, if you do that you will spend 25 years in jail. 
It is malice aforethought. You have threatened him. You said you 
would do it. You will go to jail for 25 years''. He said: ``That is 
fine. What am I supposed to do, Mr. Strahl? He is going to kill my 
daughter''. I said: ``I would do the same thing''.
<P>
	The system has to change. Victims rights should be more 
predominant. It has to change. I have to be able to go back to that 
lady and say ``we are going to change it and we are going to fight in 
this place until it is changed''.
<P>
	They might issue press releases from the other side which say 
there is not a problem, but I am not going to change my mind. I am 
going to attempt to help that lady and too many others like her.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
speak to Bill C-17 for the last time. It is unfortunate that there are 
two amendments which are completely unrelated to Bill C-17 
which have been piggybacked on to the bill. That was done with the 
unanimous consent of the House because all members of the House 
supported the amendments which were brought forward. Bill C-17 
was the medium through which those amendments were put 
forward, but the amendments are totally unrelated to the bill. I am 
going to direct most of my comments to the original bill.
<P>
	Bill C-17 contains a significant number of updates and 
improvements to the administration of law which are long overdue 
and which we support. The efficiency of our police officers and our 
courts will be aided through a number of the amendments 
contained within Bill C-17.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Sections 4(6) and 4(7) of Bill C-17 will allow a peace officer to 
provide a statement of service without having to seek out a justice 
of the peace or notary to have the service sworn.
<P>
	This change will improve police efficiency, reduce the workload 
of justices of the peace and redirect their expertise to where it is 
needed.
<P>
	Similarly, section 145(5) and a number of subsequent sections of 
Bill C-17 will permit any peace officer to release an accused on a 
reconnaissance. Currently only the officer in charge can do so.
<P>
	This amendment improves police efficiency by negating the 
necessity to bring in the officer in charge for a mere procedural 
action.
<P>
	We fully support the changes in this bill that would enhance the 
way police would be able to conduct their business. We also 
support the portion of the bill which strengthens the proceeds of 
crime legislation by ensuring that criminals do not retain the profits 
of their crime.
<P>
	Initially we opposed Bill C-17 because, as most Canadians are 
aware, Reform is vehemently opposed to measures that lessen 
rather than strengthen penalties for serious offences.
<P>
	Today, however, we are reluctantly providing our support 
because we have confidence in the provinces that support these 
measures and confidence, as it has so indicated, that the crown will 
in the most serious of cases proceed by way of indictment by 
following a sentencing protocol.
<P>
	We believe the justice minister was less than forthright with 
Canadians about the full impact of Bill C-17. The minister has 
touted the merits of this bill in that it modernizes the law and 
streamlines court proceedings but he has been noticeably silent 
about the reduction in penalties for certain very serious offences.
<P>
	Although Reform supports the administrative changes contained 
within Bill C-17 I mentioned earlier, I would be remiss if I did not 
say this bill is a nebulous inconsequential piece of legislation 
which will be of little significance to the enhancement of the safety 
of Canadians, their children and their property.
<P>
	Canadians are very concerned about their personal security and 
that of their families. These administrative changes will do nothing 
to protect Canadians from murderers, rapists and other sadistic 
criminals who roam our streets and enter our homes.
<P>
	Bill C-17 cannot prevent serial child killer Clifford Olson from 
playing out his charade. Bill C-17 does not deny killers the right to 
early release.
<P>
	Only a bill repealing section 745 from the Criminal Code can 
deny Clifford Olson and others from seeking early release, but the 
minister did not bring in a bill of this nature. Instead, he brought in 
Bill C-45 which still grants Clifford Olson and other first degree 
murderers an avenue for early release.
<P>
	By doing so, the justice minister with the support of his Liberal 
colleagues, has forced the families of murder victims to relive their 
terror over and over again.
<P>

<P>

	Bill C-17 will not stop Robert Noyes from sexually molesting 
another child. The former Ashcroft teacher admitted to abusing 
more than 60 children. As a dangerous offender, he was sentenced 
to an indefinite period of incarceration on 19 sex related charges.
<P>
	Now the justice system has turned him loose. In June the 
National Parole Board granted Noyes escorted temporary leave and 
if that went well, Noyes was to be eligible for unescorted leave 
with day parole in February 1997. To date I have not heard whether 
he has been successful.
<P>
	Only a bill like the one proposed by my colleague from 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley requiring the examination of 
sex offenders by two psychiatrists will keep Noyes locked up where 
he belongs.
<P>
	Bill C-17 will not alleviate the fear of Canadian parents that their 
children could be abducted, sexually molested or killed in any of 
our communities or on our streets.
<P>
	The justice minister's news release at the time of the 
introduction of this bill stated that these amendments illustrate 
further progress on the government's safe homes, safe streets 
agenda. This is absolute nonsense. It is simply not true.
<P>
	How does someone make safer streets and safer homes by 
reducing the penalties for crimes such as the forcible confinement 
of individuals and being unlawfully in their homes?
<P>
	Canadians want substantive change within the justice system. 
They want pieces of legislation that effectively enhance public 
safety. They want legislation that sends a clear message to 
criminals that if they do the crime they must do the time. Canadians 
want legislation in the hope that it will deter ruthless thieves from 
entering and destroying the sanctity of their homes.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Canadians want a bill which repeals section 745 of the Criminal 
Code. They want the justice minister to vote in favour of victims 
and victims rights. They do not want a minister that upholds and 
protects the rights of criminals to the detriment of the law-abiding, 
peace-loving citizen.
<P>
	In 1995 the minister voted against private member's Bill C-226, 
which would have extinguished the right of first degree murderers 
to a parole ineligibility hearing after serving only 15 years of a life 
sentence. Canadians do not want the minister giving killers a 
glimmer of hope. They want killers behind bars and they want them 
there for a minimum of 25 years: not 15 years, not 20 years. 
Canadians overwhelmingly want murderers behind bars for the full 
length of their sentences.
<P>
	What is the value of a human life to the justice minister, the 
Prime Minister and the Liberal government? Is it just 15 years? 
That is what they are telling the people of Canada. They are telling 
Canadians  their laws are enhancing public safety. Nothing could 
be further from the truth.
<P>
	On August 12, Clifford Olson was eligible to apply for a parole 
ineligibility hearing and in March, thanks to this government, this 
multiple child killer gets his day in court at the expense of 
taxpayers. The minister saw on the day that Olson once again made 
the national news how Canadians truly feel about his tough on 
justice amendments to section 745. The justice minister just 
recently witnessed the horror all Canadians experienced on March 
11 when Clifford Olson once again was granted, courtesy of the 
Liberals, the opportunity to flaunt his sadistic crimes.
<P>
	Olson is not the only eligible murderer. On July 10, Ralph Ernest 
Malcolm Power applied for early parole on his first degree murder 
conviction. In 1981, the 28-year-old Power, an ex-con out on 
mandatory supervision beat 20-year-old Sheryl Gardner's face to a 
bloody pulp with a hammer. He confessed he was attempting to 
stun her just a little so he could rape her. Power was caught and 
arrested for the murder of Sheryl after attempting to kill another 
woman.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice should have brought in a bill that would 
keep Clifford Olson, Ralph Ernest Malcolm Power and many 
others behind bars. Why is the Minister of Justice not listening to 
the victims of violence and the Canadian Police Association? Why 
has the minister not repealed section 745? The Minister of Justice 
should be dealing with crime first and then administrative matters, 
not vice versa.
<P>
	In the wake of the horrific crimes against Leslie Mahaffy and 
Kristen French, capital punishment is resurfacing as a major issue 
with Canadians. The evidence is growing that if Canadians were 
given the opportunity to vote in a binding referendum on capital 
punishment, an initiative the Reform Party supports, Canadians 
would choose to sentence our most ruthless and sadistic killers like 
Paul Bernardo and Clifford Olson to death. The Liberal 
government refuses to give Canadians this opportunity.
<P>
	Canadians welcome Bill C-55, the dangerous offender 
legislation, but they want it strengthened and they want the 
minister to end statutory release. They want to end the automatic 
release of prisoners after serving only two-thirds of their sentence, 
even when science indicates these people will commit further 
crimes. Malanie Carpenter who was kidnapped, raped and 
murdered is one of the latest victims of this kind of Liberal 
mentality.
<P>
	The minister promised to bring in an omnibus bill encompassing 
these two initiatives which would significantly enhance public 
safety. Instead we got Bill C-55, which falls short of Canadians' 
expectations. All Canadians have been given in the last year are 
half measures or bills like Bill C-2 and Bill C-42 which amend the 
Judges Act, Bill C-9 which re-instituted the law commission and 
now Bill C-17. Bill C-27, which we do  support because it deals 
with child prostitution and stalking should have pre-empted all of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9596"> 9596 </A></B>
<P>
these bills. All Bills C-2, C-42, C-9 and C-17 do is make life a little 
easier for those involved in the justice system. They do not and will 
not make Canadians safer.
<P>
	In fact Bill C-17 may give Canadians more reason to be 
concerned about home invasions because the Liberal government 
through Bill C-17 has lessened the punishment for this Criminal 
Code offence. That is why we give our support reluctantly to this 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-17 reduces maximum sentences and changes strictly 
indictable offences to dual procedure offences. The redesignation 
of offences from indictable to dual procedure permits and 
encourages judges to consider those offences as less serious and 
therefore permissive of a lesser punishment to include mere 
financial penalties.
<P>
	While most of these offences are non-violent, with the exception 
of forcible confinement, they do involve intrusion into the sanctity 
of our homes and forgery which may deprive our most vulnerable 
citizens, our seniors, of valuable financial assets.
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada, in 1994 break and enter 
accounted for 15 per cent of all Criminal Code offences while 25 
per cent of all Criminal Code offences were for property offences. 
Eighty-one percent of break and enters involved forced entry. 
Property was damaged in 71 per cent of the cases and property 
stolen in 81 per cent of the cases.
<P>
	Instead of expressing concern and outrage over these figures, the 
Liberal government is now saying these offences deserve a lesser 
penalty. These offences, which infringe on the financial and mental 
security of Canadian citizens, are going to be dealt with more 
leniency because of Bill C-17.
<P>
	Unbeknownst to Canadians, the Liberal government has been 
slowly moving in this direction over the course of its mandate, a 
direction we are opposed to because not only has it not been 
sanctioned by Canadians, it may very well lead to an increase in 
crime, not a reduction, which is what we in this party seek as do 
most Canadians.
<P>
	A shift of this magnitude in how we punish or-should I say in a 
politically correct manner-how we hold criminals accountable for 
their actions should be reviewed and then approved by the public.
<P>
	Bill C-41, which has now been in force for a number of months, 
introduced alternative measures: alternatives to incarceration, 
alternatives in fact to a court hearing. This portion of Bill C-41 was 
overshadowed by the hate crime part of the bill which gave added 
protection under the law to a category of citizens including those 
classified by sexual orientation, an undefined term.
<P>
	If asked today, I am confident very few Canadians know that the 
Liberal government has provided the  means for a whole host of 
criminals, including sex and other violent offenders, to do 
community work rather than spend time in jail.
<P>
	It is most unfortunate Canadians were not aware of the full scope 
of Bill C-41 which was described by the Canadian Police 
Association in the following manner: ``Bill C-41, with few 
exceptions, is unwieldy, complicated, internally self-contradictory, 
duplicitous and what is worse, all of it completely unnecessary for 
anyone of any knowledge of or use for the common law heritage of 
Canada''.
<P>
	We would not have objected so vehemently to the alternative 
measures section of Bill C-41 if the government had specified 
which offences may be applicable to alternative measures. We 
could support the use of alternative measures for specific 
non-violent offences, to reduce expensive court procedures and 
incarceration. However, no such specifications appeared in Bill 
C-41.
<P>
	The Reform Party submitted an amendment to Bill C-41 that 
would have exempted violent offenders from alternative measures. 
However, the Liberals on the justice committee killed that 
amendment.
<P>
	Since the proclamation of Bill C-41, which also encouraged the 
courts to use conditional sentencing, at least two convicted rapists 
and others are walking free on conditional sentencing while their 
female victims are afraid to leave their homes. That is 
unacceptable. I hope the minister will bring in an amendment to the 
Criminal Code that will restrict conditional sentencing to 
non-violent offences so that rapists do not walk free like the two in 
British Columbia.
<P>
	I would like to draw to the attention of the House the sections of 
Bill C-17 which concern us. The present law dealing with forcible 
confinement of a human being makes this offence an indictable 
offence with a maximum sentence of 10 years which classifies this 
as a very serious offence.
<P>
	Under Bill C-17 the severity of this offence will be lowered 
significantly. The maximum penalty will still be 10 years but it will 
become a dual procedure offence which may be processed by either 
indictment or summary conviction. This means that under a 
summary conviction procedure, this offence can be reduced to a 
maximum sentence of 18 months or only a fine of up to $2,000.
<P>
	Section 348.1(e) of the Criminal Code regarding breaking and 
entering for places other than a dwelling house is also changed to a 
dual procedure offence and the maximum sentence will be reduced 
from 14 years to 10 years under indictment. Not only that, but it 
can be tried by summary conviction with a maximum penalty of 18 
months or simply a fine. What does this say to society? What does 
it say to the criminal?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="9597"> 9597 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	The offence of being unlawfully in a dwelling house, Criminal 
Code section 349(1) has also been changed to dual procedure with 
imprisonment of up to 10 years or processed by summary 
conviction. Currently, unlawfully being in a dwelling house is an 
indictable offence with a maximum imprisonment of up to 10 
years.
<P>
	Similarly, section 367 of the Criminal Code regarding forgery 
and section 368(1), uttering forged documents, will be amended to 
dual procedure offences with imprisonment of up to 10 years or 
processed by summary conviction, whereas the current punishment 
is indictable only with imprisonment of up to 14 years.
<P>
	It is these sections which initially had us opposed to Bill C-17. 
As stated earlier, we remain concerned that these Criminal Code 
amendments will signal to the courts that these types offences are 
to be treated in a less severe manner than is currently the case. As 
we know, the decision on whether to proceed by indictment or by 
summary conviction is made by the crown. It is with this fact in 
mind, and following consultations with some provinces which 
provided us with the assurance that in most of these cases the 
crown will still proceed by way of indictment, that we reluctantly 
provide our support today for Bill C-17.
<P>
	Canada is facing rising crime rates, particularly violent crime, 
raising fears regarding personal safety, escalating costs to 
administer justice and to house prisoners and to top it all off a 
growing debt which severely limits spending.
<P>
	The task of the federal Minister of Justice to deal with these 
problems in unison will be difficult but not insurmountable. Bill 
C-17 is not at this time part of the answer. It does not address the 
increase in crime in Canada and it does absolutely nothing to 
confront the causes of crime.
<P>
	Therefore, we will support Bill C-17, an inconsequential piece of 
Liberal legislation, but we do so regrettably for the reasons given.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak on Bill C-17. I am encouraged by the 
statements that my colleague from Crowfoot has made in reference 
to this bill concerning its shortcomings and the fact that we will be 
supporting it reluctantly. I too have very deep concerns about some 
of the provisions of the bill.
<P>
	I have paid some attention to the shortcomings in the area of the 
reduction in maximum sentences. That really concerns me. As as a 
police officer for 20 some years in the city of Calgary police 
department I have experienced what reductions of sentences 
actually do in the courts. There seems to be a trivializing of 
sentences that are delivered when parliamentarians start tinkering 
around and reducing the maximum terms allotted to some 
offenders.
<P>
	I look in particular at section 279(2) which deals with forcible 
confinement. When is the section on forcible confinement often
<P>
used? What kind of offender is charged with such an offence? For 
the most part it deals with the rapist, the sexual abuser, the person 
who has intent to kidnap or to hold against his or her will someone. 
It is most often a female or a child that the offender has attacked or 
is attacking.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	In Bill C-17 the government introduced a reduced sentence 
lowering an indictable offence which had a provision of 14 years to 
one of 18 months and making it a dual procedure. A minimum 
sentence of 18 months can be delivered if the courts proceed by 
way of summary conviction.
<P>
	Rape or sexual assault is a very serious offence. Yet the 
government has trivialized a good portion of the number of charges 
of forcible confinement laid in sexual assault offences.
<P>
	Another provision in Bill C-17 comes under section 348(1). 
Breaking and entering a place other than a dwelling house is now 
considered a dual procedure offence with a maximum of 10 years. 
Again it has been decreased.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member will have the floor 
immediately after question period when we resume debate on this 
matter.

many of my constituents practise preventive health care using 
herbs and other natural health supplements, but the Liberal 
government wants to criminalize these law-abiding Canadians by 
arbitrarily reclassifying herbs and natural health foods as drugs. 
This sets in motion an expensive and time consuming testing 
process that will remove access to health supplements for many 
Canadians.
<P>
	Health food stores are being raided, products confiscated and 
stopped at our borders, and consumers are denied access to 
products they have enjoyed for years. That happens even though 
there is no scientific evidence whatsoever that the products have 
ever produced harm and there is no reason for these actions.
<P>
	The burden of proof should be reversed for these products. 
Health Canada should be required to demonstrate that they harm 
human health and well-being before it imposes restrictions in their 
trade or consumption. Reformers say call off the Liberal 
government's health police and give Canadians freedom of choice 
in health care because foods are not drugs.

<P>
	The government has acted in a responsible and prudent manner. 
Seasonal workers have not been compromised. The Atlantic

<P>
	Unfortunately after EI went fully into effect in January a 
problem surfaced which affected all Canadians. Again the 
government acted on recommendations that would protect seasonal 
workers.
<P>
	The solution will work. Small weeks are counted for eligibility 
but are bundled for calculating benefits. This change gives 
claimants the best of both worlds.
<P>
	I doubt there are many who would argue that reforms were not 
needed. The changes implemented help Canadians. Every hour 
counts. More people will be covered and many will qualify quicker.

to continue the fight for the long term survival of Mirabel airport, 
following the appeal court decision concerning ADM.

to find solutions.

	In Quebec City, work has already begun, with the creation of the 
joint commission on the future of Mirabel airport, and we should 
be pleased. The Liberals, who have landed us in this mess, should 
get moving as well.
<P>
	The region's Bloc Quebecois MPs urge the public not to give up, 
but instead to redouble its efforts to have traffic transferred back to 
Mirabel. People in the Lower Laurentians should not be held 
hostage by the Liberal government.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Yesterday, before the UN Commission on Human Rights in 
Geneva, Canada refused to co-sponsor a Danish  resolution 
condemning human rights violations in China. Yet, since the 
massacre in Tiananmen Square, Canada had never failed to 
co-sponsor 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9601"> 9601 </A></B>
<P>
similar resolutions. Canada has apparently given up defending 
human rights internationally.
<P>
	In light of the fact that China is systematically, blatantly and 
continually violating human rights throughout its territory, and 
particularly in Tibet, can the minister tell us why the Canadian 
government did not support Denmark's action, which condemns 
the failure to respect human rights in China?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have not refused. The hon. member is totally wrong in 
his statement.
<P>
	A resolution was tabled by Denmark with a number of 
co-sponsors. We are still looking at the question of whether we 
would be a co-sponsor but we have not refused in any way. It is a 
matter under consideration.
<P>
	The Prime Minister already said a few days ago, if the hon. 
member had paid attention, that they would be examined by a 
meeting of cabinet ministers probably at the beginning of next 
week.
<P>
	In the meantime we have also indicated our intention to vote for 
the resolution. The Prime Minister said that in Washington in his 
speech Wednesday. The hon. member should check his facts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the past seven years, China has succeeded in blocking 
any vote concerning its human rights violations. But the real vote, 
the one he is talking about, is when a country sponsors a resolution.
<P>
	Is the minister telling us that, with all these changes, these things 
he will be deciding about in the future, and so on, Canada has caved 
in to the blackmail and threats of political and trade reprisals from 
this country?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I repeat what I said. We were faced, as was everybody 
else, with a decision by the French to break the consensus 
established by the European Union, the major sponsor of the 
resolution.
<P>
	That certainly changed the circumstances in which one would 
want to look at the resolution. Because of the trip to Washington 
and other activities, we did not have the opportunity to have a 
cabinet meeting on the matter. The Prime Minister indicated that 
there would be a meeting at the beginning of this week at which 
time we would make a decision.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it has only been going on for seven years, so I can 
understand that the minister has not had the time to hold a meeting 
of his officials.
<P>
	I find the responses of the government and of the minister this 
morning most puzzling. If I understand the minister correctly, 
Canada seems to have abdicated its traditional role as defender of 
human rights. Otherwise it would have cast its real vote by now, 
and we would know where it stands. As things are now, we do not 
know where it stands and are still waiting, despite the importance 
of the issue.
<P>
	By refusing to stand up to intimidation by China and by putting 
the defence of international human rights on the back burner, does 
the minister agree that Canada is a party to the imprisonment of 
Chinese political prisoners, and to the detention of the 11th 
Panchen Lama, the chief spiritual adviser of Tibet?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know the hon. member is trying to inflame and to 
exaggerate his position. Unfortunately the hon. member is basing 
his premise on sheer ignorance.
<P>
	If he had paid attention rather than to a headline but to the facts, 
he would know that last week I was in China. I met with Chinese 
officials. I raised the issue of human rights. I raised the issue of 
political prisoners. We put them on the table.
<P>
	Canada maintained a continual constant opinion that we would 
raise those kinds of issues directly with the Chinese and we did. It 
is too bad the hon. member does not have the fortitude and the 
resolve to make the same kind of commitments we are prepared to 
make.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question as well is directed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	We know that Canada played an important role in the world 
movement of sanctions against apartheid in South Africa. At the 
beginning of this month, the UN Human Rights Commission 
published a report in which it urged the international community to 
take steps to combat violence against women, such as rape and 
trafficking.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us the measures he intends to take in 
response to the publication of this report, which reminds us that 
violence against women is still considered a form of entertainment 
or a normal practice in a number of countries?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9602"> 9602 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we certainly share very much both the spirit and the intent 
of the resolution in Geneva. There are several ways of follow it 
through. Certainly one would be to ensure that in our domestic 
situation we take all steps possible. The Minister of Justice has 
already indicated in the House several times this week that we have 
a number of initiatives to combat violence against women, in fact 
violence against all people.
<P>
	I think the commitment made by the minister is a clear example 
of the way we want to act domestically.
<P>
	A second initiative we can take is to work internationally to 
ensure that there are covenants and that through the work of CIDA 
and other groups we work within those countries to provide 
assistance and programs that will assist women and combat 
violence against women.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we know 
that many countries with which the Canadian government has 
dealings are directly implicated in this serious problem of violence 
against women.
<P>
	Does the minister intend to denounce these countries during his 
upcoming international dealings and in his trade relations with 
these same countries, and thus maintain the leadership role that 
Canada has always played with respect to human rights?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can answer that by way of example. Canada was very 
instrumental in working with Indonesia for the establishment of an 
independent human rights commission which is taking on those 
individual cases by the support we give.
<P>
	In the discussions we held recently with Cuba on human rights 
issues, we have agreed to co-sponsor a major meeting in Havana to 
deal with the questions of rights of women and rights of children.
<P>
	I have made it very clear and very explicit in the statement on 
Canada's human rights approach that we believe the most effective 
way of promoting democracy, human rights and the protection of 
basic civil liberties is to promote and support those working within 
the countries to provide the changes within those countries. That is 
the central trust of our policy.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
during question period the justice minister read a letter from the 
president of CAVEAT, Mrs. de Villiers, while responding to a 
question about conditional sentencing and the case of rapist Darren 
Ursel.
<P>
	By doing so, is the justice minister saying to the House and the 
victims of this country that Mrs. de Villiers and her organization 
support a law that allows a convicted rapist to walk free?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought the response spoke for 
itself.
<P>
	I was asked yesterday about the position of the government in 
relation to victims. The allegation has been made all week by the 
hon. member and his colleagues in the Reform Party that the 
government either does not understand or has not acted in the 
interests of victims in the criminal justice system.
<P>
	My purpose in referring to the letter from Priscilla de Villiers, 
the president of CAVEAT, was to demonstrate that one of the most 
respected spokespersons for victim rights, who has suffered her 
own personal tragedy and has turned from that tragedy to make 
something constructive come out of all that, has looked at the 
record of the government and has said we have made significant 
change, that we have demonstrated a willingness to listen and a 
willingness to act.
<P>
	I said yesterday, as I say today, that when the people of Canada 
come to make their choice between the Reform Party and the 
Liberal government as to who to believe on the issue of victim 
rights, I believe they will turn to respected and credible third 
parties such as CAVEAT.
<P>
	The people of this country will have no difficulty deciding that 
this is a government which has acted and the Reform Party is 
absolutely wrong.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the justice 
minister's reading of Mrs. de Villiers' letter in the House yesterday 
indicates clearly that the minister remains committed to a law that 
allows rapists and child sex molestors to walk free and has 
attempted to defend his position by leaving the impression that the 
victims of crime support this law as well.
<P>
	If this impression is wrong and the minister does not really 
support rapists and violent offenders walking free, will the minister 
move immediately to amend the Criminal Code to restrict 
conditional sentencing to non-violent offenders?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me make a couple of points.
<P>
	First, no one would suggest for a moment that anyone, whether it 
is this government, CAVEAT, I or any other responsible person, 
favours anything but prison for those who commit serious violent 
crimes.
<P>
	My reference to the CAVEAT letter was and is in relation to its 
commentary on the performance of this government in relation to 
victims and their rights under the law.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9603"> 9603 </A></B>
<P>
	On the subject of conditional sentences, the Criminal Code 
already contains serious penalties, including life in prison, for 
those who commit serious violent crimes such as sexual assault, 
aggravated sexual assault and the like. It is already in the criminal 
law.
<P>
	If a court somewhere makes a decision about a sentence in a 
specific case, if the prosecutor believes that sentence is 
inappropriate an appeal can be brought and argued and that result 
may well be changed. It depends on the judgment of the court.
<P>
	The reference this week has been to a specific case in British 
Columbia which is before the court of appeal. I ask the hon. 
member to let the court do its job. The penalties are already in the 
code. If the penalty in this case was inappropriate the appeal court 
has all the power to correct that result.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, conditional 
sentencing has been used in a host of violent cases across this 
country where the offenders are walking free. It is not simply the 
case of Mr. Ursel. There are a host of child molestors and violent 
offenders walking free because of the loophole this justice minister 
has left in the law through Bill C-41.
<P>
	Since the justice minister likes to hear and read what victims 
have to say, I would like to read the words of Jana Rosenfeldt, the 
sister of one of Clifford Olson's victims:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Actually we met with the justice minister last year. He had a chance to stop this. 
He basically spit on all the graves of all these kids.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is how a victim really feels about this justice minister and 
his great concern about victims of crime.
<P>
	I ask the justice minister one more time will he do the right thing 
and amend Bill C-41 to plug the loophole that allows the courts to 
let rapists and violent offenders to walk free? Will he bring that in? 
We will support it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said, there are already 
penalties in the criminal law to provide for lengthy imprisonment, 
if necessary life imprisonment, for those who commit serious 
violent crimes.
<P>
	Monday of last week I proposed and all parties agreed, including 
my hon. friend, an amendment to the conditional sentence 
provision that will require the courts to look at sentencing factors 
in general, including denunciation, when deciding whether 
conditional sentences are appropriate.
<P>
	In terms of the hon. member's reference to graves, the party 
opposite makes it very difficult to engage in rational debate. If its 
members have succeeded in anything this week it has been to 
fortify their position as a party of the narrow edge, a party of the 
extreme, a party that prefers slogans over substance, a party that  
prefers rhetoric over results. They have made themselves the 
spectacle this week.

question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Tension continues to mount in the Middle East where, yesterday, 
the Israeli defence minister warned that, if friction between 
Palestinians and the Israeli army continued, Israel would have no 
trouble taking back Hebron or any other Palestinian city.
<P>
	Since this statement could inflame the situation and irreversibly 
topple the peace process arising from the Oslo accords, can the 
minister tell us what actions Canada intends to take to maintain 
peace in the Middle East?
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are very concerned about the increasing tensions in the 
Middle East. We continue to call on all parties to find ways of 
following the peace process established by Oslo of reconciling 
differences, of living up to their commitments.
<P>
	Canada is the chair of the working group on refugees. It is the 
one working group that came out of the larger peace process that is 
still functioning. We will be leading a mission into the Middle East 
shortly to see if we can bring the parties together to work 
specifically on the refugee issue.
<P>
	That area is perhaps the most burning source of tension and 
instability. If we can bring progress about by bringing the parties 
together on the refugee issue it may contribute in its own way to 
providing a sense that solutions are possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
minister intend, in light of the new context, to renew Canadian 
opposition to the Israeli plan to build new Jewish settlements in 
East Jerusalem?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have always said that any attempt to bring those 
settlements about runs contrary to the resolutions of the United 
Nations. We have constantly stated that and our position has not 
changed.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on June 15, 1995 this government invoked time allocation 
to ram its sentencing bill, Bill C-41, through the House.
<P>
	Reformers supported the Canadian Police Association in calling 
for the rejection of this ill conceived piece of legislation. We feared 
judges would use conditional sentencing inappropriately in cases of 
violence. Our worst fears have become victims' worst nightmares.
<P>
	The Bill C-17 amendment the justice minister just referred to 
only cautions judges to use this so-called tool appropriately. It does 
not prevent them from using it in cases of violence.
<P>
	Will the justice minister now admit his mistake and take 
corrective action to ensure conditional sentencing is never used 
again in cases of violence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the conditional sentence provision 
provides on its face that the court must take into account the safety 
of the community, the danger to the community, before deciding 
whether a conditional sentence is appropriate.
<P>
	By virtue of the amendment that all parties agreed to this past 
Monday we will add words that require the judge before 
considering a conditional sentence to take into account the usual 
factors, including deterrence, denunciation and protection of the 
community.
<P>
	The Criminal Code has over 800 sections. Many provide 
expressly for terms as long as life imprisonment for those who 
commit crimes of serious violence, including sexual assault and 
aggravated sexual assault. The tools are there. This government 
does not sit in the courtrooms to decide cases or pass sentences. It 
provides the law. The law provides well to deal with violent crime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on November 4 last year I drew this minister's attention to 
the misuse of Bill C-41 in three cases involving violence against 
women. He chose to ignore the facts. One week later, on November 
12, Judge Harry Boyle turned Darren Ursel free into the 
community.
<P>
	Had the minister acted then rather than mock the question, this 
travesty of justice need not have occurred.
<P>
	I will ask the minister the very same question I asked him almost 
six months ago. Does he believe conditional sentencing, no jail 
time, is appropriate for rape?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	If the hon. member looks at the cases he referred to last 
November, he should look at the appeal court decisions from those 
results. If the hon. member is suggesting that any time a judge 
somewhere in Canada  makes a sentencing decision that he does 
not agree with we should pass another law, then he does not 
understand the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Judges are to apply the criminal law which includes penalties up 
to life in prison for serious violence, including sexual assault and 
aggravated sexual assault. The tools are there. They are spelled out 
in the code for the courts to apply.
<P>
	I urge the hon. member to reconsider what the purpose and 
nature of the criminal justice system is.

<P>

United States have reached an agreement on amendments to the tax 
treaty between our two countries. However, retroactive payments 
will not be made until the agreement is ratified by the Senate.

incomes who will otherwise have to spend nearly two more years 
deprived of 25 per cent of their U.S. pension income?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
previously said that we need to set up a system because of the 
rather complex administration involved. We have already taken the 
requisite steps to ensure that, if an agreement is not reached in time 
for the U.S. Senate to be able to act, we are prepared, once the 
system is set up, to make payments on an interim basis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, am I to understand from the minister's reply that he thinks 
it would be normal for a person whose sole income amounts to 
$10,000 annually to receive some compensation so that he will not 
have to live on $8,000 a year for two years, while waiting for 
retroactive payments because of an unfair tax treaty?
<P>

Speaker, I think the hon. member did not understand the answer.
<P>
	I said we needed to set up a system in order to have the data 
required to make these payments. Now if there were some delay in 
the U.S. Senate and the system is ready to go and we have the data, 
then we will make these payments. So the delay is not due to a 
matter of principle on our side but is purely administrative.

Now we have learned that there are not any negotiations taking

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and

resolved last fall. The fact is an agreement has been achieved with 
respect to the clean-up of a number of bases, including distant early 
warning systems at Argentia, Goose Bay and a couple of others. 
However, it is a contingent agreement because it still remains to be 
dealt with by the American government.
<P>
	What we are looking at is, hopefully, that there will be a

taxpayers are being stuck with a $500 million tab to clean up

white wine with his close friend Bill Clinton.
<P>

Canadian taxpayers be stuck with toxic waste and a $500 million 
tab?

the American government takes some responsibility for a situation 
that has developed over the last 40 or 50 years.

was a second world war. Subsequent to that there was a cold war, 
during which time American military establishments were set up in

	The number he referred to, specifically the $500 million figure, 
was not a number put forward by the Canadian government. It was 
a number that may have been put forward by someone else. The 
$100 million U.S. that has been agreed to, contingent on approval 
by the American Congress is, we feel, a significant improvement

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is directed to the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Before the Easter recess, in answer to my question about 
employment insurance benefits for members of the reserve, the 
Minister of National Defence said he would let us know as soon as 
possible why members of the reserve did not pay premiums for 
service in class A or for contract jobs with a duration of less than 30 
days.
<P>
	Could the minister finally explain why members of the reserve 
are excluded from the Employment Insurance Act, while all other 
workers are not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
the hon. member for the question he asked a few weeks ago.
<P>
	I would like to point out, however, that all employees are not 
necessarily covered by the act because if I am not mistaken, the 
Sûreté du Québec is not covered, since the Quebec government 
decided it would be better for employees of the Sûreté not to be 
covered.
<P>
	However, since the hon. member raised a matter I thought was 
very important, we looked to the whole picture. Since it is a 
fundamental principle to ensure that all Canadians who have a job 
have access to the employment insurance program, we are now 
changing the regulations at the Department of National Defence to 
give members of the reserve access to the employment insurance 
program, even for a period of less than 30 days.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again 
the Bloc Quebecois has made major gains. We are often in the 
House to push this government to do things, and we do that on a 
regular basis.

he will take action as soon as possible, in other words, by the end 
of this month?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we will do 
everything we can to act as quickly as possible.
<P>
	My only regret is that the hon. member is surrounded by people 
who once sat on this side of the House as members of the 
Conservative government, including the leader at headquarters in 
Quebec City, and all these people let this situation go on for many

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Standing Committee on Government Operations tabled its report 
on contracting yesterday. The report was particularly critical of the 
government and found that Treasury Board was not following its 
own rules. It was found that fully 37 per cent of contracts worth 
over $3.2 billion were sole source or non-competitive contracts.
<P>
	In the red book the Liberals promised accountability and 
integrity in government. What do we see? Millions of  taxpayers' 
dollars being squandered by the government. It is not following its 
own Treasury Board policies and guidelines regarding the 
awarding of contracts.
<P>
	My question is for the minister responsible for Treasury Board. 
Will the minister guarantee that Treasury Board will follow its own 
rules with respect to the awarding of contracts and, in particular, 
drastically reduce the number of contracts awarded without going 
through the competitive bidding process?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
committee of the House has been doing what we believe is very 
good work for about two years. The members submitted a 
preliminary report in the fall of 1995. We agreed with quite a 
number of their recommendations.
<P>
	In fact, already we have put in place a number of measures to 
implement these recommendations. For instance, in order to 
increase the number of contracts that went to competitive bidding 
the threshold was lowered from $30,000 to $25,000. The new 
bidding procedures have been tightened. The monitoring is much 
stronger. We are waiting to see the other recommendations in the 
final report in order to act on them as quickly as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is tinkering around the edges. He has not dealt with the 
meat of the issue. We are talking about $9 billion in contracts. That 
is nearly 10 per cent of total government spending and yet the 
government has not addressed the key issues.
<P>
	The committee report recommends that Treasury Board address 
four areas of abuse by the government: sole source contracting, 
contract splitting, contract tailoring and contract amendments. 
These abuses fly in the face of government policy and are contrary 
to the standards of fairness and transparency that Canadians expect 
from their government. The committee report calls for strong 
sanctions to be imposed to prevent such abuses from continuing in 
the future.
<P>
	Will the minister guarantee to Canadians that his department will 
follow the committee recommendations and put an end to contract 
splitting, contract tailoring and excessive contract amendments?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first, more than 60 per cent of the contracts that are concluded are 
concluded according to rules that involve competitive bidding. The 
great majority of these contracts are clearly recognized as being 
efficient, fair and under proper procedures.
<P>
	In the circumstances that were mentioned by the committee we 
have recognized that in certain cases the recommendations make a 
lot of sense. As I mentioned, we have already implemented a 
number of these  measures. We will now study the other 
recommendations. We have, I believe, 90 days to respond. We will

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	In the report to the Prime Minister entitled ``Leadership and 
Management of the Canadian Forces'', there is a common thread to 
the reforms proposed by the Minister of National Defence. They do 
not touch anything that sets the army apart, well out of public view, 
and that affords it government complacency.
<P>
	Why did the minister refuse to act on the recommendation by 
Professor Albert Legault that civilian and military companies be 
integrated and the ombudsman accountable to Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we tried to take 
into account a number of recommendations that came from a lot of 
people, not just Professor Legault.
<P>
	I would point out to my colleague that, as regards the system of 
military justice and the operation of the military police, we will be 
establishing a tribunal to oversee the activities of the military 
justice system and to look into complaints about the system. This is 
completely outside the chain of command of the Canadian forces 
and outside the bureaucracy of the Department of National 
Defence. It will report directly to the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	However, as is generally the case, because he has no regulatory 
power but rather the power to verify and encourage so that the 
appropriate changes are made in cases where the system has treated 
individuals unfairly, the ombudsman is to report, as is often the 
case, to those persons in a position to make the necessary changes.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	In the case of National Defence, the ombudsman's reports will 
be made public as will those of the tribunal I have just mentioned. 
This will, I think, ensure a transparency heretofore unknown in the 
organization of the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the military police and the ombudsman, who will both 
remain under the authority of the chief of staff, and the minister's 
refusal to review the army's traditional role, including its readiness 
for combat, lead us to conclude that the minister's reform is 
nothing more than window dressing.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that, in fact, his reform accords full 
and unconditional amnesty to the chief of staff of the Canadian 
armed forces and treats all those guilty of murder and of covering 
up all the events in Somalia as innocent, without any formal 
decision? Does the minister realize that he is proposing not only 
amnesty, but total amnesty?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker, but when I 
come face to face with incomprehension, I certainly realize it.
<P>
	There is no doubt that some of the 65 recommendations we made 
in fact concern a number of the points the hon. member has raised. 
However, I would point out to him that the recommendations on the 
military justice system and the operation of the military police 
were prepared and submitted to the Prime Minister and the 
government without a single letter being changed. The 
recommendations are the result of work presided over by a former 
chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	I think the hon. member should make sure his facts are right and 
that he understands what he is saying when he refers to the 
recommendations on the military justice system and the military 
police. Because when the time comes to judge the content, I believe 
the opinions of the hon. member will be measured against the 
ability of the former chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

effective.
<P>
	Second, he is well aware that Health Canada already has a 
committee in place to study all such herbal products. Over 100 of

which are found in our own bodies, like tryptothan.

to ban vitamins. I suggest that he get his priorities straight. While 
Canadians a dying on waiting lists, this is what the government is

<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

asked for specifically: stable, predictable and secure cash transfers. 
In the 1997 budget, an additional $150 million in investment for 
the future of health care was added in the health transition fund to 
take Canada into the 21st century. That is in addition to funds that 
had been already put in place for other health related measures 
including prenatal nutrition, community action programs for

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for

<P>
	Last March 8, 23 days before the end of the fiscal year, my 
colleague, the member for Louis-Hébert, reminded the Secretary of 
State for the Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec that 
his government had not yet kept its promise to turn over a quarter 
of a million dollars in funding to the Parc technologique du Québec 
métropolitain. Last March 26, the Minister of Industry told the 
Sainte-Foy chamber of commerce that the amount would be only 
$150,000.
<P>
	How can a minister who says that the jobs of the future will be 
built on savoir faire and knowledge break the government's 
promises like this, by depriving the Parc technologique du Québec 
métropolitain of financial resources, the very purpose of which is 
to create jobs in the high tech sector?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
confirm what my colleague, the Minister of Industry said: this 
government has focused on job creation based on businesses in the 
new economy.
<P>
	As for the Parc technologique du Québec, it was created and 
exists in large measure because the Canadian government 
supported it from the very beginning. We recently stepped in with 
an additional $150,000, which seems to have satisfied the people of 
the Parc technologique.
<P>
	However, I would just like to mention that the Parc 
technologique du Québec is a paragovernmental corporation 
belonging to the Province of Quebec, and I think that members of 
the official opposition are knocking on the wrong door. I think the

manner until the case is concluded in a court of law.

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today I have the privilege to present more petitions on 
``don't tax reading''.
<P>
	The petitioners ask Parliament to zero rate books, magazines and 
newspapers under the GST. They also ask Parliament and the 
provincial governments to zero rate reading materials under the 
proposed harmonized sales tax.
<P>
	These petitioners are from Edmonton, from Rocky Mountain 
House and other parts of Alberta. This is very important and I hope 
the government takes it seriously. We should not be taxing reading 
material.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-17, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code and certain other acts, be read 
the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Calgary Northeast 
has 37 minutes remaining in his intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
relating some of the shortcomings of that bill. I dealt with section 
348(1) of the Criminal Code, breaking and entering a place other 
than a dwelling house for which the maximum sentence is being 
reduced from an indictable offence only to a dual procedure one, 
having a maximum sentence of 10 years.
<P>
	I was relating a situation that occurred in Calgary. It was a shop 
break-in. Several offenders had entered the shop in the early 
morning hours of a weekday. While they were conducting their 
activities within that shop, the owner, a recently arrived immigrant 
to Canada, had come into the shop to do his work. Unbeknownst to 
him three culprits who had entered through the roof were in the 
store. When he walked in he was immediately confronted by the 
three shop breakers, one of whom was armed.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	There was a physical confrontation and the shopkeeper was shot 
in the neck. He was a breath away from dying. The culprits 
scattered. Some climbed back on to the roof, the point of entry. One 
ran through the parking lot. Fortunately a call was placed to police 
and a nearby cruiser responded. The police response was so 
immediate that two culprits were trapped on the roof. The third 
culprit ran through the parking lot firing his gun as the police 
approached him. It was a semi-automatic weapon.
<P>
	There was the offence against the owner of the shop and charges 
were also laid as a result of the culprit firing at police officers. 
Fortunately no one else was hit. There was a good resolution to this 
incident. For one reason or another the police never returned fire 
although they had every opportunity to do so. Maybe they looked at 
the conditions around the site at the time and did not return fire for 
that reason.
<P>
	That is a very serious offence, a shop breaking. It can be looked 
at as a property offence which is the way it has been classified. It is 
unfortunate that the government seems to be looking at those 
offences as being rather minor in nature. As a result of that view we 
see a change in the legislation that trivializes the offence by it being 
reduced with its maximum sentence diluted.
<P>
	There was a shop breaking. Armed offenders entered the 
premises. A confrontation ensued because a man who had 
contributed to society got up a little earlier than normal and went to 
work to look after his books and a few other items. He confronted 
these subjects and almost lost his life.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned shop breaking is a serious offence. So is 
house breaking. However, the maximum penalties will now be 
reduced to a dual procedure. They can be proceeded with as 
summary conviction offences which may yield just a few months in 
prison.
<P>
	To my way of thinking and in the eyes of a lot of Canadians, 
culprits like that should get the maximum penalty just for that 
offence. Now it has been reduced. It should be an indictable 
offence. Even if the crown proceeds in that fashion the maximum 
time delivered will be 10 years which is not acceptable.
<P>
	Another thing will happen in this case. The charges will all go 
forward: discharging a firearm in a public place; attempted murder; 
and all forms of criminal charges adequate to this offence. They 
will be presented in court. As in most cases of this nature where 
multiple charges are laid, the courts will look on the charges in the 
following fashion. The most serious charge is attempted murder, 
the second most serious is shooting at the police officers and the 
third is the shop breaking itself.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	Those three charges will go forward and most likely the most 
serious penalty will be allotted to the attempted murderer, as it 
should be, but all the rest, even though they may yield four, five or 
however many years the court deems necessary, will serve their 
sentences concurrently. In other words, they will all be served at 
the same time, as opposed to consecutively. Seldom do we see the 
courts ordering consecutive sentencing. I find that a little unsettling 
because it is so common in our courtrooms today.
<P>
	Charges such as shop breaking, a breaking and entering offence 
other than in a dwelling house, have been reduced in scope. 
Frequently charges for shop breaking are reduced. I have a concern 
about the provision in section 348(1) which would reduce 
maximum sentencing.
<P>
	The member for Crowfoot has been diligently following this bill. 
He is very much aware of its ramifications. He clearly pointed out 
the fact that our party would have voted against this bill. However, 
other provisions have been thrown into the legislation which make 
it almost necessary for us to support it.
<P>
	Section 349 deals with being unlawfully in a dwelling house. 
Again it is a dual procedure which has a maximum sentence of ten 
years. It is an indictable charge. We are talking about a dwelling 
house in which people live. It is their castle. It is their refuge. The 
charge concerns an uninvited person being in the house. It is a 
situation  which occurs frequently. The person may not even give a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9612"> 9612 </A></B>
<P>
reason for being in the house but will only face a maximum 
sentence of ten years.
<P>
	I was a police officer. The hon. member for Crowfoot was in a 
similar type of career. He struggled through 14 years and saw some 
very significant happenings when it came to the things that some 
people will do to others. I know that people are very unsettled when 
someone walks uninvited into their home and disturbs the 
possessions they cherish. I am concerned about the reduction in the 
sentencing for being unlawfully in a dwelling house. There is no 
reason an uninvited guest should not get the maximum penalty.
<P>
	I see that the parliamentary secretary to the justice minister is in 
his seat. I do not know if he understands what I am saying, but 
when it comes to breaking into a house, the victims do not forget 
that there was an intruder in their house. They never forget it. It is 
very unsettling for them, especially if the intruder touched their 
possessions.
<P>
	It has happened to me. Some of my police paraphernalia was 
stolen from my home by an intruder. I know how it feels. I want to 
point out that for female members of a family it is very disturbing 
and they never forget. They have to wash all the clothes because 
somebody uninvited intruded in their privacy.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	When it comes to a dwelling house I see the need to keep 
offences much higher than most. It is so important that people get 
the message that the government intends to protect what they own, 
their refuge, the only refuge that really no one else is permitted to 
enter apart from members of the family or those who have 
permission to do so. That is my concern about this part of the bill.
<P>
	There are other provisions in the bill. One is dealing with 
forgery. Again it is being reduced from 14 years to a maximum of 
10 years.
<P>
	Prior to my election to the House I was a commercial crime 
investigator. I have been involved in some major cases of 
embezzlement, fraud and misappropriation of funds. I have seen 
numerous people lose their livelihood over the greed of others who 
had been hired or who were in partnership with them in businesses. 
It troubles me to see again someone who has committed such a 
crime and who can lay a complete business to waste because they 
were in a trusted position and then get away with a lower sentence.
<P>
	I refer to a statement that was made in one of the government 
reports. It was the intent of the government to modernize the 
Criminal Code in these areas. What on earth does modernizing the 
Criminal Code have to do with reducing the sentences on very 
important sections of the Criminal Code? What on earth does that 
have to do with modernizing it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Reformers do not understand modernization.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> The parliamentary secretary cannot grasp what is 
being said here. The courts have taken this trend, and a lot of it is 
because of appointments from the government to many of the 
judges within the court of Queen's bench appeal court and the 
supreme court and the pressure coming to bear to change some of 
the sentences delivered.
<P>
	That is not what the people in this country want. They are crying 
out, calling out, for stiffer sentences. Take the troublemaker off the 
street, not turn him out earlier, not reduce his sentence and 
especially with violence and those areas where there is a potential 
for violence. With break and enter there is always the potential for 
violence.
<P>
	I know many people do not talk about the fraud side of things but 
there are hundreds of millions of dollars lost every year in credit 
card fraud. That would certainly address the point of organized 
crime.
<P>
	Organized criminals have engaged in this activity big time. They 
are the most abusive and intrusive form of criminal into the whole 
area of credit card fraud and deceit through other means. It 
stretches into unemployment insurance fraud and welfare fraud in 
the organized criminal mind.
<P>
	When the drafters of the Criminal Code brought these sections 
into being they were very much aware of what had to be done. The 
legal minds of the day were concerned about organized crime. 
What would it take to shut down an organized criminal? I know the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice may not be 
aware that some of these fraud criminal rings operate on an 
international scale. It is international crime with hundreds of 
millions of dollars in credit card fraud alone. They obtain cards and 
they can actually change the data on the strip on the back of the 
card. This is a very sophisticated, organized type of criminal. It 
certainly has an impact on the community and society. Who pays 
for it all? We do. We pay for the service charges at the bank. We 
pay for the purchase of those goods that are never recovered. We 
pay the price at the stores because everyone builds into their price 
list the losses incurred because of this organized criminal element. 
These sophisticated crimes should addressed by a maximum 
penalty that is higher instead of lower.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	We talked about the greatest shortfall of the bill, the reduction of 
maximum sentences in the Criminal Code. The real reasons 
Reform will have to support the bill are two provisions that the 
justice minister put in at the last minute.
<P>
	There is the conditional release where violent offenders are 
actually given conditional sentences, some of them for rape. Some 
did not even go to jail. The other one is the victim impact 
statements on section 745. They  were not mandatory. In Bill C-41 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9613"> 9613 </A></B>
<P>
the government granted victims the right to give their statement 
and then in Bill C-45 took the right away.
<P>
	Seeing the error of its ways, the government brought in the two 
quick amendments to Bill C-17 which have nothing to do with the 
original bill, but the subsections are essential and Reform has 
chosen to support the government on the bill.
<P>
	On section 745 under the Criminal Code, the faint hope clause, 
there has been so much talk about the faint hope clause over the 
years and especially since many of these first degree murderers are 
now eligible for application for a hearing. There has been a lot of 
controversy surrounding this.
<P>
	The government introduced legislation that tinkered with it. It 
now requires the unanimous consent of a jury to reduce the killer's 
request for a reduced sentence.
<P>
	I want to talk more about victim impact statements. However, I 
think we should look at some other facts before we get into that 
aspect. Let us look at the judicial review decisions as of mid-1995. 
In total there were 46 judicial reviews. I looked at the record of 
those making application for early release. I am talking about first 
degree murderers. Of the 46 killers who had their sentences 
reduced 11 killed women. Some were their wives. Some were 
acquaintances. Some were female children.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The government talks about what it wants to do when it comes to 
supporting women and giving them opportunity. There is nothing 
wrong with that, but I have to question the government when it 
comes to looking at the cold hard facts.
<P>
	Why would a government want to allow killers who deliberately 
took the lives of someone else to be released back into society? 
They prey on moms, wives and children. As of mid-1995, 11 of the 
46 applied. Another 8 killed police officers. A police officer has a 
significant role in society, as do mothers. As the statement goes, 
the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. Let us think of the 
power of that statement about mothers. It is a powerful statement. 
One day children have significant influence on society.
<P>
	Of the 46 applicants, 11 females were murdered by these killers, 
8 police officers were murdered by these killers and 3 children. The 
applicants had reduced sentences.
<P>
	I would like to have those statistics brought up to date. What is 
the record from mid-1995 to today? I could add one or two more to 
the list who killed police officers and had their sentences reduced. 
How many more women and how many more children were killed? 
The government is intent on letting them out. It could have stopped 
that once and for all by repealing section 745.  Ultimately we 
should be talking about repealing section 745.
<P>
	The statistics send a shiver up my spine, to think this is what 
society is doing. There is no punishment. Speaking of punishment, 
it used to play a very prominent role in the judicial system. It was 
essential. There was a different understanding of what had to 
happen. That different understanding dealt with the view of the 
Liberal thinker of what a man is capable of doing and of what 
would stop him from doing it.
<P>
	The role of government is to protect those who have done good 
in society and to punish those who have done wrong. That is what 
order is all about. It is about punishing those who do wrong to 
correct their behaviour. Only punishment can do that.
<P>
	The model of rehabilitation is struggling. It has fallen into the 
mud. It has failed society. Yet the Liberal mentality of the day 
continues with rehabilitation as the way to correct problems when 
it comes to offenders.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	In 1976 the Liberals abolished capital punishment against the 
wishes of the vast majority of Canadians. I was never consulted or 
asked for my opinion. Nor was anyone in my community whom I 
know of. It was a unilateral action taken on the part of the Liberal 
government to get rid of that section of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	In 1962 the last person was hanged in the country. It was the 
form of capital punishment of the day. In 1976 it was completely 
abolished. Also 1962 was the last time corporal punishment was 
administered. Since 1962 violent crime has increase over 400 per 
cent.
<P>
	Let us look at the big picture because it tells the story. Since 
1962 there has been over a 400 per cent increase in violent crime. I 
do not buy the story-nor do most police officers and others who 
analyse the crime situation-that crime is going down. It is going 
down only in the short term.
<P>
	Since 1962 there has been over a 500 per cent increase in 
property crime. I think 1962 is a very significant date. Not 1976 or 
1984. The last time corporal punishment and capital punishment 
were administered was in 1962. It was ripped away from the 
people. They were never consulted. Since that time we have been 
paying the price. The list of victims increases as time goes on.
<P>
	It is now to the point where our jails are full. Prisoners are being 
turned out quicker than we can put them in. They are being turned 
out without them being rehabilitated. This is a very common 
occurrence. Rehabilitation does not work. This is a deep concern.
<P>
	We heard lately questions being put to the minister about 
ongoing victimization. My colleague from Fraser Valley East has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9614"> 9614 </A></B>
<P>
been very pointed with the Minister of Justice. I am ashamed to say 
the Minister of Justice in his  replies will never address the concern 
about what is happening. We want to stop victimization.
<P>
	Only a small element of criminals involve themselves in this 
kind of activity. It is only 6 per cent to 8 per cent, so let us target the 
8 per cent.
<P>
	I was interested in the statistics and the reaction to the three 
strikes and you are out legislation in California. I have 
communicated a great deal with the gentleman who initiated that 
bill. Two valid strikes and any one criminal offence after that puts 
the criminal away for life. That bill was passed. The citizens of 
California wanted it. They were tired of their sons, daughters, 
moms and dads being shot, mutilated and killed in every fashion. 
They got behind Mr. Reynold as he introduced that citizen's 
initiative. It was passed through their legislature and became law.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	That was three years ago. Since then violent crime has gone 
down. They targeted 6 per cent or 8 per cent of the most violent 
criminals in their society, took them off the street and put them 
away for life. It did not fill their jails up to overflowing. They had 
to build one or two more but it is beginning to show results. It is 
beginning to protect people.
<P>
	We talk about section 745 and wanting to turn killers out. Where 
the justice is in that? It is not there. We argue about how the victim 
impact statement will be presented in the courtroom. It is sad to see 
victims watching their statements being torn apart by a judge and 
judge telling them that they are editorializing, that those sections of 
their statements have to be removed and that they cannot be 
emotional. They want to take emotion out of the whole process.
<P>
	I would be emotional if my wife, my son or my daughter were 
killed. I do not blame them for being emotional. I want them to be 
emotional because it is an emotional situation to have a loved one 
ripped away.
<P>
	We are arguing about the statements when the government 
should be completely removing the section and allowing for the 
total closure on behalf of victims. They should not have to contend 
with another hearing and another hearing and another hearing. It 
would be over. It would be done with.
<P>
	Bill C-17 certainly will go forward. We will support it. We will 
give its provisions the benefit of the doubt and allow the provision 
overlooked by the justice minister to go through. The bill is so 
flawed and so abusive to those who do not deserve to be abused that 
I have a difficult time supporting it. We should be repealing the 
section completely. We should be removing it from the books.
<P>
	I have sat in several hearings to listen to statements given by 
victims. Some cannot even go to court. Some have a difficult time 
going to court so they have the prosecutor or someone else read it. 
The difficulty for me  was to see those victims struggle with that 
and to watch judges tear their statements apart and sanitize the 
whole courtroom with filtered evidence. Reports were submitted 
by so-called experts who could never be questioned or 
cross-examined.
<P>
	I have a parole report in my briefcase which I will not o get into 
right now. It is devastating to see condensed versions of reality or 
the truth. They are paraphrased and placed into a court record with 
hardly any opportunity for questioning or cross-examining. 
So-called experts come up conclusions to justify the existence of 
their testimony to ensure a reduced sentence from the jury. The jury 
sits in a sanitized courtroom. I do not think that is justice at all. The 
truth is not being heard.
<P>
	Again I put on the record that Reform will support the bill 
reluctantly, but our fight to have this section repealed and truth in 
sentencing initiated, that is a sentence delivered is a sentence 
served and life means life, will not rest until such is accomplished.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to speak on the motion to read Bill C-17 a third 
time. During the course of debate on this bill there has been a 
considerable number of subjects discussed which did not 
necessarily relate to the subject matter of the bill. I will restrict my 
comments for the most part to the issues discussed in the bill.
<P>
	Some may remember that Bill C-17 was originally introduced as 
Bill C-118 on December 14, 1995. At that time it was noted that it 
continued the work of Bill C-42, the Criminal Law Amendment 
Act, 1994 which had been adopted the year before. Bill C-42 was 
very well received. Provincial and territorial governments through 
their justice ministers have asked us to get on with producing a 
follow-up bill to continue the reforms and improvements to our 
criminal procedure law which were begun in Bill C-42. I believe 
Bill C-17 does just this. It appears the provinces are appreciative of 
this and are eager to see it passed.
<P>
	When the bill was in committee a letter from the attorney 
general of New Brunswick was tabled. The purpose of the letter 
was to urge the committee members to seize the opportunity to 
make a number of significant improvements to our criminal justice 
system. It is worth referring to this letter more extensively in order 
to show how important our work in Parliament can be to the 
provinces that are responsible for the administration of the criminal 
law.
<P>
	The hon. Paul Duffie, attorney general of New Brunswick, wrote 
to the chair of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs 
on September 17 and indicated that he wished to stress the 
importance of the proposed amendments contained in Bill C-17 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9615"> 9615 </A></B>
<P>
and New  Brunswick's particular interest in a number of its 
provisions.
<P>
	He went on to indicate the following: ``The bill's provisions can 
be broken down into a number of broad categories. The first 
category is those which enhance public confidence in the criminal 
justice system and here I refer to the statutory basis allowing police 
officers to take by warrant handprints, fingerprints and teeth 
impressions from suspects; expanding the release provisions that 
can be imposed by police officers to include such basic 
requirements as abstaining from alcohol or drugs, reporting as 
required and prohibiting the possession of firearms; retaining at the 
option of the crown trial jurisdiction in provincial court so that a 
limited category of offences could be dealt with expeditiously''.
<P>
	The letter identified a second category of provisions, those 
intended to make the Criminal Code more effective and efficient. 
Mr. Duffie then identified provisions aimed at broadening the 
scope of prehearing conferences, which will give judges more 
leeway to deal with preliminary issues, thereby narrowing the 
number of issues at trial and reducing trial time; replacing jurors 
who are unable to perform their duties, eliminating delays which 
can occur by restarting the trial; providing a precondition for the 
court appointment of counsel so there is a means test imposed, 
ensuring that the public purse is used to only assist those who 
cannot legitimately afford counsel.
<P>
	With regard to the third category mentioned in the provisions 
intended to fill perceived gaps in the Criminal Code, he referred to 
the need for an offence for those accused who failed to comply with 
release conditions imposed by a police officer and those who make 
unauthorized use of credit card data, those who forge or falsify 
credit cards, those who possess a device for unlawfully obtaining 
computer devices and those who participate along with the driver 
in the theft of a vehicle for joy riding.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	As a fourth category, the attorney general of New Brunswick 
identified those provisions intended to achieve compliance with 
court decisions. He referred to the decisions of the Supreme Court 
of Canada in which the court interpreted the drinking and driving 
law so that the statutory presumption on blood alcohol has become 
less effective in contested cases, as the crown is currently obliged 
to call expert evidence to extrapolate the reading back to the time 
of driving and has determined that an arrested accused who is 
detained by police pending a court appearance must be brought 
before a judge within 24 hours of arrest.
<P>
	Provisions in this bill will address these problems. He noted, in 
particular, that the technologically amendments in Bill C-17 would 
allow the provinces to use modern communication methods to 
conduct remote appearances,  using one or two judges to cover the 
province, thereby greatly reducing the number of weekend courts 
which, with their limited human resources, are taking their toll on 
all of the participants. It is also quite costly to set up weekend 
courts in each region of the provinces.
<P>
	The fifth category identified by the attorney general of New 
Brunswick contained provisions aimed at advances in technology 
to modernize procedures. He then referred to those provisions that 
would eliminate the need for a personal appearance in a court by 
police officers and accused persons for various administrative 
matters at various stages of the court process, including at the bail 
hearing, at the preliminary hearing and at the trial. Those 
provisions would enable investigators to make effective use of the 
new DNA warrant and general warrant procedures in major crime 
investigations by applying for and obtaining warrants using 
modern communication methods.
<P>
	The sixth and final category includes provisions which try to 
improve evidentiary procedures. He mentioned the provision that 
would eliminate the necessity of calling witnesses to establish 
uncontested elements of certain events by providing affidavit 
evidence and the provisions that would allow the presentation of 
expert evidence through written reports, unless otherwise directed 
by the court.
<P>
	The attorney general concluded by noting that there are many 
more provisions contained in this bill, all of which are intended to 
improve the workings of the criminal law of Canada. He stated that 
there is a window of opportunity for legislators, after due 
consideration and informed debate, to enact these measures which, 
in his view, will enhance criminal law enforcement, facilitate court 
proceedings, modernize the provisions of the Criminal Code and 
enhance public confidence in our justice system.
<P>
	It is clear that this bill is important for the territories and the 
provinces. Indeed it is a good example of co-operative federalism 
in an important area where the federal government has the 
responsibility to enact criminal law and the provinces have the 
responsibility to administer it. I urge that the bill be passed as 
quickly as possible.
<P>
	There were a couple of amendments which were put forward by 
the government for the purposes of clarifying existing legislation.
<P>
	First, Bill C-17 was amended to change paragraph 742.1(b) of 
the Criminal Code by making it explicit that in addition to the 
judge being of the view that serving the sentence in the community 
would not endanger the community, which was in the provisions 
for conditional sentencing, the sentence also had to be consistent 
with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out 
in sections 718 to 718.2. Such principles include the principle of 
denunciation, deterrence and the protection of the community. 
While implicit before, it was felt that  it was important to make the 
application of those principles very explicit.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	Over the past several months it has been the practice of the 
Reform Party to refer to specific cases which may be decided 
before the courts which in the view of the Reform Party are

<P>
incorrect, as is the case when every new piece of legislation is 
introduced.
<P>
	Court decisions, provincial or Queen's bench or supreme court, 
differ from one another. The vast majority of the cases are decided 
correctly but there are exceptional cases where the public may be 
of the view that the case was incorrectly decided or the crown was 
of that view. Then the crown seeks an appeal of those decisions, 
and the defence can also appeal, when it is of the opinion that the 
decision is incorrect.
<P>
	The appeal then goes to the court of appeal then to the supreme 
court and guidelines for the use of such sections are set out and are 
considered and delineated carefully. As the judicial process carries 
on, there is a clarification and improvement in the setting out of 
conditions under which conditional sentencing will operate. Each 
time there is a court decision which indicates that certain 
considerations are appropriate or if there is disagreement it is 
subject to appeal and improvement by the court superior to the one 
in which the decision was made.
<P>
	It is probably not appropriate to simply take exceptional cases 
and make them the rule. Out of the 1000 cases that are decided, 999 
are decided in an appropriate manner and are never mentioned. But 
the one that may not happen to be decided in that fashion is the one 
the Reform Party raises in an attempt to cast the whole justice 
system into disrepute.
<P>
	With respect to this amendment, certainly conditional sentencing 
as it only applies to those criminal activities for which a sentence is 
two years or less, people are incarcerated by provincial 
governments. Because this is an administration of a justice issue, 
all the provinces were consulted, regardless of political stripe. 
While there may well have been some differences as to details, a 
broad consensus certainly existed that a change of this nature 
needed to be made. Certainly those familiar with the legal system 
see the jails of the land filled with people who are dangerous but 
also those who posed no danger to the community, who did not 
commit violent crimes. It was the desire of the provinces and the 
federal government to ensure that when people commit violent 
crimes there ought to be room in correctional facilities for them 
and that the space ought not to be taken up by people who would 
not pose a risk to society.
<P>
	It is a mechanism of the conditional sentence that rather than 
allowing violent offenders to enter the jail and then days later 
because of lack of space being removed, it allows for 
non-dangerous offenders, people  who have not committed violent 
crimes, to serve their sentence in the communities and more space 
will be freed up for those violent offenders, those who commit 
abhorrent crimes within the community. Therefore the community 
will be even more properly protected.
<P>
	I would suggest that the conditional sentence is one mechanism 
that allows greater safety in communities by ensuring that for
<P>
people who commit violent crimes there will be room in our 
correctional facilities, thus ensuring they are there for an 
appropriate length of time.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	The second amendment is with respect to victim impact 
statements and section 745 hearings. When Bill C-41 was 
introduced it was silent on when the victim impact statement 
provisions would become effective. This amendment merely seeks 
to clarify that and make certain that victim impact statements, if 
the victim wishes to make one, must be accepted by the court after 
the passage of this bill. That very briefly sums up the provisions of 
Bill C-17 and the amendments.
<P>
	I want to make one more comment. I noted with interest when 
the hon. member from Calgary, the critic for the solicitor general, 
indicated that since California put in a three strike law the crime 
rate has gone done. He used that as an argument to suggest that if 
the crime rate is going down what is being done in California must 
be working and we should do it here.
<P>
	I would like to inform the hon. member that over the last four 
years the crime rate in Canada has gone down, due largely in part to 
a broad range of initiatives. First, the initiatives taken by the 
government to toughen and strengthen the Young Offenders Act, 
the criminal law and other related criminal statutes. More 
amendments and more changes to improve and toughen the 
criminal law have been made by this government than had been 
made in the history of this nation. That is certainly part of the 
reason.
<P>
	Another part is that the government has worked hard to increase 
jobs and economic opportunities for people. That is a very 
important factor in reducing the crime rate. As well, the 
government has introduced many important initiatives on the social 
front to ensure social justice. That too is of importance in reducing 
the crime rate; removing the underlying causes for crime.
<P>
	I would like to wrap up and thank the hon. members for hearing 
me these few minutes on this bill. I hope this bill will receive 
prompt attention, will be quickly passed and that it will receive 
expedient and quick consideration by the other place so it can be 
brought into force as soon as possible for the benefit of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have some questions for the hon. parliamentary secretary to the 
justice minister.
<P>
	First, has the justice department or the member ever researched 
the three strikes legislation in California? I point out to the member 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9617"> 9617 </A></B>
<P>
that I have been doing that on a regular basis for approximately one 
year. I have received interesting statistics on what is happening.
<P>
	I am going to dispel one statement that is often used on the 
government side in reference to the three strikes legislation. It 
targets 6, 7 or 8 per cent of the criminal element. The most violent, 
habitual, intrusive, abusive type of people are by far mostly the 
male population. What it spells out is this. An individual commits 
an offence, he is charged and he is sent away. He serves the major 
part of his sentence. The second time he offends, it is spelled out to 
him very clearly that if he messes up with another violent offence, 
he will serve an even greater portion of his sentence, a longer one.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	If that individual commits any crime again whatsoever, even 
stealing a pizza, as is often said, because he has had two violent 
offences against him, he will be put away for life.
<P>
	In effect, for the offender who commits these violent acts, who 
has a greater propensity to commit a violent act such as taking 
someone's life, there is the death penalty in the state of California.
<P>
	The research put forward by the Department of Justice and those 
who initiated this bill was quite substantive. It brought about this 
piece of legislation. It is targeting. It is effective. Did he examine 
any data or research to see how and why the department arrived at 
what it did? Maybe it is in the state of California, but also here 
sentences have been reduced.
<P>
	This omnibus bill, Bill C-17, is alleged to modernize the law and 
streamline court proceedings. It quickly points out that the 
maximum sentences for very serious criminal activity, including 
unlawful confinement which is a crime against a person, that the 
maximum sentence be reduced.
<P>
	I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice to justify why those sentences were reduced and to produce 
the facts that justify this legislation in its total form. Lay it on the 
table here. Can the parliamentary secretary address that point?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite has raised 
a number of points in his questions. He indicated that he 
investigated the three strikes rule in California. After someone has 
committed two violent offences-I do not know what the definition 
of violent is, perhaps two common assaults-and then afterward 
stole a pizza, he should be put in jail for life.
<P>
	I am unclear what the hon. member means by violent offence. 
Certainly he is not suggesting that, in the case I mentioned in which 
someone brushes against someone else, committing common 
assault twice and then stealing a pizza, he should go to jail. That 
would be absurd.
<P>
	The hon. member said that he researched a number of interesting 
techniques of crime prevention. There is the three strikes rule, 
caning in Singapore as well as a number of other issues. The 
member makes the statement that because the crime rate is going 
down in California with its three strikes rule, somehow it alone is 
responsible for the reduction in crime rate.
<P>
	We have taken a very multi-pronged approach, as I indicated in 
my speech, to prevent crime. There is no simple solution to the 
problem of crime but if the hon. member's logic applies, then we 
are doing the right thing. The crime rate is going down here also.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have another question for the 
member. I do not think the parliamentary secretary is getting the 
point of my question.
<P>
	I asked him to lay on the table in this House the justification for 
reducing maximum sentences as opposed to increasing them.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	The Liberal government has a tendency to constantly want to 
trivialize some of the more serious Criminal Code charges and 
there are more than three examples. Dual procedure offences can 
be handled as indictable or as summary convictions. However, the 
parliamentary secretary does not want to answer that question.
<P>
	Where are the facts for bringing about any changes in the law 
and placing it before Parliament and passing it? I do not see any of 
that information flowing from the government side, apart from the 
fact that somebody in the legal community wants it this way or 
there is a charter argument that states we cannot do it that way any 
more. That is strictly an opinion that is offered too often by the 
justice department.
<P>
	I want to see the facts for justifying a reduction in those 
maximum sentences.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to the changes 
introduced in the bill that deal with dual procedure offences, if the 
court decisions over the past number of years are looked at, we get 
an indication of what the judges are doing with respect to various 
types of offences.
<P>
	All that we are trying to do, and something the provinces want to 
see because it aids the efficiency of the legal system, is to allow 
that where the cases are not so serious to give the provinces 
discretion to proceed at a more efficient level in court. Where the 
case is more serious, the result would be a more serious criminal 
sanction. Therefore, what it is doing is simply allowing more 
flexibility for the provinces. In more serious cases the accused will 
still be prosecuted in a serious, tough fashion with serious 
consequences if a conviction is rendered.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9618"> 9618 </A></B>
<P>
	At the same time, in very minor cases, it would allow them to 
be handled in accordance with the type of issue that is a stake. 
That is simply reality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. 
parliamentary secretary keeps talking he is going to convince me to 
vote against this bill. I will not because I see the need for some 
aspects of the bill.
<P>
	However, the penalties imposed by the courts are no justification 
for reducing the penalties as prescribed by law. If that is the case 
then what do we do with this new conditional sentencing law that 
allows violent offenders to walk free? It is the courts that render 
those sentences, only because the law has been passed to allow 
them to do that.
<P>
	Surely we cannot justify the reduction of penalties simply 
because some judges deem that a rapist should walk free and that 
we should reduce the penalty-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary has 
about 30 seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect, I dealt with that in the 
body of my speech. I indicated that we are simply allowing that 
where there is a serious offence it will continue to be dealt with 
seriously. Where it is not so serious it will be dealt with in a more 
summary fashion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted that Bill C-17 was tabled or rather brought 
back to the House this week. As you know, the official opposition 
had to approach the federal Minister of Justice on several occasions 
until he finally agreed to introduce Bill C-17 in the House, a bill 
which was and still is anxiously awaited by practically all the 
provinces, since they are responsible for the administration of 
justice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Lucky we were there.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> As my colleague just said, lucky the Bloc 
Quebecois was here to keep reminding the Minister of Justice of 
Quebec's biding interest in Bill C-17.
<P>
	You will recall that on Monday, April 7, the Bloc Quebecois 
practically had to threaten the government opposite with 
amendments that would add provisions concerning anti-biker 
legislation before the government suddenly decided to bring back 
Bill C-17.
<P>
	I think this was another important gain for the Bloc, the way the 
minister decided to act on Bill C-17 by bringing it back to the 
House.
<P>
	Again, we have always been very consistent in our position on 
Bill C-17, in other words, we have always said yes, it is a good bill. 
What the Minister of Justice proposes in Bill C-17 is an 
improvement. The Bloc Quebecois is prepared to support the 
government 100 per cent on this bill, but considering recent events 
in  Quebec, he should take advantage of this opportunity to amend 
this bill by including, as requested by Quebec, a provision that 
would open the way to legislation or provisions dealing with bikers 
and organized crime.
<P>
	The government has often told us to go to Quebec City, go to 
headquarters and see our former leader. Get him to agree, and then 
come back, and more of the same. As far as criminal law is 
concerned and Quebec's right to have its own anti-biker legislation 
and even regarding the most far-reaching provisions in Bill C-17, 
the Bloc and the Parti québécois are definitely on the same wave 
length. The minister was forced to admit that sovereignists are 
unanimous about the need for this kind of legislation. He had to do 
something to make up for the mistakes he has made in this area.
<P>
	So he brought back Bill C-17. The government even proposed 
amendments at a stage when it does not usually do so. We gave our 
unanimous consent. Our co-operation with the government was 
exemplary. We have tried to make this bill as good as it could 
possibly be, with some very useful amendments so the police will 
be able to do their job. And I think Bill C-17 will provide the police 
with additional tools so they can deal with at least part of the 
problem of crime in this country.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has repeatedly asked the minister how he 
intended to deal with crime. He kept saying: ``Now listen, Bill C-17 
is going to deal with all this. We will pass Bill C-17 in the House, 
which will introduce various changes, and the problem will be 
solved''. So why has Bill C-17 yet to pass third reading, although it 
was tabled on March 8, 1996, when it passed first reading, and 
today is April 11, 1997, more than a year later?
<P>
	However, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice 
recalled that some bills were tabled in 1994 and 1995. So they go 
back even further than March 1996. I wonder. Bill C-17 is 
supposed to be the answer to all our problems with crime. Because 
of C-17, we do not have to pursue legislation we have been 
demanding for months and even years-anti-biker legislation-to 
deal with the majority of criminal offenses. So why did the 
minister, who has been responsible for these matters since 1994, 
not table it so it could be passed?
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Allow me to make a short digression. The biker war is currently 
an issue, but you will remember that, as early as 1982, the 
municipality of Tracy, in Quebec, asked for a special law to deal 
with the problem. The mayor of Sorel-Tracy asked for such a 
measure, because a bunker was being built by the Hell's Angels.
<P>
	So, this problem has been with us for a long time. Now, the 
parliamentary secretary is reminding us that the bill, which the 
minister has had in his hands since 1994, has yet to be adopted.
<P>
	If the minister had had any political will at all, and a good dose 
of humility to admit his mistake regarding the  anti-biker legisla-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9619"> 9619 </A></B>
<P>
tion that is being asked of him, he could have introduced the 
necessary amendments and enlisted the same degree of 
co-operation that he received for his own amendments, on Monday. 
The minister could have enlisted the participation and co-operation 
of the Bloc Quebecois and, I am convinced, of the third party, since 
the result would have been a more comprehensive bill.
<P>
	But the Bloc Quebecois will show magnanimity. We will once 
again give the minister a chance, because he promised us that 
legislation would be introduced next week. We are anxiously 
waiting for this legislation, but with an open mind. I hope the 
minister will follow up on our representations, on those of a large 
number of Quebec municipalities, and on those of Quebec's 
Minister of Justice, Mr. Bégin, and Minister of Public Security, Mr. 
Perreault.
<P>
	In events surrounding the biker war and Bill C-17, I was 
somewhat surprised to see in the newspapers that the federal justice 
minister was accusing his provincial counterpart, Mr. Bégin, of 
being responsible for the fact that Bill C-17 had still not been 
passed. The federal minister said: ``Bill C-17 could have been 
passed, but Mr. Bégin, the Quebec justice minister, is partly to 
blame for the fact that it was not''.
<P>
	I think it important that I mention to the House a letter, just to 
show that sometimes the Liberal government opposite puts out 
misinformation. On July 9, 1996, Quebec's deputy justice minister 
and deputy attorney general, Michel Bouchard, wrote to George 
Thomson, deputy minister and deputy attorney general of the 
federal justice department, to express his strong interest in seeing 
Bill C-17 passed as quickly as possible.
<P>
	I know that earlier the parliamentary secretary cited a letter from 
New Brunswick's justice minister, Paul Duffy. In fact, New 
Brunswick has followed this issue with a great deal of interest, for 
essentially the same reasons as Quebec, but I find it strange, unless 
I missed something because I had to step out to make a phone call, 
that I did not hear the parliamentary secretary mention Michel 
Bouchard, although Mr. Bouchard wrote a very interesting letter to 
the deputy minister of the federal justice department on July 9, 
1996.
<P>
	I will read the first paragraph, because I know it sums up 
Quebec's position. It says: ``Bill C-17, introduced in the House of 
Commons on March 8, 1996, contains many criminal amendments 
that we have been calling for for several years now and that have 
been approved by the conference to harmonize legislation''.
<P>
	A little further on, it reads: ``The introduction of these new 
measures alone will, in the short term, save us millions of dollars, a 
not insignificant amount in the context of the budgetary constraint 
facing us all. It will therefore come as no surprise that we were 
extremely disappointed to learn that passage of this omnibus bill, 
which was already postponed until last spring, has again been 
postponed''.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	He went on: ``You will therefore understand our great desire to 
see Bill C-17 among the bills the federal justice minister is 
determined to move on as quickly as possible''.
<P>
	This letter is dated July 9, 1996. Nobody should be blaming the 
provincial justice minister, Mr. Bégin, for the delay in passing this 
bill. I think that all provincial attorneys general were in agreement 
that Bill C-17 should be passed as speedily as possible, given 
certain factors that I will mention in a few minutes. Why are these 
attorneys general in Canada and in Quebec in favour of Bill C-17? 
Why is the Bloc Quebecois in favour of this bill? Because it 
contains some very important elements that are necessary to update 
the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I will presently discuss the main components of this bill. The 
third party in the House probably would have liked to see a much 
harder line in this bill on parole, for instance, and the repeal of 
section 745, but I can assure you we do not share the position of the 
Reform Party on this part of the Criminal Code. I think the minister 
has taken a major step forward, but, as I will explain later on, he 
should have done more.
<P>
	Here are some of the main areas affected by Bill C-17. The bill 
proposes a series of changes to deal more effectively with the 
proceeds of crime. Some of these changes will help the police to 
carry out seizures, including the money that makes the world of 
organized crime go round. In politics, money makes the world go 
round; the same is true of organized crime. I think we must have all 
the tools we need to seek out the proceeds of crime.
<P>
	If I may digress for a moment, this is what Mr. Bégin made very 
clear in a proposal that was rejected out of hand by the Minister of 
Justice on Monday, a proposal that favoured anti-biker legislation, 
with provisions that would help the police seize their money, their 
property, their bunkers, their armoured cars and their big 
limousines. The bill will make all this possible. I think that by 
cutting off their livelihood, it will be possible to get rid of the 
organized crime element. I just wanted to say that in passing.
<P>
	As for other aspects of this bill, there were several changes with 
respect to computer-assisted crime, counterfeiting and the 
fraudulent use of credit cards. I think we have to move with the 
times. The Criminal Code goes back many years and has to be 
updated regularly. That is the purpose of Bill C-17. We certainly 
had no objection to updating the Criminal Code.
<P>
	There are also provisions to deal more severely with driving 
under the influence. Here again, I think that considering certain 
court decisions, it was necessary to amend the Criminal Code in 
this respect.
<P>
	There are also provisions-and this is very important as far as 
the provinces are concerned-that will save  money while helping 
counsel with court appearances. For instance, there are provisions 
for videoconferencing and the issuing of warrants by means of 
modern communications. Here again no one would have thought of 
this ten years ago, but, today, with informatics and the whole field 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9620"> 9620 </A></B>
<P>
of telecommunications, things like remote appearances are 
possible so as to save money for the provinces, which administer 
justice. All that is in Bill C-17.
<P>
	Clearly we support these provisions, but, once again, I think 
things could have gone further, as for example with the provisions 
on money laundering, because this is glossed over somewhat. 
Canada, let us face it, is the best country for money laundering. The 
Liberals opposite often boast that Canada is the finest country in 
the world, but in this finest country in the world, we annually 
launder, according to estimates, between $20 billion and $90 
billion.
<P>
	The police estimate it as follows: only some 10 per cent of drugs 
are seized annually. The seizures are worth between $1.5 billion 
and $4.5 billion a year. A quick calculation reveals that 100 per 
cent would be over $20 billion.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board is looking at me with great 
interest. I am sure he sees a lot of numbers, but he has only to 
consult the Canadian crime service and the RCMP for confirmation 
of my figures.
<P>
	Bill C-17 should contain provisions to reinforce the whole 
matter of money laundering to further prevent it and to better equip 
the police so Canada loses its title.
<P>
	I will conclude on this point. The title is awarded by the great 
jurists of the world and by the Americans annually in September, 
because American inquiries and commissions look into the matter. 
Every year, the Canadian government is encouraged to strengthen 
its legislation to prohibit this activity because of the border 
between Canada and the United States.
<P>
	I could go on with my speech, but I see my time has run out.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should make all Crown 
corporations subject to the Privacy Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am happy to rise today to speak to this 
motion of mine, which was selected as a votable item by the 
parliamentary committee responsible. I would like to thank the 
committee and particularly the member for Bellechasse, who made 
it possible for us to vote on this motion.
<P>
	When first elected in 1993, I became the Bloc Quebecois' critic 
on Canada Post. During the first few weeks, I asked this Crown 
corporation for some information that would have helped us 
evaluate its efficiency.
<P>
	We all know that, since then, several allegations have been made 
as to whether or not that corporation was properly managed. I 
cannot come to a conclusion even today because we never had 
access to the information. We might have had the opportunity to 
examine all relevant documents if only that corporation had come 
under the Privacy Act and possibly the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	Therefore, I move this motion today in order to remedy an 
absurd situation. Some ministers are responsible for Crown 
corporations and they should reply to questions in the House about 
those corporations.  At the same time, these corporations do not 
have to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9621"> 9621 </A></B>
<P>
provide the information that would be relevant to the decisions 
made by parliamentarians. This situation is rather absurd, and I 
think it would be nice if it could be solved. We cannot assume that 
illegal and inappropriate actions are taking place, but justice must 
be seen to be done.
<P>
	When a minister is put in charge of a Crown corporation, it 
means that people who have questions to ask, parliamentarians and 
citizens who need information and those on whom this corporation 
holds personal information can ensure that it is properly managed 
and that data banks will not be shared between corporations 
without their having a say in the matter.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	We are talking about personal information. Is the personal 
information held in these Crown corporations' data banks well 
protected? Is it not sometimes shared with other organizations for 
money? Is the Crown corporation not sometimes used as a straw 
man in order to get information that would otherwise not be 
available to the department? We may ask these questions and 
others as well.
<P>
	I would like to list a number of organizations that are not covered 
by the Access to Information Act: the Canadian Wheat Board, 
Atomic Energy of Canada, Petro-Canada, Canada Post, the Export 
Development Corporation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 
and VIA Rail.
<P>
	We see that all these organizations have an impact on the lives of 
Canadians and Quebecers, particularly when it comes to the 
Canadian Wheat Board and the issues that were raised recently 
about its management. When we think about Petro-Canada, which 
is a Crown corporation competing with the private sector, is there 
not a double standard if the corporation will now be able to act like 
a private corporation, but with the advantages provided to a Crown 
corporation? Some things have yet to be clarified in this regard. I 
think my motion would improve the situation.
<P>
	Also, for your information, let us review the mandate of the 
privacy commissioner and see how all public corporations could be 
subject to the Privacy Act. The privacy commissioner has the 
mandate to review each and every complaint about a federal 
institution that has not adequately processed the request made by 
an individual who wanted to review his or her personal files or that 
has collected, used, released or eliminated personal information in 
an illegal fashion.
<P>
	Right now, some crown corporations do not have to meet these 
criteria. Complaints can be made against them, because an 
individual has been unable to review his or her personal files or 
because personal information has been collected, used, released or 
eliminated and the individual is left without any recourse. The 
purpose of  my motion is to provide that individual with some 
recourse, because if an institution is considered to be a public 
corporation, if it is accountable to Parliament, if it has to submit 
reports to Parliament, then it is quite normal that these corporations 
be treated the same way as our departments.
<P>
	We cannot think, on the one hand, that public institutions are 
sometimes less efficient than crown corporations could be if, on the 
other hand, we do not subject them to the same requirements. On 
this issue, our society needs to make some progress, especially 
since we live at a time where information exchange is now made 
possible thanks to all the new technology.
<P>
	We need to ensure our citizens that they will be treated as fairly 
as possible and that they will be able to get the information that a 
particular corporation has collected about them. Did the 
corporation have the right to have this information? Is it handling 
that information appropriately and does it not transmit it to other 
organizations that do not have a right to have them?
<P>
	Taking into account how important information has become in 
our society-information is power, as we say-and how important 
privacy is for us, there is a void that my motion seeks to fill.
<P>
	It is also possible that the motion can be improved, in that it 
would be interesting if this matter was also covered by the Access 
To Information Act. Passed in 1983, this legislation gives 
Canadians the general right to access information detained by 
federal institutions, as we said earlier for the protection of personal 
information. There is also an Information Commissioner who 
investigates complaints.
<P>
	The Commissioner sees to it that rights are protected and 
convinces public institutions to adopt information management 
practices that are in line with the Access to Information Act. Thus 
we must ensure that there is a watchdog and that he has real powers 
to act appropriately and have the necessary influence. He can even 
refer to the federal court any problem in the interpretation of the 
law that require its attention.
<P>
	All those who think that this will create insuperable difficulties 
should remember that access rights are not absolute rights. They 
are subject to specific exceptions, limited exceptions, exceptions 
that did not prevent departments from working properly.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	There has been a shift toward an increase in efficiency within 
departments and crown corporations, and I agree with that, but we 
must be careful that this shift does not result in a corporation acting 
as if it were a private corporation that is not accountable to the 
people.
<P>
	I think it is necessary to ensure that all crown corporations are 
subject to the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act. Let 
us take, for example, the  Export Development Corporation, which 
is not covered. I was reading all kinds of things this week about 
exports. For example, I heard that, when a product such as a 
Japanese car arrives in British Columbia, it is considered as a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9622"> 9622 </A></B>
<P>
product imported by that province even though it can be used 
anywhere in Canada.
<P>
	When we hear that kind of information that seems absurd, we 
should be able to obtain the available data and analyze it to see if 
what we heard is true. Let us not forget that all that money comes 
from the public purse, that it is the taxpayers' money.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I hope to have the support of the members 
of all parties in the House so that we can fill what I would call a gap 
in our privacy and access to information legislation. I hope all 
members of the House will agree on this and we will be able to 
agree to this motion before the next federal election.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address the motion by the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	Motion No. 260 proposes to include all crown corporations 
under the jurisdiction of the Privacy Act. I put forward a very 
similar motion to this in the last session with respect to crown 
corporations under the Access to Information Act. This one is on 
the Privacy Act. It is very similar.
<P>
	The right to privacy is a significant issue and important to many 
Canadians. Privacy is the right to enjoy private space, to conduct 
private communications, to be free from surveillance and to respect 
the sanctity of one's body. Privacy is a basic human value that 
Canadians hold as a right central to their freedoms and sense of 
human dignity and autonomy. Most Canadians believe they should 
have the right to control their personal information and to choose to 
remain anonymous if they should so wish.
<P>
	Our privacy rights come from many sources. They are 
entrenched in international law, constitutional law, federal and 
provincial legislation, professional codes and guidelines. All the 
largest provinces, including Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, 
have provincial privacy acts and freedom of information acts
<P>
	The Privacy Act took effect July 1, 1983 and replaced some 
limited personal information rights set out in part IV of the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. These rights were expanded in the 
Privacy Act to deal with the growing impact of computers on 
government record keeping. The act increases the transparency and 
accountability of the process and gives Canadians greater 
individual control over their personal data in the government data 
banks.
<P>
	In its day to day operations, federal government departments and 
agencies collect personal information from almost all Canadians. 
The Privacy Act gives  Canadian citizens and people present in 
Canada the right to have access to information that is held about 
them by the federal government. It also protects against 
unauthorized disclosure of personal information.
<P>
	In addition, it strictly controls how the government will collect, 
use, store, disclose and dispose of any personal information. The 
act gives Canadians the right to examine information about them 
that is held by 110 federal departments and agencies subject to 
some specific exceptions. Individuals may request to have any 
errors corrected and if the request is refused individuals may 
require that a notation be attached to the information describing 
any corrections requested but not made.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	According to the act the government can only disclose personal 
information to someone else with consent or when one or more of 
the criteria in the Privacy Act are met such as to comply with a 
subpoena. The act also establishes an information code to regulate 
government handling of personal records.
<P>
	Clearly standards for the use of personal information must be 
imposed on all federal departments, agencies and crown 
corporations. This is basic to the principle of responsible 
government that Reform upholds.
<P>
	However there are many problems with the Privacy Act both 
with its enforcement and its abuse that must be addressed. Our 
rights under the Privacy Act are meaningless unless there are 
enforcement measures to ensure that the violation of these rights 
are deterred.
<P>
	However, as it stands, there are no enforcement measures built 
into the act which means clearly the act is not as effective as it 
should be. Our privacy rights can be abused and there is nothing to 
prevent it.
<P>
	A clear example of this point was recently reported in the 
newspapers when the Prime Minister's friend and political 
appointee, Bob Fowler, broke the Privacy Act. Bob Fowler 
improperly issued documents in an attempt to destroy the 
reputation of Colonel Michael Drapeau. Fowler sent poison pen 
letters about Colonel Drapeau to CSIS, the Department of Justice 
and the Department of National Revenue. These letters clearly 
broke the Privacy Act.
<P>
	The privacy commissioner looked at the case. When he 
confirmed that in fact Bob Fowler had broken the Privacy Act what 
happened? Nothing happened because Bob Fowler is a friend of the 
Prime Minister and there is nothing in the Privacy Act to enforce its 
provisions. This incident clearly illustrates the ineptness of the 
Privacy Act. It is not working.
<P>
	The Privacy Commissioner of Canada may investigate 
complaints about violations of the Privacy Act by government 
institutions. Yet when the commissioner finds a breach of the act, 
as he did with Bob Fowler, he can only recommend changes to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9623"> 9623 </A></B>
<P>
government and  bring to public scrutiny institutions that do not 
accept the instructions.
<P>
	The provincial privacy acts in Quebec and Ontario, on the other 
hand, contain enforcement provisions which allow their privacy 
commissioners to make orders. These provincial acts and their 
effectiveness should be examined by the government to make our 
federal act more effective.
<P>
	Despite the ineffectiveness of our federal Privacy Act, the main 
concern which I share with many Canadians is the abuse of the 
Privacy Act by government and its departments. The privacy and 
access to information acts work hand in hand. One is to protect 
information and the other is to ensure that information is open and 
available. There must be a balance between privacy protection and 
freedom of information.
<P>
	Canadians have a right to see government files. At the same time 
they have a right to protection of personal information. Yet time 
and again the Privacy Act has been used to prevent individuals 
from accessing information that should be public.
<P>
	The information commissioner has noted many problems and 
abuses of both the privacy and the access to information acts in his 
1994-95 annual report. According to the information 
commissioner, the Privacy Act is used by the government as 
``justification for keeping secret embarrassing details about misuse 
of public funds or position''.
<P>
	The information commissioner also notes that ``officials in the 
system have sometimes sought to protect the privacy of their 
colleagues by withholding the portions of records and reports 
which questioned their actions or competence''.
<P>
	The commissioner also says that ``such a selective and 
seemingly self-serving application of privacy rights in the 
corrections and parole systems increases the cynicism of the news 
media and Canadians about the value of the right to privacy''.
<P>
	One example he gives, which I support wholeheartedly, is the 
government's refusal to disclose the names of former MPs in 
receipt of pensions. The government defended this decision by 
citing protection of privacy.
<P>
	At present the Red Cross is fighting the Krever report and wants 
to go to the Supreme Court of Canada rather than have any of its 
members publicly named for their role in this scandal. In our 
criminal justice system we are also faced with the need to balance 
the public right to know how the corrections and parole system are 
working on the one side with offenders privacy rights on the other.
<P>
	The right to information should be a fundamental block of 
democracy. There should be a spirit of openness and honesty 
practised by the government, not deceit and  cover-up as we 
witnessed in the Krever and Somalia scandals the government 
continues to cover up. The destruction, withholding and disguising 
of information have become an everyday part of the government.
<P>
	The government has an elaborate and sophisticated early 
warning alerting system that warns departments and ministers of 
requests under the Access to Information Act and that damages the 
public right to know about government.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	Several pre-release administrative practices assist the 
government in monitoring, manipulating, delaying and holding 
back the release of information to the public. Clearly the system 
has been abused and exploited to the extent that Canadians no 
longer trust the integrity of their government. There is no question 
this has to change.
<P>
	Many issues need to be addressed regarding the Privacy Act. It is 
important all government agencies be covered under the act. At the 
same time it is vital that the abuses of the act be brought under 
control. The Privacy Act must be a tool of individual protection, 
not an agency of political cover-up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have before us today a motion asking the government to make all 
crown corporations subject to the Privacy Act.
<P>
	While the motion is very specific it also addresses a much larger 
issue which has gained a new sense of urgency: the fact that 
Canadians feel they are losing control over their information or that 
they have been subjected to new invasions of privacy.
<P>
	A recent survey suggests a great majority of Canadians are 
concerned about their privacy. This is hardly surprising. Personal 
information has become a valuable commodity in the marketplace. 
New technologies are making it possible to do widespread data 
matching and to electronically capture a person's profile for 
purposes of target marketing or other uses.
<P>
	Without the consent of the individual, downstream use of 
personal information by third parties means the individual has lost 
control of his privacy and his personality. Not only that, but 
because of the unregulated exchange of personal information 
without the consent or even the knowledge of the concerned 
individual, financial and other decisions that have great 
implications on the individual's life may be based on inaccurate 
information.
<P>
	Canadians are thus increasingly concerned that technology is 
threatening their privacy at home, on the street and in the 
workplace. Video surveillance in the street, workplace monitoring 
including interception of E-mail and voice messages, personality 
profiling aids,  drug testing for employment screening, photo radar 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9624"> 9624 </A></B>
<P>
and genetic testing are some of the examples of the threats to 
privacy created by new technologies.
<P>
	New technological advances that promote efficiency and less 
costly flow of information also carry with them great dangers to the 
protection of individual privacy. As technology is making it easier 
to gather, manipulate and transmit personal information all over the 
world without individuals even knowing it is happening, concerns 
are growing that individuals could lose control over their 
information or be subjected to new invasions of privacy.
<P>
	These considerations have led the Standing Committee on 
Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons to conduct a 
study of these issues. We are looking forward to its comments and 
recommendations.
<P>
	Canadians view privacy as a fundamental right, and rightly so. 
We should not lose sight of the fact that the right to privacy is based 
not only on respect for an individual's anonymity and privacy but 
on his or her autonomy. The right of privacy is therefore not simply 
an individual right to be exercised in opposition to some larger 
public interest to make the operations of governments and 
businesses more efficient, less expensive and less subject to fraud. 
It should also be considered as an important social tool essential to 
the maintenance of a free society.
<P>
	If citizens lose the basic individual autonomy provided them by 
the right of privacy they will not be able to make their own 
contribution to a free society. A free society cannot exist solely on 
values such as efficiency and attention to the bottom line. Mutual 
respect and personal autonomy, two values promoted by the right to 
privacy, are essential ingredients to a free society that must always 
be nurtured and protected.
<P>
	The protection of personal information can no longer depend on 
whether that data is held by a public or private institution. This 
does not mean that rules governing the collection, use, 
communication and disposal of personal information need to be 
exactly the same for every individual and organization, but it 
means that it should be based on a common set of principles. It 
does mean that personal information held in the private sector 
should be protected by law.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	What are the implications of the motion which is before us 
today? The Privacy Act governs the collection, retention and 
disposal of personal information by government institutions. It also 
limits the use government institutions may make of personal 
information and under what circumstances it can be disclosed to 
another government institution or to a third party. In brief, 
government institutions may only collect personal information 
defined as information about an identifiable individual that is 
recorded in any form that they need for one of their programs or 
activities. In most  circumstances they must collect it directly from 
the individual to whom it relates. The personal information that has 
been used must then be kept for a certain amount of time, usually at 
least two years.
<P>
	In addition, strict conditions must be met before personal 
information may be disclosed to a third party by a government 
institution.
<P>
	Finally, the act grants individuals a right of access and correction 
which, if refused, may be investigated by the privacy 
commissioner and reviewed by the federal court.
<P>
	When Parliament adopted the Privacy Act in 1982 the 
government was by far the main collector and user of information 
on individuals. The act was therefore made applicable to the 
various departments and agencies of the Government of Canada, 
including some crown corporations, such as Canada Post 
Corporation.
<P>
	At the time, however, it was felt that crown corporations which 
conducted business in competition with the private sector, such as 
the CBC, should now be subject to the act so as not to place them at 
a disadvantage against their private sector competitors. Since then 
most provinces have adopted similar legislation applicable to their 
public sector. The province of Quebec has gone even further by 
subjecting its entire private sector to the protection of personal 
information legislation.
<P>
	As it stands now, the Minister of Justice has committed the 
government to introducing legislation which will protect personal 
information held by federally regulated private sector businesses. 
As the Minister of Justice said last September at the international 
conference of privacy and data protection commissioners, by the 
year 2000 we aim to have federal legislation on the books which 
will provide effective, enforceable protection of privacy rights in 
the private sector.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status of 
Disabled Persons will report to the House shortly on its study of 
privacy issues raised by the availability of new technologies, and I 
believe the government should wait for the recommendations of the 
committee before following up on the motion.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my colleagues having made me realize how important 
this motion is, how important it is to make the information as 
widely available as possible while protecting people's privacy, I 
would like to put forward an amendment to the motion proposed by 
my colleague from Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding, after the words ``Privacy Act'', the words 
``and the Access to Information Act''.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was also 
going to move a very similar motion. I would like to amend Motion 
No. 260 by adding after the words ``Privacy Act'' the words ``and 
the Access to Information Act''.
<P>
	The table officers ruled that this was not an acceptable 
amendment because it would introduce a new concept. I question 
why my motion was rejected when my colleague's was accepted.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member raises a good point. In fact, 
it is sauce for the goose and sauce for the gander. Actually the Table 
does not rule. The Chair rules with the advice of the Table. The 
Chair rules that both of the proposed amendments are out of order 
for the reasons given by the member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A new legislation, a new concept is being introduced, and for 
this reason both amendments are out of order. But, as the hon. 
members know, with the unanimous consent of the House, such an 
amendment may be accepted.
<P>
	Does the hon. member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies want to 
ask for unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I ask for the unanimous 
consent of the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Do we have unanimous consent to accept 
this motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speake</B><B>r:</B> We do not have unanimous consent.
<P>
	Pursuant to order made earlier this day, the House is deemed to 
have divided on the motion and the recorded division on the 
question is deemed to have been requested and deferred until 
Tuesday, April 15, after government orders.
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The recorded division on the question is 
deemed to have been requested and deferred until April 15, after 
government orders.
