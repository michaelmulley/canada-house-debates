<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from March 19, consideration of the motion that Bill C-26, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act, to enact the VIA Rail Canada Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p><A NAME="Int-467110"></A><a HREF="#Int-467115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased  to speak to Bill C-26.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been waiting for this day for a long time because I represent a community that for many years has been affected by the noise from trains in shunting yards close to a residential area. Other communities across Canada have also been very negatively affected by this issue. From the experience of my own community in east Vancouver in the Burrardview area,  up until now there has been virtually no recourse or process to allow local communities to resolve these longstanding grievances against various rail companies around noise and the impact of that noise in adjacent residential neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very pleased to see that Bill C-26 finally  addresses some of these issues. To be specific, my understanding of the bill, if it is approved, is  it would give the Canadian Transportation Agency authority to review railway noise complaints and require that the railways keep any adverse noise to a minimum when constructing or operating a railway, taking into consideration the requirements of railway operations and services and the interests of local  communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill  also develops a mediation process through the Canadian Transportation Agency.  Public guidelines for the resolution of noise complaints will be developed.  This is a huge relief for people who every single night have been experiencing sleep deprivation as a result of enduring excessive noise levels from the operation of trains, engines, coupling, decoupling and shunting, and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one constituent  in this Vancouver neighbourhood said, “As always, we have no complaint with the railway in general, we just want to sleep”.  I would wholeheartedly support that sentiment. For residents in communities such as the one I am describing in Burrardview,  there is a recognition that railways, and of course the services they provide, are hugely important in our country. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,   there also has to be a recognition that when these services operate in very close proximity to urban areas and residential neighbourhoods,  there has to be very careful consideration  and we have to be sensitive and ensure that the processes are in place to deal with problems effectively and quickly.  I would emphasize doing it quickly because I know that  Burrardview residents have had to resort to phoning at 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning because they have not been able to go to sleep because of the noise  just a few hundred feet from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our situation in east Vancouver we have worked with the local health department.  We have had noise testing done.  Residents have gone to city council to try to apply the noise bylaw.  Residents have tried every single thing they could  to generate some relief so that they could go about their daily lives  and not be completely disrupted. This has been  to no avail so this bill is very important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize the outstanding efforts of a key group of residents in east Vancouver in the Burrardview neighbourhood. Jim Campbell and Barbara Fousek, Shane Simpson, John Lynn, Terry Bulwer and Torsten Kehler  have acted as leaders on this issue. They  have informed other residents about what they could do. They have monitored the situation and have stayed on top of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our case it involves CPR.  I want to congratulate those people for being so diligent in not only keeping me informed of what is taking place but in staying on top of the railroad company itself.  We have actually gone out on the tracks.  We did a tour on the tracks.  We went to visit the various locations along the lines that were causing all of the problems.</p><A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure some members of the House will remember my predecessor, Margaret Mitchell, very well, the  wonderful member of Parliament for Vancouver East from 1979 to 1993. She too was dealing with this issue. That is how far back it goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope very much that the provision in Bill C-26 will strengthen what the CTA can accomplish in providing relief to local residents and ensuring that there is an environment of peace and quiet at critical times. People need to sleep and they want to  enjoy their homes and  neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to speak to another aspect of the bill which  is also very important.  This is an omnibus bill, so there are many provisions. There is another part that interests me particularly as a member of Parliament who represents an urban community. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill will also modify the current provisions governing how rail companies can dispose of railway lines that are no longer required for freight service.  The changes would allow urban transit authorities to receive offers where they would be able to acquire corridors that could be used for urban transit.  This is something that is very pertinent to urban communities.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly in Vancouver there is an ongoing debate about the critical need for rapid transit. It could be light rapid transit but certainly what is needed is  a public transit system and structure that will allow people easy access to rapid transit that is affordable and which  will also take account of our environment.  This is critical as we face rising rates of asthma and as we see the smog hanging over our cities. As we try to meet the implementation agreements around Kyoto, this is a very key piece.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rail lines and  corridors exist. They sit there for years and years unused and  they could be used for public transit. It seems to me  we are missing a fabulous opportunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very pleased to see the provision in the bill that will allow urban transit authorities to look at specific corridors that may be suitable for public urban transit.  I hope this  will happen in Vancouver because we are surely suffering from congestion and smog and  a complete overload of mostly single occupant vehicles on Vancouver streets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are my comments on the bill.  The NDP is supporting the bill in principle.  We are happy to see it go to the committee where it will have thorough debate and review.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that residents from east Vancouver will be among the witnesses who will be heard so they can put on the record firsthand some of the terrible situations  they have had to endure in dealing with train noise. It is hoped  that their issues can be addressed in the bill and finally  the Canadian Transportation Agency can deal with the issue in a way that is fair, equitable and efficient to ensure that people can enjoy living in peace  in their neighbourhoods.  </p><A NAME="Int-467115"></A><a HREF="#Int-467117"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member's speech very closely.  I can well appreciate her concerns about  the noise level in communities with regard to trains, especially when it comes to shunting and the times of  the day, or the  night in a lot of cases, that the  shunting takes place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentions that they have tried everything, and  I know other communities have too, with regard to noise  bylaws  and  that studies have been done. I do not want the member to have a false sense of security that the bill would address these matters.  As I have sat in the House, as has the hon. member, I have come to the  conclusion that when they say that things will be studied, it could take up to years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first question would be this.  Does the member not think  that there should have been a time frame built into the bill as to when this had to be enacted upon by everybody involved?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to caution her with regard to opening up vacant corridors.  In one aspect, it is a great idea that the corridors should be used  by anybody who  can take that  on. However, when VIA ran into a large problem in the Rockies, a group came in and   took over the VIA problem, because of the financial situation it was in, turned it around and turned it into a very profitable tourist attraction, which is making money, thriving and creating business.  Now that the railroad has seen the profit margin in this, it wants it back.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get investors to go into these empty corridors and to put up their own funds,     the government should have to give   some sort of assurance to them that  when the profit margin starts to turn in their favour, it will not decide to take it  back.</p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-467117"></A><a HREF="#Int-467119"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Libby Davies: </b>Mr. Speaker,  I certainly appreciate and welcome the questions from the hon. member from the Canadian Alliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the timing issue, as we get to committee we will have to get into this issue in a lot more detail.  We will want to ensure that there are, hopefully, deadlines and that the government will agree that deadlines should be established so that the proposal does not just sit on the books, so to speak, and nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what I am particularly interested in, is the proposal  includes a proposed mediation process that the CTA would be able to engage in with respect to matters affecting noise, or maybe other matters as well.  I think from a resident's point of view, this would be a much more effective way of dealing with this kind of issue than having to hire lawyers.  This happened in one case and maybe in the member's case as well.  In many communities local residents do not have those resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would certainly agree that we should be pushing as much as we can so that the government is held to account  to set out some clear timelines and deadlines for when this will be implemented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, I am little  familiar with the situation that the member raises.  In speaking to the corridors that are no longer being used, I was referencing mostly the situation in urban communities and what opportunities there were for public transit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However in other situations where a contract has been established and then all of a sudden  VIA Rail decides to yank it back because something has become profitable, maybe that needs to be looked at by the committee. There has to be  a fair process.  We cannot allow a decision to be made and then have it unilaterally changed at some point because the company has decided there is some profit there and maybe  it had better take another look at it. Maybe can look at that issue in committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall some of the proposals in this bill, not all of them but many of them,  are good proposals.  I am  being optimistic but I hope that they will address some longstanding grievances that people have had.</p><A NAME="Int-467119"></A><a HREF="#Int-467121"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467117"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, I want to ask my hon. colleague in the NDP a question that relates to our province.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Vancouver Island we have the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway that has been deliberately run inefficiently on the part of VIA in an effort to get VIA out of it. For years and years the community on Vancouver Island and MPs on the island have asked the Minister of Transport to work with VIA, work with its current owners, RailAmerica, and work with the people on the island to put this railway in the hands of a private company that will be able to run it in a profitable fashion while keeping ownership in the hands of the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like my friend's views on whether she would support allowing  this railway to be in the hands of a private company that can run it in a profitable fashion for the benefit of the people of Vancouver Island and whether she will ask the Minister of Transport to follow along those lines.</p><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-467121"></A><a HREF="#Int-467122"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467119"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Libby Davies: </b>Mr. Speaker, as we can see there is a lot of interest in what happens in particular rail lines across the country. We think of Canada as being a place that, in the last hundred years or so, was drawn together by rail service.  I think many of us in the House look with a sense of dismay to what has happened over many decades with our rail and passenger service, which connected many communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member from Esquimalt has mentioned one such route from Esquimalt to Nanaimo.  Even though I am in Vancouver, I have seen some of the stories about how people have campaigned to save these lines and to maintain this vital service that they have connecting very important communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On principle, we very much support the need to maintain and improve and increase these service levels. The NDP does  not support the privatization of these services, however, and I think the hon. member knows that. We want to see the public infrastructure. We want to see VIA Rail do a better job of providing these services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware of the private company to which the member the refers.  However on the principle of the issue, which is to keep these services operating, to strengthen them, improve them and make them more accessible for people, I would say absolutely we have to do that.  We have to pressure the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years the service we have seen in these passenger lines has been abysmal. We have seen a complete undermining and eroding of these services. Canadians have a very strong view that we should be looking to Europe or even the U.S. where there is a much better passenger rail service. I am familiar with that line. I do not know the details of it. The NDP would not support a privatization but we do support an improvement and an increased capacity for passenger rail.</p><A NAME="Int-467122"></A><a HREF="#Int-467126"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467121"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>Is the House ready for the question?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from February 27 consideration of the motion that Bill C-20, an act to amend the Criminal Code (protection of children and other vulnerable persons) and the Canada Evidence Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p><A NAME="Int-467126"></A><a HREF="#Int-467135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467122"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to Bill C-20, which is the government's attempt to deal with the issues of child pornography and sexual exploitation of children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost one year ago the Canadian Alliance put forth an opposition motion that was debated in the House.  I believe it was last April 23.  At that time, the government defeated what I think was a very informed motion.  I will read that for the benefit of people who are watching today.  That motion reads:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That the government immediately introduce legislation to protect children from sexual predators including measures that raise the legal age of consent to at least sixteen, and measures that prohibit the creation or use of sexually explicit materials exploiting children or materials that appear to depict or describe children engaged in sexual activity.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went through an extended period of time where we continued to pressure the government to come forward with legislation to address these very pressing issues.  We had the overwhelming national interest in removing the exploitation of young children, particularly by sexual predators, pimps and others. The movement toward raising the age of sexual consent from 14 to at least 16 had prompted hundreds of thousands of letters, e-mails and petitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the debate of the motion last year, and I can recall, Mr. Speaker, you were in the chair, I had 8,681 petitions on my desk to present. Of course that was denied by members on the government side, but they did end up in the minister's office later that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is none of those people are satisfied with the current legislation.  The current legislation continues to fail to address the issues appropriately, those issues of the fact that artistic merit continues to be an adequate defence and a huge loophole, which basically makes child pornography a continuing problem in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the police, victims, advocates, all kinds of other organizations, the enforcement of our laws preventing the exploitation of 14 and 15 year old children is completely inadequate.  Until the government raises the legal age of sexual consent, this situation will continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this legislation actually does is create a very complex and convoluted set of terms of reference.  Opinions of many experts and common sense would indicate, first, that the existing defences of child pornography are actually broadened rather than narrowed by the legislation. What has really happened is there is not a substantive difference between this defence in this legislation and what was in the previous legislation on artistic merit.</p><A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other defences have been rolled into something called the public good defence which now has several avenues in which the Supreme Court will have great difficulty unless   the normal avenues of defence used by defence lawyers   are addressed.  They are not addressed. They are simply one broad thing called the public good test.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, what we really have is a very unacceptable situation,  a situation that will  lead to a vacuum in the courts from the standpoint of the ability of police to enforce the law, uncertainty in the courts and a cornucopia of opportunity for lawyers and for people who would carry out activities that are not in the public good and exploitive of children.  Those situations will all occur. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most mind-numbing of all is the fact that the age of sexual consent has  not  been raised from 14 to 16.  What has happened is that we have another very complex arrangement, totally subject to the whims of judges or others.  What we really need is what we call a truth in sentencing.  We need to eliminate statutory release.  We need to eliminate conditional sentencing for sex offenders and we must have minimum sentences in order to deter child predators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one aspect of the bill that I think we all concur in and that is the fact that it creates one new offence called voyeurism and the distribution of voyeuristic material. This is obviously a positive step and has been done on a relatively timely basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is so puzzling is that Canada remains one of the only western democratic jurisdictions that continues to pursue a minimum age of consent of 14.  This is clearly unacceptable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to read what the large social conservative organization in Vancouver, which sent me last year's petitions, had to say about all of this after our motion failed last year. It stated:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Parents, police and social service agencies are hindered in protecting children as young as 14 who are coerced into sex with adults.  Children as young as 14 can be exposed to the risks associated with sexual activity such as emotional distress, unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases including AIDS. Recent years have seen a significant increase in crimes of a sexual nature against children.  Child prostitution, child pornography etc. are increasing at an alarming rate. The low age of consent encourages societal acceptance of early sexual behaviour and appetite for pedophiles.  Problems associated with low age of consent to sex are deep emotional and mental health problems, STDS, cervical cancer, teen pregnancies, school drop-outs and criminal behaviour.</small></td>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am  appalled that  such a crucial and important issue, which deals with the  fundamental fabric of our society,  is  being treated so dismally by the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to   talk a little  about   the child pornography legislation as well.   When the Supreme Court of British Columbia  in February 2002  found that the written works of Robin Sharpe had artistic merit and acquitted him of the charges this created a vacuum.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problems with the bill are many and varied. Let us back up for a moment. If the objective of our justice system is the protection of innocent civilians, then surely the protection of children must be at the forefront of our justice system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 10 years people in my party and in others have asked, pushed, cajoled and coerced the government to implement solutions that will protect children from that most egregious crime: the  sexual, violent abuse at the hands of a predator  or a pedophile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand why we are so adamant about this, let us look at pedophilia for a moment. It is an incurable problem. Pedophiles, by and large, are not cured of this. When somebody comes before our justice system to be tried and sometimes convicted for these offences,   it is usually not the first time the person has  sexually abused a child. In fact, studies show that when an individual comes before the court charged with the sexual abuse of a child, generally the person has abused at least 12 children before that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members should think about that  for a moment. When a person   comes before a court for the very first time, the person has sexually raped and abused at least 12 children, not once  but generally over a prolonged period of time. As my colleague has mentioned, that has profound implications upon the life of   a child for the entire length of   the child's life. It is something that they never, ever get over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, we are aghast and appalled that the government has not adopted the constructive solutions that we put forth that would have strengthened our justice system, protected children and enabled our courts to do the job they were supposed to do:   protect the Canadian public. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also without a doubt the responsibility of the courts and our justice system to implement solutions that will help in the rehabilitation of the convicted. We make no dispute about that and, in fact.  we encourage that.  How can we have a society where those who have made mistakes and who  have committed offences do not have the hope of retribution or of being cured of their problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedophilia is in a category very different from all others, with  the exception, I would say, of  individuals who commit violent sexual abuses against other individuals. Violent sexual behaviour, pedophilia, is in a class unto itself. Most of those people do not get cured. It is true that most of those people, it is  sad to say, have endured sexual abuse, violent or otherwise,  themselves. That is a profound tragedy and we have great sympathy for those individuals. However it does not exonerate them from committing acts of violent sexual abuse against others during their lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it is our responsibility here in the House to ensure that our justice system, our courts and our police have the tools to not only protect civilians, but also to ensure that to the best of our ability we can give the individuals who  committed those offences as much treatment as possible to ensure that when or if they get out we can be confident that they will not reoffend again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein lies the problem. The court system gives individuals a sentence. They  finish   their sentence and then they are released. We are fairly confident that some of those people will not reoffend but, having worked in jails, I can tell the House that a lot of those people, whether they are sexual predators or violent offenders, are being released with the full knowledge and awareness that they will commit that type of offence again. Those who work in our penal institutions, those who are part of our court system and those who are part of our police forces are aghast, appalled, saddened and often demoralized by the fact that our system does not at the end of the day, at its heart, protect our society from those individuals who commit the most violent, appalling and egregious offences against innocent civilians.</p><A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are predators.  I will provide an example.  Friends of mine, a couple, were living in Vancouver.  An individual moved in beside them and befriended them.  He came over with gifts and food.  One day the wife of this friend of mine was at home and suddenly found their next door neighbour in their home, uninvited, with candies for their daughter, who was seven years old at the time. Subsequent to that they found out that this individual, their neighbour who they thought was perfectly fine, had a long history of violent sexual abuses against children. He was and is a predator and was an individual who was trying to sexually abuse their seven year old daughter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this friend of mine went to the police, the police said they could do nothing about this since the person had not committed a crime.  What do we have to wait for?  Do we have to wait for that individual  to rape that seven year old girl so the police can say they have a crime and therefore can incarcerate that individual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly a crime has to be committed before someone is incarcerated, to be sure, but on the other hand, does that family not have a right to know that the person living next door to them is an individual with a long history of violent sexual abuses, an individual who the police know is fully expected to reoffend?  Does that family not have a right to know that its next door neighbour has a very high chance of sexually abusing another child? The hands of the police were tied in that case, as they are tied in other cases around the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand and are fully cognizant of the fact that all individuals have rights, but at the end of the day the rights of a child have to trump the rights of a sexual predator.  That has to happen. That is what we in our party are trying to do.  We are trying to change the laws of the land to ensure that children are not going to be preyed on by pedophiles who have a long history of these actions and, by and large, as I said before, are incurable. Some can be controlled and should be allowed out after serving their sentences, but those who cannot should be kept in jail until such time as the judicial system is confident that these individuals will not reoffend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that on the international stage there are pedophile tours.  These adults, working underground, get together to go on tours to Colombia and southeast Asia where they are taken to brothels and children are presented in front of them so that they can rape them.  That is what is happening now.  It is an underground system. The international judicial system is aghast and appalled that collectively we have been unable to prosecute these individuals who go on these tours to sexually abuse the children of people  in faraway countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Thai government and the Malaysian government are aghast because many of these pedophiles selectively go there to sexually abuse children.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  Our Minister of Justice must work with other ministers of justice and international policing organizations to develop a system for the identification and prosecution of individuals who actively go after children on these international sex tours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague has mentioned the issue of child porn.  I will not belabour the issue because my colleagues have spoken eloquently about it.  Suffice it to say that we are not talking about some individual who accidentally pulls something off a computer.  We are talking about individuals who have a long history of pulling up and using child pornography.  What adults do among themselves is adults' business, but when people are actually buying child pornography, attached to that must be victims, and the victims are children who had absolutely no say whatsoever in being part and parcel of those movies or photographs that show them being sexually abused by adults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for solutions, we have spoken about heavier penalties and minimum sentencing for people convicted of pedophilia.  Release should be conditional upon the knowledge that individuals who are pedophiles,  and  I would extend this to people who commit rape, are violent sexual offenders. We must be certain that those individuals and people who commit pedophilia and sexual and violent offences are not going to reoffend. That category of offences is very different from others because at the end of the day the victims of those offences are individuals who have to sustain and endure terrible penalties that they have to live with for the rest of their lives.</p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangerous offender status should be more liberally applied to those individuals who are pedophiles.  As I said before, it is an incurable problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know my time is up, but I hope the government listens to the constructive solutions my party has put forward. We are very willing to work with the government to implement a constructive Bill C-20 that  will protect our children from predation by violent sexual offenders.</p><A NAME="Int-467144"></A><a HREF="#Int-467156"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467137"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise and debate Bill C-20 today. I want to say at the outset that members of the Canadian Alliance have spoken out forcefully on this and that is  because we reflect where our constituents are at. Many of us have received petitions on this issue. People are very concerned about court rulings that seem to indicate some kind of a tolerance for child pornography in some form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want people who are watching today to understand that the Canadian Alliance feels it is completely wrong to give any kind of nod of approval to any form of child pornography, any form. I want to underline how pervasive the attitude is, at least among some people, that it is okay to tolerate some kinds of child pornography by pointing to something that was said in this place back at the end of January by a member of the NDP. This is what the member for Palliser said:</p>

</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern, which I think is shared by police officers across the country, is that if we open the door a crack to allowing these “artistic” versions of child pornography or what the courts have ruled are stories that may have artistic merit, then really we give the seal of approval to child pornography. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to shut that down. We are saying that there is no such thing as child pornography having any kind of public good. That of course is what is at the heart of the debate over Bill C-20 and we want to make it very clear that our party is completely opposed to that notion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is such a broad subject and there are so many different aspects to it, but suffice it to say that the Alliance believes that child pornography in Canada today is a scourge. We know that there has been a lot of publicity about this issue recently. There has been a worldwide crackdown by police forces on child pornography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that concerns us, beyond the flaws in Bill C-20, is the fact that the police are not given adequate resources to deal with the issue of child pornography. When we had the recent crackdown around the world, which resulted in people being charged in the United States, Great Britain and some in Canada, we found that in Canada we had a woeful lack of resources when it came to having enough people to go out and check on people who initially were caught with child pornography, to check and make sure that we actually had enough evidence to prosecute them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a concern. If the government maintains, and I think that it would, that the protection of children has to be the highest possible priority of a police force and a justice system in Canadian society, then they have to have adequate resources to do that. They need to have good laws and they need to have adequate resources. I am afraid to say that we have neither in Canada today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of artistic merit as a defence for child pornography, or even now the idea of public good as Bill C-20 states, I think to most people is contrary to common sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has not just failed when it comes to those issues, but it has failed in other ways as well, which are related to this. Some members already have spoken about the government's failure to adopt legislation that would raise the age of consent for engaging in sexual relations. Right now the age is 14, which I think would strike most people as being too young. We are talking here about relations between adults and children as young as the age of 14 and that is what concerns us.</p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year when we brought this forward as a motion in the House of Commons I was surprised, in fact, very frustrated, that the government voted against our motion to raise the age of consent from 14 to at least 16.  The government trotted out all kinds of red herrings that it had not been able to get the provinces onside and that it was working with the provinces.  That is a red herring because it is the federal government alone that sets the Criminal Code.   The provinces administer it, but it is the federal government that has sole responsibility for changing the laws when it comes to the Criminal Code of Canada.  We are concerned about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another indication that the government does not take these issues seriously enough is its ridiculous sex offender registry which it is now proposing to bring in.  The sex offender registry would only list  people as of now who have committed a sexual offence.  They would be the only ones who would be listed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If somebody had been guilty of all kinds of sexual offences in the past, they would not be listed in the sex offender registry.  That calls into question the government's commitment of ensuring that the public's protection is put ahead of the protection of privacy for people who have records as sexual offenders.  To me that is simply wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are concerned that the government is not taking seriously enough what should be the first priority of any government which is the protection of its citizens.  Why were governments formed?  They were formed to protect the rights and freedoms of citizens and one of those freedoms is the freedom to not be interfered with, sexually.  The government has not addressed these issues in a serious enough manner.  There have been thousands of names on petitions that have come into the House.  These people say they want these sorts of laws strengthened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For reasons that are not apparent to me, the government drags its heels at every turn and comes up with all kinds of excuses for not doing it. I think that is simply wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make reference to an article that a previous member mentioned that was written by a Winnipeg lawyer who talked about the artistic merit defence and the new legislation, Bill C-20.  He argued that the artistic merit defence, or the old legislation governing child pornography, was actually stricter than the new legislation that the government is bringing in.  He pointed to all kinds of possible ways that the government could put some strict limits on child pornography to ensure that the next time this law is challenged it will not be thrown out again by the courts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that if the government is not prepared to listen to the opposition then it should listen to people like David Matas,  a Winnipeg Lawyer.  He has provided some common sense suggestions for ways to limit the current definition of child pornography to ensure that we do not have to go through this again and that Canada's young people are protected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a year and a little bit ago my colleague from Lethbridge and I went down to the Canada-U.S. border and spent some time with customs officials on both sides of the border.  One thing that came up on both sides of the border was how they have to be so vigilant today to ensure that when young people are travelling across the border with an older person, that they are not doing so because they have been lured by older people for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The impression they left with me is that this is not just a problem, it is a crisis.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear Toronto police officers talking about the crisis that they are facing now with respect to child pornography.  We hear people talking today about the fact that Canada is becoming somewhat of a destination for sex tourism.  </p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a serious issue and I am concerned that the government is not taking its responsibilities for protecting young people seriously.  We have laid down a number of examples today of how it is failing in those responsibilities.  Not only does it have to do with Bill C-20, but it has to do with its inability to summon the courage to raise the age of sexual consent from 14 to 16 and it is has to do with bringing in a sex offender registry that captures on that registry people who have committed sexual offences in the past and not just as of today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude by urging the government to consider these remarks and to change this legislation.</p>

The resident population of some six million to seven million seals, each destroying a tonne of fish annually, clearly contributes significantly to this problem. The annual commercial harvest of 350,000 animals is a balanced approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not common knowledge is that the west coast has a similar problem. Salmon populations have been significantly reduced by huge seal populations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that a seal hunt on a commercial basis will introduce a badly needed new economy on the B.C. coast and will also aid in the revival of healthy returns on salmon and trout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to encourage the minister to seriously consider establishing a commercial seal hunt on the west coast of Canada.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the world, Canada has gained the reputation of being a country that places high value on social justice, diversity and equality.  We need to be vigilant to ensure that racism has no place in our society or in the world. The campaign is an annual reminder that every one of us has a role to play in putting an end to racism.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saddam is responsible for the deaths of over a million people, both in wars of aggression he launched, and torture and execution of his own people. He is guilty of genocide against the Kurds, Marsh Arabs and Shiites, killing tens of thousands through the use of poison gas and mass execution.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that allied forces will soon bring him to justice. But if Saddam is captured alive, I believe that he and his henchmen should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity at a special international criminal tribunal created for that purpose.</p>

In the budget the government bragged about all the money it was giving out for the various departments. While this was unfolding, it was asking departments to cut a billion dollars from existing programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been asked to find between $15 million and $20  million.  This means significant cuts to small crafts and harbours, the science branch and the Coast Guard, all divisions currently in dire need of funding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is inconceivable.  The Department of Fisheries and Oceans at present cannot afford to deliver existing programs and further cuts will be devastating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting money into one's pocket with one hand is always popular but taking it out with the other is only an action the government would take.  Government giveth and government taketh away at its own risk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Francophonie can certainly point to a remarkable trail of achievements. Consider the winner of the Prix Montfort for cultural diversity,  Rwandan-born singer Corneille, who fled the genocide, who reminded us how war destroys the dreams of thousands of children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider Antonine Maillet, winner of the Prix Montfort for literature, who constantly nurtures our hope for a better Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creator of the <i>Festival Juste pour      rire</i>, Gilbert Rozon, who won the Prix Montfort for event of the year, expressed his great admiration for all of humanity in these troubled times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about the mayor of Moncton, winner of the Montfort of the Year award. He reminded us of our ability to meet the challenges of bilingualism.</p>

The “Butcher of Baghdad” has scant days left to his evil rule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saddam has for too long been a harbourer of terrorists, a killer of his own citizens and a user and purveyor of weapons of mass destruction. Saddam personifies the new world's most evil threat, post-September 11.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Great Britain, the United States and Australia together do their part to rout Saddam, we do not stand with our allies today.  We stand in the shadow of the United Nations' failure to act.  We stand aside because of a Prime Minister who failed to help.  We stand aside, due to a Prime Minister interested more in personal popularity polls than safe, secure world order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shamefully, our Prime Minister is more ready to continue the “Butcher of Baghdad” and his evil threats, than to accept and help the most and the best of the free world marching to end Saddam's reign.  God save the Queen and God bless America.</p>

Bill Graham (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </b>To be fair, Mr. Speaker, I must say that I appreciate the hon. member's interest in the issue of reconstruction, but it is not correct to say we have taken no interest in this up until now.  We have been extremely aware of it, but the question is, how does one act reasonably and in a way that is going to make a positive contribution to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister made it clear that before the intervention took place talk of reconstruction might have caused other political issues to arise.  That is now there.  We will do our part.  We are acting at the United Nations.  We agree with the members of the House that this would be best managed through a United Nations process and we will actively pursue that agenda.</p>

Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am raising a point of order with respect to an answer given today by the Minister of National Defence and the answers which he gave to me yesterday on the same question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I put the following question to the Minister of National Defence:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Do all Canadian troops on ships in the gulf have gas masks and chemical suits to protect them against potential chemical or biological attacks?  Yes or no.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister answered that he had already answered the question.  Then he went on to say “I do not think it is appropriate for me to deal with such issues in public”,  and he offered to meet me privately. That is what he said yesterday. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today he provided to the House of Commons, in public, the information which he deliberately denied to me yesterday in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am raising this for a variety of reasons.  First, I am obliged to raise this at the most timely occasion.  Second, the issue was obviously one of grave importance.  We would not want Canadians in the gulf to be exposed to potential chemical weapons attacks without adequate provision.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that the minister was trying to hide behind a rule set out in Beauchesne's.  I draw your attention     to Beauchesne's 6th edition, page 123, citation 416(1) and (2) which says:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(1) A Minister may decline to answer a question without stating the reason...</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(2) An answer to a question cannot be insisted upon if the answer be refused by the Minister on the ground of the public interest; nor can the question be replaced on the Notice Paper.  The refusal of a Minister to answer on this ground cannot be raised as a matter of privilege.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly what the minister was attempting to do yesterday was claiming that this was a matter that could not be responded to on the ground of the public interest. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the public interest  in his interpretation  said he could not reply.  Today the public interest in his interpretation said he could reply. I believe that is a breach of the rules of order of the House.  We have a right to  count upon the veracity and completeness of the answers of ministers in the House. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate your judgment on this, Mr. Speaker.</p><A NAME="T1205"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1205"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1205)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-467479"></A><a HREF="#Int-467480"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467476"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. John McCallum (Minister of National Defence, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, as I said in my response today, one must always be extraordinarily cautious to not release information that could jeopardize the safety and security of our sailors when they are in a difficult situation. Therefore  I wanted to make sure there was nothing that would jeopardize their security in this matter.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I checked with the military people to make sure and I was assured that this could be appropriate to release.  I gave the right hon. gentleman  the courtesy, if I were not able to release it publicly, of telling him privately, given his history.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, having been informed by the military that it was not jeopardizing the security of our people I was very happy to release what was essentially good news in the House today.</p><A NAME="Int-467480"></A><a HREF="#Int-467482"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467479"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>I do not think there is need for any further interventions on this point.  I am sure the right hon. member for Calgary Centre is thrilled to get the information today that he did not get yesterday, even though it was a day late and even though it was not delivered privately. I could tell that in his remarks earlier. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of that situation, I think he is also aware that answers given one day because of certain circumstances may change on another day.  I think the minister's explanation in the circumstances is entirely satisfactory.  Therefore  in my view there is no point of order here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed  consideration of the motion that Bill C-20, an act to amend the Criminal Code (protection of children and other vulnerable persons) and the Canada Evidence Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee, and of the amendment.</p><A NAME="Int-467522"></A><a HREF="#Int-467701"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467516"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Richard Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, in February 2002, Mr. Justice Shaw of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, using whatever logic or rationale that may have prevailed on that particular day, ruled that the written works of acknowledged pedophile Robin Sharpe,  which depicted young children in various  sexual poses, depicted young children as victims  of sexual violence, and depicted young children being brutally exploited sexually by adults,  “had artistic merit” and acquitted Robin Sharpe of the charges of possession and distribution of child pornography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This came as an absolutely unbelievable court decision to millions of Canadians.  It fuelled the fires of doubt  about whether their justice system was working for society.  It fuelled the storm of protests over the decisions that we see coming out of our justice system.  It fuelled the storm of protests over the mounting judicial activism that has been happening in our country for the last 10 years because governments, such as the Liberal government, do not have the guts to make controversial  law and legislation in this Parliament, but rather they would take the cowardly way out and leave it to the judges to make these decisions and expect Canadians to just sit back,  abide by  some very sick decisions, such as this one here,  and  accept that  because  it came from the courts    it must be right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has not happened by accident.  I believe that the push to get controversial or publicly sensitive legislation out of  Parliament started way back when Pierre Elliott Trudeau was the Prime Minister of Canada.  He and his government put through legislation and he led the charge through the Charter of Rights and Freedoms so that   Parliament would never have to make controversial decisions that would make it uncomfortable or nervous.  It would be left in the hands of the courts to decide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government now brings in Bill C-20 that is supposed to fix this.  The defence that it is trying to fix is that the representation or written material has artistic  merit or is for educational, scientific or  medical purposes.  It was certainly the defence used in the case of Robin Sharpe, which Chief Justice Shaw accepted,    for whatever insane reason, and certainly, not for the good of society.   </p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now instead of using the artistic merit, educational, scientific or medical purposes defence, the new bill, which is supposed to fix this thing, proposes that this defence be repealed and replaced by the defence that the material alleged to constitute child pornography serves the public good.  This is amazing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every sane person in the country could understand that we simply could not attach the phrase “serving the public good” to materials that depict the sexual exploitation of children or the brutality of children by sexual predators either in drawn form or written word. My God, how can we imagine that Canada could accept that a defence could be used that could describe child pornography as serving the public good?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a Liberal government that has failed Canadian on so many justice issues since 1993, could come up with a bill like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not alone.  The Liberals on the other side who support the bill, will stand up and say that we have to be careful and that we have to try to determine that maybe there might be some public good in child pornography.  They will stand up and vote for the bill.  They will be joined by their friends in the NDP party.  The member for Palliser has already given notice on this.  January 27, the member for Palliser said, and he believed that his colleagues shared his opinion, that:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--if it has not specifically hurt a minor in the production of it, if it is created by people's visual imaginations and if the main purpose of it is not simply about pornography and sexual exploitation, then under the laws people do have a right to their own imaginations and thoughts, however perverse...</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That reflects the opinion of the member for Palliser and as he said, “I believe it will be shared by a majority”,  of whom, I do not know.  It is certainly not rational thinking Canadians but maybe that does not include supporters of the NDP party.  However it will shared by a majority if not all of his colleagues. Therefore we are talking about not rationally thinking Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. David  Matas of Winnipeg wrote an opinion on child pornography and artistic merit.  Apparently this person is a Winnipeg lawyer.  He argued the Sharpe case in the Supreme Court of Canada for an organization called Beyond Borders, which is a leading fighter against child pornography in Canada. He is a very knowledgeable person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Matas said that the defence of artistic merit, which is in the legislation now and in the court system now, needed to be narrowed so that only in the case of police officers using child pornography that was drawn or written as evidence in a case against the child pornographer or cases like that could it be allowed.  Certainly not the possession by some of these perverts that are running around our country preying on our children.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am absolutely disgusted at the lack of knowledge that the Liberal government has about how society feels about child pornography.  It is a disgusting lack of leadership by the government and we certainly cannot support the bill.</p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of disgusting acts, I cannot sit down before I tell the House about something that happened the last two nights in the Bell Centre in Montreal. Some of the fans were booing the American national anthem and booing the presence of American based teams playing in Canada.  This as one of the most disgusting and embarrassing things I have ever seen Canadians do. One has to wonder where their priorities are--</p><A NAME="Int-467701"></A><a HREF="#Int-467705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467522"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos): </b>I apologize to the hon. member but 10 minutes does go by fast.</p><A NAME="Int-467705"></A><a HREF="#Int-467825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467701"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC): </b>Madam Speaker, I am delighted to speak to Bill C-20.  I want to thank my colleague from Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough, our justice critic,  for his help on this issue.   As members know, he is now campaigning to become leader of our party, which I hope he does.  I do want to put some comments on the record on his behalf and on behalf of my party. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-20 is basically the Liberal answer to the John Robin Sharpe case, the pornographic case which became famous in Canada.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some aspects of the bill which we take some comfort from in terms of what it will do. For example, clause 5, which amends section 161(1) of the Criminal Code to expand the definition of those convicted or discharged on the conditions prescribed in a prohibition order, can be seen as a positive step.  We do not dispute that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also believe that positive amendments have been brought forward with regard to sections 151 and 152 maintaining the indictable offence maximum of 10 years while increasing the level of punishment under summary conviction by directing the court to incarceration not exceeding 18 months.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally, this debate and this legislation must centre around the harm caused to those most vulnerable in our society, our children.  Underlying this, we must give thought to the role of the court in the context of judicial policy making as it pertains to the supremacy of Parliament.  We must show how this new legislation will eradicate child pornography.  It is our belief that the new legislation will not do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about eradicating child pornography within the context of the artistic merit defence. Unfortunately for Canadians, the legislation does not go far enough and could once again be subjected to judicial interpretation putting our children at risk. There will definitely be constitutional challenges under Bill C-20 if it is passed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an inherent danger to society as a whole when we fail to recognize the detrimental effect child pornography can have at a base level.  No one is suggesting that the literary works of Nabokov, who is the author of <i>Lolita </i> or Plato's<i> Symposium</i>, be removed from circulation based on the promotion of sexual contact with minors.  Indeed the charter of rights provides sufficient protection for freedom of thought and expression. However the question of what constitutes a reasonable limit is central to this debate and to Bill C-20.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7(1) of Bill C-20 amends subsection 163(1) of the Criminal Code, defining child pornography to include any written material, the dominant characteristics of which is the description for a sexual purpose of sexual activity with a person under the age of 18 years of age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the addition of a clearer section for the purpose of specifically defining what constitutes child pornography is welcome, I suggest that the definition be altered to remove foreseeable subjectivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a definition, child pornography should not be open to interpretation through intent or any other means.  The thought process behind the writing and whether or not the work was produced for a sexual purpose should be of no consequence.  We need simply state the definition of what is acceptable and what is not. With this clear definition, the judiciary is removed from the public-private nature of the debate. As a remedy to that, a clause was placed in the bill, within section 163, saying that:</p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand the intent of the minister's legislation. I fear the manner in which it is presented will not be sufficient to protect the abhorrent creation of pornographic material depicting children. The public, along with child advocacy groups and members of the House, have called upon the government to produce a clear, concise piece of legislation which would remove completely the chance that materials of this nature would see the light of day. Once again the minister has left open to interpretation by the courts a matter that strikes at the very heart of our democracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of this bill is to protect children from all forms of exploitation, including child pornography, sexual exploitation, abuse and neglect. Unfortunately, the definitions of public good will be vague and no level of objectivity exists which will allow a court to decide what is pornographic and what is not. Once again it will be a question of acceptability to the individual. Obviously, an argument as to what constitutes the public good will predominate leaving our children once again vulnerable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask the minister why it has taken so long, and how  the legion of lawyers has produced yet again an obviously flawed piece of legislation. This bill has been laying around this place for a long time but they have yet to get it right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall effect of the Sharpe decision by Mr. Justice Shaw had many in society recoiling with dismay. We have heard that today in the House. That a learned judge would in fact open the door to potential pedophiles and those who take advantage of youth, who denigrate images and engage in writings that have a very corrosive effect on social norms, is a travesty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Works of this nature go against the very fabric of what is acceptable in a moral and just society. There can be no denial that a direct correlation exists between the fantasies of sick individuals and the harm created to children. Why risk the potential danger, when the collective will of the people would see this material stricken from existence?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In handing down the Sharpe decision, Justice Shaw effectively broadened the interpretation of the current exemption or defence of artistic merit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remind members, section 1 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms, “subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society”. The contention that section 1 limits are justifiable in this case are correct when weighed against the potential harm to children and the intent of Parliament to protect the rights of those most vulnerable. Simply put, it is my belief that the Supreme Court erred when it favourably interpreted the Shaw decision. Unfortunately I do not think the minister's lawyers understand that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Progressive Conservative Party has been supportive in the past of the law enforcement community victims' groups and child advocates who are constantly tasked and constantly struggling with a lack of resources available to them. We desperately need legislation that will protect children. We believe that this legislation is not strong enough. I urge the government and the minister to consider some of the arguments being put forward in the House today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the objective of this new bill is to protect children.  It does not do that. Please allow some of the amendments suggested by this side of the House to be considered by the government. Do not just categorically deny the opposition that simply because we are the opposition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is here to protect children and that is what we want it to do.</p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-467825"></A><a HREF="#Int-467838"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, I have a couple of things to say on the bill.  I think it would be appropriate for me to begin by making a very important announcement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred and seventy-five hours ago we saw  another Epp baby come into the world.  I am a grandfather for the fifth time.  I will use a term  which is unparliamentary but not offensive,  it is my name.  In the Epp tradition, the baby came into the world just perfectly.  He even had a little hair over his ear to match grandpa's, which was very nice. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This grandchild is little Micah.  He  is the baby brother of  Noah and Hannah.  When I see him and his older sister and brother I cannot help but think how totally deplorable and depraved it would be for anyone to engage in any activity of a sexual nature with these innocent, young, beautiful children. Nor can I can understand how anyone would get any pleasure whatsoever from depicting, either by written words,  by pictures.  cartoons or whatever, that type of activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that  totally deplorable.  In fact, I do not know of any words in the English language or in either of my other two languages that  come anywhere close to describing the absolutely horrific nature of such an activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along come the Liberals and they say  that they will introduce Bill C-20. It is a Criminal Code amendment designed to safeguard children from sexual exploitation.  It is a very hapless title.  It reminds me of the days when I drove a truck.  I used to haul big loads with a big rig on the highway.  Every once in a while we did not have a back haul.  I would be driving the big truck empty simply to get to another destination.  I had no load.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the bill is.  It has a fancy title but the bill is empty.  It does not begin to address the issues that are before us as a society and as lawmakers in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be very specific because I know this is actually a bill that was brought forward  to make political hay.  The Liberals brought forward the bill with nothing in it to protect children  so that we in opposition will have no choice but to vote against it.  We will vote against it because it is ineffective.  The bill does not do anything to protect children.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next election we  probably will have brochures in our ridings  asking  why  people would vote for that Canadian Alliance member when he voted against the protection of children.  That will be the  Liberals'    messaging.  I find that almost as offensive as the bill itself.  I have seen this happen in previous election campaigns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Liberals to use children in such a blatant way  shows how really empty they are of any principles at all.  I am really distressed about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, for example, in the bill   a move that is supposed to make it easier to actually convict child pornographers.  How will we do that if we stand in front of the same judges trying to make the case?  In the past we went there and said that something was  bad that the person should be convicted of a crime.  The defence would argue, no, that this was in keeping with community standards.</p><A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out that community standards basically allowed almost anything to go through because it is very difficult to define community standards. They changed that in the bill calling it “public good”. That may be a little more difficult to prove. Maybe community standards sometimes are contrary to public good but, as I see it, they are almost identical in the eyes of a judge in a law court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public good could be argued to be served if we simply fail to stop somebody from writing this junk. They would say “that is the public good”, and they would be arguing free speech. I am not against free speech but limitations to a certain degree are valid. In my humble opinion, when it comes to protecting our beautiful, innocent, young children, we stop at nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be totally content to say that  to depict child pornography in any form whatsoever, written, hand drawn, definitely photographs or films or videos, but even the written stuff and  the hand created cartoon stuff, if it depicts children being abused, it is wrong. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ought to have a law in this country that says that no one can do  it. I would even go so far as to write into the legislation “notwithstanding anything in the charter” so that defence could not be used. I would say “notwithstanding anything in the charter, this bill provides that no one may produce or possess, in any form whatsoever, any form of child pornography”. Then perhaps we could stand tall and say that we are doing something tangible to protect our children. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot let my time slip by without making a comment on  a glaring omission in the bill, and that is the age of consent. I do not know how it happened in our country that we allowed the age of consent to slip down to 14. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goddaughter had a birthday yesterday if I am not mistaken. I know she just turned 12 but that means she finished her twelfth year of life and she is into her thirteenth year. Again, there is absolutely no justification anywhere, anytime for anyone to talk a child of that age into sexual activity. It just is wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have a bill that says we are going to protect children but does nothing with the age of consent. I need to explain this for anyone who may not know what it means. It means that an adult cannot stand up in court and say “I am innocent because she agreed to it”. That is all it means. No one cannot persuade a 13 year old in this country to have sex and get away with it because that is not permitted, but if she is 14, they can. I say that is way  too low. The  very serious omission in the bill is that it does not address that problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could talk about   many other things in the bill  but I guess I will have only time for one more in my last minute and that  has to do with minimum and maximum sentences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bill the maximum sentences have been increased. Fine, but will the courts use them, or will they continue to give continual sentences? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a letter from an individual who actually chastised me for calling for minimum sentences. She said that she did not want minimum sentences for those creeps. She said that she  wanted maximum sentences. I wrote to her and told her  I understood what she was saying. She wants to punish them to the max, which is right, but, unfortunately, if a maximum sentence is given in the law  it prohibits a judge from giving any sentence greater than that. A minimum sentence means  that a sentence must be given of at least a set amount. </p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have minimum sentences in a bill that purports to protect children but  it is not in the bill.  Therefore I will be voting against the bill and my reason is that  I truly want to protect children.</p><A NAME="Int-467838"></A><a HREF="#Int-467839"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos): </b>I am sure that I speak on behalf of all members in congratulating the hon. member for Elk Island for his new grandchild.

I also want to congratulate  the hon. member who just spoke on his new grandchild.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a big  problem with what   exactly  the government is trying to do with regard to the bill.  We all know, or should know, and maybe  the problem is that we do not all know, that the government's first and foremost responsibility is  the protection of its law-abiding citizens. However it seems that the government has decided to take an easy way out of this.  I should explain this to the people at home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have in Canada what is  known as judge made laws.  The government has allowed that  to take place because it lets the government off the hook.  Governments are supposed to make laws, judges are to interpret them and lawyers are to debate them.  It is easier now for the government to say that it did not intend something to happen in a law and that it was the judge who was at fault for giving  that type of sentence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore,  as a member of Parliament, the government in its own stupidity--I cannot put it any other way--decided to  give me an out as a member of Parliament when I go home and   have to face  some tough questions from my constituents, such as the Sharpe decision in regard to child pornography. I can now go home and say that it was a judge who made that decision,   not the government. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallacy is that we can now lay the blame on the judges, even though the government appoints most of them, because they are not  accountable.  They do not have to come up for re-election.  They do not have to be voted in.  They do not have to explain to the population why a decision was made.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b> They're unelected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</b> They're unelected and it lets the government off the hook.  Some people call it smoke and mirrors but   I call it total deception by the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b> Cowardice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</b> Yes, cowardice is a very good word for what the government has allowed to happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function of  government is to create the laws.  If a judge interprets a law in a way that the government did not mean for it to be interpreted, it  takes only a matter of a day or so in this supposed Chamber to change the law so it can no longer be interpreted in that way.  However, the government, in its cowardly acts, decided it would  not do that because it might be controversial and it did  not want to take any type of heat in case it impacted upon it in a coming election.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b> Let the judges take the heat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</b> Let the judges take the heat and let the lawyers be called the dogs of the day for arguing the cases. The  fact of the matter is  that when we hire  lawyers we want  our lawyers to represent us to the best of their  ability, and then the judge makes the decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the decision goes against the good of children, of all people, certainly the government should have the intestinal fortitude or the guts to make the change to protect our children, but it does not.  It goes along and tries to pass another bill, which I am sure   it will get through, Bill C-20.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-20 fails to set a clear standard on the issue of the age of consent for adult-child sexual relationships. In other words, we allow our 14 year old children  to be bought and paid for by some 60 year old, and we do nothing about it.  We have become known in the world as protectors of the child sex trade.</p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the unfortunate opportunity of seeing some of these programs that the police are so concerned about. Fourteen is at the high end of the age spectrum. These videos show three year olds and four year olds.  They are sick and they are sickening.  Yet time after time when we find these people and law enforcement collects enough evidence and is finally allowed to bring these people to court, they are let off with a slap on the wrist and we say that we can change these people or the way they do business in  regard to child pornography. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard the excuse of artistic merit. Nobody with any reasoning is going to argue about a drawing in a doctor's office,  for God's sake, yet I have heard members, and I even have heard the minister, stand up and say that is reason the government  wants to have this in the bill.  What a load of garbage.  It is a doctor's office.  We know that doctors have drawings and pictures of body parts, so that does not wash with the public out there. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does get the public angry is that when these people are sentenced they can go right through the whole system without treatment and be allowed to go back onto the street. They are allowed back onto the street to ply their trade, and that is all it is. These people are in it for the money and are using our children to make the money.   They go through the prison system without even having to sit one day to understand what is wrong with their trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Before they ever get to prison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</b> Yes, many times before they ever get to prison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they are pushed out the door to again go after the children, to be part of our so-called neighbourhood that the government is so worried about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are things going on in this country.  If  the government really wants to know what is going on in the country, it should get its head out of where it has it stuck. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b>  They use legal aid lawyers too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</b>  They use and they use, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot believe that we have allowed this to go on for so long. I remember standing up in 1994 in the House arguing about the same thing, the exploitation of our children in this country.  I am not speaking as a father because I do not have children. I have not had  the good fortune to have grandchildren. I am speaking as someone who has gone with members from this side, the member for Wild Rose and the member from Bulkley Valley,  to see the devastation this has created in our cities across Canada. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing worse than talking to a girl who is 12, 13 or 14 years old  and whose life has been totally ruined through this.  They are taken in by gangs and forced into these types of acts.  They are  forced and we sit here and we do nothing about it.  Then I am supposed to go home, along with the other members of the House, and say that I am proud to represent Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that many times I am not proud to represent Canada because of what we allow to take place in Canada. It is time the government decided to give back to parents the right to start raising their children. The government has to get out of the family business and start protecting those who need protection. It is time, long past time, and sooner or later we are going to reap what we sow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we have an overabundance of child drug addicts and sexual diseases among children in the country? This is why: The government decided it would be a parent.  The trouble is that the government does not understand or realize what being a parent is about.  It could care less.  This is what is going on in our country.  It is going on in our schools and our streets and still the government will turn a blind eye and say it is justified under artistic merit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the guts this government has. It will hide behind judges and it will hide behind interpretations such as artistic merit and say when this happens that it had no idea that this could take place and that the law will be made this way and will be interpreted this way by a judge.</p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet time after time on this side of the House members have stood up and told the government exactly what is going to happen.  It has still turned a deaf ear to it and decided it will pass it on by. That is a disgrace.  Not only is it a disgrace for the House, it is a disgrace for the country.</p><A NAME="Int-467845"></A><a HREF="#Int-467849"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467839"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos): </b>Is the House ready for the question?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from February 21 consideration of the motion that Bill C-23, an act respecting the registration of information relating to sex offenders, to amend the Criminal Code and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p><A NAME="Int-467856"></A><a HREF="#Int-467880"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467850"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, I rise today to take part in this important debate, which has been a long time coming.  Although this issue has been debated numerous times in the House, every time initiated by the Canadian Alliance, the official opposition, it is the first time an actual bill, Bill C-23,
  an act respecting the registration of information relating to sex offenders, has been the topic of discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood in the House more than two years ago in support of a Canadian Alliance motion requesting the establishment of a national sex offender registry.  Two years ago, that motion resulted in the government committing to the establishment of a registry. At that time, members opposite stood unanimously in support of their government's commitment to establish a national sex offender registry by January 30, 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite obviously the government again has failed to meet another commitment.  It failed to meet its commitment of having the sex offender registry up and running by January 2002.  I am confident that had we not pushed and prodded the government, it never would have met that commitment on its own accord. The time it has taken to force the government to bring Bill C-23 before the House clearly demonstrates to all Canadians and all parliamentarians the priority, or the lack thereof, that it places on the protection of our children in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ontario established a registry three years ago.  Christopher's law, or Bill 31, received royal assent in April 2000.  That bill established a registry to enhance public safety by providing law enforcement agencies with a modern, reliable and effective electronic tool to support services to track sex offenders in our communities and to improve the investigation of crimes of a sexual nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the efforts of Ontario and other provincial governments, the Liberal government has failed to protect Canadian children from sexual predators.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be the third time that I have stood in the House quoting from a document that was produced by the Liberal Party of Canada, produced before the 1993 election.  Before the election, their promise, their commitment and their vision sounded pretty good in the red book.  I quote this today because it is absolutely imperative that we point out the clear justification for a national sex offender registry as recognized not just recently but 10 years ago by those who now sit across the way in government.  Yet the government has moved very slowly.  It has done absolutely nothing to this point but fail to once again make good on a promise.  It has failed, and that is this government's record. It has a record of failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993 the Liberals fully supported the establishment of a national sex offender registry of convicted child abusers.  Their rationale, quoting directly from their own document, was this:</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government recognized  the chances of reoffending. It recognized that they were a threat. All those it recognized. These facts were highlighted three years prior to the publication of the Liberal document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 1990 report by a working group established by the Department of the Solicitor General concluded that offender treatment programs have shown limited results. The report said that they  gauged and  looked at the programs that were in place,  followed them through, did an evaluation and the programs showed limited results. The report showed that practitioners in the field of sex offender treatment do not claim to cure sex offenders. The Solicitor General's department in 1990, in a previous government, recognized that they  cannot simply claim to have 100% cured the sex offender, but rather the treatment strategy is to manage the risk of reoffending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That document says that although they will put them in a program, although they will give them treatment, at the end of the day they recognize that basically the best they can do is risk manage. I am not sure as a parent that I am quite satisfied with the response the report brought out, although it is true. As a parent it causes me some concern that people who recognize that programs are not working and recognize the recidivism rate are saying  they are going to risk manage pedophiles and sex offenders back into the communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report also said that there were not enough experts to meet the demand for sex offender treatment and the limitations of treatment were recognized. This research based information, produced by the Department of the Solicitor General, clearly demonstrated well over 10 years ago why Canada needed a national sex offender registry. Yet the government and its predecessor failed to establish such a registry despite recognizing the risks, despite the ample justification to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question must be asked, recognizing the rights, recognizing the risk, why would it  fail to meet such a requirement? The only plausible answer in my mind to that question is that the government has and continues to place the rights of the offender before the rights of the victim. It has  continuously placed the rights of the offender above the concerns of the protection of our society. We have seen this over and over and over again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is evident in almost all of the justice legislation the government  has  brought forward in the last few years, including the establishment of the DNA database. Enacted in 1998, Bill C-3, an act respecting DNA identification, created a new statute governing the establishment and the administration of a national DNA bank. It also amended the Criminal Code to permit a judge to make a post-conviction order authorizing the taking of bodily substances from a person found guilty of a designated Criminal Code offence in order to include the offender's DNA profile in the national DNA database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DNA data bank was officially opened on July 5, 2000. My party, the Canadian Alliance Party, is firmly committed to restoring confidence in our justice system by providing law enforcement officers and law enforcement agencies the latest technological tools to quickly detect and apprehend criminals. The attempt to amend Bill C-3 was unsuccessful. </p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in a day and age where every sector of society is looking for the newest technology available to enhance their way of life, to enhance their business, to enhance their safety perhaps, every aspect, every area of society. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at some of the things that are happening in health care and the new technologies that are available.  It has only been for a few years  that we have been  able to have laser surgery done on our eyes to repair loss of vision.  That is old technology now. Now health care has the technology to do many things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We demand high technology in travel.  There are  vehicles now with global positioning systems that can detect when there has been an accident.  When the air bag is inflated  a signal is sent automatically by satellite to an office and medical attention is called without ever making  a 911 call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society has moved to a place where we accept and want the latest in technology.  We see it.  We  have turned the television on in the last few days and we have seen the latest technology in the war on Iraq.  We have seen missiles being sent from hundreds of miles away.  We have seen the latest in laser guided missiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see it in health sciences with research and development.  We want the newest in technology.  However, when it comes to law enforcement, when it comes to dealing with crime, when it comes to dealing with criminal offences and offenders, the Canadian Alliance argued that DNA identification, if used to its full potential, could be one of the newest  technologies.  We argued that DNA identification could be one of the greatest resources in  fighting  crime since the introduction of dusting for fingerprints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deny the police agencies the full use of this technology, as Bill C-3, did was reprehensible.  It was unacceptable, inasmuch as it maintains an unnecessary level of risk to the lives and safety of our citizens. We have the technology.  We have the ability to fight crime.  When it comes to giving those resources to our law enforcement agencies, we handcuff them and then tell them to go out and do their job.  Shame on the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are literally hundreds of unsolved rapes.  Hundreds of murders are outstanding in the country.  There are victims across the nation where one event, one criminal offence has changed their life forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have looked into the faces of mothers whose children have been murdered, some who have been murdered in prison.  The twinkle in their eye is gone forever. When we talk with a parent whose young child has been sexually molested or raped, it  not only leaves a scar on the primary victim, the child, it scars that family and the extended family forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many dangerous offenders remain on our streets because of the government's failure to deploy the DNA tool properly as requested by police across the country.  Bill C-3 did not allow for the taking of DNA samples at the time of the charge.  The bill did not permit samples to be taken retroactively from incarcerated criminals, other than designated dangerous offenders or multiple sex offenders or multiple murderers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Bill C-3 did provide a dangerous and an unnecessary exemption that could be authorized by judges not to issue a warrant for the taking of a sample if they believed that in  doing so it would impact on an individual's privacy and security. Here again we see where the courts have the ability to disallow the taking of a DNA sample if that individual's privacy or security could be jeopardized.</p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This misplaced consideration for the privacy of offenders is more than apparent in the bill we are debating today.  It is more than apparent in Bill C-23.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sex offenders may be excluded from the registry, according to   Criminal Code section  490.03(4) as set out in clause 20, if the court is satisfied:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--that the person has established that, if the order were made, the impact on them, including on their privacy or liberty, would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest in protecting society through the effective investigation of crimes of a sexual nature, to be achieved by the registration of information relating to sex offenders.</small></td>

</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not all sex offenders will be successful in exempting themselves from the registry, this one thing we can be sure of:   many will delay having their names put on  that registry and many  will not register their whereabouts, arguing in court that  with regard to their privacy,   their liberty and   their freedom,  it would be too  negative an impact for them to handle. One thing we can be sure of is  we will see a log jam in the court system like we have never seen before.  The lawyers across the way sit back and wipe their hands and lick their chops.  This becomes a lawyer's dream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are not successful in convincing the judge that their names should not be on the registry, we can be sure  they will take their cases to the Supreme Court of Canada and they will string out those cases for just as long as they can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the papers just two days ago, one headline  read, “Rapist asks Supreme Court to strike down DNA law.  Lawyer argues sampling bodily substances violates constitutional rights”. The article went on to say:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence is contending that the DNA legislation breaches the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, that it hinders the protection of his personal security and that it should be banned because it was an unreasonable search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convicted rapist's lawyer is not arguing his client's innocence.  He is not arguing in a court of law that there has been a miscarriage of justice, that  the individual was innocent of the charge that was put against him.  He is arguing against how the police obtained the evidence to prove that he was guilty. He is arguing a technicality. </p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the wheels of justice grind slowly or they grind to a halt, our sons and daughters may be victimized all because the government continues to stack the deck in favour of the offender and the offence over the protection of society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of years ago the Supreme Court of Canada in a 5 to 4 decision held that privacy rights under the charter demanded that police obtain a warrant prior to entry into a dwelling house to arrest a suspect. The decision in response to the Feeney case resulted in evidence being thrown out because the police did not have a warrant when entering his premises. Feeney's blood soaked shirt which had been obtained by the police, and blood all over the place where this individual lived, clearly proved his guilt to the first degree murder charge. That shirt or that blood was not allowed as evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her dissenting opinion, Supreme Court Judge L'Heureux-Dubé said that while the rights of the accused people are certainly important under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, “they are not all the equation”. I like what the judge said. The judge did not question whether someone who was charged had rights under the charter. She did not question whether someone who was a suspect by the police force and who had a charge levied against them had rights.  She did not question whether the Charter of Rights and Freedoms applied. She said that it was only one part of the equation and not all the equation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That quote should be a wake-up call to the government. That quote should be a wake-up call to those who are continuously looking only at the rights of the offenders with  the rights of the victims forgotten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge cautioned her colleagues not to automatically exclude even illegally obtained evidence without considering the consequence for victims, the protection of society and the reputation of the justice system. She stated: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>When an attacker or a murderer is acquitted in the name of the regularity of the criminal process, it is not only past victims who are ignored, but also future victims who are sacrificed.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court judge boldly suggested that it was time to reassess the balance the court has struck between protecting the individual rights of the accused and preserving society's capacity to protect its most vulnerable members and to bring and to expose the truth. I challenge the government today to strike the necessary balance because as Judge L'Heureuz-Dubé said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--perhaps it is time to recall that public respect and confidence in the justice system lies not only in protection against police abuse, but also in the system's capacity to uncover the truth and ensure that, at the end of the day, it is more likely than not that justice will have been done.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I emphasize this, “it is more likely than not that justice will have been done”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is saying that when someone goes through the system, the public wants to look and have the faith that justice has been served. When we read about offenders back on the street because of technicalities, the public begins to question if justice was served. Did they come to justice?  Although they are very seldom ever satisfied when the offender is caught,  the public questions if there a degree of closure that can be brought to the victim because justice has been served. That is the question. That is the secondary part of the equation that needs to be considered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way we can ensure that justice is done is to ensure that police officers in Canada have all the investigative tools necessary to do their jobs effectively and to uncover the truth through the bringing together of all the evidence that they can gather.</p><A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will indeed be an injustice if the DNA warrant provisions are found unconstitutional.  It will indeed be an injustice if it severely restricted the use of DNA as evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 10 years ago six year old Punky Gustavson was kidnapped, sexually assaulted and then murdered.  The story captivated all the country, certainly my province of Alberta.  It was a story that, not only in Edmonton  where it happened  but throughout the province, horrified people as when they heard about little Punky Gustavson going missing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happened over 10 years ago.  Less than a week ago, Punky Gustavson's murderer was finally charged. In November of last year, an Alberta provincial court ordered that DNA sample be taken from Clifford Mathew Sleigh, who is a prisoner in the Bowden Institution.  That sample was matched with a very small sample of DNA that was taken in 1992 when Punky's body was found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated earlier, only three types of prisoners who were found guilty prior to June 2000, when the DNA data bank was created, were eligible to be included.  The first were those who were listed as being dangerous offenders.  The second was multiple murderers. The third was multiple sex offenders.  Across Canada 2,000 such offenders were identified. Three hundred of them were in Alberta prisons.  The Alberta court however had to obtain court orders for the seizure and inclusion of DNA from the 300 inmates as it was not automatic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance Party has argued that DNA samples should be automatic, should be retroactive  and should be taken from all convicted offenders.  Similarly, we have argued, not so successfully apparently, to have all convicted sex offenders retroactively entered into the registry.  However we will continue to push for the inclusion of all past and current sex offenders to be listed on the registry with absolutely no exceptions.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retroactively part of the bill is of huge concern to Canadians.  The fact that the government boasts of a registry with no names on it and the fact that the government boasts of a registry that for many years down the road will not help law enforcement is wrong. It is wrong for the minister to stand up in front of the House or in front of any television camera across the country and brag about how the registry, as soon as it is brought into legislation and is passed, will help.   Without retroactivity on that list, absolutely nobody will benefit.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will push to have any sex offender who fails to comply with an order to register to be held liable for a significant terms of imprisonment. Currently, clause 20 of Bill C-23 adds  subsection 490.09(1).  It states:</p>

<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend the definition of “pensionable employment” in the Canada Pension Plan to include worker's compensation payments. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion is designed to allow injured workers who have had to take temporary leave from their workplace to, on retirement, get the same level of CPP that they would have received had they not had to leave for a certain period of time because of injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is very simple and I believe it is very sensible.  I really cannot understand why the government has not already implemented this small but significant change to the CPP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand what the motion does,  we have to look at the problems that injured workers face relating to the pension system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, worker's compensation is not considered pensionable employment for CPP purposes. Since a retiree's CPP eligibility is based upon months of pensionable employment, each month of work a person misses due to injury counts against them when the CPP eligibility is calculated upon retirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of severe injuries that require lengthy rehabilitation periods, such as amputations, severe burns and electrocution, these lost months of CPP eligibility can dramatically reduce an individual's retirement income or leave them ineligible for any CPP benefits at all.  This is in essence a second injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPP program was created to provide Canadian workers with a secure retirement income.  There is no intention in the design of the public pension plan that workers would lose their pension simply because they had the bad fortune to be injured on the job.  This problem is in fact significant in size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nine provinces covered by the CPP, there were over 800,000 claims via worker's compensation in 2000.  The fact that these people could potentially lose or see a reduced retirement pension is, I believe, unacceptable.  After all, worker's compensation systems are designed to get people back into the workforce, and most treat their clients as workers temporarily on leave from their jobs.  That is of course how we should treat them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people want to work and they strive to work.  With the proper accommodation and support, most will work. The problem is with systems the governments have in place, like the CPP, that seem to treat injured workers as individuals who have deliberately opted out of the workforce and then reduce their retirement benefits accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the critic for persons with disabilities for the New Democrats, I see courage and determination every day and every week from people who have had to leave work due to a disability, including a workplace injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most frustrating to these people is not that they face life with a disability but that the public support systems that most Canadians take for granted, things like the CPP, public transit, health supports and income supports further penalize them on a systematic and repeated basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have a public pension plan which acknowledges that injured workers are simply on a temporary leave and therefore should not suffer a financial penalty of a reduced pension due to their injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since worker's compensation programs are provincially administered, implementation of the motion would require agreements with the provinces.  Passing Motion No.197 would therefore only be a first step.  It would nevertheless be an important first step as it would signal to the federal and provincial executive branches that there is a legislative support for the principle that injured workers should not have to suffer the loss of pension benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a huge problem because the provinces already meet with the federal government over CPP issues regularly and the provinces understand injured workers better than the federal government does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should note that the motion would have no impact on Quebec where a separate program administered by the Quebec government, the Quebec pension plan, takes the place of the CPP which exists in the rest of Canada.</p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I wholeheartedly support the motion, I want to also take the opportunity to discuss a parallel problem and situation: another group that suffers a similar penalty under the CPP, as injured workers currently do, and that is the group of caregivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 10 in <i>The Toronto Star</i> there was an article by Carol Goar  about a woman named Marie Taylor. I will quote a bit from Ms. Goar's succinct and well written article about Ms. Taylor's situation: </p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Taylor was not ill herself but she was caring for others who were ill. She is in the same situation that injured workers face and that Motion No. 197 is trying to address, namely, losing retirement benefits under the CPP because of temporary interruptions in a career. But in the case of Ms. Taylor, her workplace interruption was not because she was injured or ill, but because she became a caregiver during the terminal illnesses of her stepson and mother. If she had been callous and had left her family's care to the inadequacies of the Ontario health care system, then she would not have suffered this financial penalty. Instead, she did the right thing and therefore lost 20¢ on the dollar of her retirement income.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of caring for  loved ones, she is currently at the CPP appeals tribunal fighting for sufficient income so she can stay in her modest home and keep from sliding into poverty. Most shamefully, the federal government is fighting her all the way with its lawyers through its appeal system. The federal government should stop harassing this woman and intervene so she and other caregivers do not face penalties for caring for a dying relative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fairness, the government has started to see that caregivers deserve support, not punishment. I acknowledge that baby steps were taken on the employment insurance front in the budget, but our overall social safety net, both federally and provincially, has to be looked at so we can take away the barriers that persecute caregivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at welfare and disability programs, CPP and private insurance programs, and compassionate leave systems in the workplace. We need to institute a national home care and respite care program and reform our overly bureaucratic, financially unfair and almost incomprehensible income tax system. Other countries already have brought in these common sense, compassionate policies without causing economic problems. Some have even started to directly compensate caregivers, including Britain, Norway, Sweden and Australia, so a rethinking of our overall policy for both injured workers and for caregivers is not only doable but long overdue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, I say that injured workers need our support, not our punishment, that caregivers need our support, not our punishment, and that we should reform the CPP program in order to do this. Caregivers and injured workers do not deserve to be punished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once again thank my friend from Churchill for this visionary motion and I call upon the government and all members to support the motion and start the journey to a more compassionate society.</p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I commend the hon. member who sponsored this motion on her concern for Canadians who are prevented from working by a disability or a serious illness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out that this is an issue that the Government of Canada takes very seriously. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since coming into office, we have endeavoured  to find new and improved ways to help people with disabilities  so that they can adequately support themselves and their families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed programs to help workers with disabilities acquire the skills and training necessary to re-enter the labour force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we have introduced the Opportunities Fund  under which, every year since 1997, $30 million was  used to help persons with disabilities  take their place in the labour force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have introduced and enhanced tax relief measures for persons with disabilities and their families. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, we introduced the Canada study grants  for persons with disabilities, and increased the amount of  the grants in 2001.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In budget 2003, we renewed a transfer of $193 million a year for the employability assistance for people with disabilities program. This money will be transferred to the provincial and territorial governments to fund programs  and services designed to help Canadians with disabilities overcome employment barriers.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Minister of Human Resources Development and her colleagues are working closely with their provincial and  territorial counterparts to make sure there is a coordinated approach to meeting the needs of people with disabilities, one that will provide them with the best possible services and eliminate duplication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, one of the most important programs is the  Canada pension plan disability benefits program, which provides an income to contributors who are unable to work because of a serious long-term illness or disability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada pension plan is the most significant income program for people on long term disability. During fiscal year 2000, the Canada pension plan paid out $2.6 billion to 280,000 contributors with disabilities, and  $245 million to the 97,000 children of these contributors. No fewer than 55,000 applications are received each year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada pension plan offers more than just disability benefits. It also provides retirement pensions, death benefits, survivor benefits, and child benefits. Almost all Canadian residents contribute to the Canada pension plan and will eventually receive  benefits from it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly we must ensure that the Canada pension plan is able to continue this important work over the coming years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that we must ensure that it is financially viable and can count on the necessary assets to provide future generations of workers and their families with the same level of protection that their predecessors are now enjoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to do this is to ensure that the rules governing eligibility for benefits are relevant, clear and easy to administer and that they allow for the right balance between providing enough support to those who are entitled to the benefits and ensuring healthy management of Canadians' contributions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very good example that illustrates this principle is the clear and precise definition of “pensionable employment” contained in the Canada pension plan and intended to be used in determining eligibility for benefits and the amount thereof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This definition, which excludes compensation for workplace accidents, employment insurance benefits, social assistance and other benefits of this kind, has struck the right balance and shown that it is here to stay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This definition was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2000, when an applicant claimed that the workplace accident compensation he received should have been considered income for the purposes of eligibility under the Canada pension plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court's decision was very clear: Part I of the Canada pension plan is adequate and corresponds to the objective that was set out by Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other reasons that suggest that the proposed change is not relevant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, implementing such a change would lead to increased Canada pension plan contributions for both workers and employers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would place an additional burden on many workers already having trouble making ends meet. </p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might also act as a disincentive for some employers to hiring new workers, something no member of this House would want to see happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, this measure would have a negative impact on many workers' compensation recipients, because CPP would have to be deducted from their benefits, thus reducing their already pretty modest incomes still further. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are these results we would  want to see?  I think not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extension of CPP coverage to workers' compensation recipients might seem unfair, particularly to injured self-employed people who would not be entitled to it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if such a change were approved, it might have repercussions on such provincially administered programs as social assistance and worker's compensation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long term disability plans offered by private insurers would also be impacted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provincial and territorial governments might refuse to consent to such a change, and this would greatly complicate implementation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this points to the fact that the change proposed in this motion would not be as desirable as it might seem at first glance.  Worse yet, it might end up doing harm to those it seeks to help.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I cannot support the motion as presented, but I do congratulate the hon. member for her efforts and her determination to help disabled workers and their families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say again, this is an important matter which the government is determined to address, but everyone must do his or her part in this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore calling upon each and every member of this House, regardless of political affiliation, to work with us in our efforts to ensure that programs are put in place that can provide disabled persons and their families with the support they require to cope with their most challenging circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only way we will be able to find a satisfactory solution to this situation, and to provide Canadians with the help they need and deserve. </p>

I wish to congratulate her for bringing this forward.  Clearly, her intention is to help people who are facing difficult situations and this is admirable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the nature of the motion, being a motion, there is not a lot of detail attached to it.  We are talking about an intent when we talk about this.   Many questions are raised as a result of this proposal and in order for it to work those questions must be answered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the questions that I have yet to hear the mover of this motion or the previous speaker address has to do with CPP premiums themselves. For example, a logical question to ask would be whether moving WCB benefits would be counted as a salary to calculate Canada pension plan benefits? Would that mean that people would pay 4.95% of their WCB cheque into the Canada pension plan initially?  That important question needs to be addressed.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obvious follow up question would be,  if not, where would the money come from?  Right now, the Canada pension plan is running very close to the line.  Some people argue it is actually in deficit.  Where would that money come from? Where would the money come from on the employer side? Would provincial governments be expected to pay it?  If people were in business and drawing a salary, then they would pay 4.95% of their salary and the employer would pay 4.95% of the salary into this plan.  Those are some of the questions that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would we do about other types of benefits people receive where the same sort of arguments could be made? Canada pension plan disability is a good example.  If someone is on CPP disability, that money is not counted as a salary and therefore it would lower the overall Canada pension plan that the individual might be eligible for.  Do we then apply the same remedy for CPP disability as applied to WCB? The same thing would apply to private insurance because that is also not counted as a salary for the purpose of calculating Canada pension plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all important things that need to be addressed.  In order for me to support this motion I would like to at least hear how these sort of things could be addressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue that is important and one that we need to talk about to make it clear is the fact that a remedy is already in place to some degree for people whose Canada pension plan is lowered because at some point they were injured on the job and had to go on workmen's compensation.  When people hit retirement they do not just have access to the Canada pension plan because there are other safety nets in place, including old age security and the guaranteed income supplement for example. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If individuals have a low income in their retirement then these safety net programs supplement that income and take into account to some degree the lower Canada pension plan they might receive as a result of being injured on the job, going on workmen's compensation, and for a period of time at least, not contributing into their Canada pension plan and building up a level of benefits.  I do not think we should understate that because it is an important point to make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we go to all of this trouble, we may find out that people who all of a sudden enjoy better benefits from Canada pension plan may ultimately see it eroded or they may end up being no better off in the end because the benefits they would have received from old age security and/or the guaranteed income supplement may actually go down.</p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an important point to make. It requires a little bit of study in maybe a number of different scenarios to identify what would happen to these people who earn different amounts of income based on this change that is being proposed by the member for Churchill. We need those kinds of scenarios to have a good idea of whether or not in the end this would leave people materially better off, because that is obviously the goal here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think this can be overemphasized, but another problem we have and should address, which is something that would leave people better off generally, is that if people would pay lower taxes throughout the course of their lives, not only would it leave them better off in that moment, but it would allow them to save more for their retirement.  It would allow them to save more in the event that they become disabled and save more to purchase their own disability insurance. I always hasten to add that aspect when we are talking about social programs to help people because often that gets discounted as a way of helping people out a lot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It disturbs me today that in Canada people can have very low levels of income and still pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars in taxes. Perhaps we should be looking at  ways to raise those basic exemptions higher so that people who are already pinching pennies to survive do not have to send the government a big chunk of the benefits that they may receive through Canada pension plan, old age security or whatever. This is something that I would like all parliamentarians to consider. There is a way to help people beyond just providing better social programs.  One of those ways is to lower the level of taxes that we all pay. If we were to do that people would be better off in a number of ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the intention of the motion very much. I know the member for Churchill is a big-hearted person and she wants to help. That is admirable, but if we are serious about ever having this passed, the provinces, for instance, and certainly the federal treasury would want to have some of the answers to those questions I have raised with respect to how these payments would be treated.   Would the CPP premium come off these payments? Who would pay the other half of the CPP premium, would it be the provinces, et cetera? Those things must be addressed before this motion can get proper consideration.</p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

As my colleague, the member for Laurentides already said, the Bloc Quebecois supports Motion No. 197, which I will read again for the benefit of those who are listening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion No. 197 reads as follows:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend the definition of “pensionable employment” in the Canada Pension Plan to include worker's compensation payments. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that this is a simple question of justice. Why should victims of accidents at work and occupational illnesses be punished when they have already been victimized by negligence in the workplace? Under the CPP, workers can already subtract 15% of their employment period as leave. This makes it possible to increase the average earnings and the pension that will be collected at retirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for many workers who have a workplace accident or an occupational illness, this period is not enough. I think that in the interest of justice we must rectify this situation that currently exists in the Canada pension plan and render justice to those who, as I already mentioned, have already been punished  because of poor working conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of the government and the parliamentary secretary, in his comments, is completely unacceptable. The Liberal government is acting as though people who have workplace accidents or occupational illnesses are responsible for their own plight. The government is penalizing them again by refusing to recognize workers' compensation payments as though they were employment income.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, there has been consensus among employers, the government and workers and their organizations since 1920 that the employer is responsible for workplace accidents and occupational illnesses. People who have workplace accidents and occupational illnesses are not responsible for their accident or their illness. It is the employer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is up to the employer to pay and that is how it has been since 1920 in Quebec. People who have workplace accidents and occupational illnesses are not punished because they suffered as the result of problems in their workplace, in terms of workplace health and safety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the only social program where the federal government believes that the victims are responsible for their situation. Just as the Canada pension plan penalizes injured workers or workers with an occupational illness, employment   insurance penalizes people laid off by their employer due to an economic downturn—be it in the company, the industry or the whole economy—by imposing a waiting period, as if they were responsible for what has happened to them. The same backwards attitude applies to both this situation and the Canada pension plan. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the federal government is encouraging prejudice against injured workers or workers with an occupational illness. The government inundates us with propaganda and is constantly telling us that  discrimination is a no-no. It is guilty of discrimination in this case, as in the case of the unemployed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential, therefore, that the federal government fix this situation if it wants to do more than just pay lip service, to prove that injured workers and those with occupational illnesses are not responsible for their situation and, therefore, should not be penalized with regard to their pension under the pretext that they have suffered as a result of  a workplace accident or an occupational illness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason given—which was unfortunately taken up by the hon. member for the Canadian Alliance—is that this will increase premiums. This is the first time I have seen the federal government worry about the effects of a payroll tax on employment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a number of years now, with regard to employment insurance premiums, we—not just the Bloc Quebecois, but Quebec employers and unions—have been telling the government that the premium rate is much too high. The federal government has never reacted. I know that the Minister of Finance likes to boast that the rate has been lowered ten times already. Yes,  it has been lowered ten times, but it is still too high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the actuary did an assessment of the premium rate needed to ensure employment insurance coverage, he told us that it would take $1.75 per $100 of insurable earnings. Currently, the government is still taking $2.10, and the Minister of Finance announced in his budget that he was going to lower it to $1.98.</p><A NAME="T1400"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1400"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1400)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even at $1.98, the government is still collecting too much to ask from workers and employers in employment insurance premiums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment insurance premiums need to be lowered to correspond to the coverage in the plan. We know that out of ten workers who contribute, four are eligible for benefits and six are not, because of extremely strict rules imposed by this government. Let us lower employment insurance premiums and, if necessary, increase CPP contributions to do justice to people who are victims of workplace accidents  or occupational illness. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same argument is being made to us that was made 10 or 15 years ago when we were told that pay equity for women was unattainable. We were told that, in theory, this discrimination was unjustifiable, but that there was no money to do anything about it. That is what employers are telling us and today the federal government is saying the same thing. Unfortunately, the Canadian Alliance is stuck in its backward mentality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had listened to the federal government and used the arguments it is using today, we would not have gotten anywhere in the pay equity situation. It really dug in its heels, just as it is doing now in this and other situations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the federal government is sincere in its concern that an increase on payroll taxes or on contributions may have a negative impact on employment, it must, since it has the means to do so, lower EI contributions to do justice to those who are injured while at work and to those who suffer from occupational diseases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is using another argument that is just as unjustifiable when it says that self-employed workers may feel left out. One does not justify an injustice with another injustice. It is true that self-employed workers should be covered when it comes to social insurance. It is true that the government should be more innovative. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, Pauline Marois set an example in her most recent budget by granting a tax credit for parental leave to self-employed workers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the federal government says that it would not be fair to self-employed workers to include injured or sick people, since they themselves are not covered. There is an injustice here, but the government will create another one by penalizing those who are injured at work or who suffer from an occupational disease.  This reasoning is faulty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am extremely disappointed to hear the parliamentary secretary say, “We think that the initiative of the hon. member for Churchill is a good one, but she is going about this the wrong way”. Let the parliamentary secretary suggest other ways to achieve the same objectives. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until proven otherwise, the motion by the hon. member for Churchill is the right way to correct the injustice done to those who are injured while at work and to victims of occupational diseases. I am convinced that this fair measure would cost very little to Canadian society, and nothing to Quebec society, since we are not affected by this discriminatory and unfair situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary also claims that the Supreme Court issued a ruling to that effect. In Canada, do we live, as a number of people think, in a democracy run by judges, or is it  elected  representatives who are responsible for lawmaking? I do hope that it is still this Parliament, this House that has the last word regarding the vision and the structures that we want   for our society, particularly at the legislative level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it suits its needs, the federal government does not hesitate to retroactively amend  an act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give the example of school bus transportation. We will get to examine ways and means motions. In one instance, with respect to school bus transportation, the federal government changed the rules  after losing in court. It decided this change would be deemed to have come into effect on December 17, 1990. It does not bother the government when it comes to grabbing money that is intended for school boards in Quebec and Ontario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not make us laugh. If the federal government were serious about wanting to correct this injustice, it could correct it; instead, it is hiding behind the courts. I hope that it will be equally consistent in the ways and means motion and remove the GST retroactivity for school boards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the arguments we have heard from the government side hold water. Simply put, in this case, as with the guaranteed income supplement and the tax credit for persons with disabilities, this Liberal federal government does not care about the people. This is a heartless government. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all hon. members in this House, I hope, the Bloc Quebecois will be voting in favour of the motion put forward by the hon. member. </p><A NAME="T1405"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1405"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1405)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

I congratulate the member for Churchill for having taken this important initiative to remedy what clearly is an injustice and a sort of double injury to workers who are injured or diseased on the job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is an accident that the member for Churchill has taken this initiative.  Not only is she a health care worker who has seen injured and diseased workers being discriminated against in a very particular way, but she also represents a riding that  is very heavily dependent upon resource industries.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well-known fact that a great number of workers are injured in the course of doing their jobs in the mining sector  for example, and in the forestry sector.  I believe the forestry sector has the highest incidence of worker injuries of any economic sector.  She of course has seen the amount of hardship that is imposed on people's lives through any discriminatory measures that are inherent in our current public policies. I congratulate her for bringing the concerns forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course it is self-evident that if there is discrimination economically against individual injured workers and a higher incidence of injury in the workplace in a particular area, then it becomes a matter that has a discriminatory effect economically on the whole community.  Therefore, it is first and foremost a bill that attempts to address the negative economic impact, the double penalty in effect, on injured workers for their Canada pension plan benefits to be affected negatively in the future, but it is also an attempt to remedy the fact that there is a discriminatory impact in some cases on particular communities that are dependent upon industries where there is a higher level of workplace injury or disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think  members are very clear on  the purpose of the bill.  It is quite a straightforward, simple remedy that is being proposed here. My colleague from Dartmouth has reminded us that what is being sought by the Churchill member's bill is an amendment to the definition of what constitutes pensionable employment for purposes of determining one's future Canada pension plan benefits.  This is really a matter of simple justice.  I do not think those of us in this corner of the House like to use the terminology common sense as it conjures up images of the Mike Harris government, but it really is a reasonable measure that is fairly straightforward to deal with a form of discrimination that exists now that rears its ugly head in one's retirement years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a Canada pension plan in the first place, something we should be proud of, something for which the New Democratic Party fought very long and hard  in the early years to get into place and continues to fight hard to ensure is maintained at adequate levels so that seniors are lifted out of poverty, but also that it remains in the public domain.  This has not been an easy struggle in the current climate.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I think there is reason to be optimistic that we have turned the corner somewhat on a climate over the last 10 years which has constantly eroded the value of our public provisions, like the Canada pension plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pension is in place because it recognizes that all workers should have the opportunity and  the responsibility to contribute to a pension plan that will be in place for them in their senior years.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that because pensionable income is not now defined to include workers' compensation benefits, we have the situation where workers, first, suffer the penalty of being injured or diseased in the workplace, then   second,  find themselves unable to have their workers' compensation benefits deemed to be pensionable so that there is the double injury, and then third, when they reach the retirement years, find their pensions are actually lower than they would otherwise have been.</p><A NAME="T1410"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1410"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1410)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  clearly does  not meet the intentions of the Canada pension plan, nor is it simple justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know  that several other members who have spoken have taken the opportunity, which  is perfectly in order, to raise some concerns about  other aspects of our broad income security system,  our  disability pensions and unemployment insurance provisions, all of which have effectively been under assault by the government in a number of different ways.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we need to be clear that with respect to this particular issue we  are talking about recognizing that workers who are injured or diseased on the job, through no fault of their own,  find themselves unable to go to work and therefore the substitute income, which is in place and to which they and their employer have contributed, should be considered pensionable income for calculating the level of their Canada pension plan benefits when they reach their retirement years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Alliance members never fail to take an opportunity, and in this I guess we can say at least they are consistent. It is as if every single problem that presents itself is best solved by lower taxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I think it is a ridiculous to go down that path when we are talking about dealing specifically with a pan-Canadian Canada pension plan and the very particular way in which workers' compensation income is calculated, or, in this case, fails to be calculated, for the purpose  of determining the pension for which they are eligible in their senior years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It  really is a matter of agreeing that there is an important principle:    workers should not be discriminated against in their retirement years because they suffered a workplace injury or disease.  It is not as though we do not know how to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that the Alliance member said that he understood  the problem and that he was interested in knowing how it could be solved  but that   a lot of questions needed to be addressed  to solve it.  That is fair game.  That is part of our jobs as members of Parliament. If we are going to support a particular measure we should know how the  matter can be dealt with. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take the opportunity to say, without hesitation, that one fortunately can look at the Province of Quebec and say that it has already addressed the problem.  It is my understanding that the Quebec government,  in having availed itself of the opportunity to opt out of the Canada pension plan, has put in place its own Quebec pension plan to address the  problem. It  recognized   the discriminatory element in the current workers' compensation program in every other province and it  simply said that there ought to be the opportunity for  injured or diseased workers who are on workers' compensation to  maintain their level of contributions to the Canada pension plan.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question was raised by government members as well. How would it be paid for?  I am not saying that the way in which the Quebec government is now paying for this is the only way to do it but I think it does show that the Quebec government has recognized the double injury involved and said that through  the CSST, basically the health and  social security commission, that provision will be made to pay for those benefits.  That in turn removes the discriminatory element.  Perhaps there are other ways in which it can be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate a point that the member for Churchill and every other member who has spoken from the NDP caucus in support of this private member's bill have made, and that is that this is not a simple matter of the federal government legislating a solution.   </p><A NAME="T1415"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1415"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1415)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a case of where there is a federal presence in the Canada pension plan.  There are provincial workers compensation programs.  Clearly, we would have to negotiate the way in which this would be implemented. Quebec has already shown that where there is a will there is a way.  There is every reason for the provinces to be receptive to this important improvement in the existing provisions for injured workers who are being discriminated against under the Canada pension plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope other members will continue to help us address the problem.  It is fundamentally a moral issue that has to do with treating all Canadian workers equally.</p><A NAME="Int-467912"></A><a HREF="#Int-467916"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-467900"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC): </b>Madam Speaker, I will say a few brief words on this topic in support of the motion. Why I say they will be a few brief words  is that  I think we talk too much about issues such as  this  one and we do not do enough about them. An issue such as this should not be one that we have to debate for hours, days, weeks, months or years as has been happening.  It should be a cut and dried issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is  the type of country that leads to people being injured on the job because   Canada is a country of very rich resources. Developing resources is always dangerous work, whether it is working in the mines, working in relation to hydro developments,  working offshore or  working  in the fishery and  I could go on and on.  All of these professions cause one to be working in dangerous situations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even  working in what we call ordinary everyday work can  lead to someone slipping and falling and injuring oneself.  Often    people can be out of the workplace for quite some time. This  means that  the total amount of Canada pension down the road is diminished according to the number of years the person is out of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person is  still considered as an active person in the workplace, not someone who has quit or was fired or whose job ran out.  The person   not working in a specific position simply because he or she has been  injured. The person will return to the position whenever he or she is fit and is cleared by the appropriate doctors to go back to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime the time off, which  unfortunately sometimes  can be considerable, is not factored in in relation to Canada pension.  Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only legitimate argument I hear is that the employer who is involved will have to hire someone else to replace the person who is off.  That is understandable.  It would be very unfair to ask the employer to pay Canada pension premiums for the new worker who is doing  the job and pay Canada pension premiums for someone who is  listed as a  worker in that factory or whatever, but is unable to work  or assist the employer because he or she  is off on workers compensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I ask is, why should the employer have to pay?  I do not think the employer should have to pay.  There is no reason to double the burden of the employers who are hit by two great premiums in relation to Canada pension, and particularly in relation to employment insurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other options if premiums must be paid.  Certainly, one is the government and some will say, “Well, that is people again  doubling up on it”.  A proper mechanism could be  put in place in consultation with  the three parties involved,   the employer, who I will say up front I do not think should be handed any extra burden, the government and the person who is directly involved. It would not be unreasonable  with  the amount of money we are talking about here to  give somebody the option of having his or her time count toward possible Canada pension benefits down the road and  benefiting from that provided they were willing to pay the double premium.  It is basically an insurance for the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unreasonable whatsoever.  It is not a major additional burden on the individual who has been injured.  What it does do is it certainly enhances the income of that person down the road when the days, months or years he or she is off on workers compensation are now counted as time toward the drawing of Canada pension benefits.</p><A NAME="T1420"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1420"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1425"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1420)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere in between there is an answer. Instead of arguing and fighting and saying yes, it is hard, why do all parties involved not sit down and find a solution? I am sure we can, and in an amount of time similar to the time we have spent discussing this here in the House, unless we bring in a pile of bureaucrats. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I solidly support this. I see a lot of people, particularly people who are working in positions that do not have great pay, who are doing very ordinary work and making a very ordinary wage and  suddenly find themselves trying to live on the 80% that some provinces pay, or somewhere in that vicinity. It is difficult enough to be sick or hurt and trying to live on less money. However we cut it, it is less money. People might say that they do not have to pay any extra amount for benefits and so on, but a lot of the benefits we pay into come back to us one in way or another. If we are not paying in they are not going to come back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is bad enough to be in that position, but let us look at people who in 10 or 5 or maybe 2 years' time  are finishing up work and looking toward their meagre Canada pensions and who find that pension reduced significantly, especially if it was  in their latter years of work, because they were on workers' compensation. In reality, they were not out of work through any choice of their own, because of layoffs or because they quit or because they did not want to work. They were out of work because they were injured. In reality, they  are really still on the lists of the unemployed as it affects the companies with which they would have worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly think there is a solution here, one that could be found quickly if the will were there. Again, I and my party  solidly support this suggestion provided that it is done without the extra onus on the employers, many of whom are small business people who are having it tough enough with government red tape, bureaucracy and regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe we could do two things here. Let us zero in on this matter and, realizing how easily something like this could be solved, maybe it will give government the incentive to look back and say to itself that maybe it could solve a lot of problems negatively affecting the people in our country if it would sit down and, with a bit of common sense, deal directly with these problems.  It could change or cut out the foolish regulations in place that  delay  and procrastinate, or  it could implement new fine-tuned regulations that can cut quickly through red tape and bureaucracy. Perhaps for a change we can get down to one-stop shopping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An issue came up the other day.  It dealt with a relatively small issue in fisheries. In order to deal with the topic, which we should be able to do with a snap of our fingers, seven different departments had to be consulted because there were seven different pieces of legislation dealing with a very minuscule topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in relation to the development of the offshore in Newfoundland and Labrador, and I am sure this is true in the development of other resources in other places, if we want to do some exploration, I understand, we must deal with either 13 or 14 boards, agencies and departments. From the time the first application is initiated until a permit is issued, we are looking at at least two years, if we are lucky. We can imagine the time and effort that companies have to put in for two years, whereas in Norway they deal with one organization. It is inconceivable the number of burdens that we put on our people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a lesson from that. Let us start right here and let us get this one out of the way.</p><A NAME="T1425"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1425"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1425)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-467916"></A><a HREF="#Int-467912"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos): </b>The time provided for the consideration of private members' business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
