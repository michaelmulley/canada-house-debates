	The House resumed from May 3 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-43, an Act to amend the Lobbyists Registration Act 
and to make related amendments to other Acts, be read the third 
time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in the debate at 
third reading of the bill on lobbyists. I think that it is important 
to reflect on the role of lobbies. Their role is essentially to 
attempt to influence the positions taken by the government and 
parliamentarians on policy issues and to defend private 
interests.
<P>
	I would also say that lobbyists end up reducing the direct 
influence that citizens have on their representatives. We have 
seen some instances of this in the past year, for example the 
lobby that formed around the somatotropin issue. One company 
that wanted to see somatotropin approved went so far as to hire a 
manager who was on leave without pay to lobby the government 
machine. There are also very obvious cases where Canadian 
banks are systematically making representations to MPs in an 
effort to either effect changes or to maintain the status quo in 
taxes and regulations.
<P>
	I do not think that anyone is against the fact that lobbyists 
exist. The same thing goes on in all parliaments. What should be 
looked at, however, is their methods, because so many things 
have come about mysteriously in the past which could have been 
the result of lobbying. Parliamentary history, be it in Canada, 
England, the United States, or almost anywhere else in the 
world, is characterized by blatant examples of this. This has led 
other parliaments to reflect on the best way to monitor this 
activity to prevent abuses.
<P>
	Other examples of this have cropped up recently in the news 
here in Canada. For instance, there is the connection between the 
Liberals, Power Corporation and certain decisions. Today, it is 
DTH television services. Yesterday, it was the railways. It is 
always there and it is always connected with important 
decisions. Under the Conservatives a major debate began on this 
issue because the Tory party was very close to the business 
community and there had been quite a few instances of practices 
that were doubtful, to say the least, the latest and most notorious 
example being the privatization of Pearson airport.
<P>
	During the election campaign, the Liberal Party promised that 
it would make some major changes in this respect, and that was 
before it formed the government. Unfortunately, Bill C-43 is a 
typical example of much ado about apparently nothing. They 
promised us a transparent system, and what we get is, for 
instance, an ethics counsellor appointed by the Prime Minister 
and accountable to the Prime Minister. To the Bloc, this does not 
denote transparency. It is not the way to establish a code of 
conduct and restore public confidence in our democratic 
institutions, because how can you ask an ethics counsellor who 
is appointed by the Prime Minister to judge the actions of the 
government and the Prime Minister?
<P>
	In the past, in fact this year, we saw situations where the ethics 
counsellor was put on the spot when he could not really give an 
independent opinion. We would have preferred the government 
to consider the Bloc's recommendations, including a request 
that the ethics counsellor be appointed by Parliament so that he 
or she is directly accountable to the members of this House and 
is free to criticize the government and in fact any 
parliamentarian, irrespective of the connection that is there.
<P>
	We have a situation where a lobbyist approaches a member of 
the government, the counsellor evaluates the government's 
transparency in all this, gives an opinion and then reports to the 
Prime Minister who is himself a party to the case.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12238"> 12238 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	This is entirely unacceptable, and perpetuates the image that 
politicians are always looking out for their own interests. I think 
this government will assess this later on during debate. I think 
there is support in Canada to improve the situation, and the bill 
does not satisfactorily do so. Considering the commitments the 
Liberals had set out in the red book, it was very clear that they 
wanted to go a lot further.
<P>
	Once it crossed the floor, how is it that the government did not 
manage to drop its old habits? We can only guess at what 
influenced it. I think the answer lies in the fact that, in Canada, 
political party funding is still very unstructured. Companies, 
unions, groups and pressure groups can all contribute to party 
funding. So, once a party is in power, it is forced to pay careful 
attention to the comments and suggestions of those who funded 
it.
<P>
	I think that the big companies, such as the Canadian banking 
network, for example, want to make sure that their lobbyists 
have a lot of leeway.
<P>
	We parliamentarians must ask ourselves the following 
question: Is this advantageous for Canadians? It is advantageous 
for Quebecers to leave all this leeway to lobbyists and to end up 
cancelling out the direct effect the public must have on the 
people they elected to represent them?
<P>
	The second indication that a government has not let go of its 
old habits is the action of the lobbyists themselves. They are a 
highly polished group. We can see very clearly in the business of 
the Pearson airport that lobbying firms have interchangeable 
people. When the government changes, they have someone from 
the right family and the right school, who has access to a 
particular ear. When another party comes to power, they bring 
out of mothballs someone from the right family and thus ensure 
uninterrupted influence.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois feel that the government should 
have given a much stronger message to the public that it wanted 
to ensure that the people of Canada were the primary agents of 
democracy and that they had the greatest influence on their 
members. To this end, we made some very constructive 
suggestions, which the government rejected. This is rather sad.
<P>
	Let me give you examples of that situation. The Bloc 
Quebecois is in favour of registration for lobbyists, regardless 
of the tier to which they belong. Currently, some lobbyists make 
representations to ministers, while others are in contact with 
senior officials or MPs.
<P>
	The existing rules regarding the disclosure of the fact that 
these people are lobbyists vary. These people should all have to 
register in the same manner, so that we know exactly who is 
lobbying, not just those who are paid specifically to do it, but 
also all those who do it under cover, as director of public 
relations, director of governmental relations, etc. We want to 
have an accurate and comprehensive overview of the situation.
<P>
	It is important, for reasons of transparency, to know about all 
the activities and dealings which relate to government contracts. 
Lobbyists should be required to disclose, on a regular basis, 
which contracts they are working on, so that we could have a 
clear idea of how such representations are made and how 
contracts are awarded. The process must appear relatively fair, 
and there must be sufficient transparency to be able to determine 
whether the most deserving group or company was awarded a 
contract, in compliance with acceptable standards and criteria.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	We also think that meetings with senior officials should be 
reported. After being elected to the House of Commons 18 
months ago, one of the first changes I noticed compared to my 
previous job was that lobbyists were calling us and knocking on 
our doors asking, ``Could we meet with you to discuss this or 
that situation?''
<P>
	I think that this type of relationship with elected officials is 
normal and should be reported. What is a little more nebulous, 
however, is the representations made to senior officials. One of 
the ways lobbyists can exert influence is by becoming involved 
in the drafting of bills or regulations before decisions are made.
<P>
	It would be interesting to receive a list of these interventions 
to see whether or not a given clause has been included in a bill as 
a result of lobbying. The disclosure requirement alone may even 
reduce the number of such meetings. Again, I think it would be 
interesting because it would allow elected officials to have more 
control over, and more direct contact with, senior officials, thus 
allowing the people they represent to exert, through them, 
greater influence on the work done by senior officials.
<P>
	Therein may lie one of the causes of the current situation in 
which high level bureaucrats, senior public servants, often seem 
to govern through a third party and exert some control over 
ministers instead of the other way around. Much about this type 
of influence remains unknown and unclear at the present time.
<P>
	Another decision, which was suggested by the Bloc and 
which, I think, is very important because money has been 
described as the root of war, is to eliminate tax deductions for 
lobbying expenses.
<P>
	Paradoxically, companies can now obtain tax deductions for 
lobbying expenses often incurred to influence policies to their 
advantage even when these policies are not in the public 
interest. It is a government incentive to spend money on this 
kind of lobbying, while ordinary citizens trying to get organized 
to apply pressure often cannot obtain similar services.
<P>
	We could look at this in the context of the ongoing debate on 
gun control, without getting into too much detail. There is 
lobbying around this issue, lobbying by those who want more 
gun control and by major associations which oppose gun 
control. For my part, what  I see mainly is citizens trying to 
express opinions, one way or the other, on this issue. But they 
cannot 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12239"> 12239 </A></B>
<P>
exert the same influence, mainly because the companies or 
corporations on either side of the debate can claim income tax 
deductions for their lobbying expenses, while the residents of a 
village cannot.
<P>
	Here is an example. I met in 
Saint-Médard-de-Rivière-du-Loup, a locality in my riding, 
with 25 or 30 people who wanted to talk to me about this bill. It 
was not possible for them to form an organized group and defray 
the cost this entails. Still, they had worthwhile arguments that 
made good horse sense to put forward and they should be given 
the chance to do so.
<P>
	That is why I think it would be important to reinstate the 
relative balance between stakeholders and one good way of 
doing so would be to stop encouraging companies to hire 
lobbyists by making sure that no tax deduction can be claimed 
for this purpose, as it acts as an incentive to hire lobbyists.
<P>
	How could we finally get a government that would stand up 
and seriously tackle problems like this one? This would have a 
direct impact on the way people perceive their elected 
representatives. Just look at the degree of confidence the people 
have in their elected representatives, I would say it is far from 
satisfactory and we have to do something about it. One way is to 
show all Canadians that there is no hidden force acting within 
the system, that nobody has more power than they should have 
because of the rules of the system.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	What fundamental change should be made? It all boils down 
to party financing. If we want a responsible government that will 
make changes in this area, we have to make sure that political 
parties do not owe anything to anybody. We have this model in 
Quebec where only individuals can contribute to the financing 
of political parties, which makes the government much more at 
arm's length with companies, unions and other groups.
<P>
	If federal political parties would agree to this kind of 
financing, the party elected to office would be under a lot less 
pressure in terms of keeping its election promises, instead of 
feeling the kind of pressure that has forced this government to 
introduce such a weak bill.
<P>
	The subcommittee report on Bill C-43 is coyly entitled 
``Rebuilding Trust''. The way to rebuild trust is to make sure 
that the public knows everything there is to know and has an 
complete overview of the situation, that there is nothing secret 
going on. The only way to achieve this goal would have been for 
the government to do almost exactly what it had promised 
during the election campaign so that Canadians could see a clear 
relationship between what the Liberals said and what they are 
doing.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in this case as in several others, this 
government has a double standard. It campaigned to be elected, 
but today it is implementing the agenda of a party that the public 
completely rejected, that is the  Conservative Party. This is as 
true in the case of lobbyists as in the other areas. This is why the 
Bloc Quebecois is very disappointed with the choices made by 
the government and wants the public to be aware of it. For once, 
it can be said that this has nothing to do with the constitutional 
or with the national issue.
<P>
	We should realize that for the federal Parliament to serve 
Canadians well-and this is true for any provincial legislature, 
any government-the appearance of justice and the citizens' 
confidence in government are of critical importance. But as with 
many other issues, the government has lost an opportunity to 
make history. It is our hope that it will have the courage to go 
back to the drawing board.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the comments of my colleague from the Bloc. I note with 
interest that the Liberals promised great openness, great honesty 
and great accountability in their now infamous red book. I read 
that they will appoint an independent ethics counsellor who will 
report directly to Parliament. They say they will not allow the 
public agenda to be dominated by lobbyists as it has been since 
the Conservatives took office.
<P>
	I invite my hon. colleague to comment on whether or not he 
thinks openness, accountability and independence have been 
achieved.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that the criteria of the 
government's accountability and independence vis-à-vis 
lobbyists have not been met. The reasons are outlined in the 
Bloc Quebecois's minority report which also proposes 
solutions.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	The report prepared by the Reform Party, which believes that 
the Liberal report has two major shortcomings, namely 
insufficient disclosure and the way the ethics counsellor is 
appointed and his accountability, concurs with the report by the 
Bloc Quebecois as far as these problems are concerned. 
However, perhaps because of the expertise acquired in Quebec 
concerning the financing of political parties, the Bloc 
Quebecois went much further, making some concrete proposals 
that may improve the situation. Having listed these proposals in 
my speech, I will not repeat them. But as we are about to enter 
the next century and we see that governments have less and less 
control over international decisions and the way things are done, 
I believe this will be one of the criteria people will use in 
determining whether their government is doing its best to ensure 
adequate development for their country.
<P>
	People can understand that we can no longer control all the 
variables and that we live in a very complex world, but they will 
never accept that those variables may be controlled by others 
than their elected representatives. I believe that, in choosing 
their representatives, voters will systematically come back to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12240"> 12240 </A></B>
<P>
the following criterion: they will want to make sure that their 
elected officials really represent them and are not continuously 
influenced, with varying degrees of transparency, by lobbies 
that do not reflect the opinions of the electorate.
<P>
	Having been made aware, since I was elected, of all the twists 
and turns involved in bringing about a policy decision, it is 
obvious that what people want is for their elected 
representatives to have control of what is going on and not 
simply be the puppets of people who have received no mandate 
from the voters. I think that the government will have to go back 
to the drawing board. I do not know whether it will have the 
courage to do so during this Parliament, but this whole issue will 
surely remain a fundamental one for voters, and the suggestions 
that were made by the Bloc Quebecois in its minority report will 
prove to be an interesting guide in this respect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the remarks of the hon. member, 
and I think he did a very good job of pointing out the problems 
with this bill, and more particularly the fact that it does not go 
far enough. Members of the official opposition have been 
receptive to representations and comments made by the public 
during committee hearings. I was one of those who attended 
most of the hearings of the committee on lobbying. What struck 
me the most is that people want more openness in the public 
sector. They do not trust politicians any more. They said it quite 
bluntly: We do not trust politicians. We have the definite feeling 
that all the decisions made on Parliament Hill-or at any other 
level of government, but let us deal with our own House 
first-are made to serve the personal interests of politicians. 
That is what people told us. It is quite clear and easy to 
understand.
<P>
	I think Bill C-43 was an opportunity for us, as politicians, to 
demonstrate our commitment to openness. We had an 
opportunity to pass a bill on lobbyists that would clearly show 
that we are not here to advance our own interests or those of the 
government's buddies. That was the very praiseworthy goal of 
Bill C-43, but the government did not take the necessary steps to 
reach that goal.
<P>
	With Bill C-43, we had a chance to really shed some light on 
what goes on on Parliament Hill, but we let it slip by. One thing 
we could have done to promote openness and show Canadians 
how serious we are on this issue would have been for the House 
to have a say in the appointment of the ethics counsellor, and for 
the bill to stipulate that our code of conduct was binding, just 
like the one lawyers have. I am a lawyer myself and, when I used 
to practice law, our corporation had an official whose job it was 
to slap us on the wrist if we misbehaved. I think we should have 
taken this opportunity to develop a binding code of conduct to 
ensure some kind of supervision.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Instead, we will end up with a non binding code of conduct 
written by an ethics counsellor appointed by the Prime Minister, 
in other words, with a document that is just so many empty 
words.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned some issues and current events. 
My question is: Does he agree that, if we had had an ethics 
counsellor appointed by the House, accountable to the House, 
with the statutory instruments needed to enforce the law and 
ensure openness, would the goal set out in Bill C-43 have been 
reached and better defined? Could the hon. member provide an 
answer to my question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Indeed, Mr. Speaker, I believe this is a symbolic 
example of the situation regarding the ethics counsellor.
<P>
	I would like to remind you of a sentence which was in the red 
book of the Liberal Party of Canada. It says: ``The integrity of 
government is put into question when there is a perception that 
the public agenda is set by lobbyists exercising undue influence 
away from public view''. Hence, what our citizens want, 
according to the Liberal red book, is better information on the 
influence of lobbyists.
<P>
	Opting for an ethics counsellor appointed by the Prime 
Minister and accountable only to the Prime Minister, is like 
saying that the person who is going to look into the situation has 
a direct tie with the one who might be implicated. This shows 
concretely that Liberals did not go to the core of things and did 
not deal, in a definite, long term way, with a situation which is 
unacceptable to the people.
<P>
	This is something we had been trying to deal with following 
the last election campaign, and I repeat that Liberals will be 
accountable to the people for not having used the solutions 
which, in the end, were the results of a consensus in our society.
<P>
	Today, the decisions needed are very complex and we have to 
make sure that things are open enough and that the people who 
are going to pass judgment have an independence somewhat 
similar to the one enjoyed by the auditor general. If the auditor 
general were not independent of the government, do you think 
that he could systematically report on the government's 
efficiency like he is now doing? A new auditor general would be 
brought in before he could get a second report out. The same 
goes for the ethics counsellor. The Prime Minister will either 
give him a very limited role or he will simply be obliged to give 
in to pressure from the lobbyists and, in this way, serve to cloak 
their activities even more. We have before us a perfect 
example-the MP's question is quite germane-of the fact that 
the government did not fulfil its mandate and that is the main 
reason the Bloc Quebecois will not support this bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12241"> 12241 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The five hours provided for debate 
have now expired. We are now entering the ten minute period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
everybody knows that it is high finance that controls the 
government.
<P>
	If Bill C-43 had had more teeth, it could have had the merit of 
keeping this pack of predators at bay.
<P>
	The hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm, my Bloc 
Quebecois colleague, introduced a series of amendments which 
would have effectively caged them in, but the Liberals rejected 
them all. How can they possibly hope to control the situation 
when they, like negligent shepherds, have flung the doors of the 
fold wide open, turning a blind eye to the hungry wolves killing 
off every last lamb in the flock, one by one?
<P>
	Let us not kid ourselves. If Bill C-43 is passed as is, the 
government will not be able to pry open the stranglehold that the 
lobbyists have on the affairs of the state.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	They will still be able to promote their own interests as they 
influence major decisions that should be made in the best 
interests of the people of this country. In the debate on this bill, 
the very credibility of our democratic system is at stake. We 
know and we said this earlier, that the public does not have a 
very high opinion of politicians. This attitude extends beyond 
elected representatives to include our institutions as well.
<P>
	With Bill C-43, the Liberal government had a good 
opportunity to keep its promises and promote the transparency 
of our political life and our democratic system. Unfortunately, 
these promises will never be kept if it depends on hon. members 
opposite. They reject all amendments. They reject all the good 
ideas my colleagues submitted, although these were proposed in 
a spirit of co-operation, not as a way to score points.
<P>
	My colleague submitted amendments based on the concept 
that democracy is the only valid system of government. We in 
the Bloc Quebecois believe that democracy is sacred. It is the 
only system we accept and practice, and we uphold its 
principles. The aim of democracy is to promote the public good. 
In a real democracy, governments are elected to manage the 
country's assets in the best interests of its citizens.
<P>
	The aim of a genuine democracy is to ensure that all citizens 
have a chance to pursue their dream of individual happiness. In a 
democracy, this dream of individual happiness and success 
could be called the DIH. Today, the only thing that counts for 
this government is the GDP, the Gross Domestic Product or 
whatever contributes to the well-being of the financial 
community, the lobbyists, wolves whose only purpose in life is 
to feed on helpless sheep.
<P>
	In a democracy, we all have the right to express our opinions. 
We have the right to promote and defend our interests, but we do 
not have the right to do so at the expense of our fellow citizens. 
However, that is exactly what is happening, and that is why 
public confidence in our institutions has hit a new low. 
Lobbyists for the financial sector manage to get government 
contracts through secret negotiations. They manage to influence 
government policy to further their own interests.
<P>
	A good example is the fact that the wealthy in this country 
hardly pay any income tax. The rich can set up family trusts and 
avoid paying their fair share of taxes. The reason for this is 
simple: they have access to government and they use their 
influence. Our democracy is no longer being run by a group of 
individuals who have been elected to serve the community. It is 
governed in the utmost secrecy behind closed doors and on the 
sly.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois agree with the need to restore 
people's faith in their institutions. I also believe that many of my 
colleagues opposite feal the same way, but I think the 
government is not willing to do the job. Since its election, the 
government has not been particularly transparent. A number of 
matters hint at the possibility of there being determinant outside 
influence, such as the matter of the Pearson airport in Toronto, 
for example.
<P>
	However, what finally convinced me about the government's 
lack of willingness was the $400 a plate dinner in Montreal on 
May 3 given by the Liberal Party of Canada. You will never 
convince me that only Liberal partisans were involved. There 
surely were lobbyists there as well. Rest assured, Mr. Speaker, 
however, that there was no one, not even a Liberal, from 
Sainte-Irène, and there were no fishermen from Grosse-Roche. 
The people clearly remember the promises in the red book, but 
government leaders seem to have forgotten them.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	If Bill C-43 were improved, it might mean greater 
transparency. A stronger bill, one with teeth, could at least 
increase public confidence somewhat. This was the aim of the 
amendments proposed by my colleague for 
Berthier-Montcalm.
<P>
	In the case of the ethics counsellor, we in the Bloc propose 
that the person be accountable to the House of Commons, like 
the auditor general. The ethics counsellor must be independent 
and have his or her hands free to act, otherwise he or she would 
be subject to lobbyist influence. It would be a complete waste of 
time to appoint an ethics counsellor who could be influenced by 
outside forces. Such a gesture could only increase the mistrust 
of people for their own institutions.
<P>
	Moreover, we recommend that there be only one category of 
lobbyists. Why differentiate? A lobbyist is an individual who, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12242"> 12242 </A></B>
<P>
on behalf of a group or a company, tries to influence the 
government. Are some motives more commendable than others? 
Certainly not, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Lobbyists do not seek to improve the well-being of the 
community, they are hired to defend particular interests or to 
represent interest groups. I do not believe that creating different 
categories can be justified. If governing was adding up all the 
interests at stake, I would understand, but in a democracy, such 
is not the case. In a democracy, governing is thinking and acting 
with the best interests of the community in mind, which is 
contrary to private interests.
<P>
	Also, we are asking that fees and meetings with senior 
officials and ministers be disclosed. The public has the right to 
know that information. Parliamentarians who represent 
Canadians have the right to know if a senior public servant was 
influenced regarding some major decisions. We talk about 
accountability in the public service, but let us not forget the 
notion of responsibility.
<P>
	Public servants are paid by taxpayers to serve them. They are 
not paid to meet the expectations of lobbyists. What is at stake 
here is the credibility of the public service. Bill C-43 must 
provide for the disclosure of all meetings with senior officials.
<P>
	The legislation includes a code of conduct for lobbyists, but 
no real means of enforcing it. This is like putting up a sign 
saying ``No wolf allowed'' in front of the sheep barn. Is the 
government so naive as to believe that such a sign will keep the 
wolf away? Is it so naive as to believe that a mere code of 
conduct with no enforcement measures will help rehabilitate our 
institutions?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to rise in the House today to speak to 
Bill C-43, an act to amend the Lobbyists Registration Act. It is a 
very important bill dealing with a very major problem we have.
<P>
	It is important we do all we can to restore the trust that has 
been lost between the voters and the politicians in Ottawa 
representing them. When I think about this bill it brings to mind 
the experiences I had when I was campaigning for the election. I 
was absolutely shocked at the number of people with the same 
response: ``Here is another politician at the door telling me what 
I want to here now; however, you will go to Ottawa and do as 
you're told''. I encountered that distrust and cynicism at far too 
many doors. It was a disheartening experience.
<P>
	The bill is a small step in the right direction to do something 
about that. To reinforce what I am saying about the lack of trust 
and the cynicism I want to quote from the royal commission on 
electoral reform and party financing, 1992. It dealt with 
political cynicism in Canada. Seventy per cent of the people 
contacted responded: ``I do not think the government cares 
much about what people like me think''. Seventy-nine per cent 
responded: ``Generally those elected to Parliament soon lose 
touch with the people''. Eight-two per cent said: ``Most 
candidates in federal elections make campaign promises they 
have no intention of fulfilling''.  And 64 per cent said that most 
members of Parliament make a lot of money misusing public 
office. Those are serious observations by the people we are here 
to represent. It is a very serious challenge, which we must do 
something about.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The mood of the voters was understandable. I understood 
where they were coming from as I went door to door. What was 
being said then has just been highlighted in the recent book, <I>On 
the Take</I>. That cynicism, to a large degree, was justified in the 
minds of the public. We are all tarred by that brush. We are 
dealing with a minority that does the things that were alleged, 
but it is a problem we all face and must address because we all 
pay the price.
<P>
	It was evident that the government understood the problem, 
because in the red book it did talk the talk. Unfortunately, it has 
been words up to this point and not enough action. Page 94 deals 
with public trust:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nine years of Conservative government have brought our political process 
into disrepute. A Liberal government will restore public trust and confidence in 
government. We will regulate the activities of lobbyists by appointing an Ethics 
Counsellor. We will reform the pension plan of members of Parliament. We will 
give more power to individual MPs by providing more free votes and more 
authority for parliamentary committees.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I suggest that has not been happening. The government 
apparently understood the problem but is somewhat reluctant to 
deal with it. Some half steps have been taken, but it has not gone 
nearly far enough.
<P>
	If we look at members of Parliament from the voters' 
perspective, whether it is real or perceived, and certainly some 
of it is perceived, they look at us while they are paying higher 
taxes and receiving fewer services. There are more people 
unemployed and indeed under-employed. There are a lot of 
young people who have skills far beyond what jobs they are 
forced to take because of the economy. There is an increase in 
crime, particularly among our young offenders. Our social 
programs are threatened and there has been some deterioration 
in them. They had no voice in Ottawa. I believe that was 
manifested in the GST, where that most unpopular tax was 
rammed down the throats of the Canadian people without them 
having a say.
<P>
	All of this resulted in 205 new members being elected to the 
35th Parliament. That was a very strong message from the voters 
that they were very unhappy with what had been going on here 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12243"> 12243 </A></B>
<P>
and they wanted major change. They wanted the windows and 
doors open to find out more about what goes on in this place.
<P>
	Those 205 new members represent a great challenge. It is a 
great opportunity for us to bring about the changes that are 
needed in order to restore that trust. If we want trust we have to 
give trust. Things like freer votes, recall and referendum, and 
Bill C-43 all lead toward that. We saw what happened to freer 
votes in Bill C-68. Those Liberal members who had the courage 
to stand up and vote by the wishes of their constituents were 
stepped on rather heavily and removed from committees; so 
much for freer votes, as was indicated in the red book.
<P>
	With respect to recall, we saw what happened very early in the 
life of this Parliament, when a member was thrown out of the 
government. He was not good enough for the government, but 
there was no opportunity for the people of that riding to do 
something about the member.
<P>
	There is no place for the referendum. There is still no voice 
for the Canadian people in this Parliament. I think the comment 
from the Prime Minister was that he found the referendum 
revolting. I do not think that comment would sit well with 
Canadian people, given their current mood.
<P>
	As I said, Bill C-43 is a small step in the right direction. In 
dealing with Bill C-43, I return to the royal commission on 
electoral reform, particularly that 64 per cent of the respondents 
said that most members of Parliament make a lot of money 
misusing public office. It is a terrible mood that is prevailing out 
there, and we have to do all we can to change that.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian people want a more open and transparent 
process. This bill has got off to a bad start, because it is not 
going far enough.
<P>
	The Pearson mess has been mentioned a couple of times 
already this morning. The Pearson situation is a very good 
example of lobbyists and the lack of an open process. That 
situation continues to deteriorate. If we review that situation, we 
had a government that forced that through during the campaign, 
which was wrong as far as the Canadian people were concerned. 
Then the Liberals cancelled that program without having due 
regard for the cost of that cancellation and indeed whether the 
Pearson deal that had been struck was a good one.
<P>
	In looking at that deal, one of the things they did in shutting 
the doors was appoint a Liberal to do the investigation. Without 
questioning whether Mr. Nixon is qualified or not, that was a 
very poor choice, given the mood of the voters. It smacked of 
trying to hide things from the Canadian people.
<P>
	Now we find that renegotiating or taking a look at that 
contract was not even an option. It has been made clear that 
indeed it was a process that was started with a bias, and that did 
not change. We have no idea of what might be the eventual cost 
to the taxpayers. The report was accepted by the government 
without one ounce of proof as to whether in fact there had been 
any wrongdoing. People's names were dragged through the mud. 
They were being denied the opportunity to have their day in 
court. Here again this is happening behind closed doors. The 
Canadian people want a more open process.
<P>
	When we talk about infrastructure, the Pearson airport is 
Canada's most important infrastructure and it continues to 
deteriorate. Jobs could have been created in overhauling those 
terminals. Indeed jobs are going to be lost in Ontario and all 
across Canada because that airport is continuing to deteriorate.
<P>
	One of the things that really bothered me on that Pearson deal 
was the comments that were coming from the other side about 
the sleaze, the corruption, and how rotten a deal it was. Yet the 
government was prepared to pay $30 million to this sleaze. If 
these people are half as bad as the government is making them 
out to be, why would they get one nickel of taxpayers' dollars?
<P>
	We were demanding that an open and public inquiry be held. 
That was denied over a year ago, and reluctantly it is being 
agreed to now. It is unfortunately too late, because now we are 
going to have the Liberal hacks and the Conservative hacks in 
the Senate deciding who is the worst in this whole affair.
<P>
	A problem with Bill C-43 is that the lobbyists should be 
identified by activities and not by employers. Another item is 
there is a definition in the bill that the lobbyist activity should be 
significant. How do we measure significant? If we go back to the 
Pearson deal, there was enough potential money to be made on 
that deal that you could be in once and out and be set for life. The 
word significant would not have applied in the case of the 
Pearson deal. The bill ignores the anti-avoidance schemes that 
are there.
<P>
	The appointment of the ethics counsellor is another broken 
promise. On page 95 of the red book we were going to get an 
ethnics counsellor who would report directly to Parliament. 
Another broken promise. Another golden opportunity to restore 
the confidence of the Canadian people has been lost. Having him 
report through the registrar general is like having the auditor 
general report through the finance minister.
<P>
	Remind all members we have an opportunity, with 205 new 
members, to do something to restore that level of trust and lost 
confidence. Let us not lose it. Bill C-43 is a small step. We can 
open it up so that it is a much larger step, taking us down the road 
to a much better and more open Parliament.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak about Bill C-43, which seeks to amend the 
Lobbyists Registration Act and thus, we are told, ensure greater 
transparency regarding representations made to the Canadian 
government by lobbyists.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has always insisted on the need to 
monitor the activities of those who make representations to 
politicians and public servants in an attempt to influence 
decisions for the benefit their clients.
<P>
	The Liberals' red book is infamous, because it was their 
election platform, but has become the graveyard of all their 
unfulfilled commitments and promises. The red book stated that 
``a Liberal government will move quickly and decisively in 
several ways to address these concerns about conflicts of 
interest and influence peddling''. A few weeks later, as soon as 
they got to power, the Liberal government stressed in its Speech 
from the Throne that ``legislation will be placed before you to 
increase the transparency of the relations between lobbyists and 
the Government''.
<P>
	Despite the far from exemplary past of the federal Liberals in 
this area, Quebecers and Canadians were ready to believe that 
this was it, that this federal government was finally going to 
clear out this dark corner of our political institutions and 
bureaucracies. Patronage and partisan politics have fed the 
public's cynicism regarding the government apparatus for much 
too long now for the government to be able to restore their trust. 
The 35th Parliament was given a clear mandate to change these 
old ways. Canadians and Quebecers opted for change and they 
elected us to defend the interests of all our fellow citizens.
<P>
	Bill C-43 and the Zed report on the registration and control of 
lobbyists brought Canadians and Quebecers back to the sad 
reality. We have learned that the Liberals should carry a ``best 
before'' date, just like dairy products.

Mr. Speaker, I recently returned from a trip to Burma and 
Thailand. While making that trip I learned a lot about human 
rights and some of the concerns the local people have.
<P>
	I had an opportunity to visit the refugee camps on the 
Thailand-Burma border, where there are more than 90,000 
Burmese Karens on the border. One of the major concerns they 
had was the security problem of the military government, the 
SLORC from Burma, attacking them. More recently I have 
learned that some of the camps I did visit in fact were attacked 
and more than 200 houses were burned down.
<P>
	I made these concerns known to the ambassador of Thailand 
and to our foreign affairs people.
<P>
	I would urge this House and all my colleagues to continue to 
put the pressure on to ensure that the refugees along the 
Thailand-Burma border are secure and that the Thailand 
government gets the security it deserves.

	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
speaking in the House on Tuesday, the federal Minister of 
Fisheries admitted that his plan for managing snow crab in 1995 
changed the historic shares of the provinces, but he maintained 
that the measure would be temporary, just for this year.
<P>
	This is a complete contradiction of a statement made by his 
secretary of state in Shediac on April 23, which indicated that 
the plan might be extended as long as the snow crab biomass 
remained stable.
<P>
	Because of this measure, Quebec will lose 400 tonnes of crab 
and 40 factory jobs, while fishermen in the Gaspé and the 
Magdalen Islands will lose three million dollars in income. And 
the minister has the nerve to claim that his decision is fair to 
Quebec fishermen.
<P>
	We are beginning to understand why the federal government 
insists on maintaining its right to manage fish quotas and 
continues to ignore Quebec's demands. Quebec fishermen, who 
are caught in the middle, are feeling the impact of this policy 
and are not about to forget it.

it is with great pleasure and pride that I say these words today.
<P>
	I was moved by the ceremonies performed today across 
Europe in recognition of war's end and especially to remember 
Canada's role with the allies in the liberation of Europe. The

<P>
thankfulness and warm affection these people feel for 
Canadians.
<P>
	To see the Canadian flag waving, to hear the cordial words 
from their youth, to participate in the prayers in their churches, 
to see the bloom of flowers on every street and city square made 
me, and I am sure all Canadians, even more proud of our heroes 
and country. It is this that shows us the true bond that exists 
between our nation and our people with the former allies 
overseas. We should all pause to consider how fortunate we are 
that we inherited and formed these bonds as a result of the 
sacrifices our fighters made in defending freedom.
<P>
	It is moments like these we should dwell on to put into true 
perspective our lasting relations with our friends across the seas. 
Today in Canada we feel truly proud and grateful that God has 
blessed us and our country with such history and friends.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberal government has chosen to close Canadian forces 
base Chilliwack, a decision which many people in British 
Columbia regard as unwise.
<P>
	I received a letter bearing thousands of signatures requesting 
that the government keep the base open. A public rally was held 
a few weeks ago, the weekend before the minister visited the 
base. Unfortunately the minister stated that the decision to close 
CFB Chilliwack was carved in stone, although both civilian and 
military personnel have posed questions about the closure that 
remain unanswered.
<P>
	If this decision is final, it means that the government must 
now participate with the local committee to plan the transition. 
It must provide clear information on the timing and disposition 
of both personnel and facilities at the base as soon as possible.
<P>
	The closure of CFB Chilliwack means the loss of over $100 
million to our area. Now that the government's position is clear, 
it is time to begin working with the community to minimize the 
disruption to our local economy and to the thousands of families 
affected by this unfortunate closure.

someone who has been involved in this issue for a number of 
years, I want to take the opportunity to congratulate all the 
non-profit organizations, school boards and people involved in 
the issue of illiteracy from coast to coast.
<P>
	Members will know that illiteracy costs Canada about $10 
billion a year in lost productivity. To business alone it costs 
about $4 billion a year. That is quite appalling.
<P>
	The initiative the government has taken on the issue is 
commendable. I take this opportunity to congratulate the 
minister responsible for literacy in the other place as well as the 
minister of human resources for their initiatives.

hard working and caring citizens, including the students from 
the Carleton North high school choir, those participating in the 
forum for young Canadians and the adventures and citizenship 
students, all of whom are visiting Parliament Hill this week.
<P>
	Our youth are learning Canadian values that will enable them 
to grow into the leaders of tomorrow, who will protect others 
who are not as fortunate as they are, while providing every 
opportunity for those who follow them to flourish in the best 
possible environment.

Quebec and former health minister, gave a very clear analysis of 
the state of our health care system and the future of the system.

survival of our health care system.

<P>
	Still according to Mr. Castonguay, despite this withdrawal, 
the federal government continues to act like an inflexible 
regulatory agency and dogmatically enforces the standards of 
the system. By calling the shots without sharing the costs, the 
federal government puts the provinces in an almost impossible 
situation. To us, it is clear that the only way to guarantee the

	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, Canada is a country of many cultures and 
languages. Our diversity strengthens and enriches us. In Canada 
we have values of respect for one another and accommodation of 
our differences. In Canada we do not have to be the same as 
everyone else. We do not all have to have the same roots or the 
same mother tongue to be Canadian, to love this country and to 
work for its betterment.
<P>
	My mother tongue, Inuktitut, has been spoken in this country 
for thousands of years, long before European languages were 
spoken here. Along with other aboriginal languages, Inuktitut is 
an original language of Canada. Inuktitut belongs in the House

present the fourth instalment of the Liberals copy Reform 
awards.
<P>
	Today's lucky winner is the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood, who last Monday stated: ``If we do not 
have total tax reform in the House in about 25 or 30 months from 
now, I agree with the people who say we will hit the wall when it 
comes to our deficit and debt''.
<P>
	In those words, I see a member who is frustrated and lonely 
because his party is not supporting tax reform in Canada. It is a 
party that in one year in the name of simplicity has added 1,288 
pages to the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Canada's tax system is out of control. It takes too much 
money from hard working Canadians who earn it and gives it to 
high spending politicians on that side of the House who blow it 
on pensions, on junkets, on programs like TAGS.
<P>

party, unlike the Liberal member who is truly a lone wolf, whose 
unanswered howls for tax reform echo through the halls of 
Parliament.

especially proud to recognize the many veterans who live in my 
riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants. I look forward to joining 
them on Monday to commemorate this momentous occasion.

	For our military personnel, for our merchant marines, for our 
medical teams that worked on the front lines and for all those 
Canadians who contributed to the home front I am sure I speak 
for all my colleagues when I offer my deepest gratitude for their 
sacrifices.

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the grade 5 
students of William E. Brown Elementary School in the village 
of Wainfleet in my riding of Erie ask that the government ban the 
use of lead shot in Canada.
<P>
	Lead shot is used for hunting waterfowl, upland game birds, 
small mammals and for trap or skeet shooting. This results in 
4,125 tonnes of lead being discharged into the Canadian 
environment each year. Lead is a highly poisonous metal that 
when ingested by birds or animals as they forage for food leads 
to a slow and agonizing death, a death that is totally 
unnecessary.
<P>
	The use of lead shot is one more source of environmental 
contamination that is unacceptable, especially when there are 
non-toxic alternatives available, such as bismuth shot. It is my 
understanding that lead shot has already been banned in the 
United States and some European countries and that some 
non-toxic shot zones have been established in our own country.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of the Environment to ban the use of lead 
shot throughout Canada. Let us follow the lead of these students 
by thinking globally and acting locally. Preserve our wildlife, 
simply ban led shot.

<P>

Canadians will be left to pick up the pieces of the wreckage. It is 
a sad day in Canadian history when patronage heaven decides to 
clear the stench over Pearson with Tory and Liberal hacks 
investigating a patronage affair.
<P>
	Accusations fly between the two while the airport remains in a 
holding pattern. Canada's most important piece of infrastructure 
continues to deteriorate.
<P>
	Reformers called for an impartial judicial inquiry over a year 
ago. Canadian taxpayers, as always, are stuck with the cheque 
and they want some answers. Instead, a year has passed and the 
Liberal government provides Canadians with a partial, 
patronage based inquiry without a single elected official, 
members of the family compact investigating members of the 
family compact.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the Minister of Industry stubbornly refused to admit 
that Bill C-88 gives the federal government extraordinary 
powers that go far beyond the scope of the internal trade 
agreement.
<P>
	Now that he has read his bill and his officials have informed 
him of the scope of the provisions of C-88 on the government's 
retaliatory powers, could the Minister of Industry confirm that 
the federal government is giving itself, among other things, the 
power to cut transfer payments to any province that fails to 
comply with the internal trade agreement?
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is mistaken once again. If he would 
read the bill, he will see the following, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-pursuant to Article 1710 of the Agreement, the Governor in Council may, 
by order-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In order to understand the bill, the member will have to read 
the entire agreement on internal trade.
<P>
	Had he read it, he might understand that the federal 
government's power in this area is very limited and applies only 
in the case of provincial discrimination against a company 
because of its federal status. Then there has to be a hearing 
before a committee to resolve the dispute and then another for 
the company and then the province involved has to refuse to 
implement the terms of the agreement.
<P>
	The only provision then is that all parties must comply with 
the agreement. There is nothing like what the member for 
Roberval has suggested.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can 
the Minister of Industry continue to deny that Bill C-88 gives 
the federal government excessive powers, when no less than the 
executive director of the Internal Trade Secretariat himself, Bob 
Knox, says that Bill C-88 enables the government to use 
whatever retaliatory measures it deems appropriate in any 
sector?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I put the question to Mr. Knox this morning and he told 
me that the reporter had completely misunderstood him, which 
is not surprising. I can read the provisions of the agreement to 
the hon. member if he wants me to. I would like to stress this 
point because the federal government is very seldom in a 
position to intervene in a dispute. This applies only to those 
companies that are subject to action because they are federally 
regulated.
<P>
	If this takes place after every other recourse provided for in 
the agreement has been exhausted, then the government may 
suspend the application of certain provisions with respect to a 
province, but on the following conditions: benefits must be 
suspended or retaliatory measures imposed in the same sector as 
the measure considered inconsistent with the agreement; 
moreover, benefits may be suspended or retaliatory measures 
may be imposed in other sectors covered by the agreement only 
when it would be impractical or ineffective to suspend such 
benefits or impose such measures.
<P>
	It is strictly limited those sectors covered by the agreement. 
So there is no problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> No, Mr. Speaker, 
there are no problems. There are never any problems with the 
federal government. The minister has just told us that the 
journalist misunderstood. Yet, I quoted Mr. Knox's statement 
verbatim.
<P>
	You know, if we are to believe the Minister of Industry, the 
opposition never understands, the opposition's legal advisers do 
not understand, and the same goes for Mr. Knox and the 
journalist. According to him, nobody ever understands 
anything, except him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> He is the only one who understands.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> He is the only one who is marching in step.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	I will ask him a third question and I hope that, this time, we 
will agree on a possible answer. How can the provinces trust the 
federal government when none other than the senior strategic 
adviser with the Internal Trade Secretariat, John Richardson, 
admitted that the bill goes further than the agreement? That is 
what Mr. Richardson himself said.
<P>
	How can we trust a partner who, at the first opportunity, 
betrays his signature and clearly exceeds the terms of an 
agreement?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me again try to explain to the hon. member. The 
provisions of the bill are limited by the agreement on internal 
trade. That is the case in the wording of clause 9 of the bill. It is 
the same wording as applies in the implementing legislation for 
the World Trade Organization and NAFTA. It is normal 
wording.
<P>
	The agreement limits very specifically the occasions when the 
federal government is involved in a dispute resolution. Most of 
the agreement on internal trade has to do with regulating 
disputes between provinces. Only in the rare case where a 
company is discriminated against because of its federal status or 
because it is federally regulated would the federal government 
be involved in the process of dispute resolution which starts first 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12249"> 12249 </A></B>
<P>
with  consultation, second with the appointment of a panel, and 
then the resolution of the dispute by the panel.
<P>
	If the dispute were resolved in favour of the federal 
government, if the province refused to take the measures that 
were dictated by the panel, if a year passed without that 
happening and further consultation did not occur, then possibly 
the federal government could withhold benefits in the sectors 
concerned with the dispute or the sectors involved in the 
agreement on internal trade.
<P>
	This does not at all pertain to the issues of health and social 
transfers raised by the hon. member in his first question. It is 
ridiculous.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Industry. The Canadian 
provinces and the federal government agreed on the terms of an 
agreement on interprovincial trade. The federal government is 
now using Bill C-88 to give itself powers that were never 
discussed during negotiations or when the agreement was 
signed.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Industry, who claims to be 
co-operating with the provinces, to be a reliable partner and to 
act openly, explain that at no time was the Quebec government, 
or the Ontario government, for that matter, ever consulted on 
Bill C-88?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is wrong. The ministers responsible 
for internal trade met in Calgary a few weeks ago. Together with 
the other ministers responsible, I announced at the time that this 
bill would be tabled in the House of Commons after the Easter 
break.
<P>
	I repeat that there is nothing in the bill, that it is simply not 
possible for the bill to contain provisions that go further than the 
agreement itself. It is certainly possible for us to implement the 
internal trade agreement, to table in the House of Commons a 
bill applying only to the measures included in the agreement 
without going any further.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
once again, we did not get it. Why is it that the Minister of 
Industry is the only one who understands? We have been told 
that he is the only one who does understand.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Industry continue to claim that Bill 
C-88 complies with the Agreement on Internal Trade, 
considering that the two senior officials responsible for its 
implementation maintain that the legislation goes beyond the 
scope of the agreement?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can do no more than refer the member to the bill and 
ask him to read its terms so that he can see the provision about 
which he complains states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purpose of suspending benefits or imposing retaliatory measures of 
equivalent effect against a province pursuant to Article 1710 of the Agreement,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	The provisions of the bill are limited by the agreement. I 
regret that words spoken by officials were taken out of context 
and misquoted, I might add, by a journalist. I am sure it has 
never happened to the hon. member. I would like to emphasize 
the importance of reading the bill before the House.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUGHESAIRCRAFT">HUGHES AIRCRAFT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Hughes Aircraft of Canada received a government 
contract to modernize our air traffic control system at a cost of 
almost $420 million. The system is already 15 months late and 
now we have learned that Hughes is looking for as much as $400 
million more of taxpayers' money to complete the job.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport expressed his dissatisfaction with 
the delay and said that there would be a limit to the amount of 
money the government was willing to add to the contract. The 
government should not add anything to the deal. It was a fixed 
price contract and Hughes should deliver.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Transport. Will he assure 
Canadians that not one more dime of public money will be given 
to Hughes Aircraft?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I indicated in response to a question yesterday, the 
government is very concerned about the matter to which my hon. 
friend refers. We are in the process of negotiations now with 
Hughes.
<P>
	The system should become a very important element in the air 
navigation system for Canada. We have serious reservations 
about the way the project has been managed and the problems to 
which my friend refers in terms of delivery and cost.
<P>
	I do not want to prejudice the negotiations by doing it in 
public, but I want to assure my hon. friend that we are very 
sensitive to the potential for cost overruns. We want to make 
sure the system functions well. We will do everything in our 
power to try to protect the interests of Canadian taxpayers in the 
matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Hughes officials informed top level officials of 
Transport Canada last month that they could not meet the terms 
of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12250"> 12250 </A></B>
<P>
original contract but were willing to deliver a scaled down 
version for an extra $150 million.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport, however, told the House that 
Hughes officials had assured him the project was on target and 
within budget. This makes me wonder whether or not the 
government would have quietly given Hughes more money if the 
deal had not been made public.
<P>
	When did the government learn of Hughes' inability to meet 
the original terms of the contract and why was the House not 
informed of this serious matter?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I regret the implication in the hon. member's question 
that somehow we have been remiss in responding to the 
problems.
<P>
	As I indicated in my response yesterday, immediately that I 
became aware there was a problem with the contract I not only 
advised the deputy minister of my concerns but I also advised 
the Auditor General of Canada and asked him to look into it.
<P>
	Further, my reference to the comfort that we received from 
Hughes with respect to delivery on time and the cost provisions I 
said was made several months ago, quite some time ago in a 
meeting in my office with the principal officers of the company 
responsible for delivering on the contract. They had assured me 
at that time that the difficulties had been overcome and they 
were confident of being able to meet the terms of the contract.
<P>
	I want to say in fairness to all the parties involved that these 
types of very complex and technological contracts often are 
subject to some change and modification as the technology 
evolves. However this particular situation is unacceptable to the 
Government of Canada and we intend to protect the interests of 
Canadian taxpayers to the extent we can.
<P>
	I know the hon. member is very fond of contracts being 
honoured in view of his support for the Pearson airport contract.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just love it that the minister raised the question of my 
favourite subject.
<P>
	The government has been quite willing to cancel contracts 
including those with Andersen Consulting, Micronav 
International, and, yes, the Pearson airport contract.
<P>
	Hughes Aircraft has only delivered a meagre 10 per cent of its 
promised contract. Now it states that it cannot meet the original 
terms of the deal and will only produce a scaled down version of 
the air traffic control system if it gets more public money.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. Why will the government 
not cancel the Hughes contract immediately? Not one more cent 
of Canadian money should be wasted.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, those who are following the Pearson saga will know the 
hon. member was quoted in a major article this week as having 
succumbed to the arguments of those who keep whispering in his 
ear about the propriety of the Pearson contract, and he now 
supports it. Who knows, given a couple of weeks he could even 
come around and support the Hughes contract.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	A few weeks ago, the government announced that there would 
be an inquiry to shed light on the behaviour of Canadian 
peacekeepers in Somalia.
<P>
	This morning, we learned that, on the advice of his lawyers, 
the Minister of National Defence has ordered that no document 
relating to the inquiry is to be made available to the media and 
the public under the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	How does the Deputy Prime Minister explain her 
government's refusal to give access to the documents which 
relate to the inquiry on the behaviour of Canadian soldiers in 
Somalia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, a recommendation 
was made by the Judge Advocate General. The government has 
yet to make a decision in that respect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
hope that decision will not take as long as the setting up of a 
board of inquiry.
<P>
	How does the Deputy Prime Minister reconcile this refusal to 
give access to information with the government's claim that it 
wants to shed light on the events which took place in Somalia? 
What is the government trying to hide by acting in this way?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to repeat it in 
case the member did not get it the first time.
<P>
	The Judge Advocate General has made a recommendation 
about the issue of access to information. There has been some 
discussion among the commissioners, including former 
journalist Peter Desbarats who is of the public view that further 
informal links of information may put the inquiry in some 
difficulty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12251"> 12251 </A></B>
<P>
	We are at the moment examining the issue and we have not 
made a decision. We obviously want the inquiry into the 
Conservative handling of the Somalia affair to be as thorough 
and as public as possible. We do not want it to turn into an O. J. 
Simpson style circus. We will do everything we can to make sure 
public access to all information is available to everyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the Deputy Prime Minister's 
statement in response to the Bloc's question. I listened carefully 
and it is not adequate for me.
<P>
	In my opinion the Canadian public is entitled to the 
information, and the democratic process is being violated by 
this blocking of the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	If we consider the continued refusal to release information at 
the request of the commissioners we understand were appointed 
to conduct the inquiry, can the Deputy Prime Minister explain in 
simple terms why she believes Canadians' right to this 
information can be subverted in this way?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member obviously 
prepared his question before he listened to my previous answer.
<P>
	My previous answer was quite clear. There is a 
recommendation by the Judge Advocate General on the issue of 
information. We have not made a decision on that 
recommendation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Judge Advocate General is not the be all and end all 
of the legal process in Canada. He may be for the Department of 
National Defence but he is not for Canadians at large.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister to rethink the answer, leaving 
out the Judge Advocate General and including someone else in 
authority.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know how I 
can be more clear.
<P>
	There has been a recommendation made by the Judge 
Advocate General. The government has not as yet made a 
decision about that recommendation.
<P>
	We will very shortly obviously review the views of the 
commissioners, some of whom have concern about the 
possibility of tandem inquiries taking place, a la O. J. Simpson.

<P>
	Over the years, Canadians and Quebecers have invested

to privatize Canadian National without guaranteeing Canadian 
ownership.
<P>

ownership and thus no guarantee that CN will remain under 
Canadian control?
<P>

would not be appropriate for me to comment on the hon.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, my second question is a 
supplementary that I would urge the minister to answer this 
time.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Transport not agree that limiting to 15 
per cent, under this bill, the number of CN shares that an 
individual or group may own does not seem to do much to 
protect the substantial financial contribution the taxpayers of 
Quebec and Canada have made over the years to CN's 
development? If he has no objections, I would like him to 
explain.

my question is for the Minister responsible for Public Service 
Renewal.
<P>
	Workers who have been declared surplus deserve the first 
crack at any job they can seize in the public service. Last year a 
regional director in the Department of Health cancelled a job 
competition in order to hire someone he knew personally under 
an employment equity program called ``Options''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12252"> 12252 </A></B>
<P>
	Surplus employees watched helplessly as their applications 
were ignored in favour of an employment equity application.
<P>
	We have been assured the best qualified persons are allowed 
to compete for jobs in the public service. Are employment 
equity programs being used to bypass this important principle?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, no. Our equity programs are not there to create the 
type of result mentioned.
<P>
	I can only reaffirm we use the merit principle in the public 
service as our basic principle. I will investigate the facts of the 
case mentioned to see if they fit with our principles.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will give a few more facts. The person who was hired for the job 
happens to be the daughter of the regional director of the 
Department of Health. Not only was employment equity used to 
bypass the merit principle but apparently it was also used to hire 
a close relative.
<P>
	Any program that does not demand the hiring of the best 
qualified is open to manipulation. The government plans to 
expand employment equity programs throughout the public 
service. The people of Canada do not want that; the public 
service does not want that and surplus employees certainly 
deserve a lot better.
<P>
	Why does the government not cancel this program right now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, even if the facts of the case are as indicated, and we 
will check on it, this would not be a reason to cancel the 
employment equity principle.
<P>
	It is a principle that we basically believe which permits all 
Canadians, whatever their origin, colour or religion, to have the 
same treatment in the public service. It is fundamental to a well 
functioning government and a well functioning society. We will 
keep it as the basis for our public service.

	The minister will not use federal environmental laws to ban 
the substance because she cannot. There is no independent 
evidence to prove MMT harms Canadians, the environment or 
cars in Canada. If the minister bans MMT without 
environmental laws she will likely find herself defending the 
ban under the laws governing free trade.
<P>
	Considering the legal difficulties of an arbitrary ban of MMT, 
why is the minister still moving ahead with the ban?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency banned MMT in 1977. Since 
that time the Ethyl Corporation has consistently tried to turn 
around the ban by court case after court case, which has and 
continues to fail.
<P>
	I advise the hon. member that last week when I had the 
opportunity of speaking with Carol Browner, head of the EPA, 
she reaffirmed the U.S. commitment not to allow MMT. She 
decried the fact that there is only one country, Canada, that still 
allows MMT. We intend to change that.
<P>
	Instead of being the mouthpiece for a particular industry, the 
hon. member should be concerned that Canadians across the 
country run the risk of having to pay $3,000 more for their 
automobiles next year if we do not get MMT out of gasoline.
<P>
	We intend to do so. We intend to show the leadership the 
previous government did not show. Canadians will be happy 
with the result.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party supports curtailing toxic 
substances but only on the basis of reliable evidence. We do not 
choose sides in this matter. We just want some proof. The 
minister appears to be deciding for political reasons rather than 
science.
<P>
	How can the minister support an arbitrary ban of MMT 
without impartial evidence and especially without the support of 
the Minister of Natural Resources?
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would point out that 
any cabinet decision to move on MMT is supported by all 
ministers of the government. I would further point out that if the 
member is looking for evidence, he can look at the evidence 
which was tabled before the environment department by 
Chrysler, Ford and GM. All of them have suggested that at the 
moment the failure rate for Canadian spark plugs is 17 times 
higher than that of the United States because we have MMT and 
it does not.
<P>
	If this member is not interested in protecting Canadian 
consumers and cleaning up Canadian air, this government is, 
and collectively we are going to do that.

<P>
	For several weeks, residents of Hull and Ottawa have been 
waiting with baited breath for Cabinet to decide which city shall 
be selected to bid for the 2005 World Fair. In its report, a 
committee set up by the heritage minister recently 
recommended Calgary as the host city for this event.
<P>
	How can the heritage minister explain this long delay in 
processing applications by Calgary and the federal capital and 
when will a cabinet decision finally be announced concerning 
the selection of one city as a potential host for Expo 2005?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

indeed, an important question. We are in the process of

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we should not yet panic about the unfortunate but 
strong and distinct signs of economic slowdown. However, we 
should be prepared for it to continue since Canada's record high 
real interest rates are sure to keep consumers from buying cars, 
homes and other durables.
<P>
	My question for the Minister of Finance is how much 
economic slowdown and resultant reduced tax revenues can 
Canada take before the contingency reserve in his budget is 
exhausted and he will miss the deficit target he has vowed to 
meet?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
has made some interesting points.
<P>
	I point out to him however that our interest rate levels are 
below the levels that were in the budget. Economic growth is 
running in the first two months of this year at about 5 per cent 
above last year's numbers. Our deficit numbers are very much 
on target. The contingency reserves are not in any sense 
endangered by the present economic slowdown.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not believe this slowdown was in any of the 
models. It had never been put into the forecast about economic 
growth in the future. It comes as a total surprise.
<P>
	The coming economic slowdown will cause higher 
unemployment. This will surely cause members of the Liberal 
cabinet and caucus to increase their resistance to spending cuts, 
cuts which they could not get themselves to approve during last 
year's boom.
<P>
	Given the likely political resistance to essential spending 
cuts, will the minister support Reform's proposed balanced 
budget legislation which has been used in many other 
jurisdictions to protect taxpayers from shortsighted and selfish 
actions of politicians?
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite possible 
for the hon. member to gather economic statistics that are 
negative. However, there are a lot of positive things as well.
<P>
	The member talks about slowing employment. Let me remind 
him that over the last 12 months 338,000 new jobs have been 
created in this country. The rate of GDP has been expanding. 
Exports were up 25 per cent in the first part of this year. Our 
deficit numbers for last year came in well below our target 
numbers.
<P>

support his balanced budget amendment, the answer is no.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. In the last budget, the Minister of Finance announced 
an 8 per cent cut, over a three year period, to the postal program 
designed to subsidize the distribution of magazines and 
publications in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Canadian Heritage explain that his 
officials indicated to Canadian publishers that the cut affecting 
the postal program was 24 per cent over 13 months, instead of 8 
per cent over three years, as announced in the budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

obviously a very important issue for the magazine industry. As I 
<P>

said before in this House, we are considering ways of changing 
the financial support we give that industry in order to ensure that 
it continues to flourish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, one change is the fact that the program had a 
budget of $220 million in 1990, compared to $77 million this 
year. How can the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who claims to 
be the protector of the Canadian publishing industry, justify 
such drastic cuts to a program so vital for publishers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should realize that we are 
in a period of fiscal austerity. Obviously, the fiscal restraint 
announced in the budget will have consequences. However, as I

consumed by people who are applying for refugee status, 
including I presume those refugee claimants with AIDS.

believe in health care for people who come to this country. We 
do not cut people off and leave them to be sick in the streets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
because of Canada's bizarre appeal system for failed refugee 
claimants, many stay in the system for years without 
determination. By not funding health care for these people, 
Ontario expects to save an incredible $32 million which the 
federal government will now have to pay.
<P>

put Canadians first and reconsider the provision of expensive 
medical services for failed refugee claimants who are filing 
appeal after appeal just to avoid legal deportation?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

of immigration has announced a number of reforms to the 
immigration system. We have announced a number of changes

earlier presumably with no limit on foreign ownership.
<P>
	When we consider this alongside the abandoning of the Crow

this government is beginning to make Brian Mulroney's Tories 
look very good.
<P>
	When we look at what this government has done over the last 
18 months, what is it that is Liberal about this Liberal 
government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

are not working today.
<P>
	Many of the initiatives which have been undertaken by the 
department for which I am responsible have been very well 
received. I am astounded that the hon. member does not 
recognize the tremendous support in his province, for example, 
for the policies on international air routes and the bilateral 
agreements with the United States.
<P>
	When the merger talks went on with Canadian Pacific and the 
offer from Canadian Pacific to buy the assets of CN in the east, 
everyone in the west wanted to make sure we had a national, 
viable, transcontinental railroad. That is what the purpose of all 
of this legislation will be: to make sure we have a strong railroad 
network in this country. That certainly is Liberal policy.

the House of what commitments the government has taken to

people have to file their taxes a question like this should come 
up.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member and this House that the measures 
undertaken three weeks after this government took office are 
bearing fruit. We are succeeding in reducing the scope of the 
underground economy through a number of measures, in 
particular of course with greater enforcement.
<P>
	We have done this in co-operation with the provinces. We 
now have agreements with every province in the country. We 
exchange information, carry out joint orders, work with them. 
We have agreements with the professional and trade 
associations in areas of particularly high non-compliance so 
that we can use the industries themselves.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that the result of this has been a 
very substantial increase in the revenues coming to the 
government. I would like to point out that in the last month for 
which we have figures, revenues are up over 8.5 per cent of what 
they were a year ago. Some of this at least is due to the 
underground economy initiative, although I must admit that-

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LOBBYISTSREGISTRATIONACT">LOBBYISTS REGISTRATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
closing, I pointed out that Bill C-43 reassured no one. I said that 
the Liberals should have a ``best before'' label, a bit like dairy 
products. They were better before they came to power, better 
before the elections, better before they lined up at the trough. 
The fine principles they defended in opposition have 
evaporated.
<P>
	I could explain at length the many shortcomings of Bill C-43. 
My colleague for Berthier-Montcalm has already done so 
amply. As we are short of time, I will raise two flagrant 
examples of this change taking place in the Liberal family.
<P>
	First, the appointment of the ethics counsellor. With great 
pomp, as usual, the Liberals across from us announced the 
appointment of an ethics counsellor to advise ministers and 
government officials and to examine the need to amend the 
legislation.
<P>
	These fine principles will not go far, however, if this 
counsellor is not given some independence from the Prime 
Minister and his government. Do not forget that the Prime 
Minister appoints the ethics counsellor, consults him when he 
sees fit and allows him to make public statements only when 
they are to his political advantage.
<P>
	A true ethics counsellor would be accountable to the 
representatives of the people. All of the counsellor's decisions 
should be made public. He should have the power to launch 
investigations and have enforcement powers. Bill C-43 does 
none of the above. It merely gives the illusion that someone is 
ensuring that decisions are made ethically, while in reality, the 
role amounts to nothing.
<P>
	We are giving the Prime Minister the right to appoint an ethics 
counsellor, to consult the latter when he feels like it and to keep 
the counsellor's advice secret unless he decides otherwise. They 
will have to think of something else if they want to restore the 
trust of Canadians and Quebecers in our institutions!
<P>
	Scandals like the attempted privatization of the Pearson 
airport hit home the need for a bill on the registration of 
lobbyists. I will not describe in detail all of the underhanded 
tricks and schemes that came into play in this tainted deal. What 
is really important is that we remember it as a sad incident in 
which the government's reputation was tarnished in the eyes of 
the public.
<P>
	As it stands, Bill C-43 could not have prevented this kind of 
scandal, no more than it could shed more light on the suspicious 
comings and goings of the current Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. The ethics counsellor does not have the power to set up 
an investigating committee to get to the bottom of it for 
Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	The second shortfall of Bill C-43 on which I would like to 
comment concerns the categorization of lobbyists. The Bloc 
Quebecois wants to eliminate distinctions between different 
types of lobbyists. When the Liberals were in the opposition, 
when they were ``best before'', they took exactly the same view 
as the Bloc Quebecois: lobbyists are lobbyists and should be 
accountable for their actions. Since then, the Liberals reversed 
their position, probably under pressure from lobbyist friends 
and contributors to the party coffers.
<P>
	And speaking of party coffers, when I look at the latest figures 
on funds raised by political parties in Canada, I can understand 
why the Liberals are so anxious to change their position on 
lobbyists. In 1993, the Liberal Party of Canada raised more than 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12261"> 12261 </A></B>
<P>
$20 million in political contributions which was, needless to 
say, the largest amount ever collected by the Liberal Party of 
Canada  during an election year. Last year, in 1994, the Liberals 
raised $9 million, the largest amount ever collected by the 
Liberals outside an election year. This year, the Liberals have set 
their fundraising objective at $10 million.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	During the election campaign, the Liberals claimed, and this 
is again from the red book: ``No one should be required to pay 
fees in order merely to arrange meetings with ministers or senior 
officials''. However, just to give a few recent examples, last 
Wednesday in Montreal, the Prime Minister met 1,800 people 
who had each donated $400 to the Liberal Party.
<P>
	Last month, the Minister of Finance invited members of the 
business community to a private reception at $1,500 a head, to 
talk about his budget, and so forth. Are we to understand that the 
Liberal government's message is: For access to decision 
makers, instead of investing in lobbies, contribute to the party 
coffers of the Liberal Party of Canada for a better return on your 
investment. It seems to be the message an increasing number of 
Canadians and Quebecers are hearing.
<P>
	Bill C-43 does nothing to remove this impression. The Bloc 
Quebecois tried to give this bill some teeth by proposing at least 
60 amendments. The Liberals were adamant and rejected all 
proposals that would have made this a bill with teeth. The 
obvious conclusion is that for Quebecers, their only hope for 
more democratic and more transparent institutions lies in 
sovereignty. Through its bill on political party financing, 
Quebec has made an important contribution to the resolution of 
this important ethical matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I rise to participate in the debate at third reading on 
Bill C-43, an act to amend the Lobbyists Registration Act. I say 
with pleasure but also with a certain weariness, because the first 
speeches I delivered in this House more than a year ago dealt 
with the privatization of Pearson airport by the previous 
government. In that speech, I denounced the dubious 
transactions involving people close to both Tory and Liberal 
political circles.
<P>
	Bloc members who spoke up at the time called for the 
supervision, clarification and regulation of lobbyists' activities 
in Canada. Reading the bill now before us, I realize that the main 
demands made by Bloc speakers, the main conditions we wanted 
to set in order to shed light, once and for all, on lobbyists' 
activities in Canada, have not been met.
<P>
	Although we may deplore the fact that lobbying activities take 
place in a government such as the Canadian government, it must 
be recognized that, given the financial implications-for 
example, the federal government signs close to 90,000 contracts 
every year-, some people may to try to influence the 
government and meet lawmakers and senior officials with 
decision-making powers to ensure that regulations, programs 
and even bills are in their best interests.
<P>
	Although we understand this situation, we are surprised that 
this government does not understand the need to monitor the 
risks of influence and mismanagement so that citizens are fully 
aware that things are being done properly. The bill before us 
nonetheless contains a number of improvements. Certain 
members of the Liberal government now in power had 
denounced really unfortunate and unacceptable situations when 
they were in opposition and promised, notably in their red book, 
drastic measures to regulate the activities of lobbyists.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Going over this bill, one realizes that, while some 
improvements have been made, major amendments would have 
been required at committee stage to increase its efficiency in 
terms of its purposes and to bring it at least slightly more in line 
with the goals the Liberal Party had set for itself when in 
opposition as well as with its promises to sort things out once in 
power.
<P>
	Many of my colleagues have already spoken on this bill, 
therefore I will only list a number of flaws or points that should 
have been corrected in order to allow us, members of the official 
opposition, to vote for this bill. Since these flaws were not 
corrected in the legislative process, it will not come as a surprise 
to anyone to hear me say that, like all Bloc members I think, I 
will be voting against this bill.
<P>
	One of the main flaws of this legislation has to do with the 
whole ethics counsellor issue. At present, no one seems to have 
the authority to provide advice or guidance to politicians and 
government employees on certain procedures or actions which 
may be confusing.
<P>
	The bill provides for an ethics counsellor to be appointed by 
the Prime Minister. I have no doubt that the Prime Minister will 
choose an honest and reputable person who will be able to 
provide enlightened advice. However, this person will have no 
power and, being appointed by the Prime Minister, neither will 
he or she have any credibility. The House of Commons, or 
Parliament, should appoint the ethics counsellor, so as to give 
that person the prestige, the authority and the protection 
necessary for someone who will have to provide opinions on 
actions, representations or projects which often involve 
enormous expenses for certain people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12262"> 12262 </A></B>
<P>
	We deplore the fact that, while the ethics counsellor will 
undoubtedly mean well, this person will be subject to the Prime 
Minister's will in terms of his appointment, and it is the Prime 
Minister who will govern to a great extent how the ethics 
counsellor executes his or her mandate.
<P>
	When we reviewed the transactions surrounding the 
privatization of Pearson airport, we also asked that there be only 
one category of lobbyists. As you know, lobbying activities are 
conducted by various firms, groups and organizations. If 
someone wants to influence the government or have his or her 
views expressed to MPs or to some senior public officials, that 
person can go to a specialized agency which will do what is 
necessary to convey his or her views to those concerned.
<P>
	However, there are also other people who lobby while 
working for various organizations, such as business 
associations, unions, and all sorts of other groups which hire 
permanent staff to do so. Some of these permanent employees 
may be involved in communications or governmental relations 
and make representations as lobbyists, even though they are not 
treated in the same way as those who belong to lobbying groups 
specifically involved in governmental relations. We suggested, 
in parliamentary committee, that there should only be one 
category of lobbyists, so that all those involved in the same kind 
of representations and have the same responsibilities, would 
also have the same obligations. However, the legislation 
provides for two categories of lobbyists.
<P>
	Several other suggestions were also made. We had asked that 
the fees paid to companies, agencies or individuals for lobbying 
services be disclosed. They will not be. Lobbyists objected to 
that. Lobbying experts have told us that this was not possible, 
that it was not under federal jurisdiction, that there would be 
problems related to competition and non-disclosure of 
activities, and that it was not necessary in any case.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	I feel it is important that Parliament and the Canadian public 
be aware of the amount of money involved. Whether a company 
hands out $2 million or just $20,000 to a government relations 
agency does make a difference. When huge sums are involved, 
people who have to watch over lobbying activities would be on 
the alert.
<P>
	We would also have liked some clarification on the political 
ties of lobbyists. The media have pointed out that many former 
very influential politicians, political staff members and people 
close to decision makers easily make the transition to a new 
career in lobbying.
<P>
	It would have been important to have some kind of 
registration scheme for lobbyists so that we could determine 
who did what, what they did subsequently, and whether they 
hold positions, paid or unpaid, in political organizations. If the 
president of a Liberal association is active in lobbying, I think 
the people should know.
<P>
	I had more points to make to demonstrate that the bill before 
us is flawed. But my time is running out, and I can only express 
my disappointment at the lobbying problem we now have in 
Canada and the unwillingness of the government to keep the 
promises it made in the last campaign, as set out in the red book. 
The only legacy of that red book will be the shame of unkept 
promises.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak on Bill C-43, 
an act to amend the Lobbyists Registration Act and to make 
related amendments to other Acts, that my colleagues have 
already commented on extensively. I remind the House of the 
detailed analysis made by the member for Berthier-Montcalm. 
He explained the many reasons why the Bloc Quebecois would 
not support the bill.
<P>
	Without getting into details, I will sum up the eight major 
flaws of this bill, as mentioned by my colleague. They concern 
the types of lobbyists, the requirement to disclose contracts, 
lobbyists' fees, the contacting of ministers and senior officials, 
the lobbyists' political ties, coalitions, contingency fees and, 
finally, the whole issue of the ethics counsellor. In fact, the Bloc 
Quebecois tabled 60 amendments, as my colleagues have 
already pointed out. They were all negatived.
<P>
	The major flaw of this bill, the basic problem, is the fact that 
the ethics counsellor reports only to the Prime Minister. All 
those things that could enlighten the public will only enlighten 
the Prime Minister's office.
<P>
	Again, as I had mentioned in the case of Pearson airport, it is 
like having a fox guarding the hen house. We all recall the bill to 
cancel the privatization of Pearson airport. It contained a clause 
allowing those claiming to have lost future profits to negotiate 
arrangements in a private meeting with the minister. That also 
was like asking the fox to guard the hen house.
<P>
	This analysis of the bill, which was made by my colleagues 
much better than I could do it now, shows that the government 
has chosen to use smoke screen tactics in its bills. It says it will 
take certain actions, but the resulting bills show no sign of 
openness and everything will be decided by the Prime Minister's 
inner circle.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	These smoke screen tactics have also been used for events that 
have occurred over the past 10 or 15 days, in this House, 
regarding two major problems surrounding Power DirecTv and 
Seagram.
<P>
	For the benefit of our viewers, I will briefly outline the case of 
Power DirecTv. Last August, only two weeks after the CRTC 
announced its decision exempting Canadian satellite 
broadcasting companies from licencing requirements, the 
Liberal govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12263"> 12263 </A></B>
<P>
ment announced that it intended to review policies concerning 
direct broadcasting. A first, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	On November 29, 1994, the government decided to create a 
three member task force to review the CRTC decision, which ran 
contrary to the interests of Power DirecTv and prevented the 
company from going ahead with its plans; as we know, it wanted 
to broadcast from an American satellite, which the CRTC found 
unacceptable.
<P>
	The task force received briefs from several groups, including 
Power DirecTv. On April 6, it submitted a detailed report tailor 
made for Power DirecTv, which is partly owned, as we know, by 
Power Corporation and Hughes Aircraft of Canada.
<P>
	On April 26, the government adopted the report's 
recommendations, verbatim, and tabled two orders, telling 
Expressvu, a Canadian company, that it must now apply to the 
CRTC for a licence, thus delaying its going into operation, 
which was planned for September 1995. And yet, this company 
had simply abided by the CRTC decision. After that, the CRTC 
announced that the government could be liable to prosecution. 
Expressvu believes it has a vested right and I think that it is 
legally defendable.
<P>
	And who is the head of Power DirecTv? André Desmarais, 
son-in-law of the Prime Minister and son of Paul Desmarais, 
CEO of Power Corporation.
<P>
	This happened in the House, right here, and it was raised 
repeatedly during question period.
<P>
	There was also the Seagram case which is just as obvious. The 
Minister of Canadian Heritage went incognito to Los Angeles, 
with two members of his staff, supposedly to meet major players 
in the U.S. film industry. He got there on the very day the deal to 
sell MCA to Seagram was signed. Seagram is a Bronfman 
company, and it just so happens that Paul Desmarais, the 
father-in-law of the Prime Minister's daughter, is a member of 
the board.
<P>
	They say the minister was in the Bronfman suite while the 
deal was being signed. He denies he was aware of that 
transaction, which must be reviewed by the Minister of Industry. 
This review is necessary, it seems, in order to determine whether 
Seagram is a Canadian or an American company. If it is 
Canadian, there is no problem, and the investments are exempt 
from any further investigation. If it is American, Canada will 
protect its cultural market and will have to review several 
aspects of the transaction, particularly the buy-back of 
Canadian subsidiaries. And at that point, the minister, who just 
happened to be there, will have something to say on the issue.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage will have to be consulted, 
and there appears to be a conflict of interests.
<P>
	Of course, the newspapers played the whole thing up and 
English Canadian newspapers wrote at length about the events 
surrounding that problem. I had brought here, to read it in the 
House, a one page article written in English that traces all the 
family and political ties, the people the Liberals are working for. 
And, at the heart of all this, we find Power Corporation in both 
cases.
<P>
	And all the Prime Minister could say in response to the many 
questions, both from the Bloc and the Reform Party, is that he 
certainly had the right to find a good match for his daughter. We 
agree. But in fact, what we are finding through all this is that the 
government of Canada, in its agreement, has now become a 
branch of Power Corporation. So, it is using smoke screen 
tactics to explain what is actually going on in the House.
<P>
	It also uses smoke screen tactics in its statements both in the 
House and outside of the House. For instance, when the Minister 
of Finance tells us in committee, with a lump in his throat, that 
we must absolutely tighten our belts, of course, he will tighten 
the belts of the poor, he will make cuts to unemployment 
insurance and social welfare, he will raise all the costs relating 
to post-secondary education, he will probably go after old age 
pensions, but the finance minister's ships are still sailing under 
a foreign flag. And then it dawns on us that those who are asking 
us to tighten our belts always wear suspenders.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister also makes statements in the House and 
outside of the House. For example, the Liberals said there were 
problems in Canada because of people who guzzled beer in front 
of their television set. But oddly enough, and these are smoke 
screen tactics again, they never talk about champagne drinkers 
slumped over in hotel lobbies, those who take advantage of tax 
havens to avoid paying taxes, about family trusts which they do 
not want to touch, or ever so slightly, if they have to.
<P>
	They never talk about the hon. Peter Trudeau, who is getting a 
$1 million tax credit for the papers he is handing back to the 
government. That is welfare for the rich, Mr. Speaker. Brian 
Mulroney did the same thing; that too is welfare for the rich.
<P>
	They hardly ever talk about Paul Tellier, the chairman of CN, 
who is getting a huge salary, who is having his mortgage paid off 
by CN at the taxpayers' expense, and who is laying everybody 
off.
<P>
	They did talk a little about the $250,000 for new furniture 
spent by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, while cuts are 
being made everywhere else. The only answer we got from his 
department is that furniture is expensive. I was a carpenter and 
cabinet maker before becoming a member of Parliament, and I 
can tell you that for $250,000, you can get some really nice 
furniture.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12264"> 12264 </A></B>
<P>
	More smoke screen tactics, when the Prime Minister himself 
tells us that everything is going wrong in Canada because of 
Quebec. I do not know how many times I have heard him say that 
since he has been in politics. He started that as soon as he 
became a politician, even before he was given a portfolio.
<P>
	Yet, we realize-I have said it before, but this is worth 
repeating-that is was in a period of political stability, in the 
years following the rejection of sovereignty by the people of 
Quebec in 1980, that Canada experienced interest rates over 20 
per cent. So that is exactly the opposite of what the Prime 
Minister said.
<P>
	It was in 1986, also, that the Canadian dollar tumbled to 69 
cents. I remind you that at that time, the Mulroney and Bourassa 
governments were in office. That was before Meech and 
Charlottetown, the Bloc Quebecois did not even exist, and the 
Parti Quebecois was completely out of the picture. Therefore, 
there is no relationship between the disastrous state of Canada's 
finances and the political situation in Quebec. Once again, 
smoke screen tactics.
<P>
	You will recall another masterminded statement, the one 
made by the Royal Bank just before Charlottetown, where they 
said that if Quebecers and Canadians rejected the Charlottetown 
agreement, it would mean the end of the world. We said no to 
Charlottetown and the world did not end, but of course this was 
all orchestrated to scare people. This was also a case of smoke 
screen tactics.
<P>
	Let me give you another example of these tactics. The Prime 
Minister said that Quebec, through its premier, is showing 
contempt for democracy. I think we should review a bit of our 
history. Who was responsible for the patriation of the 
Constitution in 1982? The current Prime Minister. Who was 
involved in the implementation of the War Measures Act in 
Quebec? The current Prime Minister. I like to remind people that 
these measures were taken to scare Quebecers.
<P>
	I will not say anything more on this issue, except that we also 
remember the smoke screen tactics used in 1980 when some 
politicians told us they were betting their seats that there would 
be some changes. There never were any changes and now, in 
1995, our political situation has not changed at all. At the time, 
they tried to scare us by saying that if we voted yes to 
sovereignty, we would be crippled with debts, taxes and 
unemployment.
<P>
	We said yes to Canada because we wanted to be team players, 
and what did that get us? Debts, taxes and unemployment. The 
debt has gone from $90 billion to $550 billion. Unemployment 
is constantly on the rise. We now have 808,000 people on 
welfare in Quebec. All this happened within Canada.
<P>
	We were told it would take us 15 years to get back on our feet. 
That was in 1980, and now, 15 years later, were are in it up to our 
necks, and things will only get worse. The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> 
raised openly the very real possibility that Canada would go 
bankrupt. All this is part of a smoke screen strategy.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak for the second time to Bill-43, 
which amends the Lobbyists Registration Act.
<P>
	The first time was when the bill was at second reading and we 
discussed amendments hoping that we would be able to force the 
government to take more seriously the promises it made in the 
red book and also to stand by the positions it took when many of 
its members were in the opposition and discussed a situation 
identical to the one in which we find ourselves today.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, like the majority of my colleagues, I feel that I 
am wasting my breath. However, we are not asking the Liberal 
Party for anything very special. We are not asking it to attain the 
goals of the Bloc or the Reform Party. We are only asking it to 
keep the promises it made in the red book. The promise to 
tighten controls on lobbyists' activities and make the legislative 
process or the awarding of government contracts more 
transparent was one that should have been easy to keep. This 
time, the government cannot use the usual excuse that the till is 
empty to avoid doing what it promised to do. This promise costs 
nothing. The government had the power to tighten up the rules 
and to issue new standards of conduct. It had the unanimous 
support of the opposition to act but did nothing.
<P>
	Where are the Liberals who clamoured against the 
carelessness of the Conservatives? Where are the Liberal Party 
hardliners? Where are the transparent and honest Liberals? They 
have vanished and unfortunately their words have also vanished 
without a trace.
<P>
	Liberals have changed the meaning of the word promise. A 
promise is a firm commitment to do what you said you would, 
but for the Liberals, a promise is something you talk about but 
never do anything about or which you achieve in an incomplete 
or uncertain way. Indeed, it is becoming more and more obvious 
that, for the Liberal Party, there are two kinds of promises: the 
promise made to the people and which deals with public interest. 
That kind of promise is achieved only when all favourable 
circumstances are present but you can always find good reasons 
to postpone them and bring them back at election time. The 
second kind are the promises made to friends of the government, 
those who finance the slush fund. Those promises are often tied 
to private interests and can take the shape of bills or orders in 
council for the benefit of a few individuals or companies, or 
expensive contracts which are often overvalued and given 
without a real call for tenders.
<P>
	In the case of Bill C-43, there were once more conflicting 
interests. On one side, the general public and all the people who 
elected the Liberal Party, that is a few million people, and on the 
other side, a few hundred lobbyists and the thousand or so big 
companies which employ them. By not keeping its red book 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12265"> 12265 </A></B>
<P>
promises and by watering down and thus weakening this bill, the  
Liberal government has shown its contempt for the public 
interest.
<P>
	The clear message that this government is sending to the 
backers of the Liberal Party, to former organizers and 
dignitaries of the party and to the friends, relatives as well as 
former and future associates of government members is this: 
everything is allowed, but would you please be very discreet. 
That will certainly not help restore public confidence in 
politicians.
<P>
	The message from the government should have been that 
lobbyists, like any other professionals, must follow certain rules 
and be more transparent in their work, as promised on pages 94 
and 95 of the Liberal red book. This bill is not all bad, but it does 
not go far enough in terms of supervising and regulating the 
work of lobbyists. I am not implying in any way that lobbyists 
are in the business of corrupting. The great majority of them do 
their job in a most honourable fashion. This bill should be aimed 
at preventing abuse and influence-peddling, not at preventing 
individuals and companies from dealing legitimately with the 
government.
<P>
	In this regard, Simon Reisman, chairman of Ranger Oil 
Limited and star witness for the liberal government, expressed 
the opinion, at the hearings on the bill, that the practice of 
contingency fees, which will not be precluded by Bill C-43, 
``encourages the wrong kind of people into the business 
and-contingency fees perpetuate the perception of cronyism 
and back-door access to government insiders''.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	In another vein, I would like to remind members that in the red 
book, the Prime Minister committed himself to: ``regulate the 
activities of lobbyists by appointing an Ethics Counsellor''. The 
Bloc, like all Canadians, expected the appointment of someone 
who is beyond reproach who would go after people engaged in 
murky business. In reality, the ethics counsellor has only limited 
powers in spite of all the goodwill this person brings to the task. 
The code of conduct that the counsellor produced does not have 
the force of a statutory regulation, but is just so many empty 
words.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor is not accountable before the House of 
Commons. The counsellor is chosen by the prime minister and is 
accountable to him alone. All investigations are conducted in 
private. Moreover, it has become clear that the prime minister 
does not always deem it necessary to consult his counsellor or 
that he consults him only after the decisions have been made or 
after the fact. Such a manner of proceeding is not calculated to 
raise public confidence in our political institutions. What we 
needed was a counsellor appointed by the House of Commons, 
having real powers and accountable to the House.
<P>
	A code of conduct having the force of a set of regulations 
would have been appropriate, as would more stringent 
disclosure rules for lobbyists.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INCOMETAXACT">INCOME TAX ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from April 25, 1995, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-70, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the 
income tax application rules and related acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
chapter one of the Liberal red ink book it clearly states: 
``Fairness, simplicity and harmonization should be key 
objectives of tax policies''. Unfortunately, after a year in Ottawa 
this promise of fairness and simplicity is nothing more than 
empty campaign rhetoric.
<P>
	Bill C-70 is yet another in a series of omnibus bills introduced 
by the Liberal Party which further complicates, convolutes and 
confuses the income tax system in Canada.
<P>
	Most Canadians who pay income tax are unable to file their 
tax returns without the assistance of an accountant or tax lawyer. 
How has this happened? To give an idea, let me take members on 
a journey through Liberal income tax amendment bills which 
were introduced in the first year of the government's mandate.
<P>
	Bill C-9, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, was first read 
on February 4, 1994 and consisted of 70 pages. Bill C-15, an act 
to revise certain income tax law amendments in terms of the 
revised Income Tax Act and the income tax application rules, 
was first read on February 23, 1994 and consisted of 670 pages. 
Bill C-32, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the Excise Act 
and the Income Tax Act, was first read on May 27, 1994 and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12266"> 12266 </A></B>
<P>
consisted of 62 pages. Bill C-27, an act to amend the Income 
Tax Act, the income tax application rules, the Canada pension 
plan, the Canada Business Corporations Act, the Excise Tax  
Act, the Unemployment Insurance Act and certain related acts, 
was first read on May 5, 1994 and consisted of 176 pages. Bill 
C-59, an act to amend the Income Tax Act and the income tax 
application rules, was first read on November 24, 1994 and 
consisted of 110 pages.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	Finally, we have the bill before us today, Bill C-70, an act to 
amend the Income Tax Act, the income tax application rules and 
Related acts, which was first read on February 16 and consists of 
200 pages.
<P>
	The total is 1,288 pages of new amendments to the Income 
Tax Act.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes the time has come for us to 
question every aspect of our system of taxation. The urgent 
pressures of a spiralling debt and the ever growing complexity 
of an out of control Income Tax Act forced us to look seriously at 
fundamental reform of the tax system.
<P>
	A flat rated system of income tax is an important example of 
such a reform. The idea has been the subject of much discussion 
in both Canada and the United States. It is relevant and has a 
great deal of merit.
<P>
	There have been a number of flat tax models outlined in past 
years. When debating Bill C-70, the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood outlined his single tax proposal. Now I 
will outline ours; note the difference. His model is his model, 
not the Liberal model, whereas ours is a party model, not my 
model. The primary areas of variation between the two centre 
around the definition of taxable income and the application of 
tax rates.
<P>
	Canadians are among the highest taxed citizens in the 
industrialized world with about 45 per cent of a family's income 
going to government taxes. Our deficits and debts are so high 
that they are squeezing money out of program spending and we 
are transferring it over to interest payments instead.
<P>
	Increasing revenues by adding to the heavy tax burden already 
carried on the shoulders of Canadian citizens and businesses 
alike is not the solution. Raising individual taxes would increase 
hardships for many families.
<P>
	Leaving more money in the hands of the people who earn it 
makes it possible for more people to provide themselves with 
the basic necessities of life. Forcing people to send more taxes 
to Ottawa and returning it to them through social assistance is a 
waste of time, effort and money.
<P>
	Continued increases in taxation rates encourage governments 
to keep spending at current levels and avoid the difficult 
problems of dealing with the kinds of significant spending cuts 
that are needed.
<P>
	The first stage of tax reform should be a commitment on the 
part of the federal government to produce balanced budgets. 
This could be done through a Canadian taxpayers protection act 
that requires deficit control and reduction by eliminating 
expenditures according to deficit targets, inflation, and 
population growth.
<P>
	This legislation would not be designed to say how money is to 
be spent but rather to regulate how much can be spent. Its 
purpose would be to protect the Canadian taxpayer from being 
dragged into the kinds of serious debt situation we have now by 
irresponsible governments.
<P>
	The second stage of tax reform should be a commitment to the 
reform of the Income Tax Act. Our overall tax burden is the 
second highest in the G-7 countries in recent years. High taxes 
stifle economic growth in every sector of society. They decrease 
the productivity of the private sector, leading to more 
unemployment. They tempt governments to keep spending at 
current levels instead of coming to grips with the real problems.
<P>
	As I demonstrated earlier, the current system of amending the 
Income Tax Act is ridiculous. The Income Tax Act is already 
2,091 pages. Now in this past year we have added another 1,288 
pages. It is a struggle to administer, a puzzle to interpret, a 
nightmare for the majority of Canadians who have the courage 
to try to do their own tax returns. A complete overhaul of the 
system is required.
<P>
	Furthermore, in view of our current economic dilemma, tax 
reform must also mean tax relief. However, we cannot give tax 
relief until we come to realize that we must look at spending and 
what levels of government should be spending money where.
<P>
	The following outline for a proportional flat tax is a serious 
proposal that would go a long way toward solving some of our 
economic problems, an attempt to bring our system of taxation 
into the 21st century. The system must be simple, visible and 
fair: Simple so that everybody understands it; visible with no 
hidden taxes; and fair to both individuals and corporations with 
no loopholes, no exceptions.
<P>
	As it stands, the incentives should be to reward production 
and leave more dollars in the hands of taxpayers and wage 
earners than in the pockets of government, thereby reducing the 
need for many governmental assistance programs. In other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12267"> 12267 </A></B>
<P>
words, the cost of government assistance would decrease 
because fewer people would need it.
<P>
	As it stands now, Canada's Income Tax Act is based on three 
graduated rates of taxation and an extensive network of 
exemptions, deductions, reductions, deterrents and incentives.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	The proportional flat tax proposal incorporates a flat tax and 
establishes a single rate for everyone, both individuals and 
corporations, with no loopholes. With a proportional element, 
the basic flat tax model is improved further by proportioning an 
individual's tax liability according to income, family size and 
therefore the ability to pay.
<P>
	A basic level of income is tax free for all wage earners. 
Individuals and corporations would pay the same rate on income 
with a minimum of exemptions and deductions. Taxes would be 
used exclusively for the purposes of raising revenues to fund 
approved government programs, not as an instrument of 
economic, industrial or social policy.
<P>
	The rate of taxation would therefore be determined solely on 
the basis of how much the government needs to provide the 
services that Canadians want. The rate may be in the range of 20 
to 25 per cent.
<P>
	The key principle of our flat tax model is that a buck is a buck. 
Income is defined as productive income from employment, 
business and investments including interest income, capital 
gains, pensions and dividends. Some of the areas under the 
definition may be debatable, whether they should be treated that 
way, but that is for the Canadian public to decide.
<P>
	All personal income generated in any form would be taxed 
with no special treatment for various forms of income. The only 
capital gain that would not be taxed would be the one primary 
personal residence because this could represent a lifetime of 
effort over years of inflation.
<P>
	The fundamental approach to corporate income would be to 
ensure that income is only taxed once. Depreciation is 
eliminated and purchases are 100 per cent deductible in the year 
of purchase, even if it creates a loss.
<P>
	There would be one personal exemption per individual, 
perhaps $12,000. Lower income individuals would therefore be 
basically exempted from paying tax and families are granted a 
generous deduction.
<P>
	Deductions are at levels the middle class can afford. This will 
result in more tax being paid by the wealthy than is now the case 
and leaves more disposable income in the hands of taxpayers.
<P>
	A child care deduction will leave money in the hands of 
families to use to care for their children as they wish, whether it 
is at home or in day care centres. This deduction could be in the 
area of $5,000 for children up to age 7 and $3,000 for each child 
between the ages of 8 and 14.
<P>
	Spousal deductions are also included, perhaps up to $6,000. A 
charitable deduction would be included, perhaps up to 5 per 
cent. The amount of RRSPs would be reduced to $6,000 
annually so that higher income earners do not gain an unfair 
advantage and provisions would include a deduction of about 
$2,000 for seniors.
<P>
	For businesses, we could look at what they could deduct as 
cost of operations or goods, services and materials, wages and 
benefits, interest payments and pension contributions plus 
dividends paid out. This is the big difference. Dividends paid 
out to individuals for investing in that company would be 
deductible to the corporation and taxable in the hands of the 
recipient which would end the current problem of double 
taxation on dividends.
<P>
	GST or other forms of federal sales tax would not continue. 
Sales tax would be left to provincial governments to raise money 
for their own needs. This is one of the advantages of tax reform, 
looking at various levels of government and raising the money 
that they need at their level that could be shared.
<P>
	The federal government does not have to grab all, end all and 
waste all. The initial objective would be to establish a tax rate 
that is revenue neutral to begin and is redistributed equally 
between individuals and corporations.
<P>
	From that starting point, as we eliminate the waste in 
government spending, as we determine which levels of 
government should be responsible for which programs, as we 
privatize crown corporations and government gets out of the 
business of being in business, this rate would go down and down 
and down.
<P>
	I acknowledge we must start at a revenue neutral base and let 
that work through the system over a three-year period. Some of 
the advantages of this system would be an even distribution of 
the tax load by eliminating exemptions and reductions, a lower 
tax rate over the current three tier graduated system, more 
disposable income, a broader base spread out over corporations 
and individuals more equally.
<P>
	It might increase government revenue because corporations 
and higher income individuals would pay tax on everything with 
no exemptions, no tax shelters, thereby restoring tax 
expenditure costs to the government.
<P>
	More government revenue could be generated because 
perhaps the underground economy would start to disappear. 
Some economists say it presently ranges from a low of $15 
billion to a high of $100 billion. Nobody knows what level the 
transactions take on there. If we had a system of taxation where 
people were more willing to pay their taxes, the underground 
economy would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12268"> 12268 </A></B>
<P>
disappear and taxes would then flow into government coffers at 
all levels.
<P>
	The fourth advantage would be equity in the system. The 
Liberal red book dangles that idea but it does not deliver. People 
with the same level of income would pay relatively the same 
amount of tax.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Another major benefit of a proportional flat tax system would 
be simplified tax forms. Everybody could fill out his or her own 
income tax form at taxation time. As politicians and 
parliamentarians, is that not what we are here for, to try and 
improve the system, try to make laws easier for people to 
understand and for governments to administer?
<P>
	Where is the tax fairness and simplicity that the Liberals 
promised in their red ink book? We have bills like C-70, C-9, 
C-50, C-27, C-32, C-59. Next week the government is going to 
introduce another excise tax amendment to the Income Tax Act. 
All these bills put together add up to thousands and thousands of 
pages. The government has fallen into the same trap as previous 
governments. It has made the same mistake.
<P>
	In the name of simplicity and fairness it continues to make the 
system more complicated and more inequitable. It says that by 
passing all these bills, it improves the system and makes it more 
fair and more understandable. Give me a break. Who could read 
all this in six months or less and understand it?
<P>
	To members of the Liberal caucus here is an opportunity to 
stop the madness, to end the bureaucratic nightmare known as 
the income tax system and start moving the country toward a 
simple, visible, flat rate taxation system. Show some leadership. 
Follow the member for Broadview-Greenwood. Follow his 
advice. Follow our vision of a simple, visible flat taxation 
system. Show Canadians that omnibus bills like Bill C-70 will 
no longer be necessary.
<P>
	The Liberals can only spin the public for so long. They can 
only use sophistry so long in the budgets they present every year. 
They can only use sophistry so long in presenting all their 
wonderful amendments and changes to bills before the Canadian 
public will realize that their clever use of words has a false and 
misleading conclusion and will not be accepted at election time.
<P>
	Canadians will realize that if the Liberals do not do anything 
about it, that it is business as usual at plant Ottawa, they could be 
booted out just as fast as the Tories were. When the public does 
boot them out, the Reform Party will be waiting in the wings 
with a bill called Bill C-1 or C-2 or C-3. It will be a bill with a 
very high priority. It will be entitled an act to repeal the Income 
Tax Act and institute in an orderly fashion a proportional flat tax 
system in Canada over a three-year period.
<P>
	A flat tax has further advantages in that visually it makes you 
feel good. I have with me a personal income tax return under the 
proportional flat tax system. It has three categories for gross 
income. It has seven elements of deductions which I defined in 
my speech. When the total deductions are added up and 
subtracted from total income, the tax is paid at whatever 
percentage we need initially to be revenue neutral.
<P>
	As we improve government and eliminate waste in spending, 
we can continue to lower the rate to really give tax relief to the 
Canadian public. We can show them the more they look after 
themselves, and this gives them that opportunity because more 
money will be left in their pockets, then the better the system 
will be for everybody.
<P>
	The corporate income tax return is also a simple one-page 
document that scares tax lawyers and tax accountants. They 
should not be scared. In this system rather than working for 
corporations that are in receivership and trying to determine 
whether it is 10 cents, 20 cents or 50 cents on the dollar and 
wasting fruitless hours trying to do personal income tax forms 
for $50 or $100, these people will be advising the public and 
corporations where to invest, where the best rate of return will 
be. They will be helping them build profitable companies.
<P>
	I acknowledge that some tax lawyers and tax accountants will 
have to get out of the profession. Perhaps they will become 
entrepreneurs. Perhaps they will be contributors to the income 
stream rather that being on the receiving end of the expense 
stream. They do good work and they are necessary now. 
However it would open the field for a lot more opportunities. I 
do not think these people need to worry.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	On this tax form under income we have everything the 
corporation makes. There are five deductions. Any losses are 
carried forward, for a total of six items of deductions for 
corporations. Subtract those deductions from income and send 
in the tax at the same rate as individuals.
<P>
	This principle of fairness would make every Canadian and all 
corporations happy. Corporations would be proud of no longer 
being accused of manipulating the system, of not paying their 
fair share. We hear all the time that corporations do not pay their 
fair share of taxes. We hear all the time that the wealthy do not 
pay their share of taxes.
<P>
	Under this system individuals would have a certain level of 
tax free income. A married couple with two children would have 
the basic $12,000 deduction, $6,000 for a spouse is $18,000, and 
$5,000 each for two children under seven equals $28,000 of 
income that would not be taxed.
<P>
	Currently somebody making $12,000 has to send in $1,200. 
They then have to line up for some kind of subsidy program for 
education, job retraining, unemployment and welfare. By the 
time that $1,200 comes back to that individual it has shrunk to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12269"> 12269 </A></B>
<P>
about  $400. That is what gets used up sending it to Ottawa and 
then sending it back to the people in the field who need it.
<P>
	Let us stop this nonsense. It is one of the best ways we have to 
reduce the pressure and save social programs. Leave the money 
in the hands of the people who need it for their own subsistence, 
for food, shelter and clothing. We are supposed to be here to find 
solutions and that is a very concrete solution.
<P>
	Without the loopholes, exemptions and deductions that the 
wealthy use now to manipulate the system and receive tax 
breaks, they will pay their share on all income. This will enable 
wealthy people not to worry about whether or not they are 
paying their share. I already know for a fact that 50 per cent of 
the tax revenues generated in this country on an individual basis 
come from 10 per cent or less of Canada's taxpaying population. 
The wealthy are paying their share. Now the Liberal government 
is saying the corporations are not paying their share. The 
corporations under this system would pay their share.
<P>
	As we discuss the simple, visible, flat system of taxation 
perhaps the debate could lead to a system where corporations 
would only pay 5 per cent, allowing them to hire more people, to 
reinvest their profits.
<P>
	Why would I invest in a company and how would I get my 
money back? I am using 80 cent dollars. I make an investment 
and it is not deductible. However, I have invested in an area 
where I feel and see that the economy is going to grow. It is not 
driven by the government. It is driven by speculators, risk takers 
and investors.
<P>
	The company may be making a profit digging out gold or they 
have a manufacturing company and make bicycles better than 
the other bicycle. If I invest in that company and it makes profit 
it will pay me out of the profits. It gets to deduct those dividends 
and I pay tax on them. It is an equitable and fair system.
<P>
	The government will no longer be able to accuse one sector of 
the economy of abusing the system. The flat tax cleans up the 
entire system of taxation and reallocates the purpose of 
government, what the government should be doing, whether it is 
regulation or social programs. It raises the money required to do 
it and delivers it.
<P>
	I believe a flat tax system is going to become a reality in the 
United States. Therefore, why delay in making the proportional 
flat tax a reality in Canada? Let us start today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member spent quite a bit of time talking about the flat tax 
approach. In my experience as a chartered accountant, if it 
sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
<P>
	The member's approach and what he has been proposing to 
the House time and time again is overly simplistic and unfair. He 
seems to think that if one takes a tax return and shrinks it down 
to one piece of paper that somehow helps the situation. The 
method of reporting is only bookkeeping and paperwork. It does 
not impact the amount of taxes collected.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	The member will know that if Canadians have medical 
expenses they have to provide an itemization of the expenses for 
deductibility. If they have charitable donations, and many 
Canadians have a lot of charitable donations, they have to be 
itemized. Nowhere on his proposed form is their room for 
detailing eligible expenses.
<P>
	The member will know that unincorporated businesses with 
sole proprietors must have a set of books and must report the 
detail from those books as to various sources of revenue and 
legitimate deductions against business income on their personal 
tax return.
<P>
	Similarly rental properties, which many Canadians have as 
investments for the future, must also have a set of books and 
must report in some detail so that revenue is properly accounted 
for and eligible rental property expenses are claimed.
<P>
	I heard a contradiction in the member's speech. In the first 
part he insinuated that the rich were not paying their fair share. 
In the conclusion of his statement he argued that the wealthy and 
the rich were paying their fair share.
<P>
	The member is quite right in the latter case. The top 10 per 
cent of taxpayers in Canada make $50,000 a year or more. They 
pay 37 per cent of all taxes in Canada. What is more important is 
that they also pay 42 per cent of all charitable donations. If the 
tax burden on Canadians who are fortunate enough to earn 
higher incomes is increased, the first thing to suffer will be their 
level of contributions to charitable donations, which will 
definitely hurt all Canadians.
<P>
	The flat tax notion has to be dealt with here and now. If the 
member thinks that the U.S. has the answers to all Canadian 
problems, he is absolutely wrong. Let us give one very 
important example considering that last night in the House the 
member stood and said that members of Parliament should be 
paid a salary of $12,000 a month or $144,000 a year, an $80,000 
salary increase. He is saying in the House that they will make 
things better. That is not the way to do it.
<P>
	Under his flat tax system a member of Parliament who makes 
$64,400 a year pays income tax at 37 per cent on his average 
marginal rate. That equates to some $24,000 a year. Under his 
system of a flat tax with no deductions of 30 per cent, a member 
of Parliament would only pay $18,000 of taxes or a reduction in 
taxes of $6,000.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12270"> 12270 </A></B>
<P>
	Persons making $25,000 a year pay $6,000 today. Under his 
system they would pay $7,500 a year, a $1,500 increase to a low 
income Canadian. Could the member explain why his flat tax 
actually hurts poor Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious the member does not 
believe in a single flat tax. I appreciate the difficulty the hon. 
member for Broadview-Greenwood has in his caucus.
<P>
	Let me clear up the comment I made last night. The hon. 
member is an accountant. He knows that MPs currently make 
$64,000, have a $6,000 tax free travel allowance and a $22,000 
living allowance. Those are taxable. Let him dispute right now 
that we are getting the equivalent of $10,000 a month. He can 
take that number, put it in his little calculator and figure it all 
out.
<P>
	I am suggesting that we get rid of different levels of 
remuneration for MPs and quit using a low salary of $64,000 as 
an excuse for a gold plated, three tiered, extravagant, double 
standard pension plan. That is what the government is trying to 
justify to Canadian taxpayers. It is not legitimate.
<P>
	What I suggested last night was in context. The gentleman 
likes to interrupt speeches, take things out of context, do a little 
twist, stick the knife in and do a little turn. I am trying to offer a 
balanced approach to and a balanced solution for MPs' 
compensation, a salary level where MPs look after their own 
pensions. They can contribute 5 per cent matched one to one by 
the government, not three and a half times one as the 
government is doing now.
<P>
	Getting back to the specifics of the proportional flat tax or a 
flat tax, in the current system the tax form is one-quarter inch 
thick. In our flat tax system it will be one page. There is one line 
for charitable donations. Whether it is 5 per cent of gross 
income, 17 per cent of net income or whatever, it can be debated. 
When a person has a lot of donations and deductions the backup 
to this one page might be one inch thick.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps that accountant can get it through his head that I am 
not talking about everything on one page. There are receipts. It 
is justified. It is all sent in. That is all people have to worry about 
to figure out their income tax. He is out of the accounting 
profession because he is now a politician. He is a wannabe 
millionaire.
<P>
	The other point he talked about was the supposed 
contradiction about the wealthy. The top 10 per cent is not 
earning $50,000 or over. He does not have his numbers straight. 
The top 10 per cent is earning $80,000 and over. They are the 
ones who contribute.
<P>
	Is that the right number? What is the number? Help me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> The number is $52,000 and they contribute 50 
per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I want to get this right because the gentleman likes 
the facts. He likes to be specific and I do not want to make 
comments out of context as the member does. I like to keep 
things in context. When I make a mistake and I am wrong, I 
admit it. I do not go on pretending I have all the answers like 
some members of the government.
<P>
	I have vented my frustration with the member eloquently 
enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in 
debate on the legislation.
<P>
	Bill C-70, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, seeks to 
implement a number of measures introduced in the 1994 budget, 
along with certain measures announced by the government at 
other times over the last year.
<P>
	In asking for the support of colleagues in the House I would be 
remiss if I did not remind them of the context of the legislation.
<P>
	The fiscal challenge facing the country has been a topic of 
considerable debate both in the House and across the country. 
Few dispute the scope of the challenge. Few dispute the difficult 
choices that must be made. Few dispute that we must act 
decisively. Few dispute that fairness and effectiveness must be 
essential guiding principles of any and all steps taken to 
overcome our deficit challenge. These principles have guided 
the government as it has worked to restrain spending. They 
guided the minister in crafting the budget presented in February.
<P>
	For the moment and for the discussion of the legislation let me 
take hon. members back to the budget last year. Spending cuts 
alone could not deliver the deficit reductions set out at that time. 
Spending constraint had to be complemented with some 
measures on the tax side. Doing so was simply a question of 
fairness. Our vision of fairness guided us as we looked at the tax 
system addressing unsustainable tax preferences instead of 
imposing general tax hikes on Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	In looking at the corporate tax regime we sought to ensure that 
corporations paid their fair share of the tax revenues needed to 
fund government programs and to prevent certain businesses or 
sectors from taking undue advantage of certain tax provisions.
<P>
	With this in mind, the budget last year proposed a number of 
measures for the rules governing the taxation of business 
income. Let me stress that our goal was not to penalize the 
business sector or to impede the competitiveness of Canadian 
corporations. We believe it is essential to maintain a competi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12271"> 12271 </A></B>
<P>
tive tax system in today's global economy. We cannot disregard 
the role of business in creating and sustaining employment. Nor 
can we ignore the pressures faced by Canadian companies as  
they operate in fiercely competitive markets both at home and 
around the world.
<P>
	One fairness issue the budget addressed was the tax rules 
dealing with debt forgiveness and foreclosures. Under the old 
provisions of the Income Tax Act many transactions involving 
the settlement of debt were not recognized in any meaningful 
way for income tax purposes.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The new rules provide a comprehensive basis to deal with 
debt settlement. In general they provide that forgiven debt 
amounts will be applied to losses carried forward and expenses, 
or partially included in the debtor's income. I should point out, 
however, that there are special relieving rules to minimize 
undue hardship from these new rules.
<P>
	Let me turn now to the tax treatment of securities held by 
financial institutions. Until now the Income Tax Act was not 
providing specific rules regarding the tax treatment of such 
securities.
<P>
	The measures proposed in the bill seek to reduce uncertainty 
in this regard and to ensure the income derived from such 
securities is measured appropriately. The amendments provide 
that certain securities will be marked to market, meaning that 
the appreciation or depreciation in their value each year must be 
recognized in that year.
<P>
	In keeping with our goal of fairness the amendments include a 
transitional rule that allows increases in income resulting from 
the new rules to be spread over five years. These new measures 
are generally effective after February 21, 1994.
<P>
	In addition, new rules are provided for debt securities that are 
not required to be marked to market. These rules deal with the 
measurement of income while the securities are held and the 
treatment of gains and losses on disposition.
<P>
	Bill C-70 also amends the rules for the taxation of resident 
shareholders of foreign affiliates. This action is being taken as a 
result of the government's ongoing monitoring of developments 
in the area. The changes expand the categories of income of 
foreign affiliates that must be reported as income of the 
Canadian affiliates.
<P>
	Another modification prevents the use of an affiliate's foreign 
active business losses to reduce Canadian shareholders' income. 
This change also protects the Canadian tax base. The 
amendments are generally effective for taxation years 
commencing after 1994.
<P>
	Finally let me turn to six tax measures announced during the 
months after the 1994 budget. The bill addresses the issue of 
eligible prepaid funeral and cemetery arrangements. Under the 
legislation individuals making such arrangements would not 
have to declare interest on deposits up to a $15,000 maximum 
contribution as income, provided the deposit is not withdrawn 
for other purposes. The provider of eligible  funeral and 
cemetery arrangements is however required to include in 
income the total amount received from an eligible arrangement.
<P>
	Turning to the next measure, the bill proposes that real estate 
trusts with publicly traded units be allowed to qualify as mutual 
fund trusts. The measure responds to representations from the 
real estate sector which is interested in expanding the available 
methods of financing real estate. We believe the proposed 
change will facilitate the restructuring and refinancing of the 
sector.
<P>
	The third of the post-budget measures is a measure that will 
help mutual funds reduce overhead costs and improve services 
to investors. The amendments allow mutual fund corporations to 
convert to mutual fund trusts on a tax free basis and allow tax 
free mergers of mutual fund trusts.
<P>
	The bill proposes new rules to speed the resolution of 
objections and appeals particularly by large corporations. Large 
corporations will now have to specify the issues under dispute, 
the amount of relief sought, and the facts and reasons for 
objecting.
<P>
	The rules also limit the ability of large corporations to raise 
new issues in a notice of objection where the objection relates to 
the reconsideration of an assessment. However new issues 
raised by Revenue Canada on such reconsiderations may still 
give rise to notices of objection.
<P>
	In addition, the legislation will ensure that the new 
requirements relating to notices of objection will not apply to 
assessments which were repealed through court before the 
legislation received royal assent.
<P>
	The final measure I want to highlight deals with the tax 
treatment of dividend compensation payments and other 
incomes connected with securities lending. The Income Tax Act 
currently provides that the lender of securities not be treated as 
having disposed of the security under these arrangements. As 
well, payments to the lender as compensation for dividends are 
treated as dividends in the lender's hands. While these dividend 
compensation payments are generally not tax deductible, a 
special rule established in 1989 allows securities dealers to 
deduct two thirds of such payments.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	This legislation extends the use of the two-thirds rule, thus 
ensuring our security industries remain competitive.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Can I go to 
my motion?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No. The time has expired. We will now

	The House resumed from March 24 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this debate is on Motion No. 314 by the hon. member for Moose 
Jaw-Lake Centre. It gives the government an opportunity to 
point out that it is working with the provinces and industry to 
deliver effective, cost efficient programming for the benefit of 
the primary agriculture and agri-food industry and the 
consumer.
<P>
	The fundamental proposal in the motion has considerable 
merit. Who could not agree with the notion of reducing the 
duplication of programs and services? I cannot. It does not make 
sense for two levels of government to do the same thing. It does 
not make sense to spend $1 more than what is necessary.
<P>
	If the government were to adopt the hon. member's motion to 
immediately pursue negotiations with the provinces and the 
agri-food industry to eliminate overlap and duplication, we 
would be reinventing the wheel.
<P>
	We do not want a new set of constitutional negotiations. I 
remember what happened during the last set. We want 
agreements with the provinces to make a real difference in the 
lives of the people actively farming in Canada today.
<P>
	I can think of no better example than agriculture, a shared 
responsibility between provincial and federal levels of 
government, to illustrate the enormous effort made by the 
federal government, provinces, the industry and municipal 
governments to work together to resolve issues and deliver 
effective programming and reduce spending.
<P>
	There are many examples such as safety nets, where both 
levels of government and industry have come up with a national 
whole farm program that will provide $1 billion of income 
support for producers this year; $600 million from the federal 
government and the rest from provincial governments.
<P>
	The federal government has been working with the provinces, 
with industry and even with municipal governments to put in 
place a national food inspection system that will harmonize 
standards across the country, get rid of duplication of effort 
where it does exist and at the same time maintain Canada's high 
standards of food safety and quality which are respected 
worldwide.
<P>
	In financial services the Farm Credit Corporation and 
interested provinces are discussing ways to reduce duplication 
of government services. The FCC has acquired the New 
Brunswick agricultural development board portfolio. It has been 
working with the Alberta Financial Services Corporation since 
last June to combine the two lending services into a single 
delivery point.
<P>
	In research, a valuable tool for Canadian agriculture and 
agri-food, the federal government is working closely with the 
private sector and universities to continue a long tradition of 
scientific excellence. The Canadian agriculture food research 
council, which has representatives from provincial 
governments, universities and industry, helps ensure there is a 
co-ordinated approach and that we avoid duplication.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	The list is almost endless and I will not tire the House with 
much more, just a few more points: trade and market 
development, environmental initiatives, a new range of 
adaptation measures following the February 27 budget to 
support industry as it adjusts to a market driven economy.
<P>
	There is no area where federal and provincial governments do 
not collaborate effectively. After all, what have we been doing 
in agriculture since 1867? That is what we will continue to do in 
the integrated world of agriculture and agri-food where 
co-operation among all the players is more important than it 
ever was in the past.
<P>
	For these reasons I urge members to vote against the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to address the motion of my hon. 
colleague from Moose Jaw-Lake Centre.
<P>
	The motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should immediately 
pursue negotiations with the provinces and the agri-food industry in order to 
reassign jurisdictional responsibilities in agriculture and eliminate overlap and 
duplication.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The hon. member refers to this process as reconfederating 
agriculture. This is an appropriate term because it alludes to a 
new way off looking at how levels of government should treat 
agriculture.
<P>
	The motion undertakes to prod government to adopt a more 
efficient and effective agriculture industry by reducing the 
amount of overlap between the federal and provincial 
governments. It is important to note the suggested changes and 
jurisdictions could be made without any constitutional 
amendments.
<P>
	There are major changes afoot in the area of agriculture. In the 
west we are seeing the subsidy for grain transportation 
eliminated after an existence of close to 100 years. Global 
change in agriculture is at an unprecedented pace. We must 
change the way 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12273"> 12273 </A></B>
<P>
we treat our industry to keep up with it. This is combined with an  
ever increasing realization that governments at almost all levels 
are in serious debt.
<P>
	We do not have the money to fund everything. It is time to cut 
back significantly. Agriculture departments are no exception. 
The Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food has had its 
budget cut considerably in the recent federal budget.
<P>
	It is now time to take a hard look at how we can eliminate 
overlap between levels of government so we can get the most 
results from our scarce tax dollars. In 1994-95 the 10 Canadian 
provinces will spend a total of almost $2.2 billion on the 
agriculture industry. The federal government will also spend an 
additional $2.2 billion on this industry. That is a total of $4.4 
billion all coming from the same taxpayers.
<P>
	Where are the provincial or federal funds? The 10 provinces 
had 10,000 civil servants employed in their agriculture 
departments this year. The federal government had about the 
same number for a total of approximately 20,000 full time 
people on the public payroll in support of private sector 
agriculture. That equals one person on the public payroll for 
every seven farms. Clearly with these statistics we must 
examine what kind of effectiveness we are getting for our 
expenditures.
<P>
	As members of Parliament we must strive to ensure we have 
an industry more marketed oriented, can respond faster to 
external demands and is more productive and efficient.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	With regard to government involvement in agriculture it is 
really time to get out the microscope and closely examine what 
government does in its dealings with agriculture.
<P>
	By looking at the various components that make up the 
agriculture industry we can clearly label the tasks that should be 
performed by government and the tasks that should be left in the 
hands of the industry. As has been stated by my colleagues, 
reconfederating agriculture means we will develop a system of 
agriculture in which more decisions are made at the local level 
and at the farm gate.
<P>
	Reform members have always said farmers, given the 
opportunity, will always make the decisions in the best interests 
of the industry. The motion really asks for the federal 
government to initiate a process where government at all levels 
works to give farmers this opportunity.
<P>
	There are some important themes in the motion. The basic 
idea is that the decisions in the industry should be made at the 
closest possible level to the farm gate. The higher levels should 
be programmed where the federal government and provincial 
governments have some input.
<P>
	We should ask the following six questions from this type of 
service. Does the program continue to serve the public? Is there 
a legitimate role for government in the program? Is the current 
role of the federal appropriate or could it be realigned with the 
provinces? What program related activities could be transferred 
to the private sector? How can overall efficiency be improved? 
Is the program affordable?
<P>
	Government responsibilities would be clearly divided 
between the federal government and provincial or territorial 
governments. The provinces would be responsible for natural 
and human resources. This makes sense because these resources 
are specific to each province and they vary from province to 
province.
<P>
	The federal government would have responsibility for trade 
policy, whole farm income, stabilization, import, safety and 
health standards and fiscal and monetary policy. This would 
reinforce the goals of the federal government which are to assist 
lower levels of government in areas that span provincial 
boundaries and managing issues common to farmers and 
processors regardless of what area of the country they come 
from.
<P>
	Among the functions of government should be research and 
development to ensure among other things we are investing 
money primarily in sound ventures that guarantee return on our 
investment.
<P>
	Another necessary role of government is establishing a 
necessary level of regulatory policy in the private sector. 
Although I think most people in the industry would agree that 
overall there should be a decrease in regulations and that 
governments should get off the backs of farmers and processors, 
there is still a need to provide a basic level to ensure the integrity 
of Canada's industry.
<P>
	Another government responsibility is to create the lowest 
level of taxation possible for the most efficient environment for 
agriculture to operate in. The tax burden in Canada is simply too 
high. It has been fueled by indiscriminate overspending and it 
stifles investment and jobs.
<P>
	A clean break is needed from the cycle of tax and spend. If we 
are ever to realize the full potential of our industry there are a 
few other responsibilities to be studied. I know my colleague 
and others have discussed these at greater length.
<P>
	The responsibilities of the agri-food industry would be to 
provide the supplies to meet the demand. That is to say, by 
providing goods to the public the industry should have the 
responsibility and the input at all stages in the life cycle of goods 
including research and development, production, processing 
including storage, inspection, grading and labelling, and 
transportation. Producers must be directly involved in the 
marketing of their products. Financing and insurance should be 
available to processors in a competitive atmosphere.

<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I think the motion of my hon. colleague addresses these issues 
and gives some very important input into regulating or 
deregulating the agriculture industry so that it will become 
productive, efficient, and compatible in today's world 
standards.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak on the motion before 
the House. I want to thank the member for Moose Jaw-Lake 
Centre for bringing this motion forward.
<P>
	My riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants is the home of a large 
and diverse agricultural and agri-food sector. I am always 
pleased, therefore, to have the opportunity to discuss what our 
government is doing to support this important sector.
<P>
	I believe all members of the House would agree that the hon. 
member's commitment to eliminating overlap and duplication 
in the agricultural sector is a good thing. While I believe this 
motion is well intentioned, I also believe it is unnecessary.
<P>
	The hon. member wants to launch negotiations to reassign 
jurisdictional responsibilities. Canada's Constitution makes 
agriculture a joint responsibility of the federal and provincial 
governments. I believe this is one of the areas where flexible 
federalism is working.
<P>
	Since 1867 the federal government and the provinces have 
developed a culture of co-operation. While the Constitution 
does not specify certain areas as federal and others as 
provincial, governments have learned, however, to work 
together without treading on each other's toes.
<P>
	One area where this has worked well is in trade and market 
development. While international trade is strictly a federal 
responsibility and would remain so under the proposed motion, 
this government recognizes the value of working with the 
provinces to promote exports of agriculture and agri-food 
products.
<P>
	In my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants, I am pleased to say 
there is a strong and ever growing value added sector. The 
processing of hogs, chickens, fruits, and vegetables can be 
found in a number of my communities. Our government has an 
important role to play in helping them uncover new market 
opportunities.
<P>
	The best way to expand our markets and reach our potential is 
through co-operation, both with the provinces and the 
respective industries.
<P>
	We believe that there is no need to open the Constitution to 
address these issues of jurisdictional responsibilities. Instead, 
we must work with our provincial colleagues and focus on 
innovation and market development. This co-operation takes 
many forms.
<P>
	When the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food travelled to 
Chile, Argentina, and Brazil in March, high level 
representatives of three provincial governments travelled with 
him. These joint missions allow the federal government to 
promote the entire Canadian agricultural  and agri-food sector. 
At the same time, the provinces pursue specific opportunities 
for their own industries.
<P>
	We saw another example of two levels of government working 
together in the final days of the GATT negotiations. Provincial 
representatives were in Geneva helping reach the draft 
agreement. Immediately afterwards the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food convened a meeting with our provincial 
colleagues to plan how we could meet our obligations.
<P>
	Federal and provincial representatives worked very closely in 
the following months on the task force on orderly marketing led 
by the parliamentary secretary. Thanks to their willingness to 
work together for the common good, our supply managed 
sectors are moving forward to meet the challenges of the new 
trade regime.
<P>
	Another example of this co-operation can be seen in the 
export targets established for this sector. The industry set for 
itself a target of $20 billion in agri-food exports by the year 
2000. Federal and provincial ministers of agriculture accepted 
that target and agreed to help each other reach it. They added a 
further target of regaining Canada's traditional 3.5 per cent 
share of the global agri-food trade. Reaching this goal would 
boost our exports to $23 billion annually.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	However, setting the goal was the easy part. For our next steps 
the federal government will continue to work with industry and 
with the provinces. We must work to provide the programs and 
initiatives that industry has told us it needs to take advantage of 
so as to develop new market opportunities. To this end, the 
department's priorities in the area of trade for the next three 
years will include a number of initiatives.
<P>
	We will negotiate further trade access with countries such as 
Israel and Chile through the NAFTA. As well, we will work with 
countries such as China through the GATT expansion.
<P>
	Our government is committed to creating the Canada 
agri-food marketing council. This will allow the industry to 
effectively advise government on how best to support exports in 
achieving their targets.
<P>
	We will create an agri-food trade service to provide 
single-window access and market development services. Our 
government is also committed to consolidating existing market 
and trade development programs into a single streamlined 
Agri-food 2000 program. I believe this program will greatly 
assist industry in its export efforts.
<P>
	We are working to provide producers and processors with 
timely information about international markets through a new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12275"> 12275 </A></B>
<P>
agri-food trade network. In doing so, we want to help businesses 
make better and more informed decisions.
<P>
	A key priority will be the setting up of the agri-food credit 
facility. This facility will provide credits worth up to $1 billion 
for exporters of grain and other agri-food products to offshore 
private sector buyers. This in turn will help Canadian producers 
continue to compete effectively and efficiently in the export 
markets.
<P>
	By working in tandem with the provinces to achieve these 
initiatives, our government is committed to helping the 
agri-food sector reach its export targets. Now is not the time to 
work at cross purposes with the provinces and debate 
jurisdictional issues. Now, however, is the time to foster even 
greater federal and provincial relations. In doing so, our 
agricultural and agri-food sector will only get stronger.
<P>
	I again thank the hon. member for bringing this motion 
forward for debate. I certainly do not question the hon. 
member's commitment to eliminating inefficiencies and 
overlap in this important sector. However, I believe we can 
achieve our goals through federal-provincial co-operation 
rather than reassigning jurisdictional responsibilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak today on motion M-314 
put forward by my colleague from Moose Jaw-Lake Centre.
<P>
	I find it interesting that my Liberal colleagues speak of the 
lack of necessity for this bill. Both the hon. member for 
Lisgar-Marquette, who just spoke, and the hon. member for 
Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, who proposed this motion, are active 
farmers who are struggling under the inefficiencies and the 
problems of the system as it is now and are seeking to put 
solutions forward.
<P>
	The agricultural industry is intricately tied into the whole 
social fabric of Canada. Over one million Canadians today are 
involved in agriculture. Many of our peers in this Chamber, as I 
have mentioned, have left their farms to represent their friends 
and neighbours in the House of Commons. Millions of other 
Canadians only need to look back a generation or two to find a 
parent or a grandparent who worked the land. My own father 
ranched at the Springhouse ranch and my grandfather at the 141 
mile ranch in the Cariboo district of British Columbia.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	The product of the hard work of our Canadian farmers and 
ranchers sustained our troops during two great wars, saved the 
lives of millions of the world's poorest nations, and feeds the 
needy and destitute of today. They fed the world for decades and 
will continue to do so for decades to come. We are blessed with 
an amazing basket that feeds the hungry of the world. The 
question remaining, though, is how to continue feeding the 
world in the most efficient way possible.
<P>
	The agriculture industry of today is vastly different from that 
of 50 years ago. Today, agriculture is controlled and managed 
through a number of government departments and private sector 
organizations. We have bureaucrats in downtown Ottawa 
studying regional farming policies, and at the same time their 
counterparts in the ten provincial capitals are duplicating many 
of the same services the federal government is offering. On top 
of these bureaucracies are a variety of government agencies and 
private corporations that work in the industry.
<P>
	Combine all these agencies and government departments 
together and you have a tangle of rules, restrictions, and 
regulations that hamper initiative and change. What is needed is 
a new vision, a new and better approach to the management of 
agriculture.
<P>
	There are three starting points the government must first 
realize before a positive change can take place. The three points 
I refer to are that each region of our country has unique and 
diverse needs; that each government has a responsibility to 
respond to these needs, using its respective strengths; and that 
each person within the agriculture community has a strong 
desire to go about their business in the most efficient and 
profitable way possible. Let me take a moment to expand on 
these three points.
<P>
	First, on the uniqueness of each region, I have had the 
privilege of travelling through and working in many of the 
agriculture regions of our country. I have worked in the cattle 
ranches in the British Columbia interior. I have walked through 
prairie wheat fields. I have driven by the corn and tobacco fields 
of southern Ontario. I hope some day to visit some of the farms 
in Quebec, as I have had the opportunity to do in the Maritimes, 
particularly in Hants County, where the member for Annapolis 
Valley-Hants comes from.
<P>
	What has always struck me is how distinctive each region is 
and how unique each region's needs are. Do these regions have 
common concerns? Of course they do. These concerns should be 
pursued in a united manner. Yet the regions do not share 
common ground on every issue, and we as parliamentarians 
must keep this in mind.
<P>
	Second, on responding to those needs, this year the federal 
government will spend over $2.2 billion to support our 
agriculture industry, and the provinces will contribute a similar 
amount, meaning that almost $4.5 billion will be spent on 
agriculture programs this year. This works out to over $157 per 
Canadian or over $332 per taxpayer. That is enough to feed one 
person for ten weeks, and perhaps longer with careful shopping. 
Are Canadians getting value for that money? According to the 
farmers and the taxpayers, the answer is no. Is there room for 
improvement? Of course there is room for improvement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12276"> 12276 </A></B>
<P>
	For that $4.5 billion the various levels of government manage 
to keep over 20,000 civil servants on the payroll, 10,000 at the 
provincial level and another 10,000 at the federal level. 
According to my colleague from Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, this 
works out to one agricultural civil servant for every 14 farms.
<P>
	The limited money remaining after paying these government 
employees goes into numerous support programs. These federal 
and provincial programs often end up overlapping each other, 
resulting in farmers wasting valuable time and paperwork, not to 
mention the tax dollars lost through duplication.
<P>
	To respond to the needs of farmers, governments must play to 
their inherent strengths. That is, the federal government 
directing its resources to such areas as international trade, 
monetary policy, whole farm income stabilization, and safety 
hazards, and the provinces more locally investing their money in 
such areas as resource management and human resources.
<P>
<B>(1400 ) </B>
<P>
	There is the desire for each stakeholder to go about his or her 
business in the most efficient way possible. We must begin 
talking more about empowerment, giving individuals more 
autonomy in their everyday lives.
<P>
	It is amazing how bureaucratic control has crept into so much 
of our Canadian way of life, stifling the very initiative it set out 
to reinforce. Extending autonomy can involve encouraging the 
private sector to become more involved so the market system 
can work to the advantage of the farmer, not just to satisfy 
regulations that are increasingly failing to meet the needs they 
were designed for.
<P>
	We in Parliament must be constantly asking ourselves how we 
as law makers and the civil servants who enforce the laws and 
implement the regulations are interfering with the private 
sector. Are we in its way? If so, how can we move out of the 
way?
<P>
	I urge the minister of agriculture and his provincial 
counterparts to be constantly asking the same questions asked 
during the federal program review for each and every subsidy 
and program in the department.
<P>
	Does the program continue to serve the public interest? Is 
there a legitimate and necessary role for the government in this 
area? Is the current role of the federal government appropriate, 
or can the programs be turned over to the provinces or even 
eliminated in the name of efficiency and well-being for the 
individual farmer and the agriculture industry? What activities 
could be transferred to the private or volunteer sectors? If the 
government program continues, how can its efficiency be 
improved? Is the final package of programs affordable and if not 
which of these programs could and should be abandoned?
<P>
	My colleague from Moose Jaw-Lake Centre has taken an 
important first step by proposing a new dialogue between the 
players involved in the agriculture industry. I hope this debate 
on Motion No. M-314 will be an important first step in bringing 
about substantial change in the agriculture policy of Canada.
<P>
	I ask and encourage all members of the House to support this 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate today in this third and final hour of 
debate on the motion by my hon. colleague from Moose 
Jaw-Lake Centre. The motion reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should immediately 
pursue negotiations with the provinces and agri-food industry in order to 
re-assign jurisdictional responsibilities in agriculture and eliminate overlap 
and duplication.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My colleagues who have addressed this motion have focused 
on how we can get the agricultural business in Canada done 
smarter, better and cheaper. We have said that we must focus on 
how the private and public sectors can work together more 
efficiently and effectively.
<P>
	We have reached a time in our history when good economics 
and good politics can converge. Canadians want their political 
leaders to make the absolute best use of public moneys. They 
want all mismanagement and waste done away with. They want 
the political turf wars between the federal government and the 
provinces to cease.
<P>
	They want politicians to go back to square one and ask: If we 
had to start all over again, how would we structure our collective 
affairs? That is not just in agriculture, but may be especially so 
today. How would we organize government departments at the 
federal and provincial levels? How would we create 
co-operation, not competition, between the public and private 
sectors? These are conceptual questions that my colleagues have 
tried to present answers to as applied to agriculture within 
Canada.
<P>
	We have said that if we could take agriculture, which is 
probably the most basic industry, and develop a clear division of 
responsibilities between levels of government and the industry, 
we could save hundreds of millions of public dollars and we 
could unleash the private sector to grow to its complete 
potential. By taking one department of government such as 
agriculture and working through this redesigning or 
reconfederating process, we could learn lessons that could be 
applied broadly across all the economic and social portfolios 
within government.
<P>
	A discussion of this nature deals not only with a clearer 
division of jurisdictions between governments, but also with a 
clearer understanding of the functions and the roles of both the 
government and the private sector.
<P>
	My colleague from Moose Jaw-Lake Centre has suggested 
government has six roles most appropriate for it. First, there is 
basic precommercial research and development. Second, is a 
commercial role limited to  providing only those goods and 
services that are non-rival, non-excludable and thus not captur-
<P>

<B><A NAME="12277"> 12277 </A></B>
<P>
able exclusively by the private sector. Third is a minimum level 
of regulation that ensures safety and health. Fourth is a role in 
educating and training our children, youth and adults. Fifth is a 
role in serving the private sector with suitable public programs. 
Sixth is a mediation role in helping to resolve conflicting and 
sometimes competing interests.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	On the other hand, we suggested that the private sector is most 
suited to make the vast majority of decisions and have ultimate 
responsibility for organizing the production of private goods 
and services. The industry must supply the demand and provide 
goods and services that can be competitive and from which 
profit can be gained. For the most part, government should stay 
out of these business related functions. There may be niche 
roles, but they will be very few in number. These business 
functions include commercial research and development, 
production, processing, transporting, marketing, financing and 
insuring.
<P>
	Without question, this kind of business led free market system 
is the best way we have found to distribute resources and wealth 
throughout an economy and a society. This is because a 
business-led free market system is an open social order where 
individuals or parties have the right to contract with others on 
legal and mutually agreeable terms based on free choice. This 
open social order must promote personal responsibility for 
choices instead of state protection, individual innovation 
instead of bureaucratic control, and the encouragement of 
voluntary contracting exchange between free participants.
<P>
	We must also recognize that we want a free market system to 
provide protection for weaker partners so that they are not 
victims of unfair commercial practices. In other words, we want 
a free and a just market system. This issue is without doubt one 
of the most important things that we as politicians can discuss at 
this level. It has occupied the attention of legislators and 
economists around the world since the free markets began.
<P>
	At the end of this millennium we are also finding new resolve 
to ask how we best ensure a free market system is both free and 
just. I suggest there is both a moral and a democratic answer to 
the question.
<P>
	Because the tools of wealth and freedom are available in a free 
market system, participants in that system have a moral 
obligation to ensure that the creation of wealth and freedom are 
spread as far afield as possible. To whom much is given, much is 
expected. Our cultural values will determine how moral a free 
market system really is. Then a market system that is free and 
just will be based upon a genuinely democratic process of 
decision making in public and private policy, work and capital. 
In a free market economy, justice for all is best realized by 
ensuring that bottom up democracy characterizes all economic 
and political institutions.
<P>
	The power and authority must be spread out as widely as 
possible. Organizations must be flat rather than hierarchical. 
People must be empowered to fully participate in the privileges 
and responsibilities of a productive economy. In a multitude of 
counsellors there is safety.
<P>
	This is why my colleagues and I insist on the importance of 
direct farmer and business involvement in developing 
agricultural policy. We must work from the bottom to the top, 
not the other way around. We must get the maximum number of 
people involved in the decision making process. Business and 
governments around the world are realizing that the more 
democratic these institutions are, the more economically and 
socially successful they will be.
<P>
	A parliamentary democracy must submit political party 
discipline to representation of the people if it is to maintain the 
loyalty of those people.
<P>
	The private sector has other roles to perform in organizing for 
the supply of private goods and services within a free and just 
market economy. Industry stakeholders must have freedom of 
association. They should be able to democratically organize, 
carry out their activities and advocate their causes to other 
stakeholders and the public in whatever self-supporting and 
legal manner that best serves their interests.
<P>
	The private sector also has a self-regulation function. A clear 
set of regulatory policies that is established internally by 
industry or externally by government should be binding on all. 
This system nurtures the natural expressions of differences and 
openly rewards success within that regulatory policy.
<P>
	Obviously the private sector should also have some ability to 
mediate its affairs and reconcile its own differences. Where this 
is not possible, outside private or public mediators could be 
called on to help. The real need however is for all the 
stakeholders in a given industry to develop a collaborative 
approach to allow each player to do what it does best in order to 
realize the best possible good for all.
<P>
	Finally the private sector has an information sharing function, 
which is to say that it should research, compile, analyse, 
interpret and distribute data helpful to its cause.
<P>
	These basic ideas about the most appropriate roles for 
government and the most appropriate roles for the private 
sectors are crucial. We began this debate by saying that it is time 
to re-confederate agriculture in Canada. The time is right and 
the need is now. We cannot just tinker with policies here and 
there. We must think into the future and drive, not drift, into it.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12278"> 12278 </A></B>
<P>
	There must be a whole new way of doing agriculture based on 
more distinct and more co-operative roles for both levels of 
government, as much as possible separate from each other and 
separate from private sector industry. These suggestions are 
based on sound economic, organizational and democratic 
principles.
<P>
	The first act that our Fathers of Confederation passed 125 
years ago was the Agriculture Act of 1868. At the end of the 
1990s perhaps we as parliamentarians could have the foresight 
and vision for the needs of today. I have sketched out the modest 
skeleton of a proposal. I ask the House now to vote in favour of 
this motion.
