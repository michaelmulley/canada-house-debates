    </p><a name="Para753308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend our leader on the position he has taken in not voting down the government on the throne speech. I think it is wise, because there really was nothing in the speech overall. It was pretty much innocuous. If we were to change 25 words it could be a past Liberal Speech from the Throne.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753309"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part, throne speeches try to be positive. They try to set out a bit of a template. This one sort of did it from about 35,000 feet. Nonetheless, I think where we are going to run into trouble is where we drill down into the specific issues, where we look at the details of some of the actions and some of the legislation being put forward by the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is always contended that the devil is in the details and I think that is what we are going to find. As long as this Parliament lasts, as long as the session goes forward, I think what we will find is that the people on this side will stand and fight on an issue by issue basis. That has been our contention, to make Parliament work and to make it work for Canadians, but when we see that the better needs and the best needs of Canadians are being compromised, that is when we will call the government to task. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certainly a number of issues like this in the throne speech. When I look at the statement that the government is going to review aspects of the EI system, I personally am greatly concerned. I think a number of Canadians somewhat suspect actions taken by the government in the way it has addressed employment insurance. As the government brings this forward, we are certainly going to try to represent what is best in regard to the needs of workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should state from the outset that I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78983,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78983&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Davenport</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us think back to the last time that a Conservative government had control of EI. We can look back to the late 1980s. We know that the EI fund of that time had been exhausted. It was from there, from the Auditor General's report, when we did have a stand-alone EI system, that once that program had been decimated through the late 1980s because of high unemployment rates and the draw on that fund at the time, the Auditor General said we had to take that program and put it back into the general accounts. That is what was done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that through the mid-1990s the unemployment rate came down. More Canadians got back to work. There was less of a draw on the EI fund. There were changes made to the unemployment insurance act back in the mid-1990s. Over time, the premium rates paid by workers and employees went down. The economy took hold and grew. As a country we began to prosper and more money was paid into the fund.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shared some time with my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78825,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78825&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Acadie—Bathurst</A> on an all party committee in the last Parliament. We put forward some recommendations on changes to EI. Some very worthwhile things came out of those consultations and that committee. Certainly the dropping of the divisor rule and going to the best 14 weeks are things that I think better serve the workers in this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw the response of the Conservatives at that time. They wanted no part of that. They wanted an in-out, stand-alone system, like an insurance policy. Canadians have come to expect more from that system. A great piece of EI legislation came forward in the last session. As a matter of fact, it was put forward by my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78815,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78815&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sydney—Victoria</A>.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought the legislation made sense, but we saw that the government had no use for it. The government saw no purpose in it and voted against it, which was very disappointing. I am sure it was disappointing not just to the other three parties in this House, but to working Canadians, because all they are trying to do is provide for their families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is telling about the Conservative government as well when we read through the throne speech but do not see the words “student”, “university” or “post-secondary”. Those words are nowhere to be found in the Speech from the Throne. Our young students can draw no kind of hope or optimism from this throne speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly we saw the government show a total disregard for the students of this country when it decimated and gutted the student employment program last year. It was the opposition parties in the House that fought to have at least a bit more money put back into that program. Community groups from coast to coast supported that program and had offered summer employment opportunities to students for many years. It was a great program, well served, and was subscribed to by many businesses and not for profit groups from coast to coast. Yet it was decimated by the Conservative government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This showed a total lack of caring and understanding by the government about the needs of students in this country and a lack of understanding of the needs of not for profit groups in this country. Giving extra money to students is necessary to help them pay their way through university, but for many of these students this program is their first opportunity for a summer job to build skills and to start developing a resumé. I do not think there is anything better that we can give our youth. That was torn away from them by the government last spring.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753321"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the topic of universities, I note that I come from the province of Nova Scotia, which has a great reputation for having some of the top post-secondary institutions in this country, such as St. Francis Xavier, St. Mary's and Dalhousie. The post-secondary institutions in Nova Scotia are at the forefront of a lot of research. These post-secondary institutions have pretty much been pillaged by the Conservative government. That is what concerns me about the throne speech. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is changing the way it supports these institutions in transfers from the federal government to provincial governments. It did put in a bit more money, and I commend the government for doing so, but when it changes the system from an equity based system to a per capita based system, it is the small Atlantic provinces that are going to be hurt. In this change alone, Nova Scotia will receive $28 million less under the new system that was adopted by the Conservative government. Over the 10 year term of this change, Nova Scotians will receive $65 million. The province of Alberta will receive $3.5 billion. The minister's own province is doing okay, but where is the equity? Where is the fairness? Why should Nova Scotia be left behind? That is the unfairness that I see. That is pitting one region against another. We have seen this time and again from the government. There is a true unfairness there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the government that we on this side of the House, on an issue by issue basis when that legislation comes forward, will stand and defend the rights of Nova Scotians. We will defend fairness. We will make sure that whatever the Conservatives bring forward will be scrutinized. If it is going to hurt Nova Scotians and if it is going to hurt Canadians, we will stand here and we will defeat it.</div>

I take my 10 minutes here in the House and I talk about EI reform and ask what the government is going to do for students, but the member throws a little bit of smoke over it and asks about that big, bad Senate. The government says that the Senate is tying everything up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could say that the Senate reflects the government. The government put nothing in the Speech from the Throne for students or for post-secondary schooling.

When the Liberals were in government for 13 years, they had a $50 billion surplus and still did not do anything. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that the Liberals did nothing because my colleague was with me on the human resources committee. We voted to make changes to employment insurance but his own party voted against the recommendations of the committee. I congratulate the member for voting for the changes but some of his own colleagues who were on the committee recommended changes to employment insurance but when it came time to vote in the House, they voted against their own recommendations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is pitiful when there is a surplus of $50 billion. Do they not think it is about time to stop cutting EI and taking money from working people? The money was in the general revenue fund and they used it to pay down the debt. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is right when he talks about the throne speech.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We best serve Canadians when we do that on an issue by issue basis, which is why I support our leader for taking the tact that he did.

These speeches are often remembered more for what they do not address as opposed to the issues they actual raise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding all of this bluster, what of the content in the Speech from the Throne? What about the issues of importance to Canadians? We hear a great deal of chatter in the speech with respect to our national sovereignty and yet in practice the government action leaves a great deal to be desired.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, where is the government in regard to the recent outrageous proposal from the United States administration with respect to airline passenger lists? What could be more important to our sovereignty than protecting the privacy and personal rights of our nation's citizens? We hear no challenge from the government to the Bush administration's demand that Canadian airlines provide names, dates of birth, gender, travel itinerary and track information for passengers originating in Canada even though they do not even land in the United States.</div>

This is clearly an issue of sovereignty and the rights of Canadians need to be protected by their own government. Speaking of sovereignty, we need only to look at the issue of the United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples to see the issue of the actual level of commitment to the basic rights of our first nations peoples.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all remember the Kelowna accord. It was a landmark agreement between the previous Liberal government, provincial leaders and first nations peoples.</div>

The previous Liberal government was putting in place the help they needed but the present government has done nothing of substance to assist Canada's students.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our country's senior citizens are finding it increasingly more difficult to manage and yet there is no real help for them either. Where is the help for these great Canadians who have built our nation?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families across the country continue to struggle. What about the national child care program that the previous Liberal government was implementing? Again, nothing. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, we are speaking about the basic human rights of all Canadians, whether they are travelling abroad, are first nations peoples, older Canadians, students, parents and the list goes on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753364"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would note, speaking of human rights, that the government made reference to several anniversaries to be celebrated this year in Canada. While those noted in the throne speech are of significance, what about the 25th anniversary of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms? Why was there no mention of one of Canada's greatest achievements? Would this be inconvenient for the government?</div>
    </p><a name="Para753365"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are but a few of the issues that the Speech from the Throne simply fails to deliver upon. There is no passion for the values of Canadians in this speech and no vision of what Canadians want to aspire to. It is really the remonstrations of managers when what we need is leaders.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of a comment by the former British Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill. He was asked by a young member of the British Parliament how he could put more fire into his speech. Churchill replied, “What you should have done is put the speech into the fire”.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken today on many issues of importance to Canadians. We can only hope in the months to come that these real concerns of Canadians will be addressed by the government.</div>

On one hand, the NDP members constantly say that they stand up for working families. Yet when there is an opportunity to work collaboratively, especially in the last minority government, they are the first ones to attack the Liberal government.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a great, united country whose foundation is a solid federation and a living democracy. In fact, federalism and democracy have gone hand and hand throughout Canada's history.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country's history is one of people joining together to achieve great dreams thought impossible by the pessimists, but it is also a history of people who, through accommodation and respect, build practical, workable approaches allowing remarkable progress to unfold.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project of Confederation was about bringing together the different regions into a strong and united country based on democratic practices and the rule of law. Sir John A. Macdonald, George-Étienne Cartier and the Fathers of Confederation, through strong leadership united Canadians in a federal union which would deliver a future of security and prosperity for the country as a whole. Their vision was strong and enduring, a firm foundation on which successive generations have built.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is continuing this nation building project today with our commitments for strengthening the federation and our democratic institutions. Strong leadership and a better Canada: that is our objective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to spend my time today discussing the progress we have already made in this area and highlighting our plans for this new session of Parliament.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach is not new, but it is based on the very principles underlying Confederation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The union was based on a simple concept: the division of powers between the federal and provincial governments. The objective was not to have a weak, passive federal government, but a government that would respect the provinces' areas of jurisdiction.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para753389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provincial governments are closer to their citizens and are well positioned to determine local needs and aspirations. In contrast, the federal government is well placed to protect the national interest in pursuit of the common good of the country as a whole. As the project of our Confederation first became committed to paper in the Quebec Resolutions of 1864, this approach was clear:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our federalism of openness means respecting provincial areas of jurisdiction, and that, in turn, means two things.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our Confederation must be more than the sum of its parts. The federal government must act as a leader in keeping the country strong and united and as a model for democratic values. To perform this leadership role, the democratic underpinnings of our government must be solid in order to continue to meet the expectations of the Canadians we serve. Our initiatives in the area of democratic reform demonstrate our government's leadership in this area. Nowhere is this more evident than our efforts to modernize our central democratic institution, a federal Parliament where the representation of both popular and provincial interests are united within the federal legislative process.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Confederation, Canada's Parliament has served the democratic interests of Canadians well, but the government must take action to ensure that this institution, which is the cornerstone of our representative democracy, remains strong, vibrant and adapted to the needs of Canadians in the 21st century. <sup></sup></div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bicameral Parliament includes two houses, the lower house here which is comprised of elected representatives of the citizens of this great country originally founded on the fundamental principle of representation by population, and the upper house which was designed to represent the regions of the country to act as a chamber of sober second thought.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the contemporary era, the Senate has been unable to credibly fulfill its role as an effective representative of the regions in the federal legislative process due to fundamental concerns with legitimacy and effectiveness of that appointed and unaccountable chamber.

    </p><a name="Para753406"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to spend a few moments discussing Senate reform. It is a priority of our government that is urgently needed to modernize our federal Parliament. We put forward an agenda for the Senate reforms that is practical and achievable. As stated in the Speech from the Throne, we will continue to pursue this agenda with the reintroduction of two important bills. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753407"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate tenure bill proposed a uniform fixed term for senators of eight years. Rather than leave the length of tenure as long as 45 years, as it is currently, our bill proposed that senators be appointed to a fixed term of eight years. This is a change that would bring renewal and relevance to the Senate. This change would improve the effectiveness of the Senate. It would ensure that senators' terms were long enough for them to gain the expertise and independence necessary to act as a chamber of sober second thought, but at the same time it would ensure that the terms would not be so long as to undermine the legitimacy and credibility of the Senate as a modern institution in what we seek to declare to be a democratic country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the current unelected unaccountable Liberal senators spent over a year delaying this legislation before they finally took a decision to not take a decision. This action alone, or inaction more accurately, demonstrates clearly that the Senate must change. Its current form does not function well on this issue, or at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated, our government intends to reintroduce the Senate term limits bill this session. I hope that the summer recess gave opposition senators some time for that sober second thought in relation to their position of inaction on this bill where they have refused to exercise their constitutional obligation to vote on the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second Senate reform, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590486,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590486&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-43</A>, offered a means for democratizing the Senate by providing Canadians an opportunity to choose and advise who they want representing them in the Senate. It would provide for the first time an opportunity for voters across this country to have a democratic say in who sits in their Senate. This should hardly be a difficult principle to embrace in a 21st century western democracy. It would provide greater legitimacy and credibility to the work of the Senate as a democratic institution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753411"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was extremely pleased to attend the swearing in of Senator Bert Brown last week. He of course was popularly elected by the people of his province. I hope that we can look forward to the day when the Senate appointment consultations bill becomes law and all senators arrive in Ottawa with a democratic mandate.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some who have suggested that governing parties of the past could maintain the status quo in the Senate out of self-interest, that we could benefit from the patronage appointments to be made and stack the chamber with partisans who would serve for decades. Our government believes that the Senate should be a democratically elected body that represents Canadians. So far, we have taken concrete steps toward that vision and they are steps that are achievable in the short term. What is more, surveys show that our agenda for term limits in a democratized Senate is strongly supported by Canadians. Surely in a democracy this above all should be a key indicator of what constitutes a good democratic reform.</div>

We spelled them out and we have delivered on them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend asked: why confidence votes? It is about accountability, a concept perhaps foreign to the other side where those members are all about power. In our view it is very simple. We tell Canadians what we are going to do. We stand behind what we say, and then we deliver on it. The mandate we received from Canadians counts for something. If the member disagrees with that mandate, if he wishes to present another vision, he is free to do that. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tackling violent crime agenda is something core. We spoke to Canadians about it and they supported it. The Liberal Party said it supported it, but when it comes to practice the behaviour of those members is entirely different than their words. Those bills were held up without being passed for a total of 1,456 days, and yet those members said this was an agenda they could support. Those were the delays; that was the obstruction. </div>

First, on the issue of Afghanistan, we are very proud of what we have been able to do for the people of Afghanistan through our intervention, our support and our development assistance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend says that there is insufficient development assistance. Guess what, Afghanistan is the largest recipient of Canadian development assistance and the results are paying off. That is why in a poll that was released last week we saw that an overwhelming majority of Afghans felt that their lives were better today than they were before Canadian troops were there, making them safer. The Afghans want those troops there, they believe that they are making their lives better, and that they are safer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we see millions of children in school who were not there before. We see women enjoying rights that they never had before. I know that others may not want to be willing to make the sacrifice necessary to protect people in troubled areas of the world, to protect women's rights, to protect children. Canada is proud to take on the leadership role today that we have taken in the past.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753451"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly surprised when we have members of the Liberal Party raising questions on that, when they talk about principle. They were the ones who took the decision to send those troops into Afghanistan, who took the decision to send those troops into the troubled southern portions of Afghanistan, and they are the ones today who are abandoning those troops and demanding withdrawal.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the environment, this is another excellent contrast of the previous Liberal government that spoke a lot and did nothing and allowed greenhouse gases to rise massively. Our government is delivering with a program, an agenda of tackling greenhouse gas emissions and delivering actual, real reductions in greenhouse gases, as well as taking action to clean up our water, our air, address pollution and protect endangered spaces.</div>

The new Conservative government has been very committed to democratic reform in the last session and will continue to be in the next session. The minister indicated the positive aspects of democratic reform. My question for the minister is, if we do not get support from the opposition parties, what is the downside to Canada and to Canadians if democratic reforms are not passed by this House of Commons?</div>

He is indeed a remarkable new member in this House of Commons who has been serving very well. I know the constituents of Burlington are pleased that they finally have a voice that stands up and advances their agenda to improve their lives in a very constructive way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know as well that the people of Burlington do care about the quality of our democracy and something that troubles them, as I think it does trouble all Canadians, is the state of affairs in our Senate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been trying very hard to get constructive changes to the Senate, but an entrenched, unaccountable, unelected Liberal majority continues to protect their privileges. I can understand it because it is consistent with their behaviour in the past. It is about privileges. It is about entitlements. It is about a culture that has taken hold of a portion of that institution and certainly of that party.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have had enough of that. That is part of what the last election was about. It was about restoring accountability and having a government that did not work for the benefit of those who had the entitlements within, but rather of having a Parliament and a government that worked in the interests of Canadians. That is what we are seeking to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, if we continue to see, as we saw with Bill S-4, a Senate which is unwilling to consider any change, however modest, however simple, one that would not even affect them personally when we talk about term limits being reduced to eight years, everybody who was there would be grandfathered. It would only affect new appointments. Yet, they are so resistant to any element of democratic change that might change the character of entitlements they have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we find ourselves so frustrated and that institution proves itself so unwilling to modernize and change in a way that it has not for a century and a half, then we will be faced I think with the unfortunate alternative that all that is left on the table is abolition. Canadians want change in the Senate. They have spoken loud and clear that the Senate must change and our government is making our best efforts to bring about that change.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we found is that Canadians did want to see some changes.

    </p><a name="Para753499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, with what is being debated right now, the only economic lever will be a corporate tax reduction, which has not historically led to improvement in manufacturing.

The answer is, yes, we do and he will hear about it in due course.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem right now with manufacturing job losses is that it is not a proposal for the Conservative Party to cut corporate taxes in the future. That has nothing to do with the losses we see today. The losses today are because of Canada's competitiveness gap and we are losing jobs to jurisdictions that have a more competitive environment. That is why they are getting the jobs. There is no question about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems we face today is a dollar at parity. A dollar at parity has a lot to do with the economic policies of our country. We have seen government spending rise to a level that we have never seen in the nation before, and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> has seen that situation develop. High government spending has always been inflationary, which is something the Conservatives pointed out in past times of Liberal governments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflationary spending breeds higher interest rates. Higher interest rates attracts capital from around the world. As capital inflows to our country, because we have petro reserves, we see our currency rise in value. We are considered to be a petro currency country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of high government spending, a recurrence of inflation and oil reserves in Canada have driven our dollar higher. That has erased the competitive advantage a lot of our manufacturers have and our job losses in large part are a result of that. I fear they have only just started and we have to reverse this trend.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would be very pleased to work with the hon. member opposite to find ways to restore our competitiveness instead of eroding it as the Conservatives have done.</div>

    </p><a name="Para753508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First off, let me say that disappointment is the word that comes to mind. Every year and a half or two years, government presents Canadians with a throne speech. If nothing else, that throne speech is supposed to be visionary. It is not intended to be just an agenda for an election that might occur in the weeks or months following a throne speech. It should be a document that lays out for Canadians where the government of the day intends to take the country because, in spite of the great inertia in regard to the elements needed for change in our society or in any society, governments have a huge role to play when it comes to making changes for the betterment of its citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This throne speech lacked any vision whatsoever. It is very unfortunate and very sad that the government missed an opportunity to lay before Canadians its real vision, instead leaving many Canadians, including myself, to wonder what the hidden agenda is. I will list a few of the many things that were missing. There certainly were a lot of words, but no vision, no reference to substance and no context were attached to them. It was simply the mention of many words.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where was the real substance on climate change?</div>
    </p><a name="Para753511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where was the real substance and the real plan on Canada's mission in Afghanistan? </div>
    </p><a name="Para753512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was the vision when it comes to post-secondary education and the need to support research and development and the scientific community in this country? </div>
    </p><a name="Para753513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, where was the mention of a vision for our first nations, for aboriginal Canadians, many of whom have come to suspect that really and truly they are not on the agenda of the government?</div>
    </p><a name="Para753514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about poverty? </div>
    </p><a name="Para753515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about municipalities?</div>
    </p><a name="Para753516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to quote the president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, who said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para753517"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>By simply re-branding existing infrastructure programs, the Government fails to invest the additional resources needed to meet the challenges it acknowledges in the Speech from the Throne.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para753518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is okay to acknowledge challenges, as the president of the FCM says, but it is another thing to have a vision and to have a specific set of ideas to put any vision into effect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My northern Ontario riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79017,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79017&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing</A> is blessed with some 55 communities. There are roughly 24 first nations and the rest are small and large townships, villages, small cities and towns. When I meet with mayors and chiefs, they ask me to bring the message forward that the federal government needs to continue to be involved with local government at the municipal level and with our first nations. Their message for the federal government is that it needs to improve its participation, to up the ante and to recognize the challenges faced at the local level in our communities when it comes to dealing with infrastructure, poverty and local economies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of northern Ontario, we are really struggling, with a forestry sector that, like manufacturing, generally is being hit very hard. Added to the manufacturing woes in forestry, of course, there are the specific problems facing Canada because of the very terrible softwood lumber deal that this country has with the U.S., a deal, by the way, in which we threw away years of progress in the courts and before various trade panels, years of progress that we were about to reap the benefits of had the deal that was accepted by the government not been accepted. That deal, by the way, was rejected by the previous government in the late fall of 2005, and within a few days of taking office the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> adopted it, rejecting our deal, and called it his own. Quite frankly, it is a deal that has not done anything. If anything, it has hurt our forestry sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about child care? I agree that if families are able to and decide to keep their children at home from birth right through to first year of kindergarten it is perfectly fine. In my case, a couple of my children went to child care and a couple of them stayed home with one of their parents.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315">(1315)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para753522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important that there be a real choice and an infrastructure of child care in this country that allows families who choose to participate fully in the workforce to have access to a network of child care centres and early learning facilities across this country, a network that is consistent and properly funded, with workers who are properly paid, a network, indeed, that allows our families to help build our local economies and the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753523"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program that the government put in place with its so-called $100 a month really does not do it, I do not believe, and statistics will demonstrate it. That program has not created a single new day care space. One hundred dollars a month taxable puts barely $50, $60 or $70 a month in the hands of families to provide day care. In most locations, that would provide barely a couple of days of day care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753524"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move on, I mentioned forestry but there is also manufacturing in general. Yes, there are certain things happening in the world that are difficult for any government to deal with, but it is the government's responsibility to respond. Where are some specifics on the capital cost allowance measures that can help our companies take advantage of the situation as it exists now to upgrade their technology so that indeed as the next cycle comes along they can be ahead of that cycle? There are other things the government can do to make sure our manufacturing sector does not go further into decline.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well and good to have strong economies in Alberta and perhaps in St. John's, Newfoundland and other specific locations across the country. That is fine. It makes the overall numbers look good, but there are pockets and regions, and I point to many communities in my riding and throughout northern Ontario, that are definitely suffering. They need the opportunity to participate fully in the national economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753526"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak a little about northern Ontario. I mentioned that there are a great number of first nations there and a great number of communities that depend on forestry. It is very sad for me to relate to this chamber that just this past Friday the Weyerhaeuser plant in Wawa shut down for an “indefinite” period. There does not appear to be any real prospect of a reopening in the near or mid term. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to create any false hope for the workers in this plant. One hundred and thirty jobs have been lost. The workers are being told, sadly, that they should make arrangements for their lives and for their families. I wish them well. I will be there at the first opportunity in the next week or so to do what I can to help. Along with the provincial member, we will work with the community, the workers and whoever else will come to the table to make sure that the consequences of that closure can be minimized.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me speak a little about our first nations. The leaders of the communities in my riding have worked very hard. They are excellent leaders. They have worked hard to make sure the communities can do the best they can in the current situation, but they fail to see in this government any real exhibition of a willingness to see them as true partners even though they are their own level of government. They are not municipalities. They have a relationship with the Government of Canada and it is important that we recognize that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current government cancelled the Kelowna accord adopted by the premiers, the territories and provinces, the aboriginal leadership and the Government of Canada in the fall of 2005. There was every hope that the expenditures to flow from that agreement, in excess of $5 billion, would do a great amount of good work in terms of housing and education, in social services and for supports in terms of health. For example, diabetes rates are far too high in our first nations communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of things we can do better. It is time that we learned the lessons from the past. There is no past government that can pat itself on the back entirely and say that it did a great job. We all have lessons to learn. It is the responsibility of the government to build on those lessons and move forward. Sadly, we are not seeing that. What I hear instead is this: how quickly can we have a change in government so that we can have a change in attitude and a change in approach?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about poverty. Last week for a short while I was able to attend and participate in the rally on poverty that was held out front here. The fact that any child in this country lives in poverty is sad. This will not be eliminated overnight, but as is noted in the Liberal amendment to the throne speech, which will be voted on tonight, we call upon the government to end its “18 months of inaction” on poverty. We need to make poverty history. We must build on the good work of past Liberal governments on such initiatives as the Canada child tax benefit, affordable housing, literacy, the supporting communities partnership initiative, and the working income tax benefit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work was being done. Progress was being made. We call upon the government to turn that corner and recognize that something needs to be done in all the areas I have outlined.</div>

As he well knows, one of his colleagues in the other place, Liberal Senator Dan Hays, before he retired, had some pretty remarkable words to say in respect to Senate reform. He said that the need for reform in the Senate is a “long-standing sore point in our national politics”. He said that the first thing parliamentarians need to do is legislate fixed term limits for senators.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that subsequent to this the Liberal dominated Senate virtually killed our Conservative bill in respect to this, and given that the member made no comment in respect to Senate reform, which was a part of the throne speech, I would like to know where the member and his colleagues in this place stand in regard to the crucial need for Senate reform vis-à-vis Dan Hays' comments.</div>

He is a former chair of the industry committee. I would argue, all partisanship aside, that he did a very good job. I have been in the House of Commons for five years and we actually have had consensus building on that committee. He has departed to another committee, but certainly his work in the previous committee as well as the current one has been very positive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member noted that the capital cost reduction allowance issue is very important. In fact, the industry committee tabled 22 recommendations in a common report supported by all parties, including a capital cost reduction allowance for equipment. The finance minister instead did a two year window, but I actually tabled a five year window, plus a renewal period after an evaluation, because industries like mine in Windsor, for example, where there is the tool, die and mold making industry, need to have the third, fourth and fifth year to make those investments in terms of the time rolled out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask my colleague why he believes it is important to move on this. For example, I believe this is much more effective than a general corporate tax cut, because once again, I have industries leaving my constituency that are going to get taxpayer funds to set up somewhere else, whereas actually getting equipment in on the ground floor will protect Canadian workers and their jobs and provide the livelihood that we all want.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the viewers, the capital cost allowance allows a company to write off over a period of time its capital investment in equipment as an expense, a little bit each year. That allows that company to plan for replacing equipment. If the capital cost allowance write-off period is too long, it hampers that industry relative to another. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rapid change in technology in our society and in the world, we need to give companies a better ability to respond rapidly. Therefore, an accelerated rate of capital cost allowances can help industry, especially when it comes to climate change technology, auto technology, mining technology and forestry technology. We need to give our industries a leg up when it comes to preparing for the future. It requires a mix of corporate initiatives but that is a very important one.</div>

    </p><a name="Para753548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to stand in solidarity with my NDP colleagues and millions of Canadians who oppose the Conservative government's wrong-headed direction. The throne speech should be an articulation of the government's fundamental principles and yet in this document the government has reached a new level of cynical doublespeak. While claiming to be concerned about poverty, homelessness, climate change and rising costs in post-secondary education, the government has outlined steps that will make the problems worse.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has turned its back on communities. Our local governments are left with heavy lifting, forced to face today's complex challenges on their own while a federal seat sits vacant. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to start by talking specifically about Victoria. There is a growing consensus in my community that all levels of government should focus on housing. As of this April, 953 families and 406 seniors were on the wait list for social housing. The city of Victoria's homelessness task force report released last week speaks to the urgency of acting now. Even the Victoria Downtown Business Association is asking the federal government to allocate some of the surplus to housing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also consistently hear about Victoria's need for affordable, quality child care. Last week the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> gave a misleading answer in response to my question. Contrary to his assertion, his failed policies have not created one child care space, in my riding at least. On the contrary, day care centres are closing and desperate parents are on mile-long wait lists. The Union of B.C. Municipalities has called for a national child care system. The business community has lamented the domino effect of federal child care cuts on its province's workforce.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address these and other crucial issues, I have long advocated for the federal government to adopt a community focused approach. This means having the federal government act as a collaborative partner with the provinces to help municipalities implement their own local solutions. What a community approach would not do is impose unnecessary policy barriers that prevent communities from solving their local problems, like the Conservatives' resistance to the harm reduction approach and other strategies identified in communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, despite best efforts, the Conservatives still have not found their way to supplying the $150,000 in capital funding that are needed for Victoria's access health centre. This is an innovative project that provides one stop access to services needed by homeless people. It would prevent illness and save health care dollars. However, the Conservatives' shortsighted, narrow view of the federal role stands in the way of communities moving forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of weeks ago I hosted a prebudget town hall in my riding and the messages I collected to bring back to Ottawa are unequivocal. They are to invest in our citizens, communities, housing, child care, learning and training, the environment and to build a green economy, but Victoria has been let down by a government that chooses to prioritize tax cuts over investments in our collective well-being.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surplus and tax cuts will be important issues in this session of Parliament. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> says that he does not want to leave a debt for our children. I would say that the Conservative government is in the process of racking up an enormous debt that our children will have a hard time repaying. We must not forget that this massive surplus came about because of the major cuts to social programs by the Liberals in the 1990s. The national housing program was cut; tuition costs and student debt have tripled in 10 years; child poverty is worse than when Parliament promised to eradicate it; our municipalities are struggling with a $60 billion infrastructure deficit. Furthermore, the federal government refuses to commit to making our economy respectful of the environment, in order to address the imminent dangers of climate change.</div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para753556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of Canadian families have stagnating or falling incomes and are forced to work longer hours and spend less time with their children. They need better transit and home care, more affordable housing and child care, and better protection from toxic products on the market but the government does not believe in social policy. In fact, it reduces everything to economic terms and perpetuates the myth that profits from deregulated markets will trickle down. The trickle seems to be stuck.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para753557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much talk about the tax burden, but what about the burden on low- and middle-income families who no longer have access to affordable housing or child care? What about the burden on people who are on long waiting lists for major surgery? What about the people struggling to repay staggering student debts? What about the burden on women who earn on average 71¢ for every dollar earned by a man? There was nothing about pay equity in the throne speech. And what about the burden on the environment?</div>
    </p><a name="Para753558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that as long as these burdens continue to enlarge the hole in the social and environmental fabric, the answer for how to use the surplus will be clear.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the NDP's literacy advocate, I have been appalled at the disinterest of the government to the needs of adult learners. A lack of functional literacy impedes an individual's ability to lead a full life and secure a better job. It also impedes Canada's ability to stay competitive. Leading economists have joined the chorus of voices critical of the government's shortsightedness on adult literacy which costs the economy tens of billions of dollars every year.</div>

    </p><a name="Para753561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to tax cuts, the Conservatives are pursuing their quest to gut the capacity of the federal government through a radical agenda of privatization.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a similar but much broader front, the Conservatives are implementing the Liberals so-called security and prosperity partnership.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our throne speech we talk in terms of some of the steps to improve the lives of Canadian aboriginal people.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for the member who is from British Columbia.

    </p><a name="Para753574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the hon. member assure the House that she as an individual and her New Democratic colleagues would support the legislation when it is reintroduced in the House? I heard no mention in her speech and I would be very interested in getting a response on that now.</div>

    </p><a name="Para753578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few weeks, I have had the opportunity to be back in Hamilton and to listen to the concerns that are top of mind for families in our community. Without a doubt, the single biggest issue is Canada's growing prosperity gap.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors and working families are increasingly finding it difficult just to make ends meet. At a time when more wealth is being created in this country than at any other time in our history, people in Hamilton are working longer and harder, not to get ahead, but simply to keep up. In fact, average Canadians today are squeezing 200 more hours of work out of each year than they did just nine years ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While a few people at the top are enjoying the benefits of the current economy, everyone else is not. Sure, we have seen the windfall salaries and extraordinary bonuses of CEOs, but wages for everyone else are essentially stagnant or falling. The middle class in Canada is falling behind. That is what we have been calling the prosperity gap, and nowhere is that issue more relevant than in Hamilton. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing sector is in crisis, but the government's agenda for this Parliament did not even mention it. There was no mention of an industrial strategy for either the automotive or manufacturing sectors. There was no mention of wage and pension protection for workers affected by commercial bankruptcies. There was no mention of using the $3.3 billion EI surplus to retrain displaced workers. There was no mention of beefing up the Investment Canada Act to protect key industries from foreign takeovers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a $14 billion surplus, it simply did not need to be that way. There is a better choice and I will continue to advocate for those alternatives until working families on the mountain get the positive change they deserve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that my time here today is limited, but let me just speak to four such alternatives that represent missed opportunities in the throne speech. They relate to seniors, youth, our city and the environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer I had the privilege of organizing and hosting an environmental forum for businesses on Hamilton Mountain. The panellists included representatives from Green Venture and TABIA in an interactive discussion on saving both money and the environment through energy conservation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business leaders understood the benefits immediately. Whether they represented the retail, manufacturing or service sectors, they understood that far from having to choose between helping the environment and helping their bottom line, energy conservation will achieve both. In fact research has proven that ignoring climate change will ultimately damage economic growth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then is the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> not seizing all opportunities to link economic growth with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions? Here is but one small example of how that could be done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the urging of the NDP, the Canadian government has put into effect a ban on incandescent light bulbs effective in 2010, but as Hamilton business leaders learned during the environmental forum, almost none of the alternative CFL or LED bulbs are actually being manufactured in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the government is creating a huge market for new products without recognizing and supporting the equally huge domestic manufacturing opportunity that its policy has created. Instead of importing almost all of the more energy efficient light bulbs from China, why are we not supporting Canadian manufacturing and Canadian jobs by encouraging the production of the alternative light bulbs in Canada?</div>
    </p><a name="Para753589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be good for the economy, good for jobs and good for the environment, but apparently such a win-win situation is still not good enough for our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. Go figure. That kind of inaction speaks volumes about the disconnect between the government's directions and the priorities of the Canadian people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look at seniors next. The Conservative government is quick to talk the talk when it comes to seniors, but it is loath to walk the talk. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government supported my seniors charter which created a road map to ensuring that seniors can retire with the dignity and respect they deserve. Indeed it was passed in the House of Commons by a vote of 231 to 52. Instead of implementing the charter's priorities to enhance the quality of life for seniors, government inaction has made it increasingly difficult for seniors to make ends meet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons, of course, is tied to what is happening in the economy. Every time a plant closes its doors in Hamilton, the pension and benefits of its workers are threatened. It is time for the government to acknowledge that pensions are deferred wages. They are not bonuses paid to workers at the end of their working lives. They are part of an agreed upon compensation package for hours worked.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345">(1345)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para753593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, upon being elected, I was proud to introduce Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073165,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073165&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-270</A>, the workers first bill, in the House of Commons as my very first legislative initiative. Once it becomes law, this bill will ensure that workers' wages, pensions and benefits receive superpriority in case of commercial bankruptcy. If we really want to ensure that seniors can retire with dignity and respect, then we must ensure that they have an adequate retirement income. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because so many jobs do not have adequate or indeed any benefits, it is essential that we finally act on universal drug coverage. Not only can millions of Canadians not find a family doctor, but the cost of prescription drugs continues to skyrocket to points where people simply cannot pay for the medications that are prescribed. Out of pocket spending on prescription drugs is now more than 70% higher than it was in 1992. Canadian households are spending $3 billion a year on prescription drugs. We must ensure that people can get the drugs they need based on the advice of their doctors, not on the advice of their accountants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of health care, we must protect public medicare. This is Canada's hallmark social program. In Hamilton the health care sector is now the largest employer. Just a few years ago no one would have believed that about steel town. One of the best ways to protect our medical system is to ensure that we have an economy that generates the kind of revenues needed to allow our system to flourish. Minimum wage jobs do not do that. We need the decent paying jobs that our industrial sector provided for our hospitals, for our community centres and therefore, for our seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the needs of our cities. Working families in Hamilton pay a lot of money in taxes and the more their jobs pay, the more they pay in taxes. But it is not fair that the lion's share of those tax dollars goes to the federal and provincial governments. In spite of calls from Hamilton citizens, the big city mayors, the chamber of commerce and many others, the federal government refuses to recognize that Canada is the world's second most urban country with 80% of our population living in cities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an estimated infrastructure deficit of over $100 billion, our cities are in dire straits. Our federal government is rolling in cash but it is refusing to invest in our cities. Investments in infrastructure and housing would create jobs. Investments in public transit would create jobs. Investments in environmental initiatives like the cleanup of Randle Reef would create jobs. The list goes on and on. Our city desperately needs this kind of investment, but property taxpayers can no longer shoulder the burden alone. It is time for the federal government to pick up its fair share and with a $14 billion surplus, do not tell us it cannot be done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the last issue I want to raise on the throne speech, and that is the issue of youth. When the government set out its agenda for this session of Parliament, it mentioned youth exactly three times. Appallingly, all three were in the context of tackling crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was proud to support bills in the House which imposed mandatory minimum penalties for firearms crimes, raised the age of sexual consent from 14 to 16 years, and placed the onus on those accused of firearms offences to prove why they should receive bail, but I would never describe these initiatives as an agenda for Canada's youth. To stereotype all youth as criminals is to abdicate our responsibility to the vast majority of teens whose parents are working hard to afford them every opportunity to become law-abiding contributing members of our society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An agenda for youth needs to be an agenda of hope. It needs to include sports, recreation, education, training, and opportunities for employment. Instead of helping our students to excel in today's knowledge based economy, the government is refusing to deal with unaffordable tuition fees and unreasonable interest rates on student loans that have become major roadblocks to post-secondary education. We need to restore needs based grants, lower tuition fees and overhaul the Canada student loans program to make it more flexible, fair and responsive. We need to invest in apprenticeship programs. We need to raise the minimum wage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students are not asking for a free ride. They are simply asking for fairness and a chance to succeed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, that is what all working families have been asking from the government. They are asking for some basic fairness, but this throne speech misses the mark. I have a mandate to represent the goals of my community in this House and since those aspirations are not reflected in the throne speech, I will be forced to oppose it on Wednesday.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is putting in new infrastructure programs and replacing all the old ones. I want to go on record as saying it is absolutely essential that in the new program the municipalities get at least the same percentage they are getting now. It is very important that municipalities get infrastructure money. I am sure the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, the Association of Yukon Communities and all municipalities in the country would agree.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding human rights, the throne speech said that the government was a champion of human rights. Does the member find it surprising that there was nothing on the largest human rights tragedy in the world right now, Darfur; that there was not one dollar for the court challenges program so people who otherwise could not afford it could fight for their rights and freedoms; and finally, that the government is still not supporting aboriginal human rights at the UN?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I share those same sentiments and concerns about the direction of the throne speech, I would like to know why the member opposite feels compelled to support the throne speech when in fact it has these very serious deficiencies.

    </p><a name="Para753611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is right. The charter passed in this very House of Commons. We made a collective commitment to seniors across the country that we would guarantee them the right to retire with dignity and respect. The charter called for a minimum standard of income security. As I pointed out in my speech, income security just is not there for today's seniors. That income security will lead to our being able to talk about other issues related to quality of life, whether they be health care issues, issues of lifelong learning, a whole basket of issues that have not been raised in the House, except in our caucus and through the debate we have initiated in the House. We have been advocating on behalf of seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's agenda for this Parliament is completely silent on that. The official opposition party is voting for that silence. I am appalled that members of the House are so complicit in giving up on standing up for our seniors.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believing that they could raise $250,000 to contribute to the effort, the local radio stations, businesses and citizens held countless fundraisers of every imaginable form.

Vancouverites overwhelmingly identified homelessness as their number one social challenge as do many other Canadian cities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last Liberal government had committed $1.4 billion to a partnership with municipalities, provinces, non-profit and private sectors to provide shelters, single occupancy units, and temporary living for those Canadians who have no shelter. We had developed a cities plan with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753641"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were all swept away by the new Conservative government. Its 2004 platform along with the 2006 and 2007 budgets never mentioned homelessness nor housing. Instead, it cut the Liberal homelessness fund, restoring it much later as the rebranded homelessness national strategy with greatly decreased funding. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Speech from the Throne mentions the word “homelessness” in passing: no plan, no funds. Are we to believe that after three years the government has developed a social conscience or is it just more of that smoke and mirrors trick that it does so well?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1947 the Canadian Cardiovascular Society has provided outstanding leadership to members of the cardiovascular medical community and helped them deliver quality health care to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes the development of the angina classification system used worldwide, the creation of the pan-Canadian access to care benchmarks, and the development of recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These examples demonstrate the remarkable work of Canada's cardiovascular physicians and scientists through the Canadian Cardiovascular Society. The society is also a key member of the Canadian heart health plan developed by this government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will undoubtedly remain an organization of great value to our country. Congratulations to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society. We look forward to the next 60 years.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past weekend the Liberal leader outlined his vision for an alternative plan for Canada. One key element was missing, their fighting crime agenda. While this is no surprise, what is surprising is the fact that the Liberals are now trying to say that they actually care about fighting crime. In fact, for the past four months, the Liberals have been missing in action on the justice files. Now, only when there is talk of an election and the cameras are rolling, do the Liberals say that they are interested in getting tough on crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tackling violent crime bill is a priority for this government because community safety is a major concern for Canadians. Two-thirds of Canadians support the government's approach to criminal justice issues, including mandatory minimum penalties for serious crime. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Liberals are idle on the subject of justice, this government has and will continue to deliver what Canadians want.</div>

It has to deal with the administrative responsibility of the government. The government is not responsible for administering the rules relating to election expenses; Elections Canada is. It is an independent agency that does not report to the House through the government. It reports to the House through the Speaker.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult for the hon. member to ask questions about Elections Canada to the government, unless it is government policy as coming up in a change in the law respecting Elections Canada. His question appeared to have nothing to do with it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, I could not hear the first part of the question because of the tumult in the House. Maybe there was something in there that rendered it in order, but the part I heard in my view was out of order. </div>

    </p><a name="Para753925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred and forty years ago, the people of Canada created a country by joining together into a federation. Our ancestors joined forces and united their destinies to build a nation which now enjoys a privileged place on the world scene. Today, Canada is home to more than 31 million citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government wants to play its part and provide the leadership needed to strengthen this bond. It wants to work together with the provinces and territories to strengthen our democratic institutions and promote our collective heritage, of which our two official languages are a part.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to refresh our memory of our history and our heritage. Then, I will address a number of our government's achievements with respect to linguistic duality and the Francophonie. Finally, I will share with the hon. members our vision for the future. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the hon. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a country that values pluralism and where English and French share official language status.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language rights are set out in our constitutional documents and in the Official Languages Act. These rights were enhanced in 1988 and in 2005.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to remind the members that part VII of the Act was introduced by a Conservative government. This part of the Act sets out the responsibilities of Quebec institutions with respect to official language minority communities. We also supported the 2005 amendments, unlike the members of the Bloc Québécois, who claim to be protecting the interests of francophones in Canada, but who are conspicuously absent when it is time to act for francophones outside of Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both French and English are intrinsic to our identity not because of our legislation but because of the hard work and perseverance of those who came before us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753933"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Banquet de la francophonie last March, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> said, quite rightly, that “The first people to call themselves “Canadians” were French settlers who built their first community initially on the banks of the St. Lawrence on our Atlantic coast, and then across the country”. He added that well before official language laws were passed, communities built institutions—churches, schools, universities, hospitals, businesses and media—to ensure their own vitality. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People mobilized to ensure that their official language communities would not only survive, but thrive in minority settings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government recognizes the importance of promoting both official languages and Canada's linguistic duality. Our achievements and our commitment to this ideal, as expressed in the Speech from the Throne, are proof of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention some of our government's achievements over the past year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our government came to power, open federalism has been our watchword, and our achievements reflect that approach.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I am happy to have quickly signed bilateral education agreements with each province and territory, totalling $1 billion over four years. I also reached major agreements on minority-language services, totalling nearly $64 million over four years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to these agreements, minority communities are able to put in place programs tailored to their own particular reality.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para753940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Department of Canadian Heritage devotes $80 million a year to second language education programs. Thanks to this funding, more than 2.5 million young Canadians can learn their second official language. Everyone agrees that bilingualism is an advantage for individual Canadians and an asset for our country. However, it is also true that to bring francophones and anglophones closer together, both language communities must get to know and appreciate each other.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para753941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young people are the key to bringing the language communities together. Thanks in part to assistance from the Department of Canadian Heritage, more than half of the students across the country today are learning French or English as a second language. This support from the Government of Canada has helped make today's youth the most bilingual in Canadian history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In budget 2007, we also announced an additional $30 million over two years to promote greater use of the minority language in the everyday lives of Canadians, especially young people, who live in minority communities. Yet the Liberals and the NDP opposed that budget. They voted against a budget that increased funding for official languages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also want to create opportunities for young Canadians to enjoy linguistic and cultural experiences in their second language, outside the classroom. It is our hope that all young Canadians will have the opportunity to appreciate the French language and culture and understand how they enrich our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is taking concerted action. Early this month, in fact, my colleague, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Health</A>, announced $4.5 million in funding to promote access to health care services in minority francophone and anglophone communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have begun implementing a strategic plan on francophone immigration to provinces other than Quebec, in partnership with Canada's francophone and Acadian communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just a few of the positive measures we have taken.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525">(1525)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para753947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, and as the Speech from the Throne shows, our approach takes into account the role of other levels of government. One of our government's main objectives is to strengthen our federation and work more and better with each level of government respecting the jurisdiction of each.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para753948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure you that when all the provinces are around the table, things start happening. In addition to agreements on education and services in the minority language, we made several significant investments together with the provinces and territories to establish, expand or renovate the infrastructure in francophone communities in various regions of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We announced the launch of pilot projects for enriched services in French for preschool children. We all know how important it is for children, from a very young age, to be immersed in their language and their culture. This research will help us better understand the main factors that influence young people's behaviour and language retention.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Halifax, a month ago I also met with all Canadian ministers responsible for francophone affairs This federal-provincial-territorial conference is an excellent forum for ensuring that the very diverse objectives of and challenges faced by francophones throughout the country are taken into consideration when developing our programs and policies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are proud and pleased to be working with the Quebec government to ensure that 2008, which marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of Quebec City, is a great year for all Quebeckers and Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many facets to Canada's linguistic duality and francophonie. The official language minority communities make up one facet. Quebec as a whole is another.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec is the cradle of French civilization in North America, the stage where the first chapters of Canada's history played out and a leader in promoting French today. Quebec is a key partner of the Government of Canada. We are working together to promote French across the country and in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand celebrations of Quebec City's 400th anniversary is a job we will share with our colleagues from Quebec. And it will be our great pleasure. Our government is giving more than $110 million and providing its full support toward infrastructure and artistic and cultural programming in preparation of this celebration. This is a file that is particularly dear to me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is proud to be a partner in these celebrations that mark a significant chapter of our history. I hope we can make Quebec City's 400th anniversary a celebration for all Canadians to remember.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, the next Summit of la Francophonie will be held in Quebec City in 2008. It is no coincidence that heads of state and francophone governments are turning to Canada to hold their discussions. Canada is a beacon of support for the distribution and promotion of the French language. That is why we will invest some $2.5 million to ensure that francophones from every region in Canada will be represented in the activities surrounding the summit. These achievements provide a solid foundation on which we will continue to build. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to come back to the Speech from the Throne to close my presentation. As we said in that speech, our government supports Canada's linguistic duality. It will renew its commitment to official languages in Canada by developing a strategy for the next phase of the action plan for official languages. </div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para753958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation is well underway. We are in the process of reviewing all projects in the federal strategy on official languages. This will enable us to give fresh momentum to the government's official language initiatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is needed in some cases is to consolidate but also, undoubtedly, to adjust, modernize, build on key partnerships and awaken the interests of Canadians.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para753960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's new approach will take into account reports from parliamentary committees, reports from the Official Languages Commissioner and results from community assemblies, such as the summit of francophone and Acadian communities.</div>

    </p><a name="Para753965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister says she is willing to listen to what Canadians have to say, out of respect for the Standing Committee on Official Languages. That committee visited every province in Canada to conduct a study. I personally chaired that committee. There was not a single meeting in Canada in which someone did not ask the government to bring back the court challenges program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, that program helped communities, for instance, in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, specifically regarding schools. Other examples are the Collège Boréal case in Sudbury and the Montfort Hospital case right here in Ottawa. The program really helped minority francophone communities in certain regions, as well as minority anglophone communities in Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government has so much respect for official languages, why did the throne speech not include a promise to restore the court challenges program?

Rather, I want to focus on the proposed limits on the federal spending power, which take on a special meaning in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spending power, which is not mentioned anywhere in the Canadian Constitution, has been haunting federal-provincial relations for generations. As for us, ever since we were elected, we have made it clear that we want to restrict the use of the spending power, based on the criteria in the social union framework agreement, and in the 2006 and 2007 budgets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speech from the Throne said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para753981"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Our Government believes that the constitutional jurisdiction of each order of government should be respected. To this end, guided by our federalism of openness, our government will introduce legislation to place formal limits on the use of the federal spending power for new shared-cost programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. This legislation will allow provinces and territories to opt out with reasonable compensation if they offer compatible programs [with the national objectives]. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para753982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, our will to restrict the spending power is the direct result of a concern that has been strongly expressed by all Quebec governments from Duplessis to Charest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753983"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also point out that respecting the constitutional jurisdictions of each order of government has been a fundamental principle of the Conservative Party since its creation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753984"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as we have seen, the root cause of the problem, of this abuse of the federal spending power, will always be the fiscal imbalance. In other words, if the federal government did not have disproportionate revenues compared to those of the provinces, it would probably be less inclined and, more importantly, less able to get involved in areas other than exclusive federal jurisdictions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is precisely why we wanted to restore fiscal balance within the federation, as early as in the 2006 budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we restored fiscal balance with Canadian taxpayers, thanks to tax cuts totalling $26 billion. Then, we reiterated our support to long term and predictable funding for health care. We also made new, major investments in infrastructure. Moreover, we provided funding, to the tune of $3.3 billion, to the provinces and territories to alleviate short term pressures in the post-secondary education, affordable housing and public transit sectors. We also put in place measures to increase the federal government's fiscal accountability and budgetary transparency and we clarified the governments' roles and responsibilities by targeting spending in areas that clearly come under federal jurisdiction, such as defence and security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 also included a renewed and strengthened equalization program, a renewed and strengthened territorial formula financing program, a new approach to long-term funding support for post-secondary education, a new approach to long-term funding support for training, a new long-term plan for infrastructure, and a new approach to allocating unplanned federal surpluses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is appropriate to point out that before a major problem can be resolved, it has to be acknowledged. The previous government thought otherwise, and the Bloc has shown, as it has done countless times before, that it can raise major issues but cannot do a whole lot about them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very pleased that provincial governments, especially the Government of Quebec, have welcomed the measures we have taken to ensure fiscal balance. However, I should point out that this initiative was not a unilateral concession to the Government of Quebec. It was not a political favour.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to ensure fiscal balance and limit federal spending power because we believe that this will improve the federal system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para753991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know why Quebec's governments—of all political stripes—have always been more concerned about fiscal imbalance and federal spending power than other provincial governments. It is because, since Confederation, Quebec's governments have been responsible for protecting and developing a society with unique historical, cultural and social characteristics within this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing the distinct nature of Quebec society has repeatedly created difficulties during recent and not-so-recent federal-provincial negotiations. </div>

To my mind, that is the crowning glory of our policy of open federalism toward Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para753994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, clear recognition of Quebec's uniqueness must not result in abdication of our responsibilities to the entire Canadian federation. We want to strengthen the country's economic unity by clarifying the roles and responsibilities of each government. Over the coming months, we will follow up on this commitment set out in the Speech from the Throne, just as we are doing with the federal spending power.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people who cannot remember when they have seen the Canadian dollar as strong as it is, in relation to its U.S. counterpart, as it is performing today. But we have to recognize that sectors of our economy have lost a competitive advantage as a result of the strength of our dollar. In Waterloo region, which includes my riding of Kitchener Centre, there have been more than 8,000 jobs lost, well paying jobs, in the manufacturing sector. They are simply gone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speech from the Throne conveys a vague reference to the hardships that exist in Canada's traditional industry, but clearly we see no plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government recently announced a surplus that comes close to $14 billion. That is an amazing amount of money, yet at the same time we have reports from Canada's municipal leaders that communities need roughly $100 billion to rebuild aging infrastructure. That is a huge issue in municipalities right across Canada, including Kitchener Centre in Waterloo region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last federal budget included $33 billion over seven years for infrastructure, with only a small portion of that being specifically earmarked for municipalities. We need only think back to the tragic bridge collapse in the province of Quebec to recognize the ramifications of neglecting that kind of investment for communities and for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waterloo region is looking for the federal government to invest in infrastructure in a significant way, especially in a project that it has that is incredibly visionary. It is a transportation project as well as a planning tool, a transit system that is key to the management and promotion of the region's growth over the years to come. It is the rapid transit system which eventually will hook us up to the GO Train, which would allow commuters to get off the 401, which we all know is one of the most heavily travelled pieces of highway in North America.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754017"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was looking to see more substantive suggestions than the vague notions that were referenced in the Speech from the Throne. Does the building Canada plan include making the gas tax permanent? We do not know. Does it include allocating a cent from every dollar collected through the GST to roads, bridges and essential infrastructure that form the backbone of our communities and cities? We do not know.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754019"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada depends on strong cities and communities. They are the drivers of our prosperity. The link between healthy communities and productivity, as well as competitiveness, has been well established. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent Speech from the Throne produced by the Conservative minority government alludes to health care, as if it were a challenge that had been met years past and no longer warrants any kind of focus or consideration, no study, no action, no explicit strategy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754021"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud of our previous Liberal government and the lengths that we went to to address this very important priority for Canadians. The health care crisis that was emerging in Canada was addressed by the historic 2004 health accord, otherwise known as the 10 year plan to strengthen health care. We had a plan. We had specific action and it was done after vast consultation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754022"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today it is estimated that 50,000 residents are without a family doctor in my region. That is from an area that is probably one of the fastest growing, most thriving economies in Canada, and yet we still have over 50,000 residents that cannot get primary health care providers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were, at one point, officially designated as an underserviced area, but due to an awful lot of hard work by local people at all levels of government, including a great deal of leadership by the Greater Kitchener Waterloo Chamber of Commerce, we are now off that list.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550">(1550)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para754024"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot rest on our laurels because we need to make sure that health care is there for the people of Waterloo region and the people of Canada right across this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754025"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of Parliament come to this House with a variety of philosophies and I am sure in the main, 308 members come to do what they think is in the best interests of Canadians. I actually had a fairly simple philosophy when I came to this place and I continue to maintain it. And that is quite simply for some, those who are strong and able and can find their own way and make their own success, government's best role is simply to get out of their way, remove red tape, and provide incentives to support a climate where they can continue to prosper fully and to contribute to the Canadian economy and to society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For others who face challenges and struggles, government has a more personal role to empower this group to overcome barriers. No matter what the fiscal status of our nation, we cannot afford to leave anyone behind any more than we can afford to hold anyone back.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times of prosperity, in times where we see almost embarrassing levels of federal surpluses, how can we outline a plan for our nation that makes no mention of the more than one million children who continue to live in poverty in Canada? Solving poverty is much more than cutting taxes. Canadians are working, our economy is strong, yet there are still families and children living in poverty. Clearly, what Canada lacks is a national strategy for poverty reduction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative minority government identified crime reduction as a priority. If the government is serious about reducing crime and addressing the causes, it has to look at the root causes of crime and one of those is poverty. Solving poverty is essential in itself, but it is also a key to addressing issues such as health care and community safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am astonished that the government continues to turn its back on families by refusing to honour its child care commitments. The government has failed to deliver the 125,000 child care spaces that it promised and has left families with little or no choice in child care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754030"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's decision to cancel the child care funding agreements with the provinces and instead provide a small baby bonus for families with young children has simply not delivered the kind of support that families require. As the busy parent of any young child will say, $1,200 a year or $100 a month is bus fare, it is not child care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754031"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week I joined many of my colleagues to mark the national Persons Day by celebrating the achievements of Canada's Famous Five. I am always inspired by this group of women, the victory that saw Emily Murphy, Nellie McClung, Irene Parlby, Louise McKinney and Henrietta Muir Edwards having women declared persons under Canadian law in 1929. The victory of these women represents a significant milestone in the fight in this country for equal rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754032"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, actions by the Conservative government remind me that the pursuit of equality is still important in Canada today. Women's groups have worked hard in order to obtain or work toward true social, political, economic, cultural and legal equality in Canada. What has the government done? It has silenced these groups by cutting funding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754033"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ridiculous to silence those voices on those issues which are so important to Canadian women and Canadian society. Canadian women still make 71¢ for every dollar men earn in Canada and so many of them live with the threat of domestic violence. We must continue to strive for a better tomorrow for our daughters and our granddaughters. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in a complex, demanding, diverse nation and we must govern not just for today, but for tomorrow and beyond. The Speech from the Throne offers a range of ideas and mentions many important issues, but it lacks a cohesive vision to address the most important poignant needs in our community. In essence, it says very little about the Conservative government's agenda.</div>

I want to address the speech, not only in terms of what it says, but the importance of what it does not say, thereby undercutting its own stated priorities. I will address the missing priorities and the diminishing, thereby, the stated priorities on both the international and domestic levels.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the throne speech makes eloquent mention of our shared values: democracy, freedom, human rights, the rule of law and the need for international leadership to protect these values. We agree with that. However, it ignores the most compelling international concerns today and the corresponding assaults on these very fundamental values.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am referring, for example, to the genocide by attrition in Darfur where 400,000 have already died, where four million are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance, where the violence, including the indiscriminate bombing and burning of villages, sexual violence and assaults on humanitarian aid workers continues unabated, and both the Darfur peace process and the comprehensive peace process are in danger of unravelling, threatening, not only the stability of Sudan but its nine neighbouring countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754055"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that the government is unaware of the Darfur tragedy or that the government has done nothing but it has not identified it as a priority. The best evidence of this is that the word Darfur, even the word Africa, is not even mentioned in the throne speech, let alone addressed in terms of the “commitment, focus, and action” of which the throne speech otherwise speaks.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a partisan problem. To put it simply, while the international community hesitates, the people of Darfur continue to die. I would hope that this government will show the necessary moral, political and diplomatic leadership within the international community to ensure that the required concrete action is taken.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para754057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is there any mention in the throne speech of the state sanctioned incitement to genocide whose epicentre is Ahmadinejad's Iran. I say Ahmadinejad's Iran because I am not referring to the Iranian people nor to the many publics in Iran who are themselves the object of a massive domestic repression of human rights.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flagrant omission is particularly disconcerting. As mentioned during the Global Conference on the Prevention of Genocide, held last week at McGill University, the enduring lesson of the Holocaust—and the genocides that took place in the Balkans and in Rwanda—is that genocides happen not only because of the “machinery” of death, but also because of an ideology of hate propagated by the state.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This teaching of contempt, this demonizing of the other, is where it all began. As our own courts have affirmed in upholding the constitutionality of our anti-hate legislation, “the Holocaust did not begin in the gas chambers, it began with words”. These, as the court put it, are the catastrophic effects of racism. These, as the court put it, are the chilling facts of history.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tragically, Ahmadinejad's Iran, in violation of the prohibition against the direct and public incitement to genocide, in both the genocide conventions and the treaty for an international criminal court, exhibits all the precursors to genocide that have lead us down that road in the past.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para754061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly—and I repeat, this is not a partisan issue—the Canadian government should be a world leader in combating this culture of impunity, referring the matter to the United Nations and its agencies in order to ensure that the instigators of this genocide, promoted by the state, are held responsible for their actions.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the domestic level, the omissions are again glaring. For example, the throne speech speaks eloquently of anniversaries we are commemorating, the 60th Anniversary of Canadian Citizenship and anniversaries we are about to commemorate, such as the 400th anniversary of the founding of Quebec City.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it makes no mention of the fact that we are commemorating now the 25th Anniversary of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Indeed, there is no mention at all in the throne speech of the Charter of Rights even though the charter has had a transformative impact not only on our laws but on our lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we have moved from being a parliamentary democracy to a constitutional democracy; the courts have moved from being arbiters of legal federalism, which they still are, to being the guarantors of our rights, because we, Parliament, vested in them that power; and where individuals and groups now have a panoply of rights and remedies that were unthinkable prior to the charter, which is why the charter has emerged as a respected and indispensable centrepiece, not only of our legal culture but for our human relationships.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the only justice priority that the throne speech identifies is violent crime. Now safe streets and safe communities are the shared aspirations of all Canadians and the common objective of all parliamentarians and parties. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that five of the six pieces of proposed legislation in the tackling violent crime act were initiated by the government in which I served as Minister of Justice. We were not only prepared to support that legislation in the last parliamentary session but we were prepared to fast track it into law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the more important point here is that the justice agenda is not only about combating violent crime, whose objective we share, but it should include as a priority the protection of the vulnerable: women, children, aboriginals, minorities and the poor. The test of a just society is how it treats the most vulnerable among us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no mention of women's rights, thereby marginalizing, as principle and policy, the principle that women's rights are human rights and there are no human rights which do not include the rights of women, while marginalizing also the needs of veterans and students.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, not only is there no mention of women's right and the ignoring of the Charter of Rights as a whole, but the government has dismantled the court challenges program, which was a bulwark in the promotion of both equality rights and minority rights, and while we welcome the government's commitment to the promotion and protection of official languages in Canada, it again undermines its own stated objective by the abolition of the very instrument that promoted and protected minority language rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is there any provision for an early learning and child care program of the kind set forth in our government's federal-provincial child care agreements, which were jettisoned by this government, thereby denying needed child care to thousands of children, while repudiating a federal-provincial agreement, thereby undermining the government's own stated commitment to open federalism.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only perfunctory mention of poverty and the plight of the poor, but no undertaking of making poverty history on the international level or poverty reduction on the domestic level as a government priority. This, notwithstanding the fact that one million children live in poverty; that 2.8 million families, or one in five, live below the low income cutoff ; and that the gap between rich and poor has reached a three decade high, an inequality gap usually associated with underdeveloped nations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of aboriginal justice, while we welcome the government's apology to first nations as part of the residential school agreement that our government had negotiated with the Assembly of First Nations and the Conservative government is duly respecting, this is far from making aboriginal justice a priority on the justice agenda as recommended by federal, provincial and territorial justice ministers at the 2005 FPT conference. This includes the other framework agreements that were negotiated, as well as supporting the international declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, there is no reference in the throne speech as a matter of principle and policy, let alone a priority, for a comprehensive sustainable civil as well as criminal legal aid program, also identified unanimously as a priority on the justice agenda at the FPT conference in 2005. The lack of such a program also impacts adversely on the most vulnerable of our society: women, children, minorities, aboriginals, the elderly and refugees, thereby further exacerbating their plight.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the government's throne speech is diminished by the absence of even reference to these priorities, while its own stated priorities are undercut and undermined by the priorities that are excluded to the detriment of all Canadians.</div>

Indeed, the government of Iran is not only engaged at this point in the processing of enriched uranium and plutonium along the road to develop nuclear weapons, but it has defied UN Security Council resolutions calling upon it to cease and desist from doing so. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should take the lead in supporting enhanced sanctions at the Security Council where we can be supportive of those initiatives that are to be taken and work with governments like Russia and China, which have impeded such sanctions and resolutions being adopted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, on the matter of state sanctioned incitement to genocide, we should not only refer the matter to the appropriate agencies of the United Nations, the Security Council and the like, but we should call upon the UN Security Council to refer this to the International Criminal Court for investigation and prospective prosecution, as we did with respect to the Darfuri in that regard, and ensure that all initiatives be taken to combat this culture of impunity with respect to Iran's incitement to genocide, including the Government of Canada initiating a state to state complaint before the International Court of Justice against Iran, which is also a state party to the genocide convention. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also call upon the secretary general of the United Nations, under article 99 of the United Nations charter, to refer this matter to the UN Security Council as threatening international peace and security as Iran continues to be a standing threat to the right of states to live in peace and security, free from any threats or acts of force. These are some of the initiatives that I would hope the government might in fact initiate.</div>

Both have incited to genocide in their calls for the annihilation of a Jewish state and both, along with Mr. Ahmadinejad, have been engaged in a massive repression of the domestic human rights in Iran, religious communities such as the Baha'i political dissidents. There have been an increased number of executions in the last year alone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of initiatives we can take in that regard on the human rights level. As we learned at the Prague conference, which was held and brought together for the first time dissidents from countries all over the world, it said that we had to make human rights a priority in our foreign policy. We have to lend support to dissidents who are themselves the targets of this repression. We have to stand in solidarity with those who are being singled out for differential and discriminatory treatment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should therefore combat in all forms the culture of impunity that Iran has been allowed to escape its responsibilities from, both with respect to the domestic as well as international levels.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to rise and speak in this House today, not because there is anything to be happy about in the throne speech, but because I am speaking on behalf of the people in my riding and the most underprivileged people in our society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the throne speech was read and the government members made their speeches, poverty was frequently mentioned. In fact, it was only occasionally mentioned, but for the Conservatives, that is what passes for “frequently”, because they do not often talk about it and they certainly do not often do anything about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the official opposition also talked about poverty. We should be able to expect the two main parties to set an example and fight in this House to alleviate poverty. But in many respects they are not setting an example. I would even go so far as to say that this throne speech represents a betrayal of political promises made by this government and the previous government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am careful to refer to the two successive governments, because they have done the most damage to the social safety net for the poorest members of our society, in terms of social housing and income support for seniors, especially those who were entitled to the guaranteed income supplement and who have been robbed of over $3 billion. The throne speech made no mention of this, however.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous session and this one, the Bloc has repeatedly raised this grave injustice to seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same thing with social housing. In the past 15 years, the federal government has slashed funding for social housing. Only since 2001 or 2002 has the government begun reinvesting in this. Still, funding in this area is seriously lacking.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I want to talk specifically about employment insurance, as well as other promises that the Conservative government has not kept.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week is national unemployment week. It would have been nice if the throne speech had had something for the unemployed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, we discussed, at third reading, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073177,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073177&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A>, which is designed to reform the employment insurance fund and improve the employment insurance system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would have been a great opportunity for the government and the opposition to take strong action for the unemployed. In addition, International Day for the Eradication of Poverty was celebrated last week. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shortage of opportunities not only to express intentions but also to act. Yet, nothing is being done, especially not in the throne speech. We have recently had two byelections in Quebec. In the two ridings I visited, the candidates made commitments in that regard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice in the House one of the candidates who got elected. I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his victory. I would rather be congratulating him today on his government having included in the throne speech measures to address the forestry and manufacturing crises to help those businesses and workers affected by these crises.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon our colleagues, and particularly the one to whom I just referred because I am aware that he made such a commitment. I think that he was sincere. I have no reason to think he was not. Does he now realize that he was in the wrong party to make such a commitment? He sought election to be able to play a role in getting tangible measures introduced to help these businesses and workers. This was a unique opportunity. Yet, there is nothing to that effect in the Speech from the Throne. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying all this to make them argue for no reason, but to make them realize that they are far from following through on the promises made by their government, including the recent promises made during the byelections. It is unbelievable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very unfortunate that income support is not being given to older workers in the forestry and manufacturing industries. The entire regional economy is affected when the government fails to implement concrete measures to make up for the inadequacies of the employment insurance program, to improve accessibility to employment insurance and to benefits. I know that is what the members opposite talk about when they want to get elected. They say they will resolve the problem if they are elected to power.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',113961,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=113961&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean</A> and his colleagues who are here today of something. I can still hear his recent speeches. When a worker does not receive insurance benefits after contributing his entire life, he suffers and so does his family, the region, Quebec or the provinces involved. When the federal government does not meet its obligations, the provinces and Quebec have to meet the needs of these people by using welfare and other programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a serious economic crime against workers, their families and the regions. Why is it a crime? Because someone is taking their money. The employment insurance fund consists only of contributions from workers and employers. Out of everyone who contributes to employment insurance, barely 45% can hope to receive such benefits if they have the misfortune of losing their employment. The government itself acknowledges that. Some 15 years ago, 88% of the unemployed had access to EI. This accessibility to employment insurance was cut to 50% for workers who lose their employment. It is scary, but there has not been a riot over this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the fund is to serve as insurance. Imagine an insurance company trying to do the same thing. They insure your house. When you suffer a fire, you go to your insurance company knowing you paid your premiums for house insurance for the past 30 years. The representative asks you where the fire started. Was it in the kitchen or the living room? If you make the mistake of saying it started in the living room, they will tell you that is no good. Your insurance does not apply because the fire should have started in the kitchen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what unemployed Canadians are being told. What region are you in? What is the unemployment rate? Are you a woman or a young person? As we have heard, only approximately 43% of unemployed workers can receive employment insurance. Women represent only 33% and young people, only 17%. Here too, we see the discrimination in their treatment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have liked to discuss some other matters today, but I am sure my colleague will do so with eloquence. What I find very surprising is that the Bloc's amendment included all that. It included concrete measures to support the workers, businesses and regions suffering because of the forestry and manufacturing crises. Our amendment served to eliminate use of the spending power in Quebec and provincial areas of jurisdiction. We were the only ones, however, who voted in favour of that amendment. The Conservatives voted against these measures, although they were the ones who promised it, along with us. The Liberals also voted against the amendment, as did our friends in the NDP, which is beyond me. I no longer understand. I know you know them well, Mr. Speaker, and you probably understand their reasoning, but we do not understand what is happening.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians must realize what is happening in this House. Recently, someone said we have to walk the talk. In this House, several members have made speeches that contradict the positions they have taken. That is unfortunate. As a result, some Canadians are in trouble today because we fail to realize that by not carrying out our responsibilities in this House to correct the situation, we relegate these individuals to poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of poverty will be raised in this House again after the way we have voted recently. There is a lack of consistency there, and we must discuss it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754110"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing—given that you are indicating, Mr. Speaker, that I have one minute left—we do not have the right to say in this House that someone lied. However, we can urge our colleagues to tell the truth. That is what I would like to say to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105827,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105827&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</A>. He announced in this House that, under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073177,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073177&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-269</A>, the measures proposed by the Bloc Québécois would cost $11 billion. The minister's own figures indicate it would cost $1.9 billion, an amount already in the fund.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754111"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I invite you Mr. Speaker, and your colleagues, to verify the minister's statement because, in my opinion, he is obliged to be honest and to correct the statement he made in this House.</div>

In fact, the more things change, the more they stay the same. This is always a much anticipated speech, but it is always a very disappointing one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754120"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the prorogation of the House was announced, there has been a lot of griping from all parts of Quebec, and back home, in <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78655,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78655&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Longueuil—Pierre-Boucher</A>, people had much to say.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I must say that the conditions set by the Bloc Québécois in anticipation of this speech truly reflected what the people have told us throughout the summer, particularly in my riding, where many of my constituents came to me with their concerns about the environment, the federal spending power and Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to stress the fact that the environment is a central concern for the young and the not so young, who are worried. Young voices can be heard calling us to order where it comes to looking after our planet. I think that is very encouraging. The people in my generation understand, as do those in older generations, and as I just mentioned, the younger generation is very sensitive to the issue. The Conservatives are the only ones in society who do not understand. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot believe that, once again, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> is siding with the Americans and adopting the same policy, when there are so many indications that the public is opposed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot believe that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> is siding with the big oil companies instead of the people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if repudiating their signature were not enough, the Conservatives are also silent on the issue of a territorial approach. One understands, however, that such an approach would cost Alberta too much and, more importantly, that it would be too profitable for Quebec industries. How cynical.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754126"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, Quebec distinguishes itself through its difference, having already gone a reasonably long way to achieving the objectives in terms of the targets set in the Kyoto protocol, yet it is totally ignored by the federal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that makes us realize that the Liberals and the Conservatives are cut from the same cloth is federal spending power. In 1996, Jean Chrétien wrote the same lines on this that we see in last week's speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need I remind this minority government that there is a consensus in Quebec on eliminating federal spending power? Need I remind them that Quebec has been disputing this federal spending power'a existence for more than 50 years? Need I remind them that, regardless of their political stripes, every Quebec government, without exception, has expressed their desire to defend the integrity of Quebec's jurisdictions? </div>
    </p><a name="Para754129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are far from it with the Conservative Speech from the Throne. In that speech, Quebeckers now have concrete proof that open federalism is a sham.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What bothers me the most about this Speech from the Throne is that, without asking the opinion of the House, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> clearly announced his intention to pursue the current mission in Afghanistan until 2011, without first doing what he said he would on June 20; here are his own words: </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the mission in Afghanistan was above all to be a mission of reconstruction, a mission in which Canada promised to resolve problems, not create new ones.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time now, this mission has taken a rather worrisome turn. More and more military resources are being sent to Kandahar and more and more soldiers are dying on Afghan soil.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to all that, the NGOs on the ground are complaining about the bad management of money being sent by the Canadian government for humanitarian aid. If the objectives of this mission are to improve the quality of life of Afghans, the message we are hearing from the NGOs is quite simple: we have failed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government is clearly aiming to be as much like the Bush administration in the United States as possible. The reputation of our neighbours to the south is constantly criticized by the international community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly not by copying our neighbour's warlike policies that we are going to improve the quality of life of Afghans. Take Iraq for example: there is nothing to be proud of there.</div>

We are very concerned about the announcements in last week's Speech from the Throne. We are also very concerned about the kind of announcements the minister has been making.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years now, we have been urging the government to support the millennium goals and dedicate 0.7% of GDP to international aid as recommended by the UN special committee.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, our practice of federalism allows Canada to strike a balance, pursuing national goals while taking into consideration various local and regional factors, all the while continuously remaining flexible and adapting to change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Canadian federation's flexibility lends itself well to finding solutions to public policy questions and helps it rise to the challenges that we face to meet the demands of this diverse and ever-changing citizenry. It grants security for local interests while lending scope for carrying out the will of the nation as a whole in matters of national importance.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a federation, we will always have some regional stresses and strains, yet our great strength has been in how we address them, overcome them and build a stronger and a better Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our government first came into power, it was clear that Canadian federalism was not working as well as it should have been.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para754161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was becoming stagnant and unresponsive to the changing needs of the provinces and territories and the changing needs of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we saw before our government came to power was an unprincipled, what I like to call chequebook federalism, an unfettered use of the federal spending power to the detriment of the federation and to Canadians. Unplanned federal surpluses were used to spend massive amounts in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, often in the absence of consultation with the provinces and territories. This spending weakened the bonds of our federation. It resulted in strains between the federal government and the provinces and territories where expenditures were undertaken without adequate consultation or consensus on priorities and created resentment among the provinces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This use of federal spending power in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction created new cost pressures on provincial and territorial governments, forcing them to adversely distort their taxing and spending priorities, particularly where initiatives required matching funds. Provinces were then faced with the dilemma of going into debt to help fund the new programs while still having to respond to their local demands of concerns of their citizens, and if they opted out from the program they subjected their citizens to taxation without benefit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spending in areas of primarily provincial jurisdiction increased uncertainty, where initiatives were introduced without long term or stable federal funding, leaving provinces facing greater budgetary challenges when the cost of the programs were fully downloaded as the federal government sought to slash spending.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para754165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty one months ago, Canadians voted to change the government of Canada, because they wanted to change the direction of this country.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para754166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that they wanted to see was a federalism of openness that allowed the provinces to provide the programs and services that their citizens required. The idea behind open federalism dates to well before 2006. It was born out of the idea that the federation is not static but an evolving institution that should respond to the changes and the impacts of a modern world. It was built on the idea of a strong national government working in cooperation with strong provincial and territorial governments, as envisioned in our Constitution and grounded in the British North American Act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud of this type of federalism. It is also very different from the counterproductive and centralist federalism that had too often characterized the Liberal government's approach to federal-provincial relationships before we became government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that we all hope, with the passage of this throne speech and our government's subsequent legislation, that this era will be well and truly behind us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754169"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open federalism means recognizing the maturation and evolution of the provinces and territories within the federation and respecting the clear and important role that they are playing in meeting their citizens' needs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It means respecting areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction and limiting the use of the federal spending power. My colleague from Roberval--Lac-Saint Jean will be speaking to the House shortly and he will explain how important this is, particularly for Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754174"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By providing this kind of equitable and predictable funding for shared priorities and attempting to clarify roles and responsibilities in the federation, this government is offering a solid principle based approach on which provincial governments can continue to work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restoring the fiscal balance to the federation and proposing limits on the use of federal spending power gives the provinces the financial flexibility and ability to respond to the needs and demands of their citizens and ensure that there are adequate programs to do just that. It gives the provinces the resources and the ability to better meet their citizens' needs by providing better schools, better roads and better health care for Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754176"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Canadian federation evolves, we will continue to focus on measures to strengthen national unity. In the spirit of open federalism, this government has concentrated on its national role by reinvesting in core responsibilities such as trade, defence, public safety and security. We will continue to play a leadership role to promote national interests in cooperation and collaboration with the provinces and territories. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also continue to insert the importance of maintaining an open, honest and respectful relationship with the provinces and territories. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also assert that true collaboration can only occur when resources and accountability are matched with clear roles and responsibilities. Our government believes that the jurisdiction of each order of government should be respected so that all Canadians can see their needs and desires moved to fruition. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754179"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why our government will introduce federal legislation to place formal limits on the use of federal spending power for new cost shared programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. This legislation will also allow provinces and territories to opt out with reasonable compensation if they offer compatible services. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By forging ahead with our vision of open federalism, we remain focused on building Canada's future prosperity by expanding the many advantages we already possess as a nation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is quite specific because I know numerous other members want to question as well. As intergovernmental affairs minister, when she was going through the process of doing this with Nova Scotia, assuming she had something to do with it, what steps were taken to contact the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador to allow it the opportunity to add its voice to the agreement that was supposedly to be signed with Nova Scotia? In other words, if this is going to affect only one province, therein lies breaking one of the basic tenets the Conservatives support, which is to say that it is a one-off deal. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, but the Conservatives also resurrected a former one-off deal in the royalty regimes with Nova Scotia.

    </p><a name="Para754199"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to take part today in this debate on the throne speech. Our speech lays out for Canadians the intentions of our government with regard to the future of the country and the legislative agenda that will make them reality. Our Conservative government kept its promises with respect to the five priorities established in the 2006 election campaign, and I feel very proud of it and of the man who perfectly embodies the leadership sought by Canadians, our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. I feel this same sense of pride in reading the Speech from the Throne, which mirrors the expectations of Canadians who voted for change in 2006.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have chosen to focus on one aspect of the speech that was a promise in the 2005-2006 election campaign, and that our government has reiterated, restricting the federal spending power. This issue represents a challenge to be faced in order to strengthen our federation, one of the five themes of the throne speech. Our government will introduce a bill to impose specific restrictions on the federal spending power in new shared-cost programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. This legislation will allow provinces and territories to opt out with reasonable compensation if they offer compatible programs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to observe and recognize the advantages of the federal spending power, which has played a role as a factor of social development over the course of our history. It led to the creation, in cooperation with provincial and territorial provinces, of national social programs such as medicare. It also played a leading role in promoting equal opportunity for all Canadians. Finally, it helped guarantee that all citizens would have access to basic social services and programs of comparable quality no matter where they live.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By acting to limit federal spending power, our Conservative government has done something that illustrates the benefits of the type of federalism we practise, open federalism, as opposed to the centralist vision of power embraced by the previous government, which preferred conflict to solutions. Open federalism respects the provincial and territorial jurisdictions while taking Canadians' aspirations into account.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud of the open federalism practised by our government, because it avoids the old dynamic of conflict that characterized the former Liberal government of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78331,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78331&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</A>, the Leader of the Opposition. Canadians have had enough of scandals and bickering. They are fed up with the quarrels between centralists and separatists. That is why they chose our Conservative government, to bring real change to Ottawa.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want governments that get along and work together. Our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> wants the future to be marked by optimism, trust and respect. The throne speech given on October 16 paints a promising and inspiring picture of that future for Canadians. The direction in which our government wants to take Canada reflects families' priorities and hopes and what they expect of us. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we want for Canada is in direct contrast to the vision of isolation and perpetual conflict that the official opposition embraced when it was on this side of the House. Our open federalism is a federalism that all Canadians can identify with, no matter where they live. They can all share this vision of the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has long been an important issue in the evolution of the Canadian federation. Until the 1960s, most provinces, aside from Quebec, accepted this federal influence. After a new government was elected in 1960, Quebec's objections grew even stronger. In the years that followed, other provinces began to object to the federal government's presence by way of its spending power. In subsequent decades, there was a great deal of public debate over the political and legal ramifications of federal spending power. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government has already demonstrated that it advocates openness and fairness toward the provinces, especially when it comes to the fiscal balance. Our government can boast that it was the first to recognize the need to restore the fiscal balance in Canada. The federal Liberals always denied that there was a fiscal imbalance, and the Bloc was powerless to correct it. We have taken real steps to do so, thanks to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s leadership.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700">(1700)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para754208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that our government is the one which, in budget 2007, introduced historic measures to restore fiscal balance in Canada by investing $39 billion over the next seven years; by ensuring that our financial relationship with the provinces and territories are based on principles; and by increasing equalization payments and transfers to the provinces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, general agreement for this approach of openness to foster Canadian unity cannot be found in this House. One of the five conditions for the Bloc leader's support for the Speech from the Throne is the elimination of the federal spending power, and what elimination means to us is separation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one aspect of the current political debate which some members of this place tend to overlook, and that is the fact that this government delivers on its commitments to its provincial partners, and this is true for Quebec as for any other province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government promised Quebeckers that Quebec would be invited to participate fully and formally in UNESCO so as to reflect Quebec's tremendous contribution to our collective heritage. Our government has delivered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is the only one in Canadian history to have recognized the Quebec nation. The Liberals form the party of centralization, and the Bloc members, the party of separation, while the Conservatives form the party of the nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government has already done a lot to reconcile the legitimate aspirations of Quebec with our objective of strengthening the Canadian federation. These two realities are not incompatible. In fact, they are mutually beneficial. We have upheld our commitments to Quebeckers, since we are truly defending their interests and will continue to do so. Honouring these commitments is a good example of a principle at the heart of our approach to governing. Once again, we will do what we promised. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said at the beginning of my speech, the objective of a Speech from the Throne is to establish the overall objectives for the government in a new session of Parliament. It is neither the time nor the forum for introducing a bill or discussing, in minute detail, each bill that will soon be debated. At this stage, I will simply say that our policy on the spending power will reflect our desire to strengthen our federation and increase its effectiveness, and to respect our partners, while still respecting their fields of jurisdiction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754215"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebeckers, like all other Canadians, want to see their governments work together to encourage progress and prosperity in the community. With this in mind, our government is pursuing the mission Canadians entrusted us with in January 2006. Our government, under the leadership of our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> will not deviate from this course.</div>

I was a member of the Infrastructures-Québec committee. Clearly, there will always be needs, but the important thing is to continue talks with our provincial partners to make life easier for everyone in Canada.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased this afternoon to have this opportunity to respond to the Speech from the Throne on behalf of the beautiful riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78811,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78811&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Egmont</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the opening of the new session, I would like to take a moment to thank my constituents and my family for their support over the last 19 years and over the span of six elections. I appreciate their support. During my tenure, I am proud to have represented them and their interests in the federal arena.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened with interest to the speech as the Governor General outlined the five priorities on which the government plans to focus during this session. I would like to make remarks on two of those themes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud of my work with the Standing Committee on National Defence and of my responsibility as an advocate for Atlantic Canadian issues. As a result, I will address two issues that are of great importance to me and to Atlantic Canada: Canada's sovereignty and place in the world and the government's plan to strengthen the Canadian federation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First I would like to comment on Canada's sovereignty and place in the world. Canada has a long and proud history of leadership in the international community. From Lester B. Pearson's creation of the first international peacekeeping force during the Suez crisis to Canada's condemnation of apartheid in South Africa, we have always been a strong advocate for diplomacy, peacekeeping and the protection of human rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a committed member of international organizations such as the United Nations, the G-8, the OAS, NATO, the World Bank, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Through these organizations, we have developed our domestic values of democracy, good governance and respect for diversity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada encourages diplomacy and multiculturalism and has often worked hard with other countries to forge important international agreements, yet we have never been afraid to act when it was necessary to protect what we believe in. After the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, we joined in the fight against terrorism by becoming a part of the military mission in Afghanistan. Today, we continue to be a key part of the UN sanctioned NATO force there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our combat mission is scheduled to end in February 2009, which was a decision made by Parliament. As we draw closer to the deadline, it is crucial that parliamentarians have an open, informed debate on the future of the mission. It is our responsibility to represent the opinions of our constituents concerning our continuing involvement in the war. This is not a political question. It is a question of what Canadians want.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been doing good work in Afghanistan. I would like to congratulate our troops, who have been outstanding. They have sacrificed time with their families, the comforts of home and, in some respects, their lives to fight for Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our appreciation and admiration for the men and women of the Canadian Forces is limitless. The House of Commons standing committee visited Kandahar province. We met with the soldiers first-hand and saw first-hand the pride they had in serving their country in that benighted country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their efforts have included improving the security situation in Afghanistan, decommissioning weapons, clearing landmines, reconstructing roads, schools and other infrastructure and providing development aid, and training the Afghan police force and the Afghan army. No one can deny the importance of these efforts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is time to evaluate the success of the mission up to this point, our goals in Afghanistan and our strategy for the future. It is important that parliamentarians and Canadians are informed about the mission's progress and the plan going forward so that we can make the right decision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information from the government and from the military on what is going on in Afghanistan on a going forward basis is something that the standing committee has always had difficulty getting. The creation of an independent, non-partisan panel to investigate our options for the continuation of the mission is a step in the right direction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to hearing the recommendations in January 2008. However, in the end, it is members of Parliament who will make the final decision. In order for MPs to have all the tools necessary to make the right decision, I ask the government to consider creating a special parliamentary committee to review the mission, in addition to the independent panel. Six hours of debate in the House will not be sufficient. This matter deserves careful attention and examination.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715">(1715)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para754252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the questions that come to mind regarding the mission in Afghanistan are as follows.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the indicators of success? What are Canada's and NATO's specific operational goals and are they being achieved? It is simply not enough to say, with no proof, that we are making progress. Parliamentarians need to be able to assess how close we are to reaching our goals. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Canada taking on more of the military burden than other NATO nations? Canada has been involved in heavy fighting in Kandahar province while other NATO nations refuse to allow their troops to operate in the region of Kandahar and Helmand provinces. It is ultimately up to every country to decide what degree of involvement it should shoulder in any conflict; however, we have to ask ourselves why other nations have not been fully committed to this war.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fall meeting of the NATO Parliamentary Association held in Iceland just recently, Canada tried to get a commitment from parliamentarians in the 26 NATO nations, particularly those from Germany, France, Italy and other European countries, to share the burden with Canada on the front lines. Our success, I must say, probably was not resounding, as we did not get a firm commitment from the parliamentarians from these countries to pick up their share of the burden.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's efforts in Afghanistan should be a combination of the three Ds: defence, diplomacy and development. Have development and diplomacy been given enough attention? That is the question. Total defence spending for the combat mission is estimated to reach $4.3 billion by February 2009. The total financial commitment for development is $1 billion over 10 years. Will concentrating more of our efforts on diplomacy and development help us reach our goals more quickly and be more in keeping with our reputation as a force for cooperative change?</div>
    </p><a name="Para754257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the mission were to continue beyond 2009, what roles and responsibilities would we take on? The panel has been presented with four scenarios: continue training the Afghan army and police so Canada can begin withdrawing its forces; focus on reconstruction and have forces from another country take over security in Kandahar province; shift Canadian security and reconstruction efforts to another region in Afghanistan; or withdraw all Canadian military except a minimal force to protect aid workers and diplomats. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as noted by the hon. Leader of the Opposition, the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78331,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78331&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</A>, in his response last Wednesday, the government seems to have already chosen the first option. If the panel proposes a different route, will the government listen?</div>
    </p><a name="Para754259"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Speech from the Throne, the government refers to the first option by stating that “Canada should...accelerate the training of the Afghan army and police so that the Afghan government can defend its own sovereignty”, which is a noble objective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, Operation Archer, the Canadian contribution to the retraining of the Afghan National Army and Afghan police, is comprised of only 30 Canadian Forces members, compared to the 2,500 troops deployed in Kandahar. It is a massive difference in commitment: 2,500 to 30. What is the government's plan to increase the number of Canadian Forces members participating in the retraining of the Afghan army and police? </div>
    </p><a name="Para754261"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are questions we have a right to debate as parliamentarians. I urge the government to give us a forum in which to do that and to provide us with full and complete information about the mission so that we can make the right decision when the issue comes back to the House for a vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754262"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last comments are about strengthening the federation. Since I am running out of time, I will save my comments on that initiative for a later date.</div>

    </p><a name="Para754267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly am impressed with the whole committee and the way it operated on behalf of Canada in putting forth our views and in supporting our troops. As the member said, we received accolades from countries all over the world about the commitment we have made there and the necessity of a country such as Canada taking a lead role in a very tough area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to ask when enough is enough. How long are we going to put our troops on the front lines? Is it two more years during which we can reasonably expect our troops to be on the front lines or is it the next 10 years? It is going to take a long time before Afghanistan becomes a country that can function on its own with its own police force and its own army.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will have to be a long term commitment to Afghanistan made by NATO and by Canada as a member of NATO, but I think the burden of the front line should be shared with other countries that seem to have forgotten the lessons of the first and second world wars, particularly in Europe.</div>

It is distorted to the extent that it is difficult to tell what is real and what is fantasy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some examples from the Speech from the Throne: “Canadians now have more money in their pockets because taxes have been cut”. Which Canadians? Certainly not the low income Canadians who have had their taxes increased by 5% by the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech also states: “Families now have real choice in child care”. That is $100 a month, $60 after taxes, this does nothing for early childhood development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another statement in the speech states: “a government committed to helping them get the medical care they need more quickly”. The Fraser Institute has just told us that in fact wait times have gone up. There is nothing in the speech to deal with health human resources which everyone knows is what will help to break wait times and there is nothing dealing with some of the management issues that we need to put in place to bring wait times down.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of the throne speech states: “Our Government will stand up for Canada’s traditional industries. Key sectors including forestry”. I think we will recall that the government has done nothing to deal with the fires that occurred in the Okanagan, or to prevent them. It has done absolutely nothing for the pine beetle that is devastating British Columbia forests. It sold us out on softwood lumber, cheating our softwood lumber industries of $1 billion and now we are back speaking to the United States again about the same old thing. What fantasy world is the government living in is the question I want to ask?</div>
    </p><a name="Para754284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is interesting about the Speech from the Throne is what is not in it than for what is in it. The government speaks of concern for children but nowhere in the speech is there anything about sport or physical activity, yet one in four children in Canada are obese or overweight, 26% of them; 41% of children off reserve are obese or overweight and 55% of children on reserve are obese. Provincial and federal governments agree that we need to have a sport infrastructure to create daily physical quality activity for these children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Liberal government put this in place. The Conservative government came into power and it disappeared. All the provinces are wondering where the sport infrastructure money is. It is not there. Two years later we still cannot hear about it. So much for caring about children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a physician I can tell the House that being overweight and obesity creates heart disease and will create type 2 diabetes, and our children will not live as long as their parents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard again in the Speech from the Throne about homelessness and housing. The government cancelled the Liberal $1.4 billion homelessness program. It cancelled the deal with the cities with which we were partnering to deal with housing and homelessness. The government obviously never spoke about housing before except in one word in the Speech from the Throne with absolutely no follow through on the sentence. It was just plunked into the middle of the sentence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in my city of Vancouver middle class people cannot afford to own their own homes. They cannot afford to rent affordable housing for their children. This is what is going on and we know that the government has absolutely nothing to say about it except words.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On arts and culture, why does it not surprise me that there is nothing about arts and culture in the Speech from the Throne? This is a government that voted against the UNESCO convention on the protection and promotion of cultural diversity, a convention that was written by and large by Canada over the past 10 years. The Conservative government voted against it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that arts and culture is essential, not only for a sense of Canadian identity but for social cohesion in this very diverse geographic and demographic country. As well, in a post-industrial era if we wanted to really look at how Canada could be productive and competitive, we need to be able to stimulate creativity, imagination and innovation. That is what arts and culture is about. It is an essential part of an economic development plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Speech from the Throne is filled with all these wonderful buzz words, with all this fantasy and ideology, indeed I wonder if an ad agency wrote it because it is Pablum for the people. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1730"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730">(1730)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para754292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is such a lack of vision in the Speech from the Throne. It is so bland, so banal and lacking in substance that one has to wonder what there is to vote against. There is nothing there. It is a nothing speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the only red flag in the speech that causes me some concern is the rehash of that old Brian Mulroney ideology about limiting federal spending and allowing provinces to opt out of shared programs. These programs are the glue that hold the country together.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicare will be gone if we allow provincial governments to opt out of shared programs. The federal government should be standing up for accessibility and portability for all Canadians, so that they can have access to social programs and medicare no matter where they live in the country, no matter what their language or who they are. That is not going to happen. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutual respect, which is a word used in the Speech from the Throne for this devolution of powers, actually in our language as Liberals means partnerships.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent a great deal of time as a government developing the social union framework agreement that allowed us to build partnerships with provinces and municipalities working together to create something that binds us as a country. This is gone. We see that the partnerships are gone. Obviously, it worked because we were able to develop shared programs on child care, the Kelowna accord, and we were able to develop a deal for cities in the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since the current government came into power, aided and abetted I might add by the NDP, it has actually had one agenda and that is to dismantle social programs, to dismiss the most vulnerable in our society, and to disregard agreements that have been written together by governments in the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we are coming close to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s dream of firewalls around the provinces. But Liberals will continue to do what we do best: we will continue to respect Parliament. We will continue to ensure that Parliament works and that parliamentary democracy is honoured. We will be watching closely as the Speech from the Throne unfolds. We will stand on guard for a united, compassionate and strong Canada. That, Mr. Speaker, I promise you.</div>

    </p><a name="Para754300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I have been reading there are many who are saying that if we want to tackle wait times, which the government promised to do two years ago and has not done a thing about, we need to spend more money in this area for diagnostic equipment for doctors and nurses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would this work if we had limited spending power, would we have medicare today? That is the first question. The second question has to do with municipal infrastructure programs. How does the hon. member see infrastructure programs? We have a government that talks very nicely with a lot of platitudes about flexible federalism and limiting federal spending power, yet I am sure that it is concocting that it can invest in arenas and cultural centres across the country. How would the member look at that?</div>

Anyone who understands anything about medicare, the Canada Health Act and health care financing across the country will know that the way to resolve wait times is to set the protocols, and to look at how we devise a system in which we have people to deliver the care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three million Canadians today in Canada who cannot find a family physician. We need doctors, nurses and technologists. We had set up a plan as Liberals to deal with this. We had developed a health human resources strategy. That is gone. We have not heard a word of this since the government came into power. Anyone who asks questions about it gets absolutely blank stares and no answers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot bring down wait times without having human resources. As well, we know that there are management issues which the provinces can do very well. There needs to be a pool put together of all of the wait lists so that people can move in and out of the pool based on the various doctors or nurses. That is the way to work it. Provinces can do that on their own but we need to support them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754305"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many municipalities and small provinces do not have the ability to deliver the equal programs and we need to give them the opportunity to do that with federal spending.</div>

We know that in the last 10 years statistics in crime have gone down remarkably in this country. The police chiefs have told us that and justice institutes have told us that. It does not mean that we are devoid of crime but crime has gone down. Let us speak to the issue of crime, for instance, and the concept that the government has developed a strategy for the war on drugs. As a physician, I can tell members--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am here to talk today about our very exciting democracy agenda. Since this government came to power about a year and nine months ago, it has engaged in the most assertive approach to improving Canada's democracy of any government in the country's history. It is exciting to be a part of such a government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to list some of the democracy measures that we have put forward and then I will talk in a little more detail about them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is time, and I hope there is, I will be dividing my time with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78722,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78722&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had eight pieces of legislation that have dealt with democracy and I have divided them into three headings. It seems to me that there are three fundamental theme areas. We have dealt with greater accessibility to the polls for voters. We did that by putting forward legislation that created more advance poll days and more geographically dispersed advance polls allowing people, particularly in areas of the country where advance polls were not easily accessible, access to those advance polls thereby ensuring that we could help people to vote in greater numbers and with greater ease. Nunavut comes to mind as perhaps the best example of this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put forward several pieces of legislation that deal with greater security of vote, greater transparency and honesty in our voting. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, which essentially deals with electoral fraud, has put in new requirements for voter identification that will significantly reduce the potential for voter fraud in ridings. That passed with widespread support in the House of Commons. All parties, except the New Democratic Party, were enthusiastic in their support for it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, the Federal Accountability Act, had provisions ending the role of corporate and union contributions in our electoral process. This is a very healthy thing for an open and transparent electoral process where money no longer plays a role.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2903284,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2903284&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-54</A>, which dealt with election loans and the loophole that was exploited by so many Liberal leadership candidates in terms of getting loans and then finding ways to potentially get the terms of those loans rewritten after the fact, shut down that loophole.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The areas that I would like to concentrate on today are the four pieces of legislation that are working toward providing greater democracy in the most direct sense to our representative system: the legislation the government put forward dealing with the election of senators and with the creation of eight year terms for our senators, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2331924,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2331924&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-4</A>, which was presented in the Senate in the last term; the legislation, which was passed, creating four year terms and fixed election dates for the House of Commons, which removes the capacity of prime ministers to call elections when the polls are convenient, something that was used extensively by Mr. Chrétien when he was prime minister and had been used by other prime ministers in the past; and finally, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2923079,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2923079&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-56</A>, which introduces greater representation by population in the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to concentrate on greater democracy in the Senate and then greater democracy in the House of Commons, the two areas that are the most detailed proposals put forward by the government in this area of greater democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start with the Senate and the election of senators. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754324"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked about introducing in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2331924,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2331924&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-4</A>, the idea of eight year terms for senators. This was found to be constitutional in the upper House reference case of 1980 by the Supreme Court of Canada. The court indicated, in rough terms, the length of term would have to be fixed. There would have to be four senators in order to fulfill the constitutional obligation. Senators would be exempt from the kinds of pressures that re-election causes and that short terms could cause that might affect the voting patterns of an individual in either that House or this one.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that before the Liberals in the upper House decided to vote against this bill, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A> indicated that he was perfectly happy with fixed terms. Therefore, we hope he can assert that love he had of democracy and bring his unruly senators into line when this bill is reintroduced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper House was intended as a House of sober second thought, not of partisan second thought. The intention was not that the upper House become what it has become, a House of patronage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In explaining the spirit of the bill, I wanted to make the point that the upper House has wandered very far from its original intention of being a House of sober second thought. Senators unfortunately are, as a rule, not appointed based upon their merits. They are appointed based upon their partisan affiliations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote from former Senator Dan Hays in a presentation he made to a Senate committee on May 25 of this year. He made the following statement:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper House has simply become a den of patronage and we are trying to break free from that. This is the point of Senate elections. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible, I suppose, to consider abolishing the Senate. Our friends in the NDP have indicated that is their preferred approach. It is not my preferred approach. It is not the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s preferred approach. Moreover it is a very difficult avenue to pursue because it requires the consent, depending upon which constitutional scholar one goes to, of either all the provinces, or at least seven provinces with half the population.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any rate, it is a difficult avenue to pursue, but if it turns out that the other parties are unwilling to pursue elections to the Senate, it is clear that the abolition of the Senate is preferable to the approach of simply using it as a House of patronage, the pattern of course of previous governments, and in all fairness of both partisan stripes, in the past.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk for a moment about representation by population in the House of Commons. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2923079,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2923079&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-56</A>, introduced in the last session of Parliament, dealt with greater representation by population, a more equitable system in the lower House, and I am a great fan of this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representation by population formula that was incorporated in the original Constitution Act, 1867, has by reason of repeated amendment become less and less representation by population and more and more representation by population, with one exception after another. It was amended in 1915, again in the 1940s, in 1952, in the 1970s, in 1985, and each time it moved further and further from one person, one vote, the equality of voting, regardless of the riding or the province in which one lived.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has produced the situation that there is now great disequilibrium. The bill attempts to bring back a measure of representation by population. It would introduce new seats for Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. In the cases of Alberta and B.C., they have been brought right up to equality with the level that Quebec is at, essentially at the national medium number in terms of electors per MP.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ontario would be below that, but far further ahead than they are now, and this is a major step, for the first time, in the direction of returning to the spirit of rep by pop that was part of the original Confederation deal for the lower House.</div>

    </p><a name="Para754342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has not filled most of the vacancies in the Senate because he is hopeful that it will be possible to fill these by means of an election.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, let me address the question regarding Mr. Fortier. He was appointed on a very specific basis. The member may disagree with it, but the basis was that the city of Montreal deserves some representation. It is the second largest city in the country. It is the largest city in Quebec. It deserves to have some representation in the cabinet; thus the reason for appointing him.

I always look forward to his speeches as they are always well researched and contain a tremendous amount of information. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague talked about why it is important to do those things in terms of the democratic reform we have proposed. What I want to know from his perspective is what the danger is of the House not pursuing the changes needed to make this a more democratic place.</div>

The short answer for the Senate, if he had asked me about that, in a nutshell would have been that if we cannot reform the Senate, I think the move for the abolition of the Senate would grow. Having a unicameral Parliament in a federation is not as good as having a bicameral Parliament, which is why we see them in all the other federations of the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to this place, the danger is simply this. Ridings are getting larger and larger as the population of the country is growing, but they are getting larger in the provinces with the most rapidly growing populations, which in practice means Alberta, B.C. and Ontario, where there is a more rapid rate than elsewhere. There is an increasing discontinuity between the size of an average riding in Ontario, for example, and Saskatchewan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote a article for the <i>National Post</i> three or four years ago in which I pointed out that if current population trends continue, Statistics Canada predicts that 20 years from now the average riding size in Alberta will be twice the size of an average riding in Saskatchewan, for example. There is something fundamentally unfair about a system like that. We are simply trying to do what we can to rectify that situation.</div>

I will not be able to get through all of my comments, but I do want to make a few comments, if I may, in the short period of time that I do have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to stand here in response to the Speech from the Throne and say how excited I was when I heard the speech that was delivered so eloquently by the Governor General.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other things I want to say is that for the first time we had an opportunity to let the majority of Canadians really get engaged in listening to the speech, because for the first time the speech was actually primarily delivered in prime time in terms of television. Certainly in eastern Canada it was viewed in prime time. I know that from my own standpoint, we received several calls in my constituency office from people who actually had a chance to view the Speech from the Throne and they viewed it as a great opportunity. This is something about which we should all be excited, because it is actually getting more citizens engaged in the democratic process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not everyone was in favour of it. Members collectively from the opposition parties seemed to criticize it. They called it Americanization. Let us face it: If the collective opposition cannot make a couple of references to George W. Bush on a daily basis, life just is not worth living for them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fact notwithstanding, it was a very positive move, because it allowed Canadians to see firsthand how this government intends to conduct itself over the course of the next months and we hope the next few years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754356"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It spoke specifically of five priorities, what this government intends to do in strengthening the federation, strengthening our sovereignty, strengthening our economy, strengthening our environmental practices and, of course, with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, strengthening the ability for all of our citizens at home to feel more secure in their daily lives. One of the things we wanted to make sure with our tackling violent crime bill is that we enacted some measures that have been long overdue to protect our citizens, whether they be children, adults or seniors. We wanted to make sure that we took positive action to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians. That is why we have introduced Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, a comprehensive bill to deal with some very important pieces of legislation that had been stalled for far too long both in this House during committee and in the Senate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to touch very briefly on some of the points that my colleague was mentioning about Senate reform. One of the things we do have the ability to do in this House and in the upper chamber is to take some positive action in reforming the Senate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754358"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For too many years, well over 100 years, we have had an unelected, patronage appointed Senate. What we are attempting to do is take the patronage appointments away from how we conduct our Senate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By allowing citizens through a consultation process to voice their opinions on who they wish to represent them regionally, as senators, has got to be viewed as a positive thing. However, I do not see much acceptance of that initiative by members opposite and members of the upper chamber. That is clearly unfortunate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, what we need to do very seriously is, this House, as an assembly, should send a direct message to the Senate that when we send a piece of legislation from this place to the other place, the Senate must deal with it expeditiously with no delay.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I know my time is tight and I thank you for the brief opportunity I have had to give these remarks.</div>
