report concerning refugees without identity papers.
<P>
	There are two main differences between our report and the 
majority report. The first one concerns the waiting period. Second, 
regarding two of the countries identified in the regulations, namely 
Afghanistan and  Somalia, we think it is discriminatory. That is 
why we have tabled a minority report.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-364, an act to amend amend the Income Tax Act 
(change RRSP deduction to a tax credit).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the RRSP system is to assist 
Canadians in building up capital to provide a reasonable retirement 
income. It is not intended to shelter wealth or to defer taxes on the 
amounts accumulated beyond the amounts required to provide for 
that reasonable retirement income.
<P>
	Tax fairness and equity must be protected within our Income Tax 
Act. That includes making sure that the tax benefits do not 
unreasonably favour certain taxpayers over others. In the current 
RRSP system the RRSP deduction favours high income earners 
over low income earners.
<P>
	Therefore to address these matters this bill proposes to convert 
the RRSP deduction to a non-refundable tax credit and to establish 
a lifetime contribution limit on RRSPs.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, no later than the conclusion of Routine Proceedings on the tenth sitting day 
after the adoption of this motion, Bill C-234, an act to amend the Criminal Code, 
shall be deemed reported back to the House without amendment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I want to indicate what Bill C-234 is all 
about. Bill C-234 eliminates section 745 of  the Criminal Code. It 
extinguishes the right of a first degree murderer to have their parole 
ineligibility reviewed after serving only 15 years of a life sentence. 
Bill C-234 makes a life sentence mean life.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	On November 21, 1996, in a ruling that my motion on the Order 
Paper was in order, the Speaker said: ``The motion moved by the 
hon. member for Crowfoot in fact provides the committee with a 
period of time in which to consider and report the bill if it so 
chooses. At the same time, the motion provides the House with a 
mechanism to remove the bill, which is its property, from the 
committee so that the House itself can take up consideration of the 
bill''.
<P>
	The Speaker further stated: ``The House does not know what has 
occurred in committee and consequently cannot know what 
amendments the committee has made to the bill. Therefore, if the 
House wishes to once again take possession of the bill, then the 
inclusion of the words ``without amendment'' establishes clearly 
that the House will be dealing with the text of the bill it adopted at 
second reading''.
<P>
	My motion is based on my privileges and those of my colleagues 
being breached.
<P>
	The action of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs not reporting Bill C-234 back to the House impedes 
members from performing their legislative duties. It impedes 
members from debating in this House, an open forum unlike the 
committee, an issue which is of utmost concern to our constituents.
<P>
	On December 13, 1994, Bill C-234 formerly Bill C-226, was 
referred to the justice committee by a majority of votes in this 
House. The minister of defence who was then the Minister of 
Transport, and the member for Vancouver-Quadra, along with 72 
of their colleagues and all Reform members present in the House 
voted to send Bill C-234 to committee. All members who voted to 
send Bill C-234 to committee fully expected it to be reported back 
to the House, providing members another opportunity to debate the 
bill and where the final determination upon the bill could be made 
and I suggest should be made.
<P>
	The fate of this private member's bill, the fate of all private 
members' bills should not be left in the hands of just a few 
committee members beyond the authority of this House. The House 
gave life to the bill and only the House has the authority in its final 
determination. For a committee to kill a bill which was given life 
by this House and a majority of its members is a violation of our 
privileges as members of Parliament.
<P>
	Bill C-234 was circumvented by the justice minister's Bill C-45. 
The committee allowed Bill C-45 to take precedence over the 
private member's bill. Bill C-234 was introduced almost two years 
before Bill C-45 yet Bill C-45, a government bill, was the bill 
chosen by the  committee to be dealt with first. If I had not put a 
motion forward in committee to have Bill C-234 dealt with, this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7425"> 7425 </A></B>
<P>
private member's bill would still likely be in limbo today in the 
justice committee.
<P>
	Bill C-234 was dealt with simultaneously with Bill C-45. 
However, Liberal members of the committee were obviously more 
favourable toward the minister's bill which clearly led to the 
demise of Bill C-234.
<P>
	This was evident in that Bill C-45 was promptly returned to the 
House. In only 11 days, Bill C-45 was introduced, sent to 
committee, reviewed in committee, debated at report stage and 
third reading and passed. All this was done with less than two 
weeks before Parliament recessed for the summer.
<P>
	The justice minister had almost three years to introduce bill 
C-45, but he chose to drag his feet. He chose to introduce Bill C-45 
at the eleventh hour. The justice minister chose to gamble with the 
emotions of the Rosenfeldts and the other 10 families whose 
children were murdered by Olson. The justice minister lost that 
gamble.
<P>
	The justice minister is directly responsible for Clifford Olson's 
August 12 bid for early release. He is directly accountable to the 
Rosenfeldts and the other 10 families whose children were ripped 
from their lives by the hands of Clifford Olson. The justice minister 
is responsible for Clifford Olson's newsmaking attempts for early 
release.
<P>
	The justice minister claimed Bill C-45 was not about Clifford 
Olson. He claimed the bill was not a result of Olson's August 12, 
1996 date to make application for early release. Why then was the 
minister and his government so intent that the bill be passed before 
the summer recess? Why did the Liberal government ask us and the 
Bloc not to unduly delay this bill?
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	We provided our co-operation despite the fact that we do not 
support Bill C-45. We did not then and we still do not support it. 
We gave our word that we would not block the passage of the bill 
because we did not want to be responsible in any way for Olson's 
bid for early release. Unlike the Liberal justice minister, we did not 
want the Rosenfeldts and the other families to have to relive a 
nightmare they have endured for the past 15 years.
<P>
	Although Bill C-45 would still give the likes of Olson an appeal 
to a judge, which I find absolutely repugnant and beneath 
contempt, there was the possibility that he could be denied the full 
judge and jury hearing he now has under section 745 by virtue of 
the actions of this government.
<P>
	Bill C-45 was stalled by the Senate and Olson once again 
grabbed the spotlight he so predictably seeks.
<P>
	For the benefit of the members of this House who do not sit on 
the justice committee, I would like to read the testimony given by 
Sharon Rosenfeldt before that committee on June 18:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Emotional upheaval-that was what I felt on February 8, 1996, when I found out 
that Clifford Olson, the killer of my son, had applied for his 15-year judicial review. I 
do realize that the full application cannot be made until August 12, but I know that 
all the paperwork is ready.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have known for the past number of years-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I listened with 
great interest to what the hon. member was saying, but my 
understanding is that his motion really deals with trying to bring 
Bill C-234 to the House. It does not deal with Bill C-45 which has 
already gone through this House nor with the testimony of a 
witness before the committee.
<P>
	If that is the case, at least my colleague should be given the 
opportunity to respond and enter into this debate. My 
understanding is that the motion-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. The hon. member 
for Crowfoot has moved a motion that is before the House for 
debate. He is debating the motion and with great respect to the hon. 
member for Ottawa Centre, I do not think the remarks that he is 
making are far off the subject matter of the bill that was before the 
committee and which is the subject of the discussion. He is giving 
his reasons as to why the bill should have been reported. He may be 
expanding on that, but he is entitled to do so. I invite the hon. 
member for Crowfoot to resume his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Merry 
Christmas to you too.
<P>
	If the hon. member would like to debate this motion, by all 
means let him enter into debate to express his concerns about 
anything I might have to say about this bill.
<P>
	I will continue to quote what Mrs. Rosenfeldt said when she 
appeared before the committee. It is important that this House and 
all citizens of this country know the terror, agony and pain that 
victims of crime go through. She said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have known for the past number of years that it was his right to apply and that in 
all likelihood he would. Yet for some reason, although my mind knew it could be a 
reality, my heart, emotions and soul denied it. I was afraid to think about it, so I put 
my feelings on hold, something I've grown accustomed to. I know how to make 
certain feelings go numb. I learned how to survive like that.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You see, I have to stay strong because I made a promise to my son as his coffin was 
being lowered into the ground that I would do everything I could as his mom to ensure 
that the person responsible for killing him would be brought to justice. I promised I 
would never leave him until that happened. I know I have to put him to rest and that he </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7426"> 7426 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>deserves to be put to rest, but  the laws in our country prevent both of us from 
experiencing any peace.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When I learned that Olson had indeed made the application, I was stunned. 
Suddenly many images flashed through my mind. I felt shock but I shouldn't feel 
shock. I felt angry but I shouldn't feel angry. I felt hurt but I shouldn't be hurting. I 
felt betrayed and I felt panic. I couldn't breathe and I couldn't stay still. I kept pacing 
from room to room. I wanted to cry, I wanted to scream and I wanted to run-.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I hope the justice minister is hearing this. I hope that all 
members of the House are hearing this eloquent description of the 
pain and agony this mother is going through and which this 
government is perpetuating by the actions it has taken. Mrs. 
Rosenfeldt went on to state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Why do we have to go through this again? I felt weak and vulnerable. I cannot 
lose my dignity again-.I went into the family room and I took my son's picture off 
the cabinet. I sat down and stared lovingly at him, outlining his face with my hands. 
He looked so perfect. You see, I always have to reconstruct his face in my mind 
because a hammer was used on him. He was beaten beyond recognition. I cradled his 
picture next to my heart and once again made the same promises I had 15 years 
earlier. I got on my knees and I asked God to give me the strength to keep my 
dignity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is very important to me because after Clifford Olson took my child's life, he 
also took my dignity for a while. I will not let Olson and the system do that again.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	The justice minister failed to stop Olson. He failed to protect 
Sharon Rosenfeldt, her family and the 10 other families whose 
children were murdered by Olson, from feeling shocked, angry, 
hurt, betrayed, weak and vulnerable. Instead the justice minister 
and the Liberal government are protecting Clifford Olson and 
granting him rights he ought not to have by refusing to eliminate 
section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Bill C-234 protects the rights of victims. It protects the 
Rosenfeldts and other victims from enduring the painful memory 
of having their young children ripped from their lives.
<P>
	Bill C-234 would abolish section 745 of the Criminal Code. It 
would take away the rights of killers to a review of their parole 
ineligibility. In doing so it would restore truth in sentencing by 
making life mean life with no hope for parole until at least 25 years 
of that sentence have been served.
<P>
	In closing, to the members on the other side of the House who 
voted against Bill C-234, who voted in favour of allowing first 
degree murderers the opportunity for early release, I ask: What 
value do they place on the lives of their brothers and sisters and the 
lives of their children? Do they feel their lives are worth only 15 
years? Will the joy and excitement which rings in the voices of 
their young children be forgotten after just 15 years?
<P>
	I would like the justice minister and all members of the House to 
pause, particularly at this time of the season when our thoughts turn 
to our family members, both close family members and extended 
family members, and to members of our communities, to our 
friends and neighbours, and think about their own children and then 
justify to Canadians why their lives and those of all their family 
members is worth a meagre 15 years.
<P>
	Convicted murderers, rapists and others who take it upon 
themselves to assault or take the life of another human being throw 
all their rights away the minute they launch their deadly attack, all 
their rights, except to a fair and just hearing. For the criminal 
justice system to provide a killer with a so-called glimmer of hope 
or to restore their rights is a further injustice to the victim, the 
victim's family and an offence to Canadians because the killers did 
not offer a glimmer of hope of any kind to their victims. No, they 
viciously and sadistically murdered them.
<P>
	Bill C-234 would restore that justice. It would make victims 
rights a priority. It would protect the families of murder victims. 
More important, Bill C-234 if adopted by the House, would place 
some real value on the lives of all Canadians.
<P>
	I appreciate the Chair having ruled my motion to be in order and 
for allowing members of the House to make the final decision on 
Bill C-234. I would ask all members, whether or not they support 
the bill, to at least bring it back to the House so that it is this House 
which will make the final decision and not a handful of members of 
Parliament in the justice committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member went on at length to talk about his interest in ensuring the 
safety of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	It was the hon. member and his party that voted against every 
single piece of legislation that was introduced by the Minister of 
Justice that deals with the question of safety of Canadians. This is 
the very same member who did not hear the outcry from Canadians 
whose families were slaughtered by criminals. Many of my 
constituents have been killed by guns, by violence.
<P>
	When the Minister of Justice introduced legislation that would 
ensure the safety of my constituents, these members voted against 
it. They voted against the gun control legislation. They have 
sanctioned the use of guns that are used in some cases to commit 
crimes. These are members of a party that voted against everything 
that had to do with the safety of Canadians from coast to coast. 
Now they stand up enraged, saying they were entrusted with the 
safety of Canadians.
<P>
	They talk about the testimony of people who appeared before the 
justice committee. Where were they when people before the justice 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7427"> 7427 </A></B>
<P>
committee were appealing for support for the gun control 
legislation? Why did they not  support the gun control legislation 
that would have helped reduce crime? Why did they not support 
other government initiatives that deal with the reduction of crime?
<P>
	I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that you cannot suck and blow at 
the same time and that is exactly what this member is trying to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, if this hon. member wants to stand 
before his voters during the next election and tell them very clearly 
that he voted in favour of the criminal rather than a safer society on 
Bill C-45 and on this private member's bill, let him do it.
<P>
	Although he has taken the time of the House to raise the issue on 
the gun control bill, he has not told us how the registration of rifles 
and shotguns will reduce the criminal use of those firearms. 
Neither has the justice minister nor has any member explained how 
that will create a safer society.
<P>
	Why did Reform vote against Bill C-41? We voted against Bill 
C-41 because the government created alternative measures for 
violent offenders. When Reform introduced an amendment to 
exempt violent offenders from alternative measures the 
government killed that amendment with this member's support.
<P>
	Not only does Bill C-41 allow a legal process by which violent 
offenders may never see the inside of courtroom, it also encourages 
the courts to use conditional sentencing. From the time that Bill 
C-41 became part of our law two and a half to three months ago, the 
courts have freed rapists in at least in two cases, and a third one has 
just come to our attention. Serious violent offenders have been 
allowed to walk free while their victims have been traumatized and 
afraid to leave their residences. That is why Reform voted against 
some of the nonsense that comes down the pipe from the justice 
minister.
<P>
	If this member wants to stand before his voters in the next 
election and debate with myself or any other member in the Reform 
Party, he will be skinned alive. Why will he get skinned alive? 
Because Reform wants reasonable and common sense legislation 
brought forward to deal fairly and in a balanced way with the safety 
of society and this legislation does not do that.
<P>
	When our courts are encouraged to give conditional sentences to 
rapists that allows them to walk free while their victims cringe in 
their own homes, afraid to walk the streets, afraid to leave their 
homes, then there is something wrong with our justice system.
<P>
	We will take them on in the next election and we will deal with 
these issues. We will allow the people to decide who is sucking and 
who is blowing. We can see clearly who is sucking and who is 
blowing in this country. It is the Liberals over there.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what we have heard today is evidence of the Liberal 
philosophy. As a matter of fact, Canadians were astonished not 
more than a couple of months ago when the Minister of Justice, in 
the face of the people's cry for justice and in the face of all the 
victims of crime, tell them that the prime consideration of the 
criminal justice system must be the rehabilitation and reintegration 
of criminals back into society.
<P>
	What about the millions of Canadians who are talking about the 
protection of society? What about consideration for the millions of 
victims of crime? The government continually supports the 
criminal. It does not give a whit for law-abiding Canadians. It does 
not give a whit for the victims of crime. The member for Ottawa 
Centre and the other Liberal members who are cheering him on 
today are evidence that the Liberal government cares only about its 
weak-kneed philosophy toward crime. It does not care about the 
cries of Canadians or the protection of Canadian society. Its system 
of justice stinks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, all across the country there is a cry 
about the justice system and the Young Offenders Act. There is a 
cry for greater protection for those who are the most vulnerable in 
our society, our children and our senior citizens.
<P>
	For the last 25 years that kind of philosophy has held sway in the 
creation of laws that grant greater and greater rights to the criminal. 
The Liberals have had the opportunity to show that their 
philosophy would create a safer society. However, that philosophy, 
that bleeding heart mentality, has failed. If it had worked it would 
have been wonderful but it has not worked. It has failed.
<P>
	The victims of crime who appeared before our committees are 
crying out for some sort of changes. Those victims are full 
testimony of which I speak. They represent the common sense of 
the vast majority of Canadians who are speaking out on this whole 
issue of crime and the protection of society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the opportunity to make some submissions with 
respect to this matter.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I remind hon. members 
that the hon. member for York South-Weston has the floor. I think 
members might want to hear his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Canadians, in due course, will have the 
opportunity to pass judgment on the record of the government with 
respect to criminal law reform.
<P>
	Over the last three years and many years before that, Canadians 
have expressed in clear and unequivocal terms their desire for a 
balanced and just justice system. We have seen over the last 
number of years a justice system  that is unjust, a justice system 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7428"> 7428 </A></B>
<P>
that is imbalanced, a justice system that appears to put the rights of 
criminals and those charged with criminal offences ahead of the 
rights of victims, families of victims and Canadians generally. 
Canadians are not happy with the criminal justice system.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	What the government has done or what the government has not 
done, Canadian people will judge. It has had the opportunity over 
the last three years to bring in some meaningful criminal law 
reform.
<P>
	For example, the government has made some progress with 
respect to the Young Offenders Act but the progress has been 
limited. It did go far enough. The Young Offenders Act still does 
not have the support and respect of Canadians. In my view it is an 
invitation for young people to break the law. It treats 16 and 17 
years olds like children. Sixteen and 17 years olds are able to 
understand the difference between right and wrong. They are able 
to drive. For all intents and purposes they are adults but for some 
reason the government insists on treating 16 and 17 year olds like 
children.
<P>
	The police across the country, those involved in the criminal 
justice system, have been crying out for changes to the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	What about murder in this country? What about murder and the 
penalties for murder? A law on the books today allows convicted 
killers like Clifford Olson, like Paul Bernardo, like Colin Thatcher, 
like all the other hideous murderers, to apply to be released after 
serving only 15 years of their sentences. That is unconscionable. 
That is not what Canadians want.
<P>
	Canadians want a justice system that reflects their abhorrence at 
the crime of murder, premeditated first degree murder; the 
degenerates in our society who believe that they can deliberately 
take the life of another individual and then only serve 15 years.
<P>
	I had a bill before Parliament, a bill that has been endorsed by 
every police association across the country, a bill that was endorsed 
by every victims' group across this country, a bill that was 
endorsed and approved by the overwhelming majority of 
Canadians. This government had a choice. It had an option. It could 
side with the criminals, it could side with first degree killers, 
Clifford Olson, Paul Bernardo and others, or it could side with the 
victims, the families of victims and the overwhelming majority of 
Canadians.
<P>
	What route did the government take? Initially my bill to repeal 
section 745 of the Criminal Code was endorsed in principle. Over 
80 Liberal members of Parliament supported that bill. That was the 
will of this Parliament, the supreme law-making body in this 
country as far as criminal law is concerned. Over 80 Liberal 
members of Parliament, including the Minister of National 
Defence, the minister of Indian affairs and others indicated  
publicly that they would support the repeal of section 745.
<P>
	That bill, having received the endorsement of this Parliament, 
was then sent off to the justice committee. What a farce that was. 
The committee members rushed the bill through within a matter of 
hours. Is that a reflection of the government's commitment to 
consultation? We had mothers of murder victims pleading with the 
justice committee. Priscilla de Villiers and others came forward. 
Mothers of murder victims pleaded with members of the justice 
committee, saying: ``Please bring some sanity to our criminal 
justice system''. Those pleas fell on deaf ears.
<P>
	The Liberal majority on the justice committee decided that they 
did not care about their constituents. They were not really 
reflecting the views of their constituents or all the people across the 
country who want to repeal section 745. Instead they became 
voting machines again, trained seals.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	They were told what to do by the Prime Minister's office. They 
were reflecting a bleeding heart attitude to the criminal justice 
system which has caused Canadians to have disrespect for the laws 
of this country. Instead of truly representing their constituents and 
staying true to the votes they cast in this House of Commons, they 
decided to save the Minister of Justice some embarrassment.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice was listening to a bleeding heart 
minority in this country that believes convicted first degree killers 
should have the opportunity to be released after 15 years.
<P>
	Instead of responding to the wishes of Canadians, this 
government decided to respond to the wishes of convicted killers. 
This government decided to perpetuate the injustice in our criminal 
justice system by simply tinkering with section 745 of the Criminal 
Code. In so doing, the government not only exhibited an abysmal 
ignorance of the will of the Canadian public but it called into 
question the parliamentary system.
<P>
	The other night the Prime Minister said on television that he was 
a democrat. He said that he believed in democracy. But democracy 
spoke in this House in its purest form. Members of Parliament 
voted to repeal in principle section section 745 of the Criminal 
Code. Then what did this government do? It used the back door. It 
manipulated the process. It voted not to report the bill back to this 
House. What a shame and what a shameless act to circumvent the 
will of the majority, the will of this House.
<P>
	Thank goodness, Mr. Speaker, that you in your wisdom decided 
that was unjust and undemocratic. Now the opportunity rests with 
this House to bring that bill forward. Government members have 
the option to change their minds but they would have to reconcile 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7429"> 7429 </A></B>
<P>
the  votes they cast several years ago to repeal section 745 with 
their vote today.
<P>
	They cannot have it both ways. They cannot pretend on a vote to 
be committed to criminal law reform and the repeal of section 745 
and then acquiesce in this House like trained seals, like voting 
machines. Wake up and smell the coffee, my friends. The people of 
Canada want changes to the criminal justice system and they want 
them now. MPs either represents their constituents or they do not. 
They are either true representatives of the people or they are not.
<P>
	This is not the time to engage in partisan politics. This is the time 
to truly represent and bring meaningful changes to the criminal 
justice system, and here members of Parliament have that 
opportunity. When they go to seek a further mandate from their 
constituents they will have to explain to their constituents why they 
sat on their hands and allowed themselves to be manipulated by 
backroom boys in the Prime Minister's office when they had a 
choice. That is what they will have to reconcile.
<P>
	The repeal of section 745 and criminal law reform are matters 
that will put this government to the test in terms of its commitment 
and credibility. On many occasions over the past three years the 
Prime Minister has invited Canadians to judge his government by 
the red book. He waved that red book inside and outside of caucus. 
He said ``you judge us based on the red book''.
<P>
	Lest we forget, there is a major chapter in the red book on 
governing with integrity. That was the commitment the Prime 
Minister made on tape, on radio and television stations. Each 
member of Parliament, I included, went out to the people of 
Canada and said: ``Vote for us because we will provide honest 
government. We will govern with integrity. We promise you that 
we will not be like Brian Mulroney. We will not engage ourselves 
in duplicitous governance. We will govern honestly with you, for 
you in our government''.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	Their actions with respect to section 745 and my private 
member's bill would lead one to seriously question the credibility 
of this government and would challenge Canadians to reflect on the 
promise to govern with integrity. If they were truly governing with 
integrity and with honesty they would reflect the wishes of 
Canadians.
<P>
	This is not a frivolous matter for Canadians. This is a serious 
matter. They fear for the lives of their family and children. They 
want a balanced justice system. It is time government members 
woke up and realized what Canadians want.
<P>
	If they are true democrats in the true sense of the word, then they 
will stand and insist that the bill be brought back to this House and 
that this House once again pronounce itself. They will have the 
option either to vote for or against it.
<P>
	Dare they vote against the repeal of section 745, each and every 
one of their constituents will be made aware of that. The Canadian 
Police Association, as we speak, is asking every member of 
Parliament to indicate what they have done to contribute to the 
amelioration of the criminal justice system in this country. All 
members of Parliament should start thinking about what they have 
done personally, as a member of Parliament, not as part of a voting 
machine but as an individual member of Parliament, to improve the 
criminal justice system in this country. Yes, their constituents will 
judge them, based on the contributions they have made in 
improving the criminal justice system.
<P>
	I plead with those members of Parliament who have a genuine 
interest in criminal law reform to stand up for what they believe in 
for a change. Stand up for meaningful changes to the criminal 
justice system so that Canadians can stand proud of their elected 
representatives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to commend the hon. member for York 
South-Weston on a very eloquent speech. He hit the points just 
right this morning not only about the failure of the Liberal criminal 
justice system and the inadequate legislation which has been 
brought forward over the last three years but also, and perhaps just 
as important, the failure of the Liberal government to live up to its 
commitment to Canadians to restore integrity and credibility to the 
House of Commons and to the governance of Canada. Perhaps that 
is even more important because it strikes at the very heart of the 
problems that are inherent in the system of governance which 
exists in Canada today.
<P>
	I have travelled throughout my riding and across Canada and I 
know that what the hon. member for York South-Weston said was 
very true. Canadians are deeply concerned about the inadequacies 
of the justice system. They know that the legislation which has 
been brought forward over the past three years is totally inadequate 
in addressing the criminal problem which we have in Canada today.
<P>
	I commend the hon. member for York South-Weston for 
bringing forward this private member's bill. Had it been supported 
by the Liberal majority, it would have seen the repeal of section 
745. It is what Canadians want. It is what they are demanding. It is 
what they are crying out for. It is high time that those people over 
there started to listen to Canadians.
<P>
	One of the things I am asked as I travel around the country is 
what can we do as individual members of Parliament and what can 
Canadians do. Every day we see members of Parliament tabling 
petitions in the House. Those petitions are protests from average 
Canadians from coast to coast. They are crying out for justice, for 
change and for the reform of the system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7430"> 7430 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member for York South-Weston 
what is the next step. He and others have tried. I have tabled nine 
private members' bills in the House of Commons in three years, 
and seven motions, trying to move the government of the country 
which enjoys the majority in this House. I have tried to move it 
in the direction that I feel the majority of Canadians want it to 
move in.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	What can be done now that it has squashed the member's private 
member's bill? We know the majority of Canadians are crying out 
for that change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess when you are at 50 per cent 
in the polls you can afford to be smug and arrogant. However, as a 
journalist pointed out the other night, when the government is 
faced with honest questions from Canadians, it is like a bucket of 
cold water.
<P>
	The government, it appears, has been sailing along for the last 
three years assuming that re-election was a matter of course, 
assuming that the Canadian public would continue to support it 
regardless of its actions.
<P>
	Canadians are much smarter than that. History is full of 
politicians and political parties that have taken the public for 
granted. It is full of politicians and political parties that have 
become smug and arrogant.
<P>
	Many a political party has been leading substantially in public 
opinion in between elections. I have been through a lot of elections. 
I have seen a lot of politicians and leaders, David Peterson, Lyn 
McLeod, Brian Mulroney; the list goes on and on of people who 
had substantial support in the weeks and months and a year before 
an election.
<P>
	It is important that Canadians continue to speak out about their 
feelings about the criminal justice system. Quite frankly, I am 
shocked that people like Darlene Boyd, Debbie Mahaffy, Priscilla 
de Villiers and Donna French have not been able to move members 
of Parliament with respect to section 745 and criminal law reform.
<P>
	These are women, mothers who have lost children to murders, 
hideous, awful murders that have shocked the country. These are 
mothers who, in order to deal with their grief, have channelled their 
energies into trying to change the criminal justice system.
<P>
	There are members of Parliament who pretend to be 
sympathetic, who pretend to understand, who pretend to share their 
grief. However, when the time comes to be truly representative and 
to listen to these mothers who have lost children to murder, what 
happens? Members of Parliament turn a deaf ear.
<P>
	It is important for all Canadians right across the country to 
continue to speak out, to continue to challenge their politicians, call 
their members of  Parliament, tell them how they feel, tell them 
that they are not happy, tell them that unless there are meaningful 
changes to the criminal justice system, when they have the 
opportunity to vote they will take that matter into consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was in my office and I 
could not help but rush down here to participate in this debate on 
the motion. I would like to put the facts straight.
<P>
	The only difference between their proposition and our 
proposition is on the fundamental debate of whether 745 should be 
repealed.
<P>
	The government members believe that the measures the Minister 
of Justice put forth are sound measures. Let me remind the hon. 
members that if we had repealed 745, like the member from York 
South-Weston wants, like the Reform Party wants, it would not 
have prevented the likes of Olson that the member hides behind 
today from applying for early review.
<P>
	Let me state also that repealing 745 will not-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> I thought you said you 
were going to put the facts forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> As I said, the likes of serial killers like Mr. 
Olson and others would have fallen under the previous legislation. 
Instead, the legislation said that the government would repeal 
section 745 for multiple serial killers. They will not be able to 
apply.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	In addition, in order to condemn a criminal in our society, only 
one jurist need object and the person is then innocent. That was 
changed. In order to apply for early parole eligibility the jurists 
must be unanimous, 13 out of 13. It seems to me that if 13 jurists 
agree that this person should apply for early parole, and again I 
stress, apply, for eligibility. It does not mean that they will get it.
<P>
	Only the most naive politician would believe that Clifford Olson 
would ever get early parole. I am appalled to hear the Reform Party 
and other members hide behind Mr. Olson to promote their own 
political agenda. If that party had voted with the government in the 
spring, Clifford Olson would not even be able to apply. That is what 
the debate is about. Shame on those members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am frankly surprised that the 
parliamentary secretary would continue to be dishonest about the 
true facts. The fact is, had the government acted-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. I think the hon. 
member for York South-Weston, an experienced member, knows 
that it would be quite improper to suggest that any hon. member is 
dishonest. I would ask him to consider his words very carefully 
and, in fact,  withdraw the words he used in suggesting that the 
parliamentary secretary is dishonest.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7431"> 7431 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I unequivocally withdraw that. 
However, I would like to add that it is an unequivocal misstatement 
of fact to suggest that Clifford Olson would not have been able to 
apply for parole. If the government repealed section 745 when my 
private member's bill was before Parliament, he would not have 
had the opportunity to apply.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that Clifford Olson would ever be released 
prematurely. I am objecting to the fact this law gives him the right 
to drag the families of victims through the criminal justice system 
again after serving only 15 years. That is the injustice of section 
745.
<P>
	I conclude with this. Eighty per cent of those who apply are 
successful. Is that the result the government wants, to prematurely 
release convicted killers?

<P>
	The petitioners ask that reading not be taxed. They state that the 
application of the 7 per cent GST to reading material is unfair and 
wrong. Therefore, they urge all levels of government to 
demonstrate their commitment to education and literacy by 
eliminating the sales tax on reading materials.

	The petitioners point out that the national AIDS strategy, phase

access to grandchildren. The petitioners ask that the Divorce Act be 
amended so that in no case may a father or mother without serious 
cause place obstacles between the child and grandparents. For the 
sake of brevity I will not read the whole thing.

that the percentage of Canadians over age 65 will almost double 
over the next 40 years from 12 per cent today to 23 per cent by the

	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> The next 
petition, Mr. Speaker, deals with the fact that police and firefighters 
are required to place their lives at risk in the execution of their 
duties on a daily basis, but the employment benefits of police and 
firefighters offer insufficient compensation to the families of those 
who are killed while on duty.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore call on Parliament to establish a fund 
known as the public safety officers compensation fund for the 
benefit of families of public safety officers killed in the line of 
duty.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JUSTICE">JUSTICE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
final petition deals with the fact that although Canada's crime rate 
fell again in 1995, its fourth annual drop following 30 years of 
almost constant increase, the petitioners call on Parliament to 
continue to take a tough line on crime and enact laws that will 
provide Canadians with the safe home and safe streets they so 
rightly deserve.

	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask 
that all questions be allowed to stand.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know you are aware that I have 
Question No. 9 on the Order Paper. It has been on the Order Paper 
since February 28 of this year. Prior to that the same question was 
on the Order Paper in the first session of this Parliament.
<P>
	The question simply states: ``What is the total dollar amount 
spent on advertising by the government and its crown agencies in 
fiscal years 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994 by province in each of the 
following mediums: television, radio, daily newspapers, weekly 
newspapers, monthly newspapers, billboards and direct mail?''
<P>
	What I am trying to find out is if the federal departments can be 
accountable for how they spend their advertising dollars. Certainly 
they should be.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will probably recall this because at one time 
you were the parliamentary secretary to the House leader and I 
raised this issue with you many moons ago. You assured me that all 
but four departments had done their work, had presented the 
information and that the information would be forthcoming. I have 
since talked to your successor and he assured me that all the 
information had been gathered and it was just a matter of putting it 
in a report and that I should have it shortly.
<P>
	I keep talking privately with the government House leader's 
office. I have not received an answer to my question. Lately I have 
had no assurance that it would be answered at all.
<P>
	I am very confused by the mixed messages I am getting from the 
government House leader's office, and particularly his 
parliamentary secretary. Perhaps because his last name starts with 
Z he is the last one to know what is going on. However, I am getting 
tired of waiting.

says that the last shall be first. I am sure an assurance was 
previously given but I reassure my hon. colleague that we are 
working on his request.
<P>
	It is somewhat simplistic to presume that asking for information 
on four years of work literally involving hundreds and hundreds of 
groups and agencies within the Government of Canada is just a 
matter of pressing a button. It is important for the hon. member to 
remember that civil servants are spending their good time doing 
other important work for the people of Canada. While this matter is 
urgent in his mind, the reality is that it is not forthcoming with the 
same due speed he would wish.
<P>
	I know he is a patient man and we hope to have the answer before 
Christmas.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Everyone knows the hon. 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster is, as the parliamentary 
secretary says, a patient man.

Christmas we are talking about.

	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I assure my hon. colleague that we are 
hoping it will be a Christmas in the future.

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-60, an act to 
establish the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and to repeal and 
amend other Acts as a consequence, as reported by the committee 
with amendments, and of Motions Nos. 1, 13, 22 and 23.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
you have done such a nice job of reading the amendments, which 
we introduced this morning with the help of my colleague, the 
member for Lotbinière, and since you have grouped the motions, 
including Motions No. 1, 13, 22 and 23, in Group 3, you will note 
that they refer essentially to the federal government's intention of 
interfering in an area of provincial jurisdiction. Naturally, we must 
condemn this vigorously throughout this 35th Parliament, since 
this government takes advantage of its vast spending authority to 
blunder into areas of jurisdiction that, in many cases, are strictly 
the preserve of the provinces.
<P>
	I am pleased to lead off the debate at report stage of Bill C-60. 
Through this legislative measure, the federal government is getting 
ready to create the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
<P>
	The basic responsibility of this new parapublic agency will be to 
set standards for the safety, quality and manufacture of Canadian 
food products, as well as to develop minimum standards for 
imported products. This is obviously a very weighty responsibility 
for the government, and I am not in any way questioning the good 
intentions of the departments involved or their concern for public 
health.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	However, I would like to remind the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and the cabinet generally that their policies are hardly 
original.
<P>
	I would point out that Quebec has had unified food inspection 
services for close to 20 years, yes, a 20-year head start on Canada. 
The federal government has wasted 20 years meddling in 
provincial jurisdictions in an attempt to get a glimpse of what they 
were up to so that it could then turn around and adopt the same 
strategies.
<P>
	In terms of results, it would be hard to think of a worse approach, 
but then this is typical of this country: going over old ground, 
rewriting existing legislation, and changing the commas in order to 
be able to call it something new. Finally, let us return to the initial 
point of my speech, instead of launching into a stinging criticism of 
the state of this over-bureaucratized country.
<P>
	As I was saying before, the purpose of Bill C-60 is to establish 
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Although this agency comes 
under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, it will consolidate the inspection services of two other 
major departments: Health and Fisheries. This leads me to believe 
that the federal government has studied the Quebec model 
thoroughly, for the bill provides for essentially the same bodies as 
in the Quebec government's system.
<P>
	But the worst is yet to come. In its bill, the government calls for 
the agency, once created, to take precedence over all other food 
inspection systems. I find this federal attitude more than a little 
insolent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7437"> 7437 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of the minister and his cabinet 
colleagues to a concept that is very simple, but ever so hard for 
the federalists to grasp: interference. This is a gift possessed by 
certain categories of people, particularly those elected members 
who belong to a federalist party, to duplicate, and even to deny 
the existence of, Quebec's distinctiveness in administrative and 
other matters.
<P>
	Parliamentary rules prevent me from naming these individuals 
who are such past masters of the art of denying Quebec its 
fundamental right to affirm its identity and its distinctiveness. I 
cannot name names, but I can assure you that there are so many of 
them in this House, that they take up more than one side of it.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois believe that the government is 
showing its arrogance toward Quebec and the other provinces by 
attempting, in the preamble of this bill, to assume a certain 
legitimate right over provincial activities.
<P>
	In this connection, our amendment is aimed at limiting the 
impact of such an element, which would have the effect of 
dismissing all of Quebec's demands in one fell swoop. For decades, 
the provinces, Quebec in particular, have been objecting to the 
federal government's attempts to restrict some of the provinces' 
vested powers, and even to grab up those powers, without any 
consideration of the provinces' constitutional jurisdiction in these 
spheres of activity.
<P>
	The federal government is increasingly moving to centralize 
powers, while continuing to claim that it is doing the contrary, in 
order to downplay its illegitimate actions. Such cavalier 
interference into areas of provincial jurisdiction cannot help but 
slow down the constructive discourse that could be initiated 
between the provinces and the federal government. The Liberal 
Party, with its eye on the next election, is in the process of 
undermining the credibility of the agency in question. According to 
Liberal logic, the agency could control all food inspection services 
in the country by developing national standards. To us this is 
unacceptable, because it considerably restricts the ability of the 
provinces to establish and administer their own set of standards.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	The provinces would otherwise be free to decide whether or not 
they wished to go along with certain food safety standards that are 
more a matter of local custom than public health. Perhaps I may 
recall what happened last spring, when the Bloc Quebecois 
protested against the decision of the Minister of Health to prohibit 
and indeed ban consumption of raw milk cheese.
<P>
	You will recall that Quebec is by far the biggest consumer of this 
kind of cheese. In the other provinces where this kind of cheese is 
eaten, consumers are mostly former Quebecers or people who have 
been to Quebec and who appreciate this type of cheese. This is one  
example of eating habits in Quebec that are different from those in 
other parts of Canada.
<P>
	At the Department of Health, people were thinking about all this, 
and probably because they had nothing else to do and had to justify 
their pay cheque, they said: ``From now on, no more raw milk 
cheese will be imported or manufactured; cheese will have to be 
made with pasteurized milk''. Of course there was a howl of protest 
from the official opposition, supported by consumers. I remember 
that someone put a question about this to the Minister of Labour, 
whose roots are Italian. I cannot refer to him by name, but he is a 
fellow citizen, formerly from Italy. When he saw he would no 
longer be able to get his favourite cheese, he said: ``Oh dear, I will 
have to talk about this to my minister, because she is making a 
serious mistake''. See, that is a good example.
<P>
	In the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area, they make a kind of 
tourtière called cipâte, made with partridge and hare. It is a local 
specialty. Tomorrow morning, an inspector with the new agency 
might say: ``Cipâte is no good; it might be dangerous to the health 
of the people of Lac-Saint-Jean. So there will be a nation-wide ban 
on making tourtières with hare and partridge''.
<P>
	I realize you are going to say I am exaggerating. Eighteen 
months ago, who would have thought that a few senior officials at 
the Department of health would consider banning the consumption 
of the best cheese in Canada? But it happened.
<P>
	Without the media coverage, the government would never have 
backed down under pressure from the Bloc Quebecois. Not that the 
Bloc was incapable of doing a good job as the official opposition, 
but because the government, although this is a constitutional 
monarchy, often behaves like an autocratic and totalitarian 
government. It prefers to ignore the public interest and support the 
interests of the major lobby groups, while maintaining an illusion 
of power based on order and the public good.
<P>
	In concluding, Bill C-60 is an important bill that will affect three 
departments. We in the Bloc Quebecois found a number of weak 
points in Bill C-60.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	We intend to introduce more than 35 amendments in the course 
of the day, and my colleagues and I will do everything we can to try 
and make the Liberal majority think twice. I know that several 
people on the government benches think our amendments are very 
constructive and could improve the bill considerably. The purpose 
of the first group of amendments is simply to prevent the federal 
government from infringing on provincial jurisdictions.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are at the report stage of Bill C-60. My colleague 
from the Bloc Quebecois has proposed a large number of 
amendments.
<P>
	This bill went to committee prior to second reading, and the 
purpose of a bill's going to a standing committee of the House of 
Commons before coming to this House for approval in principle is 
to allow the committee more opportunity to make amendments and 
reshape the bill in the most effective and useful manner after 
hearing witnesses and government officials give reason for the bill 
and what should be in it and what should be changed from the 
initial bill tabled.
<P>
	Reform tried to use this opportunity to introduce several 
amendments at committee stage. In fact, 25 Reform amendments 
were proposed in committee during the clause by clause 
consideration of the bill after we had heard from a number of 
witnesses.
<P>
	Because we have introduced our amendments at committee stage 
we of course are unable to reintroduce the same amendments at 
report stage. Therefore we have not introduced amendments at this 
point because we sensed a wall of resistance by the government to 
any proposals we would make.
<P>
	The rationale behind the majority of our amendments to this bill 
was simply to make the new single food inspection agency more 
accountable to Parliament. I have noticed that some of the 
amendments proposed by my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois 
move in that same direction, but often in a slightly different vein 
than those amendments we proposed. Even in committee my 
colleagues from the Bloc and Reformers often voted together on 
issues where we could make the food inspection agency more 
accountable to the Parliament of Canada and not just leave it as an 
option that the committee at the wishes of the government could 
look into the effectiveness of this new agency, but in fact that it 
must review the effectiveness of the agency and that the agency 
must be more accountable to this institution.
<P>
	Over the years Parliament has less knowledge and less control 
over what is happening in the vast bureaucracy, the new agencies 
that have been constructed by governments. We feel that the trend 
needs to be reversed.
<P>
	While the government members of the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food could at any time review anything, we 
all know that because the committee has a majority of government 
members, the committee need not review anything if the 
government does not wish it to.
<P>
	We are trying to reverse that trend so that government will be 
seen to be more accountable and will indeed be more accountable.
<P>
	The new food inspection agency begins its operation under this 
legislation in 1997. It will become one of Ottawa's largest 
bureaucratic entities, with 4,500 employees and a budget of $300 
million. We are not talking small potatoes here at all.
<P>
	Federal officials contend that ending interdepartmental overlap 
and duplication in such areas as enforcement, risk management, 
laboratory services, informatic systems and communications will 
save taxpayers $44 million annually starting in 1998-99. But 
surprisingly, no detailed breakdown is available to back up this 
estimate.
<P>
	When we ask questions about where exactly is the $44 million 
going to be saved, departmental officials did not know where that 
was. They really had not arrived at that stage yet. It was just a 
figure they seemed to have pulled out of the air and expected the 
savings to be realized.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	We are very concerned about this new federal food inspection 
agency not because we think it is a bad idea but because we see 
examples of previous experiments along this line and what has 
happened. The most obvious one is the Pest Management 
Regulatory Agency, which was created to be accountable and 
responsible to the department of agriculture. However, it has run 
amok and has no confidence by and from the industry. This was 
revealed the other day in our committee when several people from 
the industry appeared on the issue of cost recovery. The prime 
example they put forward as an illustration of the failures of cost 
recovery was the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, which was 
designed very much along the same lines as this agency.
<P>
	Therefore, members will understand why we are concerned that 
this agency be held more accountable to Parliament and to the 
committee that reviews the effectiveness and the work of the 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	As I said, 25 Reform amendments were put forward in 
committee and only two were accepted, one being a clarification of 
which minister was responsible for the federal good inspection 
agency. There was some concern because the minister of 
agriculture was not put in the original document and in fact the 
government may be intending to do away with the department of 
agriculture. Therefore we insisted that amendment be included.
<P>
	The other amendment that was accepted was in the preface of the 
document. It merely indicated that part of the mission statement of 
this new agency was to be cost effective. I am very pleased that was 
put in the preface of the legislation. Unfortunately, when we tried 
to give it some teeth by putting forward amendments in the actual 
clauses of the bill that would ensure its cost effectiveness, the 
government put up a wall of resistance and refused to accept every 
and any amendment we put forward.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7439"> 7439 </A></B>
<P>
	We think that actually more than $44 million could be saved 
if the government knew what it was doing and had a responsible 
plan in place and had actually thought this thing through more than 
picking a number of $44 million out of the air.
<P>
	With regard to my amendments put forward by this grouping by 
the Bloc, Motion No. 1 is an amendment that would require the 
government to respect the legislative authority of the provinces but 
it does not deal with much else. This may be considered symbolic 
but we think it looks like a motion that could be supported because 
we certainly do recognize that in some areas the provinces do have 
authority.
<P>
	With regard to Motions. Nos. 13, 22 and 23, we do have some 
concerns, particularly on Motion No. 13. While consultation with 
the provinces is to be applauded and we support it, the fact that 
each province's approval is required to establish standards does 
cause us concern that we may see some trade barriers developing 
between the provinces, above and beyond what we already have, 
using standards as a way to protect one's own provincial area of the 
industry at the expense of a neighbouring province. Of course that 
is not the way to unify the country. We really do have some 
concerns about Motions Nos. 13 and 22.
<P>
	Motion No. 23 is another amendment with respect to the 
jurisdiction of the provinces. We support their jurisdiction but are 
not sure that this particular jurisdiction needs to be entrenched at 
this point in the act.
<P>
	I think I will have more opportunities to speak to this bill as we 
progress through the various groupings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
absolutely no question that the federal government gives a great 
deal of consideration to the jurisdiction of the provinces and 
believes that the jurisdiction of the provinces is the provincial 
responsibility. We also believe very strongly in the process of 
consultation with the provinces and with all the stakeholders in the 
industry. There is no question that is important.
<P>
	As well, this government has certainly set forward the 
committee's ability to deal with all issues and all matters that come 
to its concern that it wishes to further explore. A committee 
certainly has the ability to deal with issues such as PMRA, 
provincial-federal agreements and any other issue that comes 
forward.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	There is no way that this government wishes to infringe upon the 
provincial ability. However, we feel that the amendments which are 
being put forward at present are really not needed within the bill. 
This government has and will continue to respect the jurisdictional 
legislative authority of the provinces. Indeed, clauses 14, 20 and 21 
of Bill C-60 significantly enhance the ability of the federal 
government to collaborate with the provinces while fully 
respecting the provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	With respect to entering into agreements with the provinces, 
such federal-provincial corporations may be involved with matters 
of potential financial liability. These arrangements will have to be 
reviewed by the finance minister.
<P>
	Clearly, the government will enter into agreements only which 
explicitly allow provincial agreement by the provinces. In other 
words, we are not going to enter into an agreement with the 
province and say the federal side wants this, but the province has 
no say. An agreement is an agreement; it is an agreement between 
two parties. As a result, the federal government and the provincial 
governments will agree before a document is signed.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Government of Canada will continue to respect 
the jurisdictional level of all governments. I should note with 
respect to the roles and responsibilities of the Minister of Health 
that the intent of clause 11(4) is to clarify and not alter the role of 
the Minister of Health in establishing food safety standards. The 
current process of establishing food health and safety standards 
already provides for consultations with stakeholders and includes 
the provinces.
<P>
	The federal jurisdiction includes setting food safety standards 
for all Canadians under the Food and Drugs Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the last time I 
spoke in this House on the bill establishing the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency, I spoke of reducing costly overlap and 
advocated harmonizing and simplifying standards so as to reduce 
the burden of regulatory requirements and promote competition in 
business.
<P>
	I concluded my argument by saying that the focus had to be on 
co-operation between partners and respect for legislative 
jurisdictions. I even invited my colleagues to reread sections 91 to 
95 of the Constitution Act, 1867, which apparently they did not do.
<P>
	The Province of Quebec combined its food inspection activities 
in 1978. Now it is the federal government's turn, and it is proposing 
the same thing. It wants to harmonize. That is all very well, but 
there is no need to upset the established order. The rules must be 
obeyed.
<P>
	I want to direct your attention to the lack of compliance with the 
Constitution and the lack of respect for our partners, the provinces 
and the employees. The present government finally decided, in 
1996, to standardize food inspection.
<P>
	In his latest budget, the Minister of Finance announced his 
financial game plan for this new agency. I would remind you that 
that was on March 6. Here we are, a few days away from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7440"> 7440 </A></B>
<P>
Christmas, and the federal government is pushing members of 
Parliament to pass their bill.
<P>
	And I mean their bill, because there was no serious consultation. 
Although the briefs submitted to the Commons Standing 
Committee on Agriculture contained some very sound remarks, 
they remained on the shelf like dead ducks, in my opinion. The 
government apparently did not take them into consideration, 
because it continues to propose the same bill at the various stages 
of the process, with very few amendments.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	In my first speech, I denounced the fact that, as presented by the 
government, this agency might become a real patronage haven, and 
this is an understatement. The Liberals want to use the new 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency to reward their friends. At first, 
it will have only a few members like the president and board 
members. But two years later, the agency having moved and the 
employees having lost their permanent status, new appointments 
will be made. Who knows what the future holds. There might be a 
few Liberal candidates here and there who will have bitten the dust 
in the election.
<P>
	Subtlety is not our Liberal friends' strong suit. It is obvious that, 
through this bill and clause 5, the minister is trying to give himself 
the power to appoint the president and the executive vice-president. 
The odds are he will probably designate a friend or an old 
classmate, as is so often the case.
<P>
	Then, under clause 10, the minister wants to appoint an advisory 
board of 12 members. Have you ever seen a cowboy movie with 
only one bandit? There is always a gang, is there not?
<P>
	Also, the minister will choose individuals who share his vision. 
Like-minded people do business together, belong to the same party, 
help one another. Unfortunately, the Liberal fraternity is still very 
well represented in this House.
<P>
	Worse yet, under section 22, the minister will approve the 
agency's corporate or five-year business plan. Can we let that 
happen? It is understandable, under the circumstances, that the 
minister wants to retain a degree of flexibility just in case. If that is 
not remote control, it certainly is acute interference. The 
government is trying to control the agency and turn it into a club 
for its friends.
<P>
	Under clause 11(4), the Chrétien government, through its health 
minister, will be able to establish policies and standards relating to 
the safety and nutritional quality of food. That is exclusively the 
prerogative of the provinces. As in the case of raw milk cheese, the 
government is interfering in something that does not concern it.
<P>
	All this is far from reassuring in terms of our government's 
transparency. Some will say there is nothing new under the sun, and 
they will be partly right, as far as this government is concerned. As 
you know, I am a straight talker and I like to see people get their 
due.
<P>
	I often say that we have to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. 
However, in the case before us today, Quebec could end up 
indirectly subsidizing the inspection services of other provinces, 
under clauses 20 and 21, which provide for the establishment of 
federal-provincial corporations. There is a real possibility that 
Quebec could end up paying for this. Looking at how the federal 
government deals with the other provinces-and I am thinking of 
the GST harmonization process-you realize that ``la belle 
province'' is heavily penalized.
<P>
	The Bloc proposed many reasonable amendments, to make sure 
the agency is immune to discrimination and patronage, so it cannot 
be misused by the Liberal government. But the Liberals refuse to 
make the necessary changes, because these changes would 
adversely affect their plans. The fact is that the agency will become 
a real haven of patronage.
<P>
	The Liberals are in a bit of a hurry to pass certain bills before 
Christmas. This is not good.
<P>
	There is something suspicious. Given what the Liberals are 
trying to do with this legislation, nothing should surprise us any 
more. It is easy to figure out that the Liberal government is trying 
to score political points, to win votes, with this bill. An election 
will be called in the spring. That is why the government is in such a 
hurry.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois have proposed amendments designed 
to protect our fellow citizens. We want transparency. We believe 
the House of Commons committee should monitor or be otherwise 
involved in the process.
<P>
	The bill, as presented by the Liberals, is a step backward, not 
forward.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	This government did nothing to promote debate. I am talking 
about a meaningful public debate on the quality of Canadian and 
imported foods.
<P>
	What type and level of services are we going to provide in order 
to protect our fellow citizens? Would you believe the government 
restricted consultations with the producers, provinces and unions 
concerned. Members of this House are the only ones left to block 
this legislation. Any hope for transparency in the establishment of 
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency now depends on the will of 
the members of this House to vote according to their conscience 
and for what is reasonable.
<P>
	I am thinking of the bill to create this agency, because it is 
necessary and it is important. But it should be amended to 
eliminate the possibility of patronage appointments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7441"> 7441 </A></B>
<P>
	Furthermore, are they afraid to hold a serious debate on the 
quality of our services? One could think so, given the fleetingness 
of the consultation. There was no consultation, because the 
Liberals are in a hurry to ram their bills through.
<P>
	In conclusion, the government is locating the agency in the 
National Capital Region, but for how long? Here again, we must be 
vigilant, for they could be tempted to move the head office around, 
depending on where they want to score political points. That is 
their long term escape plan. This will be a blow to many honest 
employees in the National Capital Region. Their rights will be 
disregarded.
<P>
	The Liberals are masters of patronage and political intrigue. In 
all sincerity, I must oppose the government's Bill C-60. I urge my 
colleagues to vote against it.
<P>
	In addition, I urge Liberal members to vote freely and join us in 
rejecting this bill. In the past, a member of this House stated, not 
without attracting attention, that patronage was a political fact of 
life. I, for one, say that we must stand up and condemn this manner 
of operating. If bills leave the way open to patronage, they should 
be rejected.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member, but his time is up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the report stage amendments to Bill C-60, the 
legislation which will put in place the federal food inspection 
agency. I will be making presentations as we go through these 
groups of motions but I will only speak to Motions Nos. 1 and 13 
from group 3.
<P>
	First, I support the amendment in group 1. It could be considered 
to be a symbolic amendment which asks the federal government to 
respect the legislative authority of the provinces with regard to this 
legislation. It is important, it is not strictly symbolic and it deserves 
to be supported.
<P>
	This amendment deals with process. I would like to quote from a 
brief presented by the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, 
probably Canada's largest organization representing farmers across 
the country. The brief was given to the committee dealing with Bill 
C-60. I will read a couple of paragraphs from it. I think it should be 
entered in <I>Hansard</I>. I support most of what is presented by the 
Canadian Federation of Agriculture in these two paragraphs.
<P>
	It talks about the process although in part the process that has led 
up to this legislation being where it is right now.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	``The intention to streamline efforts to save costs and create a 
more efficient system is one which CFA has supported from the 
outset. The consultation process concerning the structure of the 
new streamlined entity was good as far as it went.
<P>
	``One of the major failings from an industry point of view, even 
now as the legislation works its way through Parliament, is a real 
business plan with costs and realistic revenue projections that can 
be shared with those who are effectively the shareholders. As cost 
recovery systems become part of business life, government must 
realize that, as in any other business, those who pay call the tune. 
When industry is forced to pay user fees it considers itself not just a 
stakeholder, but a shareholder''.
<P>
	I have just one more paragraph from the brief presented by the 
Canadian Federation of Agriculture to the agriculture committee.
<P>
	``From this point of view, it is somewhat difficult to comment on 
the legislation Bill C-60. As are most other pieces of new 
legislation, it is enabling legislation. Most of the detail will be in 
the regulations which we do not have to review. We also do not 
have a clear understanding of the financing of the agency. 
Statements such as: `There will be no new cost recovery fees for 
the first year of operation, April 1997 to March 31, 1998', when the 
industry knows that a new battery of fees will be imposed on April 
1, 1997, create at best a level of scepticism, at worst, a level of 
distrust. The fact that the legislation creates a single stand alone 
food inspection agency with no clear accountability to shareholders 
gives us pause. What are we being asked to comment on?''
<P>
	The closing question is what are they being asked to comment 
on? That is so true. With this legislation, as with so much other 
legislation that is presented to the House, it has a very broad scope, 
without enough detail, not enough clear guidance and restriction. It 
implements an institution and a policy which is uncertain at best. 
That is what the Canadian Federation of Agriculture is saying. It is 
also a big concern to me.
<P>
	The devil is in the details. The regulations will not be debated 
and passed in the House either at committee or right here on the 
floor. The Canadian Federation of Agriculture is very upset about it 
and so am I. It has presented its case very well on this new agency. 
It does not approve of the process.
<P>
	I support Motion No. 1 dealing with another part of the process, 
asking for the approval of the provinces in regard to this 
legislation.
<P>
	The second motion from this grouping I would like to speak on is 
Motion No. 13. I oppose this amendment.
<P>
	The amendment requires the minister to establish policy 
standards in consultation with the provinces. I approve of that part 
of the amendment. Of course there should be consultation with the 
provinces. There should be approval from the provinces. However, 
the amendment requires the approval of each province.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	Of all governments, this government should know how difficult 
it is to get unanimous consent of the provinces on an issue such 
as this. To its credit, the government took the initiative to put in 
place the agreement on internal trade. It is an agreement which 
required the unanimous consent of the provinces to remove some 
of the trade barriers between the provinces that have been put in 
place over the last 130 years.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately many sections of the agreement on internal trade 
are blank because the government could not get the unanimous 
agreement of the provinces. Even the completed sections are not 
being honoured. It is almost impossible to do anything about an 
infringement or failure to honour the agreement because it requires 
unanimous consent of all provinces. It does not work. This 
amendment calls for unanimous consent of the provinces but it is 
highly unlikely that any major change like this would ever pass.
<P>
	With regard to the agreement on internal trade, I propose-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Could the hon. 
member conclude his remarks in the next few seconds, please?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, I thought I had only spoken for 
five minutes. I guess our watches are not synchronized.
<P>
	In closing, since we cannot get unanimous consent in regard to 
the agreement on internal trade, other Reformers and I have 
proposed that instead of a requirement for unanimous consent there 
should be a requirement for the approval of at least two-thirds of 
the provinces which would include at least 50 per cent of the 
population, the double majority. This is just an example. I am not 
saying exactly what should be done here.
<P>
	I would probably support that kind of formula in this 
amendment. But it is not there so I do not support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak once again to Bill C-60, an act to establish the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency and to repeal and amend other 
Acts as a consequence.
<P>
	As I have said before in this House, the need for a federal food 
inspection agency comes from pressure exerted by municipal and 
provincial governments, the agricultural sector, fisheries and even 
consumers.
<P>
	The setting up of a single food inspection authority was therefore 
awaited anxiously, but not at any price and particularly not under 
just any conditions.
<P>
	When Bill C-60 was examined in committee, and in this House, 
the Bloc Quebecois presented numerous amendments, which we 
are to debate today. The reason for so doing is simple: the bill, as 
presented, is deficient  in a number of areas. It has, therefore, been 
necessary to improve it, primarily in order to reassure the 
agriculture and agri-food sector, and especially to ensure that the 
federal government respects provincial jurisdiction over food 
inspections.
<P>
	I would, therefore, like to explain to my colleagues on the 
government side the reasons why the amendments presented by the 
Bloc Quebecois are necessary, useful, unavoidable even, if we do 
not wish to see the Canadian Food Inspection Agency become 
another den of patronage and source of conflict between the 
provinces and agricultural industry representatives.
<P>
	I will, therefore, explain why it is vital for the government to 
accept, and vote in favour of, the amendments we are debating 
today. The situation is as follows: the initial block of amendments 
address the appointment of future directors of the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency.
<P>
	Bill C-60, as tabled by the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, offers no guarantee of the competency and expertise of 
those who will be selected as president and vice-president of the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
<P>
	We believe it is vital for the bill to be amended so as to ensure 
that the person directing the agency is not selected for his political 
allegiance to the party in power, but rather for his real abilities in 
the area of food inspection. These appointments must, of course, 
take place after the provinces and organizations representing 
agricultural interests have submitted to the advisory committee the 
names of candidates for those positions.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Since this is about the quality of decision making in the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the government can hardly 
refuse to support amendments in this respect. Common sense and a 
desire to avoid wasting public funds should be more important than 
the government's partisan interests. This is a matter of fairness and 
common sense.
<P>
	The second group of amendments refers to the powers of the 
advisory board, which board shall advise the minister of agriculture 
on the mandate of the agency. The Bloc Quebecois wants to make 
sure that the minister obtains from the advisory board all the data, 
opinions and expertise he needs to make informed decisions.
<P>
	To be able to do so, the board must be given broader powers. 
That is why we suggest that Bill C-60 give the advisory board the 
authority to speak out on all matters it deems relevant to food 
inspection.
<P>
	The amendments we are proposing will give the advisory board 
the authority to answer all questions and speak out on all issues 
submitted to it by the inspection industry, the provinces and the 
representatives of its employees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7443"> 7443 </A></B>
<P>
	We also want the advisory board to be able to give its opinion 
on inspection service rates, facilities, products and the rights of 
the agency. The purpose of these amendments is to let the advisory 
board take a position on the real issues at stake in food inspection. 
We do not want a puppet advisory board at the beck and call of 
the responsible minister.
<P>
	That having been said, the membership of the advisory board 
will also have to be changed. The amendment we are proposing 
would add one representative of the union or unions present in the 
agency. We think it is necessary to include agency employees in the 
board's consulting process if we want to keep abreast of what is 
really happening out there in the food inspection sector.
<P>
	I believe that the quality of the services offered by the agency 
will be better protected if the advisory board is given a real 
mandate that allows it to speak out on the real issues.
<P>
	The third group of amendments deals with the status of the 
agency and its employees and the powers of the responsible 
minister and the auditor general. In my opinion, he should be able 
to consult all members of the industry he considers representative 
and the provincial governments before drafting his report. This is 
not currently the case.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc is presenting an amendment to require the 
auditor general to consult these people and organizations so they 
may express their opinions and recommendations on the agency's 
operation. The aim is to ensure that provincial governments, the 
public and the users of the agency's services may comment on 
ways to improve the services, thus requiring the auditor general to 
take them into account in his report.
<P>
	As regards the status of the agency and its staff, we believe it 
would be dangerous to make the agency a separate employer under 
the terms of the Public Service Staff Relations Act. The intent of 
our amendment is to avoid describing the agency as a separate 
employer in order to preserve the vested rights of employees 
assigned to the agency.
<P>
	Furthermore, we want to enable those who currently represent 
unionized employees affected by the agency's creation to continue 
to negotiate the assignment of jobs and positions within the agency 
and all matters pertaining to personnel management.
<P>
	The aim here is to protect the rights of employees to ensure that, 
after the two year transition period provided in the legislation, they 
continue to enjoy the benefits of the Public Service Employment 
Act. Otherwise, the situation would be unacceptable.
<P>
	Finally, we note that the powers accorded the minister are 
watered down and at times vague with respect to agreements with 
the provinces on food inspection. Under our amendment, these 
agreements would be signed by the minister responsible and the 
provinces without the need for approval by the governor in council.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Our amendment changes the rule so that the minister responsible 
for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency alone is accountable for 
decisions involving the agency.
<P>
	This leads me to my conclusion that the minister of agriculture 
and his government should not be reluctant to implement the 
amendments we are debating in this House, because they are based 
on logic and common sense. I would like to think they will apply 
good judgement when it comes to time to vote on them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to rise and 
address the concerns that I have regarding Bill C-60. I am 
interested in what the members of the Bloc had to say. I share their 
concern that the power to investigate and the power to know 
exactly what is going on is of utmost urgency.
<P>
	I understand that the stated purpose of this act is to establish the 
Canadian food inspection agency in order to consolidate and 
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of federal inspection 
services related to food, animal and plant health and to increase 
collaboration with provincial governments in this area.
<P>
	I am concerned, the same as the Bloc is, that this power deals 
with food inspection, including risk management. It is very 
important that we look at risk management and the power again to 
look and investigate. I would be very interested in knowing exactly 
what direction we are taking when we speak of enhancing the 
efficiency and effectiveness of federal inspection services.
<P>
	Since they relate to food, animal and plant health, are we talking 
about food, animal and plant health as we know and recognize it 
now in its natural part in our society or are we talking about food, 
animal and plant health that has DNA changes to it? This is not 
very clear.
<P>
	If this new act sets out the new agency's framework in terms of 
responsibilities, accountability and organization, exactly who is the 
new agency working for? Who is it responsible to? Who is it to be 
accountable to? I am sure we would all hope it is the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	Because of the fast moving changes already occurring in our 
food chain with plants and animals, should there not be a control 
factor somewhere in the agency's framework?
<P>
	When this new Canadian food agency begins operation in 1997, 
it will become one of Ottawa's largest bureaucratic entities, with 
4,500 employees and a budget of $300 million.
<P>
	Federal officials contend that ending interdepartmental overlap 
and duplication in such areas as enforcement, risk management, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7444"> 7444 </A></B>
<P>
laboratory services, information systems and communications will 
save taxpayers $44 million annually starting 1998-99.
<P>
	Of course we have nothing yet to substantiate these claims but 
certainly duplication is a problem and anything we can do to cut 
that down is of benefit to all of us. I am sure most of us are aware of 
the massive costs at this time to the taxpayer when federal and 
provincial governments duplicate their services, not to mention the 
lack of efficiency and effectiveness as a result of this duplicity.
<P>
	I recently read an article in <I>Reader's Digest</I> written by Premier 
McKenna of New Brunswick, a Liberal premier, who speaks of the 
terrible costs in duplication of government services. He speaks of 
the cost as high as $5 billion a year.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports downsizing and consolidating the 
operations of the federal government, but I fear this act will 
accomplish little except to shuffle names and titles. This act will 
also continue to decentralize authority for food inspection in the 
hands of the federal government.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes the government should acknowledge 
that since the provinces already provide many of these same 
inspection services, the emphasis should be on decentralization and 
encouraging common inspection standards. Along with what the 
Bloc said, the provinces need to have strong impact on this.
<P>
	I want to backtrack a bit to the part that I spoke of in relation to 
federal officials who are responsible for enforcement risk 
management, laboratory services and information systems and 
communications because that is very easy and it can be said very 
quickly but there is a lot in those few words.
<P>
	I believe we are talking here about looking after our food chain, 
and certainly that is what the inspection agency's job should be. On 
whose behalf, again, are all these rules and regulations set up? If it 
is not for the protection of Canadian citizens, young and old alike, 
who is it for?
<P>
	Where is the information and communication with our citizens, 
the Canadian taxpayer? Who is minding the shop, ladies and 
gentlemen, and on whose behalf? Two years ago I had to alert 
citizens in my constituency all about the possibility of rBST 
injections into dairy cows. They were not notified. There was 
nothing sent out. There was no communication and no information 
given. This is very terrifying.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	In laboratory services, we have many fine research scientists 
who, I realize, are very excited by all this new knowledge and the 
future possibilities. As these new and exciting ideas pour forward, 
who is asking Canadians if they want these changes? What about 
enforcement and risk management? What laws are being enforced 
and where is the risk management control?
<P>
	I do not believe I am the only member of Parliament who 
receives weekly correspondence from my constituents who are 
alarmed by the changes taking place in their food chain, alarmed at 
the new genetically engineered food. Where is this mentioned at all 
in the new food inspections bill? Where is the caution?
<P>
	I now receive books, letters and all sorts of correspondence from 
all over British Columbia asking me to look at the changes and to 
consider the apparent lack of caution, as those who would benefit 
in a monetary manner push ruthlessly ahead to force their will on 
Canadians.
<P>
	I recently watched ``Jurassic Park''. I am not a movie goer, but I 
happened to catch it on TV last week. I did not find it scary in the 
physical sense but I found it alarming in the research and academic 
sense. I am not the first person to say this, but the message of the 
film to me was not can we do it but should we do it.
<P>
	There are those who would argue that we are overpopulated and 
that the world at present cannot feed all of its people and that 
justifies scientists' changing our natural world as we know it. I 
agree that overpopulation is serious, but surely the answer is not to 
move full steam ahead in chaos, for indeed none of us knows where 
this will lead us.
<P>
	Unfortunately, when we talk of global food production we have 
to admit there are serious problems. The human population is 
growing and we are losing 24 billion tonnes of topsoil a year.
<P>
	Yes, third world countries need food and I fear all this new 
biotechnology hype is not helping the third world. Rather, those 
investing are venture capitalists and they need to find investors. 
How can we expect a starving third world country to come up with 
the money needed to invest?
<P>
	What are we doing in the food inspection bill to take a look at 
what is around the corner? Surely what we do in legislation will 
reflect what is to come. We should not have to backtrack all the 
time.
<P>
	Canada and I imagine the United States as well have a lot of food 
that is wasted every year. I have been to dumps in the Okanagan 
where beautiful ripe peaches, ripe tomatoes and ripe vegetables of 
all types have been thrown out. Why did we not dehydrate them or 
reprocess them? Surely the food inspection agency could come to 
grips with some kind of process so that food would not be wasted.
<P>
	We send money to these third world countries that we do not 
have. That increases our tax burden. Yet we have food which we do 
not send. For countries to waste food when there are starving 
people in the world is not acceptable. To suggest that we must 
protect our food  market so as not to flood the market and cause 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7445"> 7445 </A></B>
<P>
lower prices is not an argument. Surely we have enough 
intelligence nowadays to be able to deal with both major issues.
<P>
	We now have concerns that there are a number of products which 
have been changed. Canola is herbicide intolerant. I am not sure 
whether that means more or less herbicide is needed. We have 
tomatoes with fish genes in them to make them more tolerant. 
There are flavour saver tomatoes. I wonder if anyone has ever gone 
to a plant that has been ripened by the sun and tasted a ripe tomato. 
I do not think anything can top that. There are pigs with human 
genes in them. Even our fish are being engineered to grow faster.
<P>
	What are the negative side effects? In B.C. we have good 
research scientists. One of them spoke on the weekend and told us 
that one of the side effects is that this particular engineered fish is a 
more aggressive feeder. Therefore it is not unlikely that if released 
into a natural setting it could over eat and cause the demise of our 
natural salmon. That is not unrealistic to suggest.
<P>
	We are not using any controls. Food inspection has to deal with 
all aspects of food.
<P>
	Every technology, no matter how beneficial, has unexpected 
costs. Today more than ever before we need researchers and 
scientists with ethical and moral values. Our research scientists 
should be free to explore where their curiosity and expertise take 
them in a controlled environment. However, if they have to be 
constantly aware of the economic payoff, then our scientists are not 
free to do their research and pressure is put on them to produce new 
ideas for those who want to exploit our world, as we know it, which 
results in the release of these genetically engineered food products 
on unsuspecting consumers. They are not being labelled. We do not 
really know what we are purchasing any more.
<P>
	I have presented two private member's bills which deal with 
labelling. I hope those bills will be dealt with seriously.
<P>
	I want to mention that there are occupational hazards related to 
biotechnology, which include diseases such as cancer, toxicity and 
product allergies. The main hazards are allergies from recombinant 
products, diseases, including cancer, and the production of novel 
disease organisms.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	What is the concern? The concern is that many of these 
significant hazards are being ignored by the scientists who are 
doing research and those reporting on the research that these novel 
allergies in food products will impact on workers. In fact the escape 
of these genes on the coats of laboratory workers is occurring each 
day. Some of them are being taken outside the lab and this matter is 
not being dealt with.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying we should look at all the research we 
have. Let us be very cautious that we do not just choose research 
that fits our particular purpose at the time and that we worry about 
all consumers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this group of 
amendments concerns mainly the respect of jurisdictions. The 
amendments proposed by the member for Frontenac and other BQ 
members of the standing committee on agriculture who spoke after 
him stand for a principle very dear to Quebecers, that is the respect 
of jurisdictions.
<P>
	Agriculture being a shared jurisdiction, it cannot be denied that 
the federal government has a say in that area. But it cannot be 
denied either that the provinces also have a say.
<P>
	As a member of the standing committee on health, I am very 
concerned by this issue. Food inspection will be the responsibility 
of the future agency of the Agriculture Department, but why is food 
inspected? It is inspected to protect the health of citizens, and 
certainly not to harm businesses, slaughterhouses or farm 
producers. The goal of food inspection is to preserve health, 
probably the most precious gift anyone can have.
<P>
	I used to be political attaché to the Quebec Minister of 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> The best!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> There are some remarks that I cannot make in this 
House and I do not want to be partisan, but I remember very well 
that, in 1978, Quebec faced the same problem the federal 
government is now confronted with, that is the multitude of food 
inspection agencies.
<P>
	For example, I will tell you what the situation was in Quebec in 
1978. At the federal level, there were at least three departments, 
Agriculture, Health and Fisheries, and the situation was similar in 
Quebec. In addition, the Montreal area, Quebec City and a number 
of other major centres in Quebec had their own food inspection 
agencies.
<P>
	Therefore, people dealing with food inspection said: ``We 
respect the principles and objectives pursued by food inspection 
agencies, but enough is enough. It is impossible to work, food 
inspectors are always on our backs and they contradict one 
another''. There was no consistency.
<P>
	So, the federal government is now looking for consistency, very 
late of course, almost 20 years after Quebec. We agree with that 
objective because, at least, there will be only one federal agency. 
However, since there is also one agency left in Quebec, there will 
still be some duplication in respect to slaughterhouses.
<P>
	I know about it. In my riding, there are slaughterhouses, as there 
probably are in every riding. These are referred to as type A and 
type B  slaughterhouses. This may not mean anything to the people 
who are listening and who are not concerned by the issue, but these 
are the categories. Some categories of meat are approved by the 
federal government. Others are approved by the provincial govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7446"> 7446 </A></B>
<P>
ment. In some cases, this means duplication for the businesses. 
There is still some duplication left, which is unfortunate.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	That is why I agree with the member for Frontenac. He is telling 
us that one cannot stop the federal government from moving 
forward, because of some rules involving shared jurisdiction in 
agricultural matters. But please, do respect provincial jurisdiction 
in this area, as well as in health. Health is even more of a provincial 
jurisdiction than agriculture.
<P>
	Personally, I hope there will be agreement between the 
provinces, even if the agency is federal. That would be simpler for 
everybody. It is also possible that we, in Quebec, do not want to 
control what is happening in British Columbia. If that province is 
more interested in letting the federal government do the whole 
thing, so be it. Except that, in Quebec, we have a specific culture. 
People always equate culture with language, but there is much 
more.
<P>
	You know that, Madam Speaker. You come from a region that 
has a specific culture. That can also be true for food, or 
gastronomy. Now, this bill is suggesting that one agency could do 
the work efficiently for all the different regional cuisines.
<P>
	A while ago, there was a reference to the cuisine of the 
Lac-Saint-Jean region. That is really good cooking. I know, 
because I have tasted it. Each region has its own specialties. Even 
the region of Edmundston, your region, Madam Speaker, has its 
own specialties. You know that people have different customs in 
different regions.
<P>
	I do not want to go into distinctions, but we know that French 
speaking people do not eat the same food as English speaking 
people, whether they are in New Brunswick, in Quebec or 
elsewhere. We must recognize that fact.
<P>
	In this case, who is in the best position to deal with these 
problems? The closest level of government. I am from Quebec. In 
my case, the closest level is the Government of Quebec, and all the 
more so because Quebec has been a leader since 1978 in matters of 
food inspection. At that time, I worked in the office of the Minister 
of Agriculture for Quebec, Jean Garon. I can name him since he 
does not sit in this House. That is to say that I followed this issue 
closely. Everybody quoted him as an example.
<P>
	Incidentally, during our consultations, I met old acquaintances 
from the Quebec department of agriculture. I was told: ``Strangely 
enough, the federal government is trying to copy us''. So much the 
better if Quebec can influence and try to improve something that  
will apply somewhere else. I have nothing against that. But I 
believe the federal government should take into account the fact 
that Quebec's mindset, culture, way of life, food, and behaviour are 
quite distinct.
<P>
	At least, there is some change, some improvement. Instead of 
three federal agencies there will be only one. It remains to be seen 
whether this agency will respect areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	I want to commend the member for Frontenac for his hard work 
on this issue. He brought it up time and time again in caucus, at 
every meeting, to make us realize how important this debate is. He 
mentioned it to me yesterday, and again today.
<P>
	He even told me: ``My dear colleague from Lévis, I know you 
have some experience in agriculture, even though it is no longer 
your field''. Finding his exemplary perseverance and tenacity 
irresistible, I came here to speak in favour of his amendments, to 
support his views. We will never say it often enough, the member 
for Frontenac is a staunch supporter of the Quebec farming 
community. Without sounding like a victim, he has often said that 
farming was not mentioned enough in speeches in this House. If it 
were not for the member for Frontenac, the member for Lotbinière, 
and the member for Champlain, we would not hear much about 
farmers.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	If we were to rely on the Liberal Party, the government, to speak 
about farming in the House, we would never hear about it. Today is 
a case in point. It is frightening.
<P>
	Food inspection is a concern not only for farmers, but also for 
consumers. How is it that no Liberal members of the health and 
agriculture committees are speaking on this issue? I am not 
allowed to criticize them for being absent, but I can criticize them 
for being silent. This is incredible.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will congratulate the member for Frontenac. I 
hope that members opposite will reconsider their position and join 
us in this extremely important debate on the issue of respecting 
areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I realize that the Liberal majority has decided not 
to answer the call of the member for Lévis. Once again, they 
remain silent on agricultural issues.
<P>
	I am happy to speak to the amendments proposed by the member 
for Frontenac, telling the federal government that, even if it did 
update its vision of Canadian federalism and merged together all 
federal food inspection agencies, it was high time to make those 
changes because there was a terrible mess in that area.
<P>
	However, in doing so, because of its very limited view of what 
had to be done in that sector, the federal government disregarded 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7447"> 7447 </A></B>
<P>
the fact that provinces already had some expertise and that they had 
developed some know-how.
<P>
	With his amendments, the member for Frontenac wants to make 
the government listen to reason and realize that it should not 
interfere in provincial jurisdictions with this bill on food 
inspection.
<P>
	Let me give you three main reasons. Sometimes we hear people 
say that separatists are against anything federal, but that is not the 
problem in this case; it is a matter of principle, of logic, of common 
sense.
<P>
	Everyone knows about the first example, the raw milk cheese. 
Thanks to a Canada-wide way of thinking, a view I would say is 
almost cultural, they came to a ridiculous conclusion that mainly 
affected Quebec raw milk cheese producers, because there are 
more producers in Quebec, but also all Canadian producers, of 
course. The Bloc Quebecois led a powerful fight on that issue at the 
federal level.
<P>
	Did the Government of Quebec initiate the same kind of action 
in the case of food inspection? Not at all. Our practices are 
different, our point of view is different, but this has to do with our 
culture, with our perception of the future of our society, and it 
translates into concrete initiative like these.
<P>
	Our first example was the planned ban on raw milk cheese. We 
had to wage a public fight, we had to demonstrate publicly the 
ridiculous side of the position taken by federal officials in order to 
win our case. Quebecers are looking forward to the day when it will 
no longer be necessary to do battle in the House in order to get 
things that make sense.
<P>
	I would like to give you another example. If we allow the federal 
government to intervene in the area of food inspection, if we let it 
set standards and operating procedures, we will get some strange 
results. A case in point is lamb production.
<P>
	Lamb production in Quebec is very different from lamb 
production in the rest of Canada. In Quebec, there are many small 
farmers with 200 to 300 sheep, sometimes less. In western Canada 
the flocks are much larger.
<P>
	When a disease that should be eradicated is found in one flock, 
up to two years ago the practice was to slaughter all the sick 
animals and those who might have been contaminated, in order to 
eliminate the problem.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	But the federal government, under pressure from western 
producers, who can be counted on to defend their interests, has 
changed the procedure. But it has always decided there would be 
only one rule across Canada; now, it was quarantine. The major 
impact of this in Quebec is that the management of a producer's 
herd may be totally paralyzed because, when a producer has 200 
animals and they are all placed under quarantine, we might as well 
say he has to shut his farm down. In  western Canada, if 200 
animals out of a herd of 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 are placed under 
quarantine, the economic impact is not the same at all.
<P>
	This is to show you that if we decide that the federal government 
can interfere in this way with food inspection and management, we 
will get absurd results similar to the one I just described.
<P>
	There is another sector in which the federal government should 
not enjoy unjustified powers, that is, the management of 
slaughterhouses. Our slaughterhouses vary widely in size. We need 
standards that may differ for the various types of slaughterhouses, 
without putting aside the rules on food quality and the guarantee 
that diseases will not spread.
<P>
	There are still small regional slaughterhouses that can work. 
They are often multifunctional slaughterhouses that slaughter 
different kinds of animals. These facilities need to be regulated 
differently from what might be a very large slaughterhouse dealing 
with a single species, say pigs. There are major differences in terms 
of management, which results in practices being different from 
region of the country to another. In that sense, to give the federal 
government the power to establish standards and, with these 
national standards, to interfere in any province is not doing Quebec 
or any other province a service.
<P>
	I would like to come back to clause 11 of the bill and to the 
amendment we put forward so that each province could veto the 
use of this provision by the Minister of Health.
<P>
	We would not want to find ourselves in a situation where the 
federal government could decide to get involved, to interfere in a 
certain area-raw milk is still an excellent example to illustrate 
this point-and the province would then have to prove such 
interference is uncalled for. The onus should be reversed and each 
province should have a veto on the application of this provision so 
that, any time a decision made by the federal government in a given 
area is in contradiction with the province's objectives, the province 
may say: ``Thanks, but no thanks. This just cannot be done here, 
and the reason for that is quite simply that it is not in keeping with 
our way of doing things''.
<P>
	We must therefore ensure that this bill to standardize food 
inspection at the federal level does not lead to what would amount 
to across-the-board standardization and that those who have a 
centralizing, federalist vision of Canada are not given yet another 
tool to impose national standards in an area that requires a level of 
flexibility unlike what is provided for in this government bill.
<P>
	We must ensure that the provision about agreements respecting 
food inspection entered into by the federal government and any of 
the provinces does not leave the door wide open for federal 
interference in areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7448"> 7448 </A></B>
<P>
	To let the federal government provide services to the public on 
behalf of the two levels of government, thereby directly interfering 
with provincial jurisdiction, is only perpetuating a pattern. Once 
again, we have a basic choice to make: do we want a federal 
system where the delineation between provincial and federal 
jurisdictions is an incredible mess? Or could we not at least, while 
we are in this system, clarify the respective jurisdictions and let 
provinces keep the jurisdiction they have as regards food 
inspection?
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	As we can see, provincial governments, or Quebec in any case, 
are 10, 15, or 20 years ahead. Back in 1978, food inspection 
responsibilities were assigned to one department. Today, in 1996, 
the federal government is putting forward a proposal to that effect, 
but its proposal still reflects the old political assumption that the 
federal government should control all areas of activity.
<P>
	This could lead once again to the problem of having to manage 
national standards, which do not necessarily apply easily and 
appropriately to each of the existing areas of activity.
<P>
	As for constituents of Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, those 
involved in farming in these various areas, every time they see 
duplication of government services, they point it out. They were 
delighted to see the federal government reduce the number of food 
inspection groups. It was about time, because three departments 
were involved, whereas there will be only one from now on.
<P>
	This bill could, and must, be improved by giving provincial 
governments control over food inspection, so that, in two, three, or 
five years, we will not be in court over legal complications. If those 
concerned by food inspection measures need a loophole, in order to 
elude the law, well, let us leave the bill as is, as it will give them an 
opportunity to do so. Then, all they will have to do is blame 
governments for not minding their own business. Therefore, there 
must be a fee structure.
<P>
	The burden of proof must be reversed. Food inspection must 
come under provincial jurisdiction. The federal government could, 
through its legislation, manage some aspects which fall under its 
jurisdiction, but it must not be allowed to interfere in such a way 
that, in two, three, or five years, through regulations, it ends up 
with even greater control. This is why I support the amendment by 
the hon. member for Frontenac.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 5</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-60, in Clause 9, be amended by replacing lines 4 to 6 on page 3 with 
the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``9. (1) The Governor in Council shall, by order, direct that the head office of the 
Agency be in the location in Canada recommended by the committee referred to in

<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The Governor in Council may, by order, direct that the head office of the

with all the reasons for such a change; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) the committee has approved the change.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>9.1 Such committee of the House of Commons as is designated or established to

<BLOCKQUOTE>9.2 Such committee of the House of Commons as is designated or established to 
consider agricultural matters shall, after studying the reasons for the change 
provided to the committee pursuant to paragraph 9(2)(<I>a</I>), either approve or refuse to 
approve, for the purposes of subsection 9(2), any change in the location of the head 
office of the Agency.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, clause 9 is very simple and almost 
laconic. It provides that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The head office of the Agency shall be in the National Capital Region, as 
described in the schedule to the <I>National Capital Act</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The senior officials we met last September 26 have drawn to our 
attention the fact that tomorrow morning, six months or two years 
from now, after a change of government, a new agriculture minister 
could, by order, to ease his conscience and continue to indulge in 
patronage, have the agency moved to his riding. Of course, we want 
to shield our fellow Canadian citizens from any potential abuse in 
that regard.
<P>
	Let us remember that it can be done through a simple order in 
council. Why should the head office of the agency move year after 
year? The Liberal government, already in power for over three 
years, is very  patronage-minded. It could eventually move 
agencies from one city to another, and that can be very costly.
<P>
	Our amendment proposes to involve the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food. It suggests two things. First, the 
location of the head office of the agency would be reviewed and 
decided by the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
and not only through an order in council.
<P>
	This would make the process much more open and at the same 
time revitalize the role of House of Commons committees that, in 
fact, do not do much except execute orders coming from above, in 
this case, from the minister himself.
<P>
	Once the head office is located somewhere, a future move is 
always possible or could become necessary 30 or 40 years down the 
road. To govern is to foresee, and people in the government should 
be smart enough to expect that the head office of the agency will 
not be moved 3 or 4 years from now. But who knows? That could 
happen, as in the case of the House of Commons, which moved 
from Montreal over a century ago. You may remember that, 
according to our history books, the Parliament Buildings were set 
on fire following a minor rebellion and, in its wisdom, the 
government of the day decided to move Parliament to another 
province, Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The second objective is that the future relocation of the agency's 
headquarters be subject to an in-depth review of the need for such a 
relocation and that the new site be approved by the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	Relocating the agency's headquarters, with all this decision 
would imply-asking the employees and their families to move, 
moving the office furniture, renting space in another city, etc.-is 
out of the question without first having carried out a review of the 
reasons behind this decision. Of course, if it is a patronage 
decision, an irrational decision, then the committee, after hearing a 
lot of witnesses, would submit its recommendation to Parliament.
<P>
	Changing topics, there is no need I guess to ask that the agency's 
headquarters, if they are to be established in the national capital 
region, be located in Quebec. When we go over the estimates for 
the Department of Agriculture, for instance, we see that, year after 
year, around 11 per cent of the departmental budget is spent in 
Quebec.
<P>
	Let me remind the House that Quebecers represent close to 25 
per cent of the overall population and pay over 23 p. 100 of the 
taxes collected in Canada. However, barely 11 per cent of the 
agriculture department's budget goes to Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7450"> 7450 </A></B>
<P>
	I approached the minister of agriculture to tell him that it 
averages 11 per cent, although there were times when it dropped 
to 9 per cent and other times when it reached 13 and 14 per cent, 
but on average it is 11 per cent. So, how could he explain why 
his department is only investing 11 per cent in Quebec? Well, he 
said: ``It is easy to understand, dear hon. member for Frontenac. 
There are a lot of infrastructures in the nation's capital, in Ottawa, 
offices and such. The nation's capital can almost be considered 
as being a part of the province of Quebec''. Are there so many 
people living in Quebec but working in Ontario? Could be. But 
not enough to make up for the difference and reach 23 per cent, 
which would only be fair in our view.
<P>
	So, if it is true that everything done in Ottawa could be 
considered as being done in Quebec, would it not be possible to 
establish the new agency in Quebec, since it is expected to open up 
in the national capital region? Set on the river bank, it could lean 
towards Ontario, a bit like the leaning tower of Pisa. In New 
Brunswick, not much leans this way, since it would have to reach 
over Quebec.
<P>
	Would my colleague, the parliamentary secretary, who sits with 
me on the standing committee on agriculture, be ready to rise now 
in this place and to say: ``Dear hon. member for Frontenac, we will 
give you something today: we will establish the head office of the 
agency in Quebec''?
<P>
	As you can see, clause 9 provides that the head office of the 
agency shall be in the national capital region. I bet you $20 to $1 
that it will be in Hull. I am being generous, I bet you $20 to $1 that 
it will be in Hull. However, I am almost sure I will lose. It does not 
matter. I am willing to take the risk that you make $20 on an outlay 
of $1, just so that you can see the major injustice being done to 
Quebec once again.
<P>
	The head office of the agency will be the reflection and the heart 
of the agency. It is estimated that some 4,500 jobs will be directly 
created by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Of course, all 
4,500 jobs will not be at the head office but easily 800 to 900 of 
them will be. This is very significant. Readjustments will have to 
be made within three departments.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Without further delay, I challenge the parliamentary secretary 
who could make you win $20, Madam Speaker. I challenge him to 
rise now and for once to make a decision not in favour of Quebec 
but a fair decision for all of Canada, that is, that the head office be 
located on the other side of the Ottawa River, in Hull, Gatineau or 
somewhere in the area.
<P>
	I thank you, Madam Speaker, and I look forward to the 
parliamentary secretary's answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-60 today. This bill 
proposes that the Government of Canada consolidate all federally 
mandated food inspection, animal and plant health services into a 
single federal food inspection agency. This agency will report to 
Parliament through the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	When the new food inspection agency begins operation in 1997, 
it will become one of Ottawa's largest bureaucratic entities with 
4,500 employees and a budget of $300 million.
<P>
	Although the Reform Party supports consolidating and 
downsizing the operations of the federal government, we fear that 
this act will accomplish little except to shuffle names and titles. 
Instead the government should be considering the advantages of 
privatizing a significant portion of Canada's food, plant and animal 
inspection services.
<P>
	Only $40 million or 13.3 per cent of the agency's $300 million 
budget is currently cost recovered. The agency already plans to 
dramatically increase this amount to more than $70 million. While 
the Reform Party supports user pay and cost recovery, the cost of 
the service must reflect the true cost of providing the service, not 
the added expense of maintaining the government's bureaucracy.
<P>
	The act should ensure that a greater priority is placed on cost 
avoidance and cost reduction. This is important as the agency 
created in this act will be responsible for enforcing and 
administering several federal statutes which regulate food, animal 
and plant health related products. This includes the Feeds Act, 
Fertilizers Act, Health of Animals Act, Meat Inspection Act, Plant 
Breeders' Rights Act and Seeds Act.
<P>
	The act will also continue to centralize authority for food 
inspection in the hands of the federal government. The Reform 
Party believes the government should acknowledge that since the 
provinces already provide many of the same inspection services, 
the emphasis should be on decentralization and encouraging 
common inspection standards and more harmonization.
<P>
	For these reasons the Reform Party opposes this bill. Turning to 
the bill itself, we have specific concerns.
<P>
	Provisions in this bill seem to create an environment for empire 
building. Clause 5 of the bill states that the governor in council 
shall appoint a president and an executive vice-president of the new 
agency. These individuals will be responsible for the day to day 
operations of the agency. They will provide advice to the minister 
on matters relating to the mandate of the agency. There is no 
mention of the qualifications required by these people. This type of 
situation opens itself up to pork barrel politics.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7451"> 7451 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill also states that the president and the executive 
vice-president shall be paid such remuneration as fixed by the 
governor in council. We do not even know the salary amounts for 
these two positions. With this legislation, each member of the 
advisory board shall be paid such fees for his or her services as 
are fixed by the minister. Again, we cannot tell Canadian 
taxpayers how much they will be paying for these salaries.
<P>
	This bill gives the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
complete control over this agency which is a vital part of the 
agriculture industry.
<P>
	The Liberal member for South Shore has voiced his concerns 
over his government's bill in this House. He has commented on the 
lack of consultation regarding Bill C-60 in his constituency. The 
small and medium size seafood processors in his riding have also 
told him that they feel increasingly isolated by this government. I 
can assure the member that this isolation is shared by western 
producers and processors.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	This familiarizes us somewhat with the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Commissioners on the Canadian Wheat Board are appointed and 
have received severance and pension payments that are hidden 
from public view. The minister is setting out to create the same 
type of regulatory agency with Bill C-60. The issue of severance 
packages, pensions, premiums and what have you in that agency is 
unbelievable to western farmers and it is causing a tremendous 
division.
<P>
	The Canadian Food, Beverage, Consumer Goods and Services 
Coalition submitted some valuable criticism of this bill. It stressed 
the need for an agency built around a board of directors that would 
be truly accountable and effective in setting these policies. I would 
like to point out that this is the direction the agriculture minister is 
slowly turning to in hinting he will be making changes. Why is this 
not being done before the bill is passed?
<P>
	The coalition feels an advisory board under the direct control of 
the minister will simply contribute to the continuation of the 
outdated policies and procedures of the original department. It 
stressed that the legislation should focus more on cost effectiveness 
and service to the consumer.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party proposed an amendment to the preamble 
to identify cost effectiveness as an objective of the agency. The 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food actually passed 
the amendment, albeit by a narrow margin. However, the Liberal 
majority on the committee succeeded in defeating all of our other 
amendments which were designed to bring more accountability to 
the agency and would have ensured more consultation with the 
industry.
<P>
	For example, we would have ensured that the appointment of the 
president and the vice-president  would have been done in 
consultation with the industry and would have been subject to a 
special subcommittee on food inspection. This is what the industry 
wants but it is not what the Liberals want so they defeated the 
amendment. This is another prime example of how this 
government operates.
<P>
	We also put forth an amendment to ensure that the appointments 
to the advisory board that is created by this legislation would be 
open to scrutiny by a subcommittee of the standing committee. Of 
course the Liberal committee majority defeated this excellent 
amendment also. The Liberals seemed determined to derail any 
attempt by Reform members to give the agriculture and agri-food 
committee some responsibility and make it significant and 
accountable.
<P>
	We also proposed an amendment to provide for a one-year 
moratorium on any further cost recovery actions so the standing 
committee could examine the consequences of the existing and 
proposed fees on the competitiveness of the Canadian industry. 
Another Reform amendment would have ensured that the fees 
would not have exceeded the reasonable cost of providing the 
service. Not surprisingly, these amendments were defeated also. 
This is unfortunate because it leaves all the power in the hands of 
the minister. There is no accountability and there is no consultation 
with the industry. These are severe detriments to making this 
agency what it should be.
<P>
	I would like to quote a paragraph or two from a presentation by 
the Canadian Horticultural Council on December 10. This is what 
the council had to say about the cost of service:
<P>
	``During the cost recovery round one discussions in 1984, the 
food production and inspection branch estimated the total cost of 
the fresh fruit and vegetable program to be approximately $7 
million. In 1994 when the cost recovery round two discussions 
were launched under the food production and inspection branch's 
business alignment plan, we were informed the costs for the 
program had increased to approximately $17 million'', more than 
double what they estimated. ``Suffice it to say that in both cases we 
had to rely on the branch's word that the figures were correct. 
When we questioned how the program costs could have risen by 
$10 million over the 10 year period, especially when a number of 
the services had been deregulated, we were informed that the rules 
were calculating the costs had changed''. Boy, that is cost recovery.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Then we go into user pay. Another short example: ``It is worth 
noting that between 1984 and 1994, the principle of sharing the 
cost based on public and private good has disappeared. In 1984 
one-third of the costs were deemed to be for the public good and in 
1994 there was no longer any public good''.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
important to realize that we are, right now, debating Motion No. 
5.
<P>
	This motion proposes an amendment to section 9 of Bill C-60, 
intent to have the committee look at where the location of the head 
office should be. The motion suggests that the head office be 
looked at within the purview of a committee and the committee 
make a decision where that head office should be located.
<P>
	This amendment is not needed. In reality, during the discussions 
with the standing committee and the amendments put forth in the 
standing committee, clause 9 indicated very clearly that the head 
office would be located in the national capital region. That is very 
clearly in the amendment.
<P>
	There is no legislative precedent in the Canadian Parliamentary 
system for having a standing committee to be involved in the level 
of detail in the administration in deciding where a building is 
located.
<P>
	The minister is responsible and accountable for his budget. He is 
responsible and accountable to the Canadian public. He is 
responsible and accountable to this Parliament. Therefore it is very 
clear that as part of his duty he must make those detailed decisions 
and bring them forward.
<P>
	I would at this time as well point out that it is of extreme 
importance to not only the minister but also to the department that 
all regions of this country be treated fairly and equally. We 
endeavour to make certain that where we are talking of research 
centres or all the facilities that exist in agriculture Canada, the 
proper facilities are placed throughout this country in order to serve 
that industry as well as possible.
<P>
	There is no question that the decisions being made are made on 
the basis of fairness. I would assure my colleagues from Quebec 
that has been the case in the past with the department of agriculture 
and the department will continue to make certain that not only 
Quebec but all regions of this country are treated fairly with regard 
to those types of decisions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would just like to comment on this grouping. We 
are really only dealing with one amendment put forward by the 
Bloc regarding where the agency's national office will be located.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary for the minister of agriculture just 
spoke and talked about the accountability that is in the system, and 
that this type of amendment is not required. I agree with him only 
on one point. This type of amendment should not need to be 
required. If there were accountability it would not be required.
<P>
	I want to review with the hon. member some facts that prove that 
his argument is a bunch of hogwash. He says  that the minister and 
the agency will be accountable. Let us look at the record of the 
Liberal government. Location is very important.
<P>
	We have seen governments from as far back as I can remember 
playing political games with locations of head offices. Even 
recently in this Parliament the Liberals brought forward a piece of 
legislation that privatized CN Rail, which means that basically it 
should be able to run its own affairs. In the legislation it stated that 
the national office of CN Rail had to be located in Montreal. Talk 
about politics. What a bunch of foolishness.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	The previous Tory government decided that for political reasons 
the national office of the Farm Credit Corporation had to be in my 
province in the city of Regina. That was a political decision. Where 
was the accountability? Where is the accountability now, where 
was the accountability then?
<P>
	It is not only with the locations of office locations, it is with the 
granting of contracts. All of western Canada was infuriated when 
the Conservative government offered the CF-18 maintenance 
contract to Canadair instead of Bristol Aerospace in Winnipeg even 
though Bristol Aerospace had the best tender with better quality 
and a lower price to offer.
<P>
	Because of political expediency there was no accountability. It 
was a joke. A few members ran into Prime Minister Mulroney's 
office and demanded that the contract with Canadair be accepted 
for political reasons, and the Prime Minister bowed to their wishes.
<P>
	What should be the criteria for determining the location of the 
national office? Has it even dawned on anybody to debate the 
criteria? The criteria for the location of an agency's head office 
should be cost effectiveness, efficiency and productivity. The most 
effective and productive location for the head office of the Farm 
Credit Corporation may just be Regina, I do not know. I do not 
think a cost benefit study has ever been done to determine where 
that national office should be.
<P>
	The most cost effective location for the single food inspection 
agency might be the national capital region, but we do not know. 
That was not even a consideration. The minister said because there 
are other departments involved, this may be the right place. But 
nobody looked into it. Nobody crunched the numbers. That was the 
last thing on the agenda.
<P>
	The first priority has always been political expediency: ``How 
are we going to maintain the most votes? If we are in trouble in 
Atlantic Canada, then we had better put some office in Atlantic 
Canada. If we are in trouble in Alberta, we had better put 
something in Edmonton or Calgary''.

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Stop being so cynical at Christmas time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> The member says I should not be cynical at 
Christmas time. It just so happens that a lot of civil servants have 
not enjoyed a very good Christmas because for some political 
reason their head office was moved from one end of the country to 
the other and they had to tag along. Had they known it would save 
them some of their own tax dollars, they may have been prepared to 
move from Ottawa to Regina or from Vancouver to Halifax.
<P>
	What really happened was that they knew some politicians were 
playing some games with the location of their national office and 
their lives were being wrecked as a result. It is time we stopped 
doing that and look at cost effectiveness.
<P>
	If this motion had stated that the head office of the agency be 
located in the most cost effective location in Canada, I would have 
jumped for joy. That would be real progress. But that is not quite 
what the amendment says. The Liberals had not even thought about 
that as a criterion for the selection of a location for their national 
office.
<P>
	I am sick and tired of playing these silly political games, playing 
with people's lives and spending taxpayer dollars needlessly.

	He said: Madam Speaker, again, these motions are well grouped. 
Motions Nos. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 21 are amendments 
proposed by my colleague, the hon. member for Lotbinière.
<P>
	The reason the Bloc Quebecois is trying hard to improve Bill 
C-60 is because of the serious risk of patronage. From 1984 to 
1993, another party was in office and some people would literally 
wake up at night despising the Prime Minister of the time, because 
they were so fed up with his politics of patronage.
<P>
	The party that took over from the Mulroney government does not 
fare much better in this respect. This is serious, as you are well 
aware. The government, through the governor in council, will 
appoint the president for a term of five years which may be 
renewed, and also the executive vice-president. There will be an 
advisory board of not more than 12 members, who will also be 
appointed by the governor in council.
<P>
	What is even worse is that the regulations governing 
employment in the public service will be suspended for an 
indeterminate period of time. This means anyone can  be hired, 
whether it is an uncle, an aunt, a nephew, a niece, a brother-in-law, 
a mother-in-law, a sister-in-law, the niece's friend, the 
sister-in-law's nephew, even the grandfather, if he still young 
enough to go to work. This is a serious matter. We are talking about 
an indeterminate period of time which could be six months, a year, 
two years, whatever. I have no doubt that the executive 
vice-president and the president will all be good friends, good 
Liberals.
<P>
	These people will appoint employees of the new food inspection 
agency in a fashion similar to that of the government. We raised 
this issue during question period. The director general of the space 
agency, which is located in Longueuil, or Saint-Hubert, lives in 
Ottawa and refuses to move. So, the government pays $1,300 a 
month to house him in a luxurious rental unit. Is it a frient of the 
government who is enjoying all this? Of course.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Look at the recent wave of appointments in our ridings. Our new 
returning officer in my riding is a well-known Liberal. The fact that 
he is a Liberal does not make him incompetent, but, by the same 
token, one need not be a Liberal to be qualified.
<P>
	This retired gentleman was appointed, while we have young men 
and young women looking for work. They are very competent, but 
they do not have a job and have to rely on either unemployment or 
welfare benefits. This government has appointed in my riding a 
man who is drawing a good pension. Why not have given the job to 
a competent young person?
<P>
	In my riding, the employment or unemployment insurance-we 
are not quite sure what word to use any more-board of referees is 
chaired by a notary who happens to be the daughter of a former 
Liberal member.
<P>
	When representatives of the farm debt review board appeared 
before us at the agriculture committee, I was the only one to ask 
them: ``Who do you have to thank for your appointment?'' 
Jean-Yves, the representative from Quebec-he is from the 
St-Hyacinthe area-made it quite clear that he had his political 
affiliation to thank for it. And what affiliation is that? Liberal. In 
the greater Eastern Townships region, the same Jean-Yves has 
managed to win the nomination as Liberal candidate for the riding 
of Richmond-Wolfe in the upcoming election. He managed to get 
himself nominated.
<P>
	Are we going to give the Liberal Party of Canada a blank cheque 
to waive the public service hiring procedures for an indeterminate 
period so that the new food inspection agency can become a 
patronage haven? Never. We will condemn this measure with all 
our might.
<P>
	The fact that a person is a Liberal does not make that person 
competent. The name of Jean Bienvenue comes to mind; he was the 
minister of education in Quebec under Robert Bourassa. Guess 
what his political affiliation was.  He was appointed superior court 
judge in Quebec. The fact that he was a Liberal did not make him a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7455"> 7455 </A></B>
<P>
competent judge. He was appointed by the Liberals, not the 
Conservatives.
<P>
	We have proposed countless amendments to improve on Bill 
C-60, so that the people of Canada could have a reliable food 
inspection agency built on a solid foundation. To have a solid 
foundation, the best qualified people must be hired.
<P>
	One of these amendments suggests that the education and 
experience of the president and the vice-president should match the 
agency's management and service delivery requirements. Qualified 
people should be hired. Chances are the government party will vote 
against that to protect themselves, because they do not want to have 
their hands tied, they want to be able to appoint whoever they 
please.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	By ensuring that the president and executive vice-president of 
the agency have a comprehensive knowledge and a broad 
experience of the areas dealt with by the agency, we would 
minimize the risk of seeing one or more unqualified person 
appointed to these positions, as was the case of Justice Bienvenue, 
to whom I referred earlier.
<P>
	We are proposing that the president be appointed for a term of 
five years and, if he does an excellent job, he could be appointed 
for one, but only one, more term of five years. After ten years in a 
position, I would say he would have given all that he can give, and 
that is enough. I bet our friends opposite will vote against that too. 
What they want is to be able to appoint the members of the new 
agency for life, like the senators.
<P>
	I urge our Liberal colleagues to consider carefully what they 
want to do. If they want this agency to be above suspicion, it has to 
be as free of patronage as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, we are now dealing with group 5. A number of 
amendments were put forward by the Bloc to this part of the bill 
which deals with the ratification or review of appointments to the 
agency.
<P>
	Reform introduced an amendment to Bill C-60 at committee 
stage. Our amendment stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No appointment shall be made under subsection 10(1) unless it is approved by a 
subcommittee of each of such committee of the House of Commons as is designated 
or established to consider</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) agriculture matters;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) health matters; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) fisheries matters.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Government members chose to oppose that amendment in 
committee. Had it passed, it would have ensured that members of 
Parliament with knowledge and  interest in the areas of agriculture, 
fisheries and health would have been able to review appointments 
to the advisory board of the agency. They would have been able to 
review the staffing decisions of the agency. That would have 
addressed the patronage issue which my colleague from the Bloc so 
eloquently berated.
<P>
	We support Motion No. 3. It ensures that persons appointed to 
the agency's executive by the minister are qualified. It is important 
that these executives not be the local Liberal who happens to 
donate the most money in the last election.
<P>
	It is sad that the Conservatives and the Liberals are trying to 
outdo each other on patronage appointments. Under the Mulroney 
Conservatives, Marjory LeBreton was the de facto minister of 
patronage. They did not have a minister in the House, but they 
might as well have, it was so blatant. Nobody got appointed to 
anything by that Conservative government unless they met the 
credentials of being a strong Conservative Party supporter. Of 
course she got the biggest plum of all. She was appointed to the 
Senate, where she is now able to make her pronouncements after 
being a party servant for so many years.
<P>
	The Liberals, not to be outdone, chose Penny Collenette to be 
their de facto minister of patronage to hand out the appointments. 
We saw it recently in the appointment of returning officers across 
the country for the next election. That is the mindset of the Liberal 
government.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	That is the fodder that feeds the political machinery. Some hope 
that down the road, if they pay my dues, donate enough money to 
the Liberal coffers, pound on enough doors or if they support the 
right person who happens to make it to the Prime Minister's chair 
or the leader of the party at least, they will get their reward and be 
well cared for.
<P>
	It is one's party faithfulness and loyalty that becomes the 
paramount criterion for being appointed to these various boards, 
without public scrutiny and merit being the primary factor.
<P>
	We support Motion No. 3.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 limits the agency's executives to one term. If there 
is proper scrutiny of who these people are I do not think that type of 
step is necessary.
<P>
	We support Motion No. 6. It would allow the standing committee 
to review the appointments to the agency. The last part of the 
amendment is a formula to force the minister to make the 
appointments based on an exact province by province formula. 
This is an excessive measure. It is getting away from merit and into 
a quota system. I believe members are quite aware of our feelings 
on people being appointed to positions or being hired based on 
quotas rather than merit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7456"> 7456 </A></B>
<P>
	We support Motion No. 7. It would allow the standing 
committee to review appointments to the agency's advisory board. 
We argued that position in committee and the Liberals rejected 
it.
<P>
	We oppose Motion No. 8. It would allow the advisory board to 
advise a provincial government or a union-we are not sure why 
the Bloc put that in. Perhaps someone can change our mind with a 
good argument.
<P>
	We oppose Motions Nos. 9 and 10. Motion 10 would require that 
at least one of the advisory board members be from the agency's 
union.
<P>
	We support Motion No. 11. This amendment would require the 
minister appoint as president of the agency the person that the 
standing committee deems to be the best candidate. This brings 
accountability and allows elected people to have a constructive role 
in matters concerning government agencies and the creation of 
these agencies.
<P>
	We support Motion No. 12. It allows the standing committee to 
review matters related to the new agency such as the advisory 
board members' pay. One of the things that damaged the Canadian 
Wheat Board the most was the fact that no one knew how much the 
appointed commissioners received in salary. All sorts of rumours 
floated around about what they received. Finally there was a leak 
concerning their benefit package if they were to retire or be fired.
<P>
	Farmers were shocked to find out that they were paying 
severance packages of over $250,000 to these appointed 
commissioners. It was all kept secret. A lot of ill feelings 
developed toward the Canadian Wheat Board and the 
commissioners because this fact had been kept secret. Therefore, 
Reform supports this motion because it opens things up and 
everybody knows the dollars that are involved and whether or not 
they are adequate or too benevolent.
<P>
	We support Motion No. 21. This would allow a review of the 
agency's operations once a year by the standing committee. 
Anything that can be done to bring elected people into a more 
meaningful role in reviewing the work of agencies such as the food 
inspection agency is a very positive step.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, several 
points have been brought forward by the leader of the official 
opposition which we agree are very important to the system.
<P>
	However, we feel that most of the issues that he mentioned have 
been dealt with very clearly within the legislation. I know people 
can talk about patronage appointments and a wide variety of things, 
such as the offices and positions that people have, but the reality is 
there are four or five political parties in this House.
<P>
	If we look at the representation of the people across the country, 
there are always going to be some Liberals who are appointed to 
positions. There are going to be some Bloc members who are 
appointed to positions. There are going to be some Reform 
members who are appointed to positions. Those appointments must 
be on merit. On this side of the House we do not question the fact 
that people are to be appointed on merit.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	We feel that this legislation provides for an appointment process 
of the president and the executive vice-president on the same basis 
as we would appoint a deputy minister and associate deputy 
minister. The process ensures that knowledgeable, well qualified 
people will be selected for those positions. The legislation also 
allows for the renewal of the appointment of the president or the 
executive vice-president for one or more terms as appropriate. As 
such it will provide the government with the flexibility to ensure a 
consistent and continuous senior management structure in the 
agency.
<P>
	With respect to the role identified for the Standing Committee of 
the House of Commons in the selection of advisory board 
members, there is no legislative precedent in the Canadian 
parliamentary system for having a committee involved with that 
type of detail. Yes, we have seen the fiascos of committees getting 
involved in the scrutiny of appointments in the United States. Quite 
frankly, it is a political tear down when we look at it. I think the 
public watches with interest when parties start that process. In 
reality, I am certain that the United States is very envious of the 
system we have in this country. It is very clear from the people we 
have in appointed positions that they do an extremely good job.
<P>
	The minister is responsible and accountable to Parliament for the 
agency and its administration. As we look at it the minister is the 
end of those responsibilities. Quite frankly, he has the 
responsibility to consult very widely, check with as many people as 
possible and make certain the operation is running properly.
<P>
	The purpose of the advisory board is clearly to provide the 
minister with advice with respect to matters relating to food 
inspection. Provinces, unions, and others will continue to seek 
input from a host of sources that will help the minister with his 
decisions.
<P>
	With respect to the selection of the advisory board members, the 
intent of the legislation is to ensure that the minister can choose an 
advisory board from as wide a selection of individuals as possible. 
We do not wish to inadvertently limit or curtail the possibilities of 
choice of that board. Rather than mandating representation from 
specific interested parties, it is preferable to have a broad source of 
knowledgeable people, including the possibility of representation 
from the unions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7457"> 7457 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to fees paid to the advisory board members, these 
fees will be subject to Treasury Board guidelines that are in place 
in this country.
<P>
	With respect to the reporting on intellectual property, this 
information is currently available and reported annually. For 
example, the food production and inspection agency of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food Canada issued 1,621 fresh fruit and vegetable dealer 
licences in 1996 and is part of the summary list in part III of the 
main estimates. This reporting will continue in the agency. 
Furthermore, committees of the House will continue to review this 
sort of information as part of the main estimates process through 
the Appropriations Act.
<P>
	I reiterate as well that where concerns come up and Parliament 
wishes to deal with them, we do have the committee process in 
place. That committee process is to allow members of this House to 
investigate whatever issues they feel necessary to further 
investigate. It will involve members of Parliament. Through that 
process I believe the House is well protected too.
<P>
	The minister who is virtually responsible in the end must take 
the resource of what is going on, take the circumstances of the 
agency and make certain it is running properly. The House at the 
same time has its vehicle through the committees to investigate any 
concerns. Quite frankly, both sides of the House have a full 
opportunity in committee to voice concerns and bring forward 
witnesses to discuss issues that are pertinent.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-60, the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency Act. At first blush, the bill seems pretty 
innocuous. I looked at it with the hon. member for Frontenac.
<P>
	However, a closer examination shows what the Liberal Party 
wants to do. This is rather disheartening. The government comes 
up with nice bills, but it always wants to able to appoint friends. 
Because the government wants to remain in office, it does not 
necessarily appoint competent people. Not to worry. It does not 
matter whether these appointees are competent or not. What 
matters for the government is looking after its friends.
<P>
	Earlier, the hon. member for Frontenac proposed constructive 
amendments. My colleague sat on the committee. He made 
constructive suggestions, and I am anxious to see whether the 
government will have the courage to accept and support these 
positive changes.
<P>
	Why do I say this? It is because, while I am still naive, I do 
notice certain things when I look at the current political reality. We 
are the official opposition and people often say that the opposition 
is only there to block government initiatives. This is not at all the 
Bloc  Quebecois' vision, particularly since we are not even here to 
try to form the government.
<P>
	Rather, we are here to defend the views of part of the public. I 
was elected to represent the Lac-Saint-Jean region. Therefore, I 
come here with certain views and I say to the government: ``Listen, 
your bill may not be so bad, but we propose this changeor that 
change''. But to no avail. I am quite convinced that, when the time 
comes to vote, the government will turn a deaf ear.
<P>
	It should come as no surprise that people are no longer interested 
in politics. It is always the same thing. It is always these little 
schemes to promote patronage. Of course, this is done quietly. It 
does not make the headlines. It is always done in an under handed 
way. This is all very disappointing. Even though we are the 
opposition-I would rather say the watchdog of democracy-we 
should be able to work together at least some of the time, so that 
everyone can make a positive contribution.
<P>
	This reminds me of the bill we talked about recently, which 
would have revoked the conviction of Louis Riel. Why did the 
government vote against the bill? This is ridiculous. When the 
opposition says black, the government says white.
<P>
	But that is not what it usually says. Usually, it says: ``The 
opposition is just there to disagree''. I am sorry, but we do try to 
suggest some constructive changes. We try to raise some 
interesting points. But all we get is a completely negative reaction 
to any contribution we are prepared to make. I must say I find this 
very disappointing. I look forward to the time when we have our 
own country, so we can go our own way.
<P>
	I will give a few examples from the bill. In clause 9, it says that 
the head office of the agency shall be in the national capital region 
or any other location in Canada. That is good. However, according 
to certain officials, the head office of the agency could be in Ottawa 
at first and then be moved later on by order in council. Basically, 
the question that comes to mind is whether the agency could go 
where it would be politically expedient. If things are not going well 
in a riding, this would be a good thing to have, so the government 
hands out a goody. That is what I dislike about the Liberal Party 
and the government.
<P>
	In clause 10, it says that the minister responsible for the agency 
shall appoint an advisory board of not more than 12 members to 
hold office during pleasure for a term not exceeding three years. 
The minister would also appoint one of the members as chairperson 
of the advisory board instead of letting people qualified in this area 
who have to work with the food inspection people choose their own 
representatives.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7458"> 7458 </A></B>
<P>
	So the minister is making sure he can control the members of the 
advisory board and influence their decisions. That is pretty 
obvious. When you give a job to  your friends, they can hardly turn 
around later on and bite the hand that feeds them.
<P>
	In subclause 10(5), it says that the minister will fix the fees paid 
to the members of the advisory board. However, I may point out 
that in clause 8, it says that the president and the executive 
vice-president shall be paid such remuneration as is fixed by the 
governor in council. The question is whether this is a mere 
technicality or whether it is some kind of double standard that 
could lead to discrimination. This clause is unacceptable for 
another reason.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Clause 12 provides that the agency is a separate employer under 
the Public Service Staff Relations Act. Clause 13 provides that the 
president has the authority to appoint employees to the agency. 
When the bill was studied in committee, officials confirmed that 
there would be a code of conduct, of ethics, governing the 
appointment of agency employees. The thing is, however, that we 
will not know the content of the code before the bill is passed. It 
reminds me of the code of ethics of the ministers opposite: they 
have a fine code of ethics to show that everything they do is proper, 
except no one knows what the code is. It is completely ridiculous. 
What is the use of a code of ethics when people cannot even find 
out what it is about? Here again, it serves to score political points.
<P>
	The officials told us that the usual rules governing hiring in the 
public service would be suspended during the transition period. 
Why do we not know what rules will be used?
<P>
	We note therefore that patronage-discrimination even-will 
abound in the future Canadian Food Inspection Agency. This is 
why the Bloc Quebecois has proposed reasonable amendments to 
prevent the federal government from abusing its power in this 
matter.
<P>
	As I said earlier, we simply want to make a constructive 
contribution. I do not want to foul things up. So long as we are 
paying taxes to Ottawa, I want to be sure this country is run the best 
way possible. I am here to work, to improve bills while we are still 
here. I see these sorts of things, and then people ask me why we 
want to have our own country.
<P>
	At some point, people have to try to understand more. As I said 
earlier, we wonder why people are not more interested in politics. I 
think it is because of this sort of thing.
<P>
	Our colleague from Frontenac has contributed constructively. I 
would therefore invite the government to give it some thought, and 
perhaps we could work more together.

	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week a very active and giving member of my riding of Brampton 
was tragically murdered.
<P>
	Martha MacDonald was a caregiver with Brampton Caledon 
Community Living, an organization that offers support to mentally 
and physically disadvantaged people living on their own. She was a 
regular volunteer at the Ste. Louise Outreach Centre, a local food 
bank, and an active political participant. Her enthusiasm and 
passion will be missed.
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents I offer my deepest condolences to 
the family and friends of Martha MacDonald.
<P>
	In early November, Martha participated in a public forum on 
justice issues which I hosted in my riding of Brampton. She was 
quite vocal at this community event about the need for greater 
attention to the epidemic of violence against women. It is a very 
sad irony for me personally that this is my last memory of Martha 
MacDonald. Her comments foreshadowed the very tragic and 
unfair end to her life.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Monday, I asked the Prime Minister to make the commitment that 
his government would give the port of Trois-Rivières the status of 
Canada port authority. I have been informed that the Minister of 
Transport confirmed this morning, in a letter, that the port of 
Trois-Rivières would become a CPA.
<P>
	There is no need to thank the federal government for that since 
the port of Trois-Rivières meets all the established criteria. As the 
minister representing the Mauricie region, the Prime Minister had 
the responsibility of ensuring, right from the start, that the port of 
Trois-Rivières would be given CPA status since it meets all the 
established criteria. His responsibility was to do that and not to 
make a pitch for some local personality through various means.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Prime Minister voluntarily ignored the second 
part of my question concerning the $12  million accumulated by the 
port of Trois-Rivières. The Bloc Quebecois is concerned about that 
and demands that the government leave this money for the

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to applaud the sincere and tireless efforts of the 
members of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Especially at 
Christmas, MADD reminds us with a red ribbon campaign of the 
tragic consequences of drinking and driving.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	I commend MADD for effectively changing the attitudes of the 
public toward what used to be an acceptable social occurrence, 
getting behind the wheel of a vehicle after drinking.
<P>
	However, the social pressure will not be enough to curb the high 
percentage of repeat offenders whose problems are more than bad 
judgment.
<P>
	As a society we also have a responsibility to eradicate the 
ravages of drunk driving by addressing the cause, not only the 
effect.
<P>
	Statistics show that up to 70 per cent of the drivers who cause 
death and injury through impaired driving do have alcohol 
problems.
<P>
	Therefore I say it is time to enforce rehabilitation, even 
involuntarily, to prevent future tragic deaths. We must, as well, 
pass legislation like Motion No. 78 which will deal with this 
serious offence effectively.
<P>
	Today I am again wearing my pin in honour of Cindy Verhulst, a 
young woman from Mission in my riding whose life was tragically 
cut short by a drunk driver.

	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
the House today to pay tribute to a special Canadian music legend. 
Many will recognize the name Wilf Carter, but perhaps he was best 
known to his fans as Montana Slim.
<P>
	Wilf Carter was born December 18, 1904 in Port Hilford, Nova 
Scotia and died one week ago at the age of 91.
<P>
	Wilf Carter was inspired at an early age by a yodeller who was 
passing through town. Wilf developed his own unique three in one 
or echo yodel, which became his trademark in the music industry.
<P>
	His famous yodel sparked his career, a career that spanned six 
decades and kept him on the road well into his eighties.
<P>
	Wilf began his career while working in the grain fields of 
Alberta, singing at local dances, bunkhouses and parties.
<P>
	Wilf was such a hit in the prairies that the Canadian Pacific 
Railway hired him to entertain trail riders on their summer packing 
trips through the Rockies.
<P>
	One of his songs that I recall is ``It makes no difference now''. 
The truth is his career made a difference, for Wilf Carter was a 
legend in his own time.
<P>
	On behalf of all Canadians and all those who knew him, we offer 
his family our deepest condolences. Gone but never forgotten.

community north of Tokyo. Rupert Evans, Royal Buchanan, Bill 
Power and Dan Babcock spent six weeks in Japan on the project 
while enjoying the warm hospitality of their Japanese hosts.
<P>
	The material and human expertise required to build the home 
were Canadian. Mr. Evans and his team amazed their hosts with 
their aptitude and dedication. They accomplished in six weeks a 
project which normally takes months in Japan. Rupert Evans and 
his construction team showed the Japanese what Canadian hard 
work and initiative are all about. Their efforts have stimulated 
demand for Canadian resources and skill in this field.
<P>
	We are opening doors to other markets, we are expanding 
opportunity for Canadian business and we are establishing good 
relations with foreign governments to facilitate trade.

<P>
	A large group of islanders are concerned about a rash of criminal 
acts that has occurred on Prince Edward Island. The worst was the 
repeated sexual abuse of a three-year old girl in which the rapist 
suggested that she was actually the aggressor. We find that hard to

	These petitioners call on Parliament to review the penalties

and should be increased to provide a deterrent to protect the most

Bois-de-Belle-Rivière as a tourist area. The city of Mirabel has 
already said it is interested in protecting local plant and animal life. 
It has even created a corporation, called CPEM, that is responsible

Liberals that their proposed senior's benefit which places a 50 per

<P>
	The Liberals do not listen to Canadians but they will not be able 
to ignore the voice of Canadian senior citizens who will align 
themselves at the ballot box in the next election. Canadian seniors 
will not stand for the 50 per cent tax rate on their income.
<P>
	Not only are the Liberals planning to attack OAS, they are also 
attacking the Canada pension plan. They plan to triple taxes for the 
CPP and cut seniors' pensions in half.

Reform Party of Canada. We are committed to rescuing the CPP 
and guaranteeing that every senior citizen receives every penny 
that he or she is entitled to under the Canada pension plan.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians have heard a lot this week about the Prime Minister's 
broken promises. The Prime Minister broke his promise to 
Canadians on the GST, on jobs, on the CBC and on many other 
issues. Some Canadians even say he lied, but today he went well 
beyond broken promises-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, we had a similar situation 
yesterday. We cannot say through someone else's words what we 
ourselves cannot say in this House. I judge that word to be 
unparliamentary and I would ask the hon. member to withdraw it 
forthwith.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. Thank you.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to withdraw the 
word.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. Of course I withdraw 
the word.
<P>
	Today the Prime Minister is breaking not just a promise but a 
fundamental trust with aboriginal people in this country.
<P>
	In 1969 he tried to assimilate aboriginal people with the 
recommendations of the white paper report. Now, 27 years later, 
changes are being introduced to the Indian Act which are not 
accepted by the First Nations of this country. Five hundred and 
eighty out of six hundred and thirty-three chiefs and councils say 
they were not consulted about this process.
<P>
	Following the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples which came out just days ago, it is time for the government 
to finally listen to aboriginal people, to consult aboriginal people, 
and not to make unilateral changes to the Indian Act.
<P>
	Aboriginal people are asking for a new relationship with Canada. 
Let us see the Prime Minister keep his promise this time.

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we learned 
this morning that IBM, CGI and the Informission Group, have just 
formed a consortium dedicated to solving the computer conversion 
problem before the beginning of year 2000.
<P>
	Informission Group's RECYC 2000 software was chosen to 
adapt the computer systems to enter the third millennium. The 
consortium intends to create a software conversion centre which 
could be established in Informission's engineering centre, in 
Quebec City.
<P>
	The activities of the consortium should create at least 1,000 jobs 
in Quebec over the next three years.
<P>
	Skilled workers, an efficient R &amp; D assistance strategy and an 
aggressive approach on international markets are the factors which 
allow Canada to attract projects like this consortium. 
Congratulations and good luck.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to inform you that the Port of Montreal will 
finish up the year 1996 in very good shape.
<P>
	By the end of the year, there will be a 3 per cent increase in cargo 
handled. There was a spectacular 10 per cent jump in the volume of 
container traffic during the first 11 months of the year.
<P>
	This increase is attributable to shipowners' confidence in 
Montreal's port facilities and in the quality of services available 
there. It is important to remember that a good part of this increase 
came about at the expense of the ports of New York and Baltimore.
<P>
	The port authority is expected to post a net profit for the 
seventeenth year in a row. This profit should be in the 
neighbourhood of $11 million.
<P>
	We pay tribute to the work of the port's administrators and we 
urge them to keep up the good work they are doing as the engine of 
Montreal's economy.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="POVERTY">POVERTY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, Statistics Canada published figures showing 
that there were five million Canadians living under the poverty 
line, a 38 per cent increase since 1989. There are 1.4 million 
children living in poverty in Canada, 45 per cent more than in 1989.
<P>
	Not only are families not getting any richer, but their average 
income has gone down by $2,800 since 1989, and this is before the 
new EI system comes into the picture and further reduces their 
standard of living.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister aware that it is incumbent on him as Prime 
Minister to do a little more for the poor than wish them ``Good 
luck'', which was all he had to say the other evening on television 
to those seeking work?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what we said when we formed the government was that 
we had a terrible situation on our hands.
<P>
	The government found itself facing an annual deficit of $42 
billion. If we had not taken steps to correct this situation, there was 
a danger that the social programs that exist for the protection of the 
poorest members of Canadian society might disappear.
<P>
	We took the bull by the horns-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, ha.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Yes we did, and we sorted out 
the problem of the deficit better than people thought we would.
<P>
	What we are seeing today is that, in order to be able to create 
jobs so that people in difficulty can provide their families with the 
necessities of life, we must contend with the lowest interest rates in 
40 years. We have an economy with the lowest rate of inflation in 
many years. The conditions are there for the economy to create the 
jobs that will make it possible for the most disadvantaged members 
of society to provide for their families, in particular their children, 
as they would like, in so far as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is somewhat unfortunate that the Prime Minister sees it 
as a choice between reducing the deficit and helping people find 
work.
<P>
	We have explained to him how taxation reform alone would free 
up $3 billion for active job creation. We are not criticizing the 
Prime Minister for trying to reduce the deficit. We are, however, 
criticizing his lack of imagination when it comes to creating jobs 
and helping people find work.
<P>
	The Prime Minister was outraged when former Prime Minister 
Kim Campbell said during an election campaign that the rate of 
unemployment in Canada would not drop below 10 per cent. The 
Prime Minister had a lot to say about that on the campaign trail. Is 
the Prime Minister more comfortable with an unemployment rate 
of 10 per cent now that he is holding the reins?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in January 1994, the rate of unemployment was 11.5 per 
cent and it was brought down to 9.4 per cent last year. 
Unfortunately, it has now gone back up to 10 per cent, but if OECD 
and IMF forecasts are any indication, we will have the best 
economic growth of all G-7 countries in 1997.
<P>
	We believe that the unemployment rate is going to drop. But we 
have set up programs. For example, despite  the financial difficul-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7463"> 7463 </A></B>
<P>
ties faced by the government, we introduced an infrastructure 
program in our first few months in office. You will recall that Mrs. 
Campbell said at the time that it was a ridiculous program, and 
members of this House used the opportunity to-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would remind you always to address 
your comments to the Chair.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, through you, I voice my indignation at the government's 
actions.
<P>
	Let us jog the Prime Minister's memory. Since the beginning of 
the year, and I hope the Prime Minister understands what I am 
getting at, through you, the number of unemployed in Canada has 
increased faster than the number of new full time jobs: 121,000 
more people unemployed, but only 106,000 new jobs. The 
government is unable to meet the public's needs.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister able to understand that, if the situation 
continues to deteriorate in this way, it is because his government is 
not guiding the economic recovery, is not stepping in, is creating 
only a paltry number of jobs, and dead end ones at that, and 
because, to top it all off, UI cutbacks will take effect in January? 
This will be a terrible blow to the poorest members of our society, 
and it is the government's fault.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Unfortunately, 
Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition has got the numbers 
wrong. Since the beginning of the year, even thouh there has been a 
loss of around 45,000 jobs in the public sector, over 200,000 new 
jobs were created in the private sector in Canada.
<P>
	Furthermore, in the preamble to his first question, the Leader of 
the Opposition spoke about family income. I would like to tell him 
that the truth of the matter is that family income has gone up since 
we came to office in 1993. Before then, family income had dropped 
dramatically during the recession between 1989 and 1991. But 
since we have come to office, not only have we halted this decline, 
but we have seen family income start to climb.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if family income is the topic, family income is $2,800 
lower than in 1989. These are Statistics Canada figures.
<P>
	There are, however, limits to the statistical juggling that can be 
done, like the Minister of Finance's statement he has just made, 
telling us we are one of the top countries in the world where job 
creation is concerned and promising that the situation will 
improve. There are limits to everything.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. What is his answer, he 
who is so fond of international bodies, to the OECD's statement 
that Canada ranks 17th out of 26  industrialized countries with its 
1996 unemployment rate? What is the Prime Minister's answer to 
Statistics Canada, which is telling us that there were more newly 
unemployed people that new full time jobs in 1996? That is what 
Statistics Canada said.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>I have before 
me the figures for average family incomes in Canada. In 1989, the 
average annual family income was $58,000. In 1993, when we 
came to office after three years of Conservative government, the 
annual income had dropped from $58,000 to $54,000. Today, it is 
going back up, at $55,000.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Minister of Finance wants to talk statistics, that is 
what Statistics Canada is there for. We can see that, for 20 per cent 
of poorest families, the income is more or less unchanged, and that 
for the richest families it has risen, while for the middle class it 
continues to decrease. This is what the Statistics Canada figures 
show.
<P>
	I think that the Prime Minister still has a chance to help those 
who are becoming more and more familiar with poverty, and he can 
do before certain measures of the new Employment Insurance Act 
are implemented.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Could he not suspend implementation of employment insurance 
reform measures which end up impoverishing the unemployed by 
taking billions of dollars away from them in order to wipe the 
deficit slate of the Minister of Finance clean?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are measures to that effect. For instance, the changes 
we have proposed concerning employment legislation. We have 
guaranteed a 25 per cent minimum to families, which is a far better 
guarantee than the one in place before, because we are concerned 
about their situation.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CBCTOWNHALL">CBC TOWN HALL</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister's disastrous performance at the CBC 
town hall has sent the Liberal spin doctors into damage control 
mode. They have now suggested the CBC, a federal crown 
corporation established by an act of this House, rigged the town 
hall, purposely stacking it with hostile questioners who did not 
reflect the concerns of Canadians.
<P>
	Unemployment, job security, the GST and national unity are the 
concerns of real Canadians. The questions raised at the town hall 
do reflect the worries and anger felt by 1.5 million Canadians who 
are unemployed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7464"> 7464 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister really think the CBC rigged that town 
hall and that Canadians are not really concerned about jobs, about 
taxes, and about national unity?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did not say that the town hall was rigged. It is the first 
time that a Prime Minister has gone on a program like that for an 
hour in French and an hour in English. If I was afraid to face the 
situation, I could very easily have stayed at home. I am not afraid to 
talk to the Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I replied to all their questions. I 
told them that it is not easy to run a country. When we started as a 
government three years ago the people were telling us that Canada 
was virtually a third world country in terms of its finances. But I 
was happy to report to the people of Canada that night that now we 
are considered the best of the G-7 because we took the challenge.
<P>
	I do not deny that there were people there who would like to 
work but cannot find a job. We are working on that. It is our 
priority. That is why we have established programs to improve the 
situation. Another credit to the nation is that Canada created 
672,000 new jobs in the last three years. But that is not enough. We 
have to keep working on that and it is exactly what we will do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we find it curious that the Prime Minister's colleagues 
stood when he said he should have stayed at home.
<P>
	Canadians have every right to hold the Prime Minister 
accountable for his broken campaign promises on the GST. But that 
is extremely difficult when the Prime Minister's handlers keep him 
in a bubble, away from the public. We can understand why they do 
that, because the last time they let him out he attacked a 
demonstrator, told a bunch of kids in Winnipeg about imaginary 
friends and he ended up abusing Canadians at a town hall meeting.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would invite the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest to put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the Prime Minister is not afraid to 
attend town hall meetings, will he assure the House and all 
Canadians that he will not retreat back into his bubble, that he will 
present himself at more town hall meetings and public forums 
where Canadian voters can hold him accountable for his actions 
and his deeds?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, not long ago I was challenged by his seatmate. We have a 
debate here every week and I am in the House more than many 
other members of Parliament.
<P>
	With regard to the preamble to his question, it is no wonder the 
leader of the third party is affected because the support which the 
people of Canada have for him is going down month after month.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue here is accountability. The Prime Minister 
should expect to be held accountable to the 1.5 million unemployed 
for saying: ``That's life, lots of luck, try harder''.
<P>
	In the last election when Kim Campbell said that unemployment 
would remain at double digits until the next century, she accepted 
the unacceptable and paid the price. By saying ``that's life'' to 1.5 
million unemployed, the Prime Minister is also accepting the 
unacceptable and he will pay the price.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister, like Kim Campbell, consider the 
present levels of unemployment acceptable and the status quo is 
good enough? Is that the real reason he rejects public criticism of 
his jobs policy?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we came to power the first thing we did was have an 
infrastructure program to create jobs. That was strongly opposed 
by the Conservatives. As the House will recall, it was opposed by 
the hon. member who is the leader of the third party.
<P>
	After the program was established he was the first one to come to 
the government for money to create jobs in Calgary. I do not blame 
him, but it shows that as long as there are people who want to work, 
this government will be working to create jobs for them.

question is directed to the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Minister of Industry tried to downplay the 
serious allegations against the president of the space agency and his 
executive vice-president. The minister wanted to put the blame on 
Mario Rinaldi, the former vice-president and comptroller of the 
space agency. In fact, the latter was fired for having criticized a 
number of dubious practices at the space agency.
<P>
	Does the minister admit that Mario Rinaldi, then vice-president 
and comptroller of the space agency, was suspended from his 
position because he revealed some dubious practices of his 
executive vice-president, Alain Desfossés, to Mr. Evans, president 
of the agency?

	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister  responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is clear that the allegations the hon. member keeps 
making are in fact the complaints of a discontented former 
employee of the agency, one of four vice-presidents-the 
vice-presidential positions having been eliminated in a 
reorganization of the agency-who is unhappy because he is no 
longer employed in the agency.
<P>
	He has indicated that he wants to take legal action against the 
Canadian Space Agency. It is his right to do so. In the meantime, it 
is very inappropriate for a member to make accusations on the floor 
of the House where people being accused are not in a position to 
defend themselves. The issues will be resolved in a court of law.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
can the minister hide behind a grievance, when the people against 
whom these serious allegations were made are still with the space 
agency, unless he wants to protect his former adviser, Mr. Evans?

questions.
<P>

<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to please put her question.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> This is my question, then. Does the minister want 
to hide his appointee, Mr. Evans? Does he want to protect Mr. 
Evans, the person he himself appointed president of the space 
agency?

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Merry Christmas, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is trying desperately to convince Canadians 
that he never ever promised to scrap, kill or abolish the GST, but on 
television, radio and in newspapers he has said quite clearly that he 
would scrap, kill or abolish the GST. Again I say that tapes do not 
lie.
<P>
	As Richard Nixon said in the United States: ``I am not a crook 
and I did not erase the tapes'', I am sure this Prime Minister wishes 
desperately he could erase the tapes. He cannot erase the tapes, so 
why does he not just admit that he blew it and apologize?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish they would quote the whole situation.
<P>
	For example, yesterday she referred to what I said in the House 
about killing the GST on May 2, 1994 before we referred the 
problem to the committee. I said: ``We are trying to change the 
GST to replace it with a fairer system of taxation''. That is all I 
said. We referred the problem to the committee and the committee 
recommended harmonization, which was mentioned in the red 
book. It was recommended as being the best course to take. A 
month later, in December of this year, the Reform Party, on page 
131 of its minority report, said: ``Integration of the provincial sales 
tax and the GST and tax in pricing are desirable in principle and 
Reform has supported this policy''.
<P>
	In that context we said we would replace the GST with a tax that 
would be integrated with provincial taxes.
<P>
	Look at what is happening in Newfoundland, for example. 
Rather than paying 20 per cent, they will be paying 15 per cent next 
year under harmonization. That is different from the GST. It is a 
different tax. It is integrated.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
might get wild cheers from his caucus, but it sure as heck did not go 
down the other night at the CBC town hall meeting.
<P>
	On April 26 of this year in this House the finance minister said 
about the GST: ``We made a mistake. It was an honest mistake''. I 
think people respect him for that. Even the Deputy Prime Minister 
admitted that she made a mistake. It took a while, but she finally 
resigned over the GST. The only person in here who stubbornly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7466"> 7466 </A></B>
<P>
clings to the illusion that the Liberals did not promise to scrap, kill 
or abolish the GST is the Prime Minister, who is whistling and 
dancing right now.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister not join with his colleagues, the 
finance minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, stand and say to 
this House, say to the CBC so it can be played on the news tonight 
and say to the people whom he scorned in the town hall meeting the 
other night: ``I blew it. I am sorry. We made a mistake''?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
virtually every time a member of the Reform Party stands to ask a 
question, the member contradicts their party's established position.
<P>
	The Prime Minister yesterday and today read from the Reform 
Party's report on the GST its unequivocal support for 
harmonization. He has read its unequivocal support for tax in 
pricing. Yet day after day members of the Reform Party stand and 
contradict it.
<P>
	There is another question the Prime Minister might ask them. 
Members of the Reform Party stand and say that they would like to 
see tax cuts. Perhaps the members of the Reform Party would then 
tell us why is it in their report on the GST that they advocated the 
base be broadened to tax food and drug products?

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr.

each time we raise the question of the space agency, he adopts one 
of two attitudes. Either he makes light of the matter, saying: ``That 
is nothing, just bits of paper'', or he goes up the wall, pulls himself 
up to his full height and lets opposition members have it.

are not in a position to defend themselves here.
<P>
	The member, who ought to know better, just made an allegation 
with respect to an overpayment of $557.82-just so we have some 
perspective on the amounts here: $375.85 for unpaid leave and 
$181.97 for two days of work-to a former agency employee who 
was subsequently hired in my office as a political adviser. Although 
the overpayment was a result of paperwork relating to the transfer 
of the employee from the agency and although the question was in 
some doubt, because that person is of high character and did not 
want to be associated with anything that could be embarrassing, she 
gave the benefit of the doubt to the agency and repaid the amount in 
question. And these people raise it on the floor of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, she may have repaid the money, but after the refusal to 
backdate a document.
<P>
	What causes concern in all of this is the incestuous relationship 
between the space agency and cabinet. The minister's adviser left 
cabinet to go to the space agency, and Diana Durnford left the space 
agency to join cabinet. The minister's credibility is a source of 
considerable embarrassment in this matter.
<P>
	I would like to ask him now, and I hope he listens carefully, 
whether today, from his seat, he can tell us if he himself looked into 
Mr. Rinaldi's allegations before saying they were totally false?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course in my responsibilities as minister I would ask 
the agency for a full explanation of all of the allegations. I have 
received that explanation.
<P>
	I have just described in detail how silly one of the allegations is. 
The same is characteristic of the allegations that were repeated in 
previous days by the member for Saint-Hubert. I am satisfied that 
there is nothing wrong.

	However, I point out again that Mr. Rinaldi will have his day 
in court. If he has been unfairly treated, a court will decide that 
and I presume he will be rewarded in damages. But in the 
meantime, to cast aspersions of this sort is simply unfair, 
unfounded and I would suggest improper.

	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister. I would like to refer him to 
page 90 of the red book. He said: ``If a government is to play a 
positive role in society, as it must, honesty and integrity in our 
political institutions must be restored''.
<P>
	Today Canadians from coast to coast are calling into question the 
integrity and credibility of the Government of Canada. How does 
the Prime Minister reconcile his promise of governing with 
integrity with his broken GST promise?
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy he has the red book. He should read the page 
where we stated we would integrate the GST with the provinces 
through harmonization. It is stated in the red book and it is exactly 
what this government is doing at this time. We have signed an 
agreement with three provinces and are about to sign a fourth one. 
We are progressing in replacing this tax with an integrated tax.
<P>
	I gave the example of Newfoundland where the people were 
paying 20 per cent tax. Next year they will only be paying 15 per 
cent. This is a change from what existed before. This is exactly 
what we said we would do in the red book from which the member 
is reading.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I think what is compounding the problem is that the Prime Minister 
refuses to recognize what his promise was. He has now had the 
opportunity to review both the audio and video tapes. Not only did 
he promise Canadians that he would scrap the GST, he also 
promised caucus on a number of occasions that he would scrap the 
GST. How does he reconcile his promises to the people of Canada 
and the caucus with his broken promises?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish the hon. member would turn to the page in the book 
about the GST and read to the House of Commons what the 
promise was that this party made to the people of Canada. We 
always said that we wanted to replace the GST with a harmonized 
tax. This is exactly what we are trying to do at this time. We are not 
progressing as fast as we would like.
<P>
	The Government of Ontario at the beginning of its tenure said it 
wanted to have the integration of the two taxes but it has not signed 
yet. Some day Ontario will sign the agreement and will have the 
same situation as that in the maritimes.
<P>
	The hon. member cannot even read back to the House of 
Commons what he campaigned on when he ran in the last election.

	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance benefits of workers who were laid 
off when the Kenworth plant in Sainte-Thérèse closed last April 
have now run out. What a wonderful Christmas present it would be 
for these workers to have the plant reopen, now that the unions and 
the Quebec government have finally reached an agreement with 
PACCAR. All that is missing is co-operation from Ottawa, without 
which nothing can happen.
<P>
	Since this is a matter of some urgency, will the minister 
undertake to approve before Christmas the financial support 
required to re-equip the plant and retrain the manpower?
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we 
know, discussions have indeed taken place since the Kenworth 
plant closed. There were discussions in Quebec City between 
representatives of PACCAR, the Quebec government and the 
Canadian government, which I represented.
<P>
	The negotiations are going well. The word is that the end may be 
in sight. There are still a number of elements regarding the business 
plans that the Canadian government is waiting for. When we have 
received all the information, we will be able to make our position 
known. At this stage, it is too early to take a position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the unions certainly do not think it would be too early if it 
happened before Christmas.
<P>
	One month after the government granted Canadian Airlines a 
$20 million tax rebate, could the minister show be as understanding 
about customs duties owed by Kenworth, which stand in the way of 
the plant reopening?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find the 
official opposition's position difficult to understand. There are

Radio-Canada International is Canada's fair and balanced voice 
around the world. Most of us recognize and know that it will cease 
operations on March 31, 1997. This will mean that Canada will be 
the only industrial nation worldwide without a voice on the

intend to do to preserve Radio-Canada International not just for the 
short term, but for the long term?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we certainly recognize how important it is to have an 
effective voice for Canada abroad to promote trade, development, 
culture and the other values of Canada. To pursue that we in the 
government are working on a broader strategy to use new 
technologies and all the assets we have. We recognize that 
Radio-Canada is an important element of that.
<P>
	In light of the funding changes CBC had to make, we recognize 
that we have to fill in a gap during the time that we work on the 
broader strategy. We can say that through the work of the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, other ministers and myself, we will be able 
to provide ongoing funding for RCI and at the same time help it 
convert to a new instrument for Canada's voice abroad to present

terms of getting a response.
<P>
	The <I>Globe and Mail</I> told us today that the government is 
planning to proceed with allowing multiple licensing for fishing on

on the west coast have indicated they are against this proposal.
<P>
	With the same enthusiasm that the government called for a vote 
by the Canadian Auto Workers regarding Canadian Airlines 
International, will the government now follow suit by agreeing to 
what the fishers on the west  coast and the Government of British 
Columbia are calling for, which is to have a vote before the 
government proceeds with this issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is referring to the Fryer report which 
was released today. It talks about a number of things and a number 
of areas in which action should be taken in support of the 
fishermen, the fish and the coastal communities.
<P>
	I have to tell the hon. member that he did not put all the 
information to the House. The recommendation made by Mr. Fryer, 
who was the third independent party, essentially was that there was 
an agreement reached on November 27 among the three parties, 
federal, provincial and the third party, that a vote would take place. 
But that vote would take place at the end of 1997, not now.

	I think it only fair to advise the House that the government sees it 
as clearly being in the public interest that some of these bills be 
finally disposed of before Christmas and if circumstances compel 
the House to sit next week to do this, we are prepared to take the 
necessary action to bring this about. I am certain that nobody here

<P>
	During question period, the Minister of Industry commented 
erroneously on my participation in the activities of the 
Canada-NATO Parliamentary Association, which took place last 
November 18 to 20. I was present at those activities.
<P>
	In addition, the minister implied that I had wasted taxpayers' 
money by not taking part in the activities and meetings of the 
association, when in fact I was present. Furthermore, I would like 
the minister to note that I was seen there by the Liberal members 
for Nipissing, Hillsborough, Saint-Denis, Mississauga West and 
South Shore, as well as by Senator Rompkey. I certainly had 
enough witnesses.
<P>
	I therefore ask the Minister of Industry to withdraw his

Speaker, let me make one thing very clear.
<P>
	If there is one thing that I consider to be despicable and beyond 
reproach, it is to make accusations of people who are not in a 
position to defend themselves. I admit I accused-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Cheap.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> There is a bird in the front row over there. I 
accused the member for Saint-Hubert, based on information that I 
received from two of the members of the committee that she has 
just cited.
<P>
	If she is prepared to stand in the House and say in the presence of 
all of us that she attended the working sessions and not only the 
social sessions of the Canada-NATO Parliamentary Association in 
Paris, that she attended the plenary session and voted on the 
resolutions, then I abjectly apologize to her.
<P>
	I wish that she would accord to others the right to be able to 
answer accusations that are made of them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I think it is now clear. Accusations were made. He 
said he was mistaken.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are trying to clarify a situation. Let me put everything into 
perspective as I understand it. During the course of question period, 
the hon. Minister of Industry raised a point about whether another 
hon. member attended some meetings that had to do with NATO.
<P>
	The hon. member, who was mentioned, stood in her place and 
said that she was at all the meetings. That was her position. I then 
asked the hon. minister if he would clarify what he said and, in my 
view, he said that if the hon. member claimed that she was there, 
and she did, she said in front of all of us that she was there and she 
did everything, I can only accept the member's word.
<P>
	Having accepted her word, the hon. minister said that he abjectly 
apologizes and withdraws. In the absence of any other information, 
unless there is more information, I have an accusation and a 
withdrawal. I do not want to get into an open debate.
<P>
	This is a question of privilege and the hon. member has asked 
and the statement has been withdrawn. In my view, the statement 
has been withdrawn.

Minister of Industry withdraw his statement?

period is run; the order of the questions, the rotation and how it 
goes from one party to the next.
<P>
	During question period after the fourth question from the official 
opposition you then go to a Liberal member and then normally to a 
Reform member. Mr. Speaker, this time you failed to recognize the 
fourth member of the Reform Party and I wondered why. We had a 
member standing who was not recognized.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I consider that to be a reasonable question. There 
has been an agreement for three years that we have gone to. When I 
come to the ninth question, which is the fewest questions I believe 
we have had in this session, I usually go to an independent member. 
That is the reason why today in my judgment I went to the 
independent member for Kamloops. That is a reasonable question.

have ruled on that and we are beyond that now.
<P>
	I am talking about a point of order here. Let me clear up this 
point of order and I will return to the hon. member's question of 
privilege. I am going to the hon. member for Sherbrooke on a point 
of order.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is on 
the same point of order. I was interested in the remarks made by the 
whip of the Reform Party about question period and how it 
operates. This is fundamental to the very workings of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Sherbrooke has the floor. I 
would like to listen to him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was about to say, my 
understanding of question period is that this is very much the 
preserve of the Speaker. You will know that taking instructions 
from the party as far as I am concerned and as far as my knowledge 
of the rules and the traditions of this place is concerned is a direct 
contradiction.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> As I was saying, this is a direct contradiction of 
the role of the Speaker which consists of first and foremost of 
protecting the rights of the individual member of Parliament. That 
being said, I noticed during question period something unusual in 
that the member for York South-Weston, if I understood correctly, 
was given a position in question period by agreement with 
members of the Reform Party who substituted one of their 
members with the member for York South-Weston. With the 
complicity of members of the Reform Party, who are now 
controlling the order of questioners that you, Mr. Speaker-
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I address myself to the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke. I thank him for his vote of confidence. Ultimately the 
Speaker has to take responsibility for question period, and I do.
<P>
	At the time when I was looking for a questioner, I looked to the 
House and the member for York South-Weston was on his feet. 
No one else was on their feet-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I can see we are going to get into a protracted 
discussion on this, but today I recognized the hon. member for 
York South-Weston and I take complete responsibility for that.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we all know how it works here in the House. There is an 
agreement between the parties, and the Speaker protects the rights 
of independent members. It is very clear that today the member for 
York South-Weston worked out an agreement with the Reform 
Party so that he could have a turn to speak.
<P>
	The member for York South-Weston has been successful in his 
attempt to join the Reform Party, unlike the member for 
Sherbrooke who tried to do the same thing almost one year ago. It 
is as simple as that.

on the point of order raised by the hon. member for Sherbrooke, I 
would concur with what the hon. member has said.
<P>
	We certainly accept, Mr. Speaker, your intervention that you are 
in fact responsible for question period and we abide by your 
rulings, but I would hope that in the  future, if the practice is going 
to be what the hon. member for Sherbrooke has said, that perhaps 
there could be a fuller debate among all the political parties and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7471"> 7471 </A></B>
<P>
members in order that we fully understand the practices which are 
going to commence.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Sherbrooke has said, if these cozy 
relationships between the Reform Party and the hon. member for 
York South-Weston are to take place, I think the House should be 
informed of them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when you were 
instructing the hon. member for Sherbrooke, he said very loudly 
and distinctly: ``That's a lot of bull''. I suggest that he withdraw 
that statement.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want the record to be very clear 
with regard to this whole episode. The Minister of Health is 
absolutely right with regard to the precedent that has just been set 
in this House. This precedent goes to the very fundamental rules of 
how the House works, of democracy itself within this place and of 
the role the Speaker plays with regard to the rights of the individual 
members.
<P>
	As of today the record shows that a deal was entered into 
between the Reform Party and an independent member so that the 
independent member could take up a position that a Reform Party 
member would have held normally in question period, and that the 
Speaker of the House of Commons complied with that instruction.
<P>
	That is what took place. I want to register the fact that this is the 
record. I think this is objectionable because with regard to the 
workings of the House of Commons this is a situation in which the 
Speaker of the House is yielding his responsibility to the parties, a 
responsibility that he must uphold and assume in the name of each 
member of this House and not in the interest of partisan politics 
within the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In these interventions on a point of order, as your 
Speaker I am ultimately responsible; there is no one else. I can 
categorically say that no matter what deals may be concocted, it 
would always rest on my decision as to who would be posing a 
question.
<P>
	I recognized the hon. member for York South-Weston. He was 
standing.
<P>
	Many times over the course of my time in the House, members 
have given way to other members who may want to place their 
questions. If the way question period is carried out is not 
acceptable, then I suggest perhaps the House leaders come together 
again and look over whatever agreement was arrived at some three 
years ago before I took the chair, and if it needs to be fine tuned, 
your Speaker is the servant of the House and I will continue to be.
<P>
	To my colleague from Sherbrooke, I find it rather sad that under 
these circumstances, if the hon. member did mean it as a rebuke to 
the Speaker of House, it would come out in this way. If the hon. 
member wishes to pursue the discussion, I would invite him, as I 
would invite all hon. members, to take up the discussion with me in 
my chambers. I would be very happy to hear what the hon. member 
has to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not mean to 
prolong this discussion but as I was sitting in this place near your 
chair, I observed the member for York South-Weston standing. 
No one else in this House stood at that time.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, you did not directly point him out. If the 
tapes are reviewed they would show there was a pause while you 
looked through the House. There was no indication that another 
member wished to speak at that point in time.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	I certainly do not understand the accusation brought from the 
member for Sherbrooke in that case because you had no choice at 
that time but to recognize the standing member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just 
for clarification so that those watching will know how the rules 
work, there is a schedule for the S. O. 31s, the one minute 
statements that precede question period. In times past we have 
given a spot to his co-worker, the hon. member for Saint John, who 
has spoken in a traditionally Reform spot because we knew she had 
something to say and we let her say it.
<P>
	In times past, the Bloc Quebecois has substituted in the member 
for Yukon in the Indian affairs committee, another member of a 
minority party who was substituted in on a Bloc's schedule. This is 
because members of Parliament have privileges that are exchanged 
and we help one another out if it is appropriate.
<P>
	Where we help out the member for Saint John on occasion or if 
somebody stands and is recognized in the House because no one 
else is standing, there is certainly nothing inappropriate. It 
certainly does not deserve the condemnation of the member for 
Sherbrooke who used the language he did to address the Chair.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I think this has gone on long enough. 
I would like to bring this point of order to a close.

	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a question of personal privilege in that I was named by the 
member for Saint-Hubert as someone  who would verify her 
attendance at all the NATO sessions. In fact, I was at a 12 hour 
voting session of NATO on the plenary session and the member 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7472"> 7472 </A></B>
<P>
was touring the Versaille with one of my assistants. So the member 
was not there.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have a member who has risen in this House 
and made a statement implicating another member of Parliament. I 
have ruled on one point of privilege, and that is behind us. I am 
dealing with another point of privilege where the member for 
Mississauga West has made a statement. The member she made a 
statement about is in the House now.
<P>
	If the hon. member for Saint-Hubert would like to make a 
statement of clarification, I invite her to do so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I 
most certainly would.
<P>
	The member for Mississauga West unfortunately did not take 
part in the activities of the Canada-Nato committee on Monday, 
November 18. She declined to fly to Toulouse with the committee, 
because, as she told us, she was already familiar with the facilities 
at L'Aérospatiale in any event.
<P>
	So I do not think the member has any business casting 
aspersions, since she herself did not participate in all the activities.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I think we are having just an ongoing debate. I 
would rule that this is not a point of privilege on either side and I 
would like to rest this here.
<P>
	I have a question of privilege that I am going to hear before the 
point of order. The hon. member for Sherbrooke on a question of 
privilege.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ORALQUESTIONPERIOD">ORAL QUESTION PERIOD</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, now that 
it has been confirmed that the Reform Party did enter into this 
agreement with the member for York South-Weston, my point of 
privilege is derived from the remarks that you have just made in 
regard to the functioning of question period.
<P>
	I return to the principle that is the cornerstone of the operation of 
government, the principle of the recognition of the rights of the 
individual member elected in his or her respective constituency 
with all the rights and privileges associated with that election.
<P>
	You have in your remarks, Mr. Speaker, just informed the House 
that if the House wished to review the operations or the functioning 
of question period, that there would be a consultation among the 
leaders of the recognized political parties.
<P>
	What am I to draw as an individual member, considered at least 
in this place as an independent member, from the remarks that you 
have just made? If I am to understand them correctly, it means that 
my rights in regard to the functioning of question period is 
something that will be negotiated by the respective leaders of the 
recognized parties in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Who will in that respect, Mr. Speaker, speak up for the rights of 
the individual member of Parliament? Who will at this point-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You are the one that made the deal, John.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Oh, please. Mr. Speaker, if I am allowed-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You have got your privileges too.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I want to hear the hon. member for Sherbrooke.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> In this respect, Mr. Speaker, if the leaders of the 
respective parties are given the opportunity to debate, to decide, to 
influence you in your decision in regard to how question period 
must function, when and at what point will the individual members 
for whom this is a basic cornerstone of the operations of Parliament 
be given equal rights and equal time? Surely you can see from 
those remarks how the basic rights and privileges of each member 
are affected, in particular my own rights and privileges.
<P>
	One remark, Mr. Speaker, with regard to rising or not rising. I 
hope the members will spare us the grand designs about members 
rising in this place when every day for the last three years members 
have been constantly designated for question period, not when they 
rose but actually were sitting right in their place and never rose. I 
hope we will be spared the great sermons about rising or not rising 
in their places.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an interesting question and I suppose you would have 
to rule whether or not it is a question of personal privilege, but 
certainly it is a question regarding the privileges of members of the 
House of Commons who keep the government accountable to the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	Having said that, the rules of this Chamber, as all members 
should realize, and the hon. member who just spoke should realize, 
are rules that have come to us by custom, that have come to us by 
precedent.
<P>
	Those very precedents on question period evolved over a long 
period of time and changed, Mr. Speaker, as you well know, very 
drastically in the past 10 years to the point where the major 
political parties do have assigned periods during question period. 
The role of the Speaker also has evolved to the point where the 
Speaker must follow those precedents and those customs as have  
evolved here in this Chamber, not in any other chamber under the 
so-called British parliamentary system, because each system is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7473"> 7473 </A></B>
<P>
different and each system has its own system of changing the rules 
of procedure for question period, as the Speaker so well knows.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	I am very surprised that the hon. member would rise in the 
Chamber and bring this up as a point of personal privilege. It was 
approximately seven years ago that we adopted as a custom in this 
Chamber the point of respecting designated questioners by the 
major political parties in this House. It was so left up to the Speaker 
that if the person designated for that political party did not stand, 
the Speaker was free to choose, as is stated in the rules, the person 
who catches the Speaker's eye who rises first. The Speaker has to 
follow those customs.
<P>
	The hon. member is perfectly correct. Perhaps we should take it 
under advisement and appoint a committee of people from outside 
the Chamber to examine the rules and to bring in some of the 
changes that are necessary to bring back the power of the 
individuals in the House of Commons. However, it is very 
surprising that the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party 
should be objecting to the very rules that were brought in while the 
Tories were the administration in power in this House.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to say also that I remember those days the member talked about. Of 
course I was an independent in the House seven years ago.
<P>
	I find it unbelievable that the member for Sherbrooke is talking 
about being hard done by. He and his party used to laugh and cajole 
every time I would try to stand. I thank the Lord for John Fraser 
who was the Speaker then. He told me: ``If you have a question, I 
will make sure that you get on''. I did not get on very often. I know 
that in the 34th Parliament I had exactly 15 questions, precious few, 
three or four a year, which is a darn sight less than what the 
independent member for Sherbrooke gets. It is unbelievable that he 
would cry foul on this.
<P>
	I know that our party as well as other parties in the House of 
Commons would be willing to make some of those changes so that 
independent members would get recognized more freely, but in the 
next Parliament so that it will not look quite so self serving that 
someone would want it now. There is nothing wrong with that.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I want to bring to your attention something you said 
earlier. When you stood up and said that the member for York 
South-Weston was the only member on his feet, the member for 
Sherbrooke hollered out: ``That is a lot of bull''. He challenged 
you, Mr. Speaker and he challenged the position of the Chair. He 
was asked by one of my colleagues to withdraw.
<P>
	I am asking you, because he respects the Chair as he certainly 
should, that he would withdraw the comment he hollered at you: 
``That is a lot of bull''. He did not holler it at another member of the 
House, but at you and you should not stand for it, Mr. Speaker. 
Please make him withdraw.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
really torn with this issue. The members for Sherbrooke, Beaver 
River, Gander-Grand Falls, the Minister of Health and others 
have already spoken to the issue.
<P>
	I think we would all agree that the direction the Speaker has 
given the House that if it is the wish of the membership of the 
House to reconsider some agreements or arrangements that were 
arrived at when we first came to this 35th Parliament 
approximately three years ago, that possibly it might be timely in 
the early part of the new year to sit down and have a discussion.
<P>
	Now specifically to the point raised by the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke regarding members outside of the official parties. I do 
not have the records, Mr. Speaker, but I would deem and feel 
confident in saying that those members who are outside of the 
``official parties'' at this time in this Parliament have had their 
privileges safeguarded, protected, defended by you the Speaker, 
and others as the member for Beaver River said earlier with regard 
to your predecessor, Mr. Fraser.
<P>
	I would hope that if the House chooses, it would make that 
undertaking to have those discussions among the parties as 
suggested so that we could put this matter to rest for the time being. 
I think we are all fatigued, we are all stressed. But certainly there 
should be no doubt in the confidence of the Chair and its speaker.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, in my view this is a debate. I 
know all hon. members wanted to participate in it but in my view it 
is probably time to move on.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member for Sherbrooke, with all 
respect, that this point was brought up by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Transcona early in the Parliament. At that time I did do a 
lot of thinking about it. As your Speaker, I have tried to be as fair as 
I can with all the members and parties, especially the independent 
members. I have always felt that it was my responsibility to see to 
it that the independent members had as much of a chance as anyone 
in the parties. I will continue to strive to do that. I would like to 
move on at this point.
<P>
	Is this a different point of order?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is about withdrawing ``bull''.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I did not hear the word. I would just 
as soon move on from here.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANFOODINSPECTIONAGENCYACT">CANADIAN FOOD INSPECTION AGENCY ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-60, an act to 
establish the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and to repeal and 
amend other Acts as a consequence, as reported by the committee 
with amendments, and of Motion No. 5.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am not raising a point of order. I will use the three minutes I have 
left to conclude my speech on Bill C-60, the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency Act.
<P>
	Earlier, I said I was very disappointed by what I heard when the 
hon. member for Frontenac asked members for their views on this 
legislation. The bill includes provisions that can certainly be 
associated with patronage. As I explained, the government appoints 
friends so as to remain in control.
<P>
	I said I was very disappointed, because it is always the same 
thing whenever the government introduces legislation. It comes up 
with a nice bill and with the best possible intentions, but we can 
always see this will to keep control over everything.
<P>
	The hon. member for Frontenac made very constructive remarks. 
I will conclude by saying that, in my opinion, the official 
opposition is not here only to oppose measures, but also to provide 
a different perspective, particularly since the Bloc Quebecois 
expresses the views shared by a large number of Quebecers.
<P>
	I am anxious to see which ministers will vote against the bill. As 
usual, unfortunately, it is a bit like taking the views of Quebec and 
claiming that they are totally erroneous.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to Bill C-60, an act to establish 
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Frontenac who did a tremendous job. He introduced a host of 
amendments to the bill which, as was to be expected from the hon. 
member, are based on common sense and the public interest.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Although the subject has not been widely publicized, it is a very 
important one that affects the daily lives of Canadians and 
Quebecers. The bill merges the inspection services of three 
departments, health, agriculture and fisheries, which from now on 
will be consolidated in one and the same agency that comes under 
the department of agriculture or the minister of agriculture.
<P>
	This agency will have an annual budget of $300 million-this is 
big bucks-for three years and a staff of 3,400 employees. That 
being said, now for the bad news: the three entities that existed 
before had a total of 4,000 employees, so we are losing 600 
inspectors. When we say $300 million, we must not forget that this 
reflects a budget cut of $44 million. So there is every reason to be 
concerned, but I will get back to that later.
<P>
	The general position of the Bloc Quebecois on this issue is 
negative. We are against the principle of creating this agency, 
because we in the Bloc Quebecois consider that constitutionally, 
this is an area that comes under provincial jurisdiction, in Quebec 
and in the other provinces. So we are against the very entity that 
will be established by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
<P>
	We are annoyed and concerned. Annoyed because considering 
the powers given to the minister by this bill, the minister will be 
able to appoint the chairperson, the deputy chair and all the 
members of the advisory board that will be created along with this 
agency. We are concerned because, as other members have already 
pointed out, this is a new patronage mill, and when we make this 
kind of remark to the government, it is clear we are referring to the 
patronage appointments made by the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	When we talk about patronage and the Liberal Party of Canada, 
we know what we are talking about, and so does everyone else. In 
Canada, in Quebec, for instance, returning officers, who play a very 
important role in our electoral process, are still appointed on an 
exclusively partisan basis. Nowadays we would have to look far 
and wide in Canada to find a returning officer without solid Liberal 
roots.
<P>
	We had another example today, when a new lieutenant-governor 
was appointed, a lady who probably comes from a good family and 
has the qualifications. I know she was president of the Quebec 
Office des personnes handicapées, but all of the insiders know that 
her greatest qualification is, no doubt, having been a Liberal Party 
of Canada candidate in the past. So her appointment today as 
lieutenant-governor of Quebec is because of her good Liberal 
connections, and we can be pretty sure that there has been no great 
consultation with the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	We had another example this morning, and another yesterday in 
my very own riding. It was announced, a bit prematurely because 
the official announcement had not been made, that the port of 
Trois-Rivières would be recognized as a Canadian port authority. 
And who was on the guest list? Two people who could not have 
been representing anything other than the Liberal Party of Canada. 
When it comes down to it, it is like an opening ceremony for a 
section of highway, a Cegep, a hospital or a CLSC in Quebec 
attended by a representative of the Parti Quebecois.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7475"> 7475 </A></B>
<P>
	That is not how we do things in Quebec, not even, I think, how 
the Quebec Liberals do things. Here we have an imperialist 
mentality, Mr. Speaker, which you no doubt recognize. We must 
speak out against it, because it is such a primitive notion, as if 
the Canadian state belonged to the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Returning to Bill C-60, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency 
and the powers assigned to the Minister of Agriculture, there are 
certainly grounds for annoyance here. We know that this is just one 
more den of patronage that has just been created by the Liberal 
government to which it can appoint its buddies. Justification for 
annoyance, justification for concern.
<P>
	Concern, because, as has just been said, when food inspection 
services affecting the daily lives of Canadians and Quebecers are 
cut, when 600 inspector positions are cut, when $44 million are cut 
from services, one cannot help but be concerned about the quality 
of services that will be delivered throughout the country in future.
<P>
	We are all the more concerned because there is a trend to 
privatization in an area as vulnerable as food inspection. According 
to what we hear, a new system has been developed, which may well 
take the place of the present system, if we are not careful, rather 
than complement the government system. That is very important.
<P>
	According to our information, the inspectors could be in conflict 
of interest or the business could be in conflict of interest with itself. 
One wonders whether private funds are involved. If the owner of a 
slaughter house has to provide direct or indirect payment to the 
inspector supervising his production and if the inspector is 
pressured by his employer, where does his loyalty lie?
<P>
	Whose interest is the inspector going to want to protect, the 
private interest or society's? His employer, who has power over 
him, or the public whose interest and health he is paid to protect?
<P>
	With this sort of privatization, which is so fashionable, in the 
neo-liberal context of deregulation, we are dealing with a basic 
issue: people's health. I would be very happy to be in my own skin 
rather than the government's in the event of public health problems 
involving poisoning as the result of laziness or some sort of lack of 
control in which the interests of the employer and those of the 
public are in conflict.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to reiterate the concerns of the Union 
des producteurs agricoles. It has significant reservations regarding 
this bill. It would like to have people from the agricultural milieu 
who know what they are doing, who are capable of making the 
distinctions and recommendations required in food inspection, 
rather than masses of pals of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Union des producteurs agricoles wants all the 
budgets-and this may not be easy with the $44 million 
cut-currently with health, agriculture and fisheries to be 
transferred. The three budgets should be combined, and not cut.
<P>
	There is the danger of cost recovery. It underlies all of that. We 
hope all of this will not be done on the backs of farm producers, and 
it is the hope of the UPA as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in the debate on 
Bill C-60 which, as was just mentioned, will establish the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency. The purpose of this bill is to group under 
a single agency all the federal government's food inspectors.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	First, I want to mention, like the hon. member for Trois-Rivières 
just did, the excellent work of my colleague for Frontenac, who is 
the official opposition's critic for agricultural issues. Thanks to his 
vigilance and to his knowledge of the industry, he has been able to 
raise basic issues relating to agriculture and more specifically to 
the creation of this agency.
<P>
	My first point was mentioned by the hon. member for 
Trois-Rivières, but it is worth repeating: Quebec cleaned up its 
food inspection sector several years ago already. It grouped 
together its inspectors who, until a few years ago, were spread out 
in several departments of the Quebec government, and at the 
municipal level. The situation was such that a municipal inspector 
would go to a restaurant to check certain things.
<P>
	For instance he could check the sanitation of the premises. Then, 
the health department inspector would come along to check the 
quality of the food. He would be followed by the agriculture 
department inspector, who would check the origin and quality of 
the food items. This meant a series of visits, of forms to complete, 
and of reports which, more often than not, would not bring about 
any changes, but would definitely create problems for those trying 
to do business in an intelligent manner.
<P>
	Giving a single agency responsibility for all this at the federal 
level makes sense, but in our opinion, we repeat, the federal 
government ought to abandon its responsibilities in this area and 
reach an agreement with the provinces, most of whom, I am 
convinced, are doing this efficiently, providing quality inspection 
services and ensuring that our fellow citizens feel secure when 
buying food for home consumption or when they eat out.
<P>
	Having said this, passing this bill will not solve the problem. In 
examining Bill C-60, we note three terrible flaws. Clause 10, which 
refers to the establishment of an advisory board, as there are in a 
number of other areas, provides for an advisory body made up of 
people from a variety of backgrounds, who ought to be competent 
in the field in which their expertise is sought, people who meet 
together to study the various issues put before them, in order to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7476"> 7476 </A></B>
<P>
report to the minister and to advise him, so that he may make good 
decisions. That is self-evident. No one is against the establishment 
of such an advisory board.
<P>
	Yet we see in the bill before us that it is the minister who will be 
appointing these men and women, who will be sought out in related 
fields, and the minister alone will have the power to appoint them 
to this advisory board.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	That is where we start wondering and having doubts about the 
credibility of this advisory board. If the minister alone decides who 
is to be appointed, it seems likely, considering the way the Liberal 
government operates, that there will be few people on this board 
who do not already share his point of view.
<P>
	In our experience, more often than not, the Liberal government 
will appoint its friends, people who are clearly identified with the 
Liberal Party, organizers and fund raisers who will be asked to 
advise the minister.
<P>
	The hon. member for Frontenac, the opposition critic for 
agriculture, told me that in the agriculture committee, he put the 
following question to witnesses who came to share their expertise 
on a bill. He asked them where they were from and what their ties 
were with the Liberal Party of Canada. One of them, who was from 
Saint-Hyacinthe, said quite frankly that he owed his appointment to 
the fact he was Liberal.
<P>
	I see the Minister of Health who agrees with me, and who thinks 
it is quite normal to proceed in this fashion. It is the Liberal way. 
My colleague managed the incredible feat of having this put on the 
record of the House. There it is, printed proof of this practice of the 
Liberal Party. I am sure no one will challenge this.
<P>
	This practice has an inherent risk, and that is our message. We 
are very critical of this section which gives the minister so much 
power. If this advisory board consists of people who are, I would 
not say subservient, the term is perhaps a bit too strong, but who 
tend to think along the same lines as the minister because they 
share the same political views, go to the same political meetings, 
give funds to the same political party, how can we trust the 
integrity of these people when the time comes to make decisions 
and advise the minister?
<P>
	Will these people, who were appointed because of their political 
allegiance, have all the freedom, all the independence they need to 
be able to tell the minister when he gives them dossiers they will 
have to think about and when he asks for their advice, will they be 
able to muster the requisite credibility, freedom and independence? 
Will they be able to tell the minister: ``Here are the guidelines you 
suggested; they do not reflect what the people in this sector want; 
they do not meet the needs of the public''? Hardly.
<P>
	This is not to say that being a Liberal means being incompetent. 
Conversely, to be competent, you do not have to be a Liberal. I 
think the first criteria should be competence. That is what my 
colleague mentioned in his speech, and what is reflected in the 
amendments he is proposing.
<P>
	In fact, the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, through the 
hon. member for Frontenac, suggests that the Standing Committee 
on Agriculture appoint these people. I think this is a very useful 
suggestion and I also think that every time the federal government 
makes appointments, its appointments should be scrutinized by the 
various parliamentary committees.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	In this way, thanks to the way the parliamentary committees 
operate, because their members represent the government and also 
the various opposition parties, we have an opportunity to question 
these people, and I will conclude on this note, and have the 
assurance that wise choices are made so that the best candidates 
will be chosen to give the best possible advice to the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise to speak to Bill C-60 at report stage. My colleague from 
Frontenac has indicated we have reached the motions in Group No. 
5. Curiously, it is a point I like to criticize the government on. The 
motions in Group No. 5 refer to the way the government can 
organize the human resources in these agencies, that is, how it 
appoints people to the agency.
<P>
	I must say right off that the federal government tried the same 
thing in another bill, the one on fisheries, because it tried to create 
the fisheries tribunal and make it quasi legal, a quasi tribunal. In 
that instance I mentioned government fronts. Once again, it is the 
same thing: a patronage haven.
<P>
	When the minister claims the right to appoint people himself and 
to define, extend and renew mandates, what are we talking about? 
How does this differ from hiring someone from the public service? 
At least this person becomes apolitical, he will have to work under 
all future governments, regardless of their colour. But in this case, 
they take money and make absolutely sure that this will be a place 
that provides a job for the friends of the party. My colleague from 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead made this point very clearly.
<P>
	Here we are approaching Christmas, two weeks away from it. 
The Liberals are trying to ensure a fine Christmas present for their 
friends by pushing us to debate this bill. They want to be sure that 
there is something under the tree for their friends, once the bill is 
passed, like the gift of future jobs. It is time to get real.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Frontenac has raised some goods points. 
We will never say it often enough today: when the Bloc Quebecois 
sends its soldiers to the front, them come prepared and, as a good 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7477"> 7477 </A></B>
<P>
soldier, the hon. member for Frontenac has done an excellent job in 
this matter. I can see him smile, but he is modest.
<P>
	I would like to come back to a few points. If the federal 
government wanted to be consistent and say: ``This is not a 
Christmas present for our friends'', would it be prepared to accept 
that the agency be made up of people, if nothing else, appointed by 
the Standing Committee on Agriculture?
<P>
	Why refer to this committee?-I notice the parliamentary 
secretary responsible for agriculture is joining us. We have had the 
opportunity to work with him. He is from Nova Scotia-Someone 
described it earlier as a patronage haven, but I will address that 
later. But I want to make sure to catch the attention of the hon. 
member, because there are still a few good Liberals. We must not 
lump them all in the same category. Since the good ones are so few, 
when we catch one, we better make sure they hear what our 
expectations are.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	As I was saying, to prevent the proposed agency from becoming 
a patronage haven, why would its members not be appointed by the 
advisory board?
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary opposite has had to face us in 
committee. The people opposite know they are in majority any way 
in the various committees, but at least official opposition members 
and the other members of this House can have a say. That is what I 
call transparency; that is what I call having faith.
<P>
	My second point is the following. Why not ensure that 
candidates are selected from within the various communities and 
that the appointments to be considered in committee are made by 
the community. Let me explain.
<P>
	If we are looking at an inspection system for fisheries, for 
instance, the fisheries community would submit to the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture a list of recommended candidates who 
have knowledge and expertise in that area. I am sure a joint 
fisheries-agriculture committee can be struck at that time for the 
specific purpose of considering who should be appointed to the 
agency.
<P>
	Why oppose such an amendment? Perhaps to make sure that the 
only requirement for getting appointed to the board of this agency 
is to be a card-carrying member or friend of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	Let me now move to another point that needs to be addressed. 
This agency is supposed to be a Canada-wide agency. Since Canada 
is made up of ten provinces, why not have specified, for each 
province, in the formula for determining how many administrators 
or inspectors will be involved, a percentage that would take the 
relative demographic importance of the province into account. 
Why not?
<P>
	In just a few minutes, we were able to make three suggestions to 
improve the perception, the political philosophy behind all this.
<P>
	We realize that it may be reasonable to try to ensure that, in 
Ottawa, the left hand knows what the right hand is doing. We 
cannot go against virtue and oppose the idea that the various 
inspection systems are being consolidated under a single agency, 
since we currently have a fisheries division, a food division, and a 
drug division in the health sector. The idea makes sense, but the 
problem is how these changes will be implemented.
<P>
	The work done by the hon. member for Frontenac regarding this 
issue will have to be taken into consideration, if we want to 
improve the bill to make it good for all Quebecers and Canadians, 
including those in Nova Scotia, whom the parliamentary secretary, 
who is listening carefully, represents.
<P>
	If the government does not support the amendments or motions 
moved by the hon. member for Frontenac, what will Canadians and 
Quebecers think of the bill?
<P>
	They will think: the more things change, the more they stay the 
same. In Canada, we switched from the Conservatives to the 
Liberals. But what has changed? What has changed is that the 
friends of the Conservatives have lost their jobs; they have been 
replaced by friends of the Liberals.
<P>
	The bill is a means to appoint Liberal Party friends who are in 
waiting. Indeed, not all the Liberal friends got jobs, and they are 
getting impatient.
<P>
	The government has an opportunity to clean up the situation and 
to rebuild the credibility of the bureaucratic system. It has an 
opportunity to restore public confidence through the people who 
will represent the public and who will work for it.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	But if, once again, the government lets go of such an 
opportunity, what will people think? If they are friends of the 
Liberal Party they may think they will receive a nice Christmas 
present, but if they are ordinary citizens they will probably think 
the government is pulling another fast one on them.
<P>
	I pointed out earlier that the government is doing the same thing 
with the Fisheries Act. The Bloc Quebecois is opposing this, again 
thanks to the information provided by the hon. member for 
Frontenac, who prepared the amendments very well. The Bloc 
Quebecois will once again oppose the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to add my voice to that of my fellow Bloc Quebecois members 
in condemning this bill. We often have occasion to discuss a new 
bill in the House. Generally, when a bill is brought before the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7478"> 7478 </A></B>
<P>
House, it has been gone over by ministers' advisers and the various 
groups working in the same area. After a certain amount of 
consultation, a bill is tabled and, as is the custom in Canada, 
brought before the House for discussion and improvement through 
amendments from the various parties and the various members, 
even those forming the government.
<P>
	But this time, I am very surprised at the arrogance with which 
the government threw this bill onto members' desks and told them: 
``Whether it is good or not, vote for it, we are going to pass it''. 
Although we tried to suggest some entirely logical amendments 
that the government could easily have lived with, we met with 
complete arrogance.
<P>
	I have noticed this arrogance getting worse for a number of 
months now. Having come to office with a red book full of fine 
promises and good intentions, this party began by holding 
pseudo-consultation sessions that consisted of a few days spent 
examining-they did not really know what to do-issues such as 
the Canadian forces abroad. After these brief sessions, they would 
say: ``There, we have just kept our promise of consulting members 
more thoroughly, of giving them more opportunities to 
participate''. The page was turned, and lo and behold, we found 
ourselves back in the Trudeau era, when the interests of friends of 
the party dictated what got done, not the interests of the people of 
Canada and of Quebec.
<P>
	Today, this government is gagging us and asking us to quietly 
approve a bill like this, a bill that gives the minister the power to 
appoint everyone who will run this agency or who will advise the 
government. This is completely ridiculous. We could always say 
that this is a government without much experience, that it is 
perhaps full of good intentions and should be given a chance. But 
look at its track record. They say that history repeats itself, and 
when you look at the past performance of the Liberal Party of 
Canada, can you trust such a government?
<P>
	I have already said in the House, and I repeat, that trusting 
Canada's interests to the Liberal Party of Canada is worse than 
putting Dracula in charge of the Red Cross blood bank. I have 
already said in the House, and I repeat, that trusting this 
government to make unbiased appointments is out of the question. 
We have only to look at the three years since they have been back in 
office. It is unbelievable. Take the Senate appointments alone. 
Have you ever seen a more shocking display of patronage? Mr. 
Mulroney would never have gone that far; he consulted the 
provinces before appointing senators.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Never. This government is not characterized by its transparency, 
but by its arrogance. That arrogance is felt in its bills, in its 
appointments, in its political speeches. This Prime Minister is the 
total incarnation of arrogance.
<P>
	What I have difficulty understanding is how Liberal MPs are 
keeping silent, preferring to serve a party, and their party buddies, 
to serving the interests of the people in their riding. Off-putting, 
that. I see them with their heads down. I understand their 
embarrassment to speak on such a bill. They prefer to say nothing 
rather than defend such a thing. Their constituents would laugh at 
them. As the kids I used to teach would say: Believe that? Give me 
a break!
<P>
	It is incredible to table such a bill and to force the Liberal MPs I 
see around me to keep quiet, to hunker down in embarrassment in 
their seats. Their red book has not only changed colour to blue, 
things are even worse than that.
<P>
	We are worse off than in the days of the Conservatives. I 
remember those days. I know how things work within a traditional 
party, but they would never have gone that far. The most corrupt 
party, the most patronage-riddled party, the most self-serving party 
in Canadian history is the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	I understand the shame we can see on the faces of hon. members 
opposite. When I run into them in the halls, they tell me that it 
makes no sense to be forced to vote in favour of such a bill. They 
tell us the same thing in committees. They tell us they can no 
longer talk to their leader, they do not see him any more. They only 
get instructions, it is a matter of believe or die.
<P>
	If they do not toe the line, they face the same fate as the member 
for York South-Weston, who dared to remind party members, at 
the time of the budget, of their promise to abolish the GST. He was 
told: ``You dare question; out you go''. He is a loyal member, 
whose fine interventions while he was in opposition helped bring 
down the Conservative Party. He opposed patronage and arrogance.
<P>
	Now he finds that his party is behaving even worse, ten times as 
badly as the Conservatives. It makes appointments and tables bills 
simply to be able to pay back the party faithful, increase election 
funds and behave more arrogantly than before.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Liberal members elected in good faith are 
keeping their mouths shut. They have a responsibility. I see the 
many members opposite listening bowing their heads in silent 
approval.
<P>
	I would like them to rise and express their approval rather than 
encourage me to continue, because what I say is true, and they are 
unable to control their own party. Let them rise, instead. Perhaps 
they stand a better chance of being re-elected if they rise than if 
they pipe down, as they have been for the past few months.
<P>
	The government is endlessly introducing bills, without 
consultation, full of things that could be corrected through the wise 
counsels that could be provided by Liberal, New Democrat, 
Reform and Bloc Quebecois members.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7479"> 7479 </A></B>
<P>
	The best example involves the member for Frontenac, who 
proposed amendments that would be acceptable to any citizens' 
committee, whether it sat at city hall or as part of a softball league.
<P>
	They would say: ``We are putting a softball team together. Is it 
all right with you if we talk about it among ourselves before 
appointing people to run our club?'' Everyone would say: ``By all 
means, let us talk about it.'' That is all the hon. member is 
suggesting in his motion.
<P>
	His amendment says: How about it, if the agriculture committee 
of this place, where all the parties are represented, said, for 
instance, let us make a list of all the suggestions received from all 
over the place, or just about, and put a subcommittee in charge of 
meeting the candidates to ensure, first, that they meet the 
legislator's requirements and, second, that they have adequate 
knowledge-that is what the amendment says-in order to 
effectively perform their duties?
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	After these consultations have taken place, recommendations 
would be made to the minister. The minister may retain fifteen of 
the names on the list as acceptable candidates and these people 
would be appointed. Or else, he would go back to the committee, 
saying he objects to such and such a candidate for this reason or 
that. Could there be anything simpler?
<P>
	That is how things are done everywhere else, even on a parish 
council. On a church wardens' board or a school board, that would 
go without saying. But no, the Liberals have raised arrogance to the 
status of a motto. ``Arrogance, arrogance, arrogance''. During the 
election, it was ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. Now it is ``arrogance, 
arrogance, arrogance''.
<P>
	Then they come and tell us: ``Take it as it is. It is Christmas time; 
it will go down well. Do not worry, we will make objective 
appointments.''
<P>
	As I said earlier, the past foreshadows the future, and to trust this 
party to make objective appointments is to dream in technicolour, it 
is a Christmas story that will turn out badly.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
now on debate on the motions in Group No. 6. You may have notice 
that we proposed six amendments in this group: AmendmentsNos. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 36, which specifically concern clause 
13 of Bill C-60.
<P>
	I would like to take a few moments to read clause 13, since this 
is the crucial clause and the amendments the official opposition is 
presenting this afternoon are specifically aimed at improving Bill 
C-60.
<P>
	If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food thinks this is obstruction, he is mistaken. I will read 
clause 13, and there is not a single municipal council in the 
smallest municipality in Canada that would accept a clause like this 
one.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>13. (1) The President has the authority to appoint the employees of the Agency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I may recall that the president is appointed by the governor in 
council. And now the president, who will be a friend of the 
government, will appoint the agency's employees. This is a serious 
matter. When I was mayor of the municipality of Garthby, if I had 
appointed the municipal inspector and then told him to appoint all 
the employees of the town of Garthby, I would have been in an 
excellent position to get him to hire my brothers-in-law, my 
nephews and nieces, my friends or people who could be counted on 
to give generously to my campaign fund.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister said so eloquently this week to people 
who were looking for work: ``Good luck''. I could tell people who 
are looking for work: ``Stick with the president of the Food 
Inspection Agency and with the Prime Minister's party, the Liberal 
Party''.
<P>
	We also read in clause 13(2):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>13.(2) The President may set the terms and conditions of employment for 
employees of the Agency and assign duties to them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is still the president. I will conclude with clause 13(3), the 
last part of clause 13:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>13.(3) The President may designate any person or class of persons as inspectors, 
analysts, graders, veterinary inspectors or other officers for the enforcement or 
administration of any Act or provision that the Agency enforces or administers by 
virtue of section 11, in respect of any matter referred to in the designation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7487"> 7487 </A></B>
<P>
	I may recall that, as I said earlier, for the time being the agency 
does not have to abide by the guidelines that usually apply to this 
type of agency of department when hiring employees. It does not 
have to abide by a principle that is currently recognized and that 
is effective in that it affords some protection against patronage.
<P>
	Our amendments are clear and specific. For instance, our 
amendment should be read here in connection with the amendment 
concerning the Professional Institute of the Public Service. We 
proposed this amendment because, in its present form, the agency 
will be a separate employer in the meaning of the Public Service 
Staff Relations Act. As a result, many of its employees will lose 
their vested rights.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	We must not forget that this new agency created by Bill C-60 
will have a staff of 4,500 in full time positions across Canada.
<P>
	These employees will come from pretty much everywhere, but, 
if they do not suit the president and are considered incapable of 
doing the job or do not want to leave Halifax to come and work at 
head office, which will be here in the national capital, they will be 
replaced by other people the president can simply appoint. The 
Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada will not be 
respected. So, a number of employees will be penalized by C-60.
<P>
	This sort of behaviour by the Liberal Party headed by the hon. 
Prime Minister and member for Saint-Maurice is despicable. Just 
this week, his comment to a woman from Saskatchewan, who has 
three university degrees-two bachelors and a masters 
degree-and is looking for work, was, simply: ``Good luck''. It is 
disgusting.
<P>
	So, to rule out any abuse or poor employee management and to 
make the hiring process transparent within the agency, which will 
have nearly 5,000 employees, we are calling for a detailed report 
on the hiring criteria used.
<P>
	I would at this point like to return to this week's, in fact today's, 
oral question period. You no doubt followed the questions on the 
space agency in the region of Longueuil and Saint-Hubert. Mr. 
Evans is a personal friend of the Minister of Industry and was 
appointed by him. A fine example of patronage. Today, Mr. Evans 
is getting his minister into hot water up to his neck.
<P>
	The amendments we proposed are aimed at protecting this party 
from potential abuse in the case of the food inspection agency. We 
are no longer talking about the space agency but about food 
inspection. Food is going to be inspected, and human health will be 
at stake.
<P>
	The president and executive vice-president of this agency must 
be appointed not because they are friends of the Liberal Party, but 
because they are competent and able to do the job. Too often, 
unfortunately, in partisan appointments, the individual who has 
contributed the most to party coffers is given huge responsibilities. 
But in this case, we are talking about your health, Mr. Speaker, and 
that of your children and your wife. This is serious.
<P>
	The report will have to be sent to the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-food one year after the establishment of the 
agency. Here again, we are concerned by possible patronage abuses 
on the part of the government and we want to be able to monitor 
this process closely and openly.
<P>
	Before turning to clause 93, we repeatedly suggested and 
recommended in a number of our amendments that the agency 
consult with the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-food. The members opposite refused.
<P>
	I can see them, and I also see them in committee. Just this week, 
in a committee of which I am a member, I nudged my colleague 
from the Reform Party and told him: ``See how bored the Liberal 
members seem to be today with the committee on agriculture''.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Indeed, they seemed to be bored to death. Some did not seem to 
really understand the issue, others did not want to speak, fearing to 
drag things out even more, or to ask questions because they we not 
familiar with the issue.
<P>
	My colleague from the Reform Party said: ``Yes, unfortunately, 
it is not the top experts on agriculture they have sent to the 
committee'', with the exception of the member for Malpeque, who 
always has questions or solutions to propose.
<P>
	This having been said, for the amendments in Group No. 6, the 
critical issue was clause 13 of Bill C-60. To conclude, I remind you 
again that the Liberal government is going to appoint the president 
and the first vice-president for an indeterminate period. We do not 
know. I asked whether it would be six months, six years or twelve 
months, but they would not tell me anything, claiming they did not 
know. So, for an indeterminate period, the chairman and 
vice-chairman will be free to appoint anyone they like. In other 
words, they are telling people to look for ``jobs, jobs, jobs'', while 
the Prime Minister wishes them ``good luck''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if I may, I would like to raise a point of order. Since 
it is only 4.45 p.m., I would like to get the unanimous consent of 
the House to speak for another five or six minutes so I can explain 
to my Liberal colleagues across the way why Bill C-60 should be 
improved.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's time is up. Since he wishes 
to go on for five more minutes, does the House give unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7488"> 7488 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see that my 
colleagues from the government party want to know more about 
the benefits of our amendments aimed at improving Bill C-60.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gaffney:</B> And that is why we allowed you to speak in 
debate too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Thank you very much. I want to 
give special thanks to the member who convinced her colleagues to 
agree to my request.
<P>
	I want to address clause 93 of Bill C-60. It is also quite 
important, but it should be amended. I will read it for the benefit of 
the House:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This Act, or any provision of the Act, or any provision of any Act enacted or 
amended by this Act, comes into force on a day or days to be fixed by order of the 
Governor in Council.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This reminds me that I heard-listen up, this is both funny and 
serious, but mostly sad-that according to the government's plan, 
Bill C-60, an act to establish the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, 
was to come into force on April 1 next year.
<P>
	I told you that the Governor in Council would appoint the 
president, the executive vice-president, and the advisory board. It 
would appear that they have already found a president, an 
executive vice-president, and that the advisory board is just about 
complete. Some democracy! But I am still introducing my 
amendments.
<P>
	Under clause 93, our amendment provides that the act will not 
come into force as long as the Minister of Agriculture has not 
prepared a code of conduct and ethics to govern the appointment of 
employees by the agency. We want a code of ethics, but not like the 
one the Prime Minister wanted for his cabinet. Whenever we ask 
him to read from his code of ethics or to provide us with a copy, we 
are told it is still being printed.
<P>
	I challenge you. If you had a code of ethics in your private 
company, you would be proud to show it to me, to boast about it, to 
praise it, or better yet, to improve it if at all possible.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	When the Prime Minister is in hot water, as was the case this 
afternoon during question period, when his industry minister was 
questioned about the space agency, is his code of ethics any good? 
We know how Mr. Evans was appointed chairman of the space 
agency in St. Hubert.
<P>
	This code must be developed in conjunction with the union or 
unions of the future agency and the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food. The objective is to get rid once and for all of the 
patronage that might easily take roots within the food inspection 
agency. This is serious.
<P>
	In the several months since we started examining Bill C-60 and I 
started raising these cases of patronage, I have received several 
calls from people supporting me. Unfortunately, when I ask them to 
testify before the  Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, they are very reluctant because they fear retaliation 
from that party.
<P>
	The Mulroney government did not go as far with patronage. 
Brian Mulroney, whom I consider to be among one of the greatest 
givers of patronage jobs, would never have created a new agency 
just to reward his friends. This is serious because there will be 
more than 4,500 jobs.
<P>
	If the government votes against this amendment that we are 
proposing in clause 93, we will have to understand that it wants to 
control the agency, thus hurting the interests of the people it 
represents.
<P>
	I doubt Canadians will have full confidence in this food 
inspection system that will be entrusted to an agency whose 
executives will not be appointed because of their capabilities, but 
because of their political allegiance and their past services to the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
	I thank the Liberal members for giving me five more minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise a second time this afternoon in the debate 
on Bill C-60 to establish the food inspection agency to point out not 
an anomaly, in my opinion, but rather a precedent.
<P>
	At least it will represent a precedent in the federal public service. 
When I rose earlier, I said that, like my colleagues, I was against 
the minister having sole responsibility for appointing the members 
of the advisory board, because of an extremely high risk of 
patronage, which could discredit the advisory board and, 
consequently, any study submitted to this board and any opinion 
provided by the board to the minister.
<P>
	Clause 12 of the bill, regarding human resources, states that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The agency is a separate employer under the Public Service Staff Relations Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It says ``separate'', and each word is important because, 
normally, the legislator is not supposed to use a word or phrase that 
does not mean anything. When Parliament speaks, it is supposed to 
mean something.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	If clause 12 states that the agency is a separate employer, that 
means that the agency will not be subject to the Public Service of 
Canada Act.
<P>
	It states further, at clause 13, that ``the president has the 
authority to appoint the employees of the agency''. It is there in 
black and white. So, it is obvious that the president, as several 
members said-and the hon. member for Frontenac just did-who 
is appointed by the governor in Council, in other words by cabinet, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7489"> 7489 </A></B>
<P>
with all the risks attached to such appointments, such as appointing 
partisan individuals whose only qualifications  would be their 
membership in the Liberal Party, once this president has been 
appointed, carefully chosen because he is one of their own-so he 
will do exactly as told-, this president will be totally free to 
appoint whomever he wants as an employee of the agency. They 
are civil servants. We are talking about civil servants who will go 
everywhere, in restaurants, in businesses, to inspect the food 
quality, the cleanliness of the premises.
<P>
	Those are the people referred to. The bill provides:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>12. The Agency is a separate employer under the Public Service Staff Relations 
Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>13. (1) The President has the authority to appoint the employees of the Agency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The President may set the terms and conditions of employment for employees 
of the Agency and assign duties to them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is really a first. I would like a member of the government to 
stand in the House and explain who, when a minister gets such 
legislation adopted, gives such extravagant powers to an individual 
who can be appointed on account of his political views.
<P>
	This means that not only is the advisory committee mentioned 
previously-which could be essentially partisan-thus discredited, 
but that the agency as a whole can lose its credibility. This is very 
serious. This means that any individual, any business owner or 
institution could question the quality of these inspectors' work.
<P>
	I am convinced that no union, no shop steward representing 
public servants was consulted about this clause, which exempts the 
food inspection agency from the application of the Public Service 
Staff Relations Act. In other words, these people will not be public 
servants. They will be employees of the agency and they will 
always be governed by its terms and conditions of employment. 
This is what clause 13, which reads as follows, provides:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>13.(1) The President has the authority to appoint the employees of the Agency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The President may set the terms and conditions of employment</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is unprecedented. Such a clause must be condemned. This 
cannot be tolerated. We must have absolute confidence in the 
inspectors' work, given the importance of their role in our society, 
which is to ensure that the food consumed at home or in public 
places is of good quality, and that it is prepared in a clean and 
healthy environment.
<P>
	The agency must not become a haven for patronage. We not let 
this happen, otherwise the work of all these people, the work of the 
whole agency will come into question. This would prove that 
Quebecers are right to demand-not merely ask-that this 
inspection work be done by inspectors accountable to the 
Government of Quebec. We experienced a similar situation of 
distrust in the seventies.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Some will remember the tainted meat scandal in Quebec. At the 
time, food inspections were not conducted properly, and hardly 
anything was checked. The situation was brought to light and it was 
found that organized crime had infiltrated the food inspection 
sector.
<P>
	Following a commission of inquiry, the Quebec government 
took a number of measures to correct the situation, including the 
grouping of all inspectors under a single organization, and the 
implementation of strict measures to give credibility to this 
activity.
<P>
	The most serious harm that has been done at the time is that, 
because of some laxness in food inspection, for many years and 
even still today, some people have doubts when they see the seal 
``Quebec approved''.
<P>
	After 10 or 15, I do not know how many years, people in some 
circles still hesitate to put their faith in inspections by the Quebec 
government. That is exactly what will happen once we have an 
agency run by the government's buddies, those who contribute to 
its slush fund. Moreover, inspectors will be selected by these 
people.
<P>
	I do not have to tell you what will happen when the time comes 
to hire inspectors. The first card one will have to show is not the 
qualification card granted by some college, but a small red card 
with a maple leaf on. That is the one to be shown. That is the way 
things will work.
<P>
	And then, they want the agency to have some credibility. They 
want inspectors to go do their inspections anywhere they please and 
would have us believe that, after the officer from the Liberal Party 
has visited their business, people will feel really secure. That is 
sheer nonsense.
<P>
	I cannot think for a single moment that such provisions will be 
maintained. My colleague from the agriculture committee is right 
to criticize the way Liberal government is proceeding in that 
regard. The government seems intent not on dealing with problems 
but on creating a lot more. They think the solution lies in leaving 
any future decision making to people they alone have confidence 
in, that is Liberal hacks. That seems to be the solution.
<P>
	They could change the title of the bill and call it the Liberal Food 
Inspection Agency instead of calling it the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency. Then at least it would reflect a de facto 
situation and people dealing with those inspectors would know 
what is what. With the provisions as they are, there will be some 
doubts. People will wonder if the inspector is qualified, competent, 
if he took courses and was trained for the job, who hired him, and 
so forth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7490"> 7490 </A></B>
<P>
	We cannot accept such a situation. That is why, unless the 
amendments put forward by my colleague are accepted, we will 
not be able to support such a decision.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, many things have 
been said today that need to be clarified and corrected to a great 
degree.
<P>
	When the hon. member concluded his speech he suggested that 
the government would not ensure that qualified, well respected 
people will get the jobs. In fact, that is exactly what will happen. 
We will make certain that qualified well respected people are doing 
the inspection jobs for food.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	It has not been by error or by mistake, or any other way but good, 
strategic planning that Canada is recognized around the world as 
one of the countries with the safest food supply in the world. The 
federal inspection agency has been and shall continue to be the best 
inspection agency that the country can possibly put forward.
<P>
	We know that when problems have occurred in other countries, 
Canada has been on the side of extra caution. We shall remain on 
the side of extra caution.
<P>
	We are not talking here about political, partisan appointments. 
We are talking about a lack of arguments by the opposition to bring 
forward criticism that is valid for this bill.
<P>
	A very partisan approach has been taken in the House today. I am 
certain not one person from the government, not one person in the 
House, and I do not care on which side of the House they sit, would 
jeopardize the safety of the food supply, food source for Canadians 
or internationally. That is paramount. That must be stated now.
<P>
	Amendments have been put forward. Those amendments are in 
some degree to Americanize our system. The suggestion that an 
agriculture committee start holding hearings on people who will be 
coming to certain boards, going into the detail of how our system 
operates is somewhat different from a parliamentary system.
<P>
	The responsible person in all the inspection systems in Canada is 
the Prime Minister, going down to his cabinet and to the ministers 
who are appointed to carry out that responsibility.
<P>
	This agency is not being formed on a whim. A tremendous 
amount of consultation has taken place across the country. Well 
over a year has been spent looking at different aspects of 
agriculture, health, fishing as well as the inspection agencies that 
exist at the present time.
<P>
	I know very well that some of our officials have been on this case 
over two years, trying to make certain that all the steps that are 
being put forward are done in consultation with the industry, in 
consultation with all the inspection services in the country, in 
consultation with all the departments in government to make sure a 
good, positive, protective system that will make certain our food 
supply is the best in the world is established.
<P>
	The agency will make certain consistency is there and one source 
can be responsible for the inspection systems in the country. There 
is no question that there is overlap when you have three separate 
departments functioning with one agency to do the inspections.
<P>
	Certainly, if there are laboratories that are doing the same work, 
if there are facilities that we have in an area that could do both the 
agriculture, the fishing and the health inspections at one time that is 
the most efficient way to do.
<P>
	By forming an agency under the minister of agriculture, we have 
formed a single inspection agency reporting to one minister and 
one group of people who can look at the system and come up with 
solutions that would better the delivery of inspections across the 
country.
<P>
	That is what has happened. We feel it is extremely important to 
have the proper steps in place, the proper people doing the job. 
Quite frankly, it is not an area where we are looking at partisanship. 
We are looking at placing the best qualified people in those 
positions that we can get. I believe that is most important for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to address a few of the motions put forward that I 
have not addressed to this point. One has to do with common 
service providers.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	A series of motions were brought forward. The purpose of the 
government's proposal was to give the agency the opportunity to 
find a cost effective way to deliver services in the program. 
However, before proceeding, the agency must seek Treasury Board 
and council approval to pay for those costs as the business 
proceeds. This is an area with a cross-governmental implication 
and therefore the minister should require and seek concurrence of 
his colleagues.
<P>
	It is important that we look very carefully at the human resources 
issue with regard to this bill. The intention of clause 12 is to 
provide the Canadian Food Inspection Agency with separate 
employer status and not to make changes to collective agreements 
which are a framework for the public service. With the addition of 
subsection 12(a), this proposed amendment would open all matters 
to the bargaining process that are now within the employer's 
responsibility in the public service. In other words, some of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7491"> 7491 </A></B>
<P>
amendments are opening up  doors to employee-employer 
problems which may come in the future.
<P>
	Certainly the department has looked very carefully at how the 
bill should be structured in order to make certain that there is a 
harmonious, fair way flowing from the present inspection system 
to the new agency so that all employees will have a reasonable 
understanding of what is happening and will be able to move from 
their present jobs into the inspection agency if they so desire.
<P>
	I was a bit astounded when the member for Richelieu stood 
today. I recall the member for Richelieu being a very staunch 
member of the Conservative Party when Mr. Mulroney was here. It 
is not proper for him to stand and criticize the present government 
for partisan appointments. It seems that no one was more partisan, 
more prone to be dictatorial and oppressive than the former prime 
minister. It is very unfair for a person who sat in his caucus to go 
after the government for the policies and the issues we have 
brought forward.
<P>
	Clearly the direction of this bill is to have the best possible 
inspection agency in the most cost effective and efficient way we 
can. We are looking at cost controls when we put an inspection 
agency in place. I have heard from the agriculture community, the 
fishing community and from all others that it will be a very positive 
move if we can save money.
<P>
	One of the greatest considerations the industry has had in the 
past several months is the PMRA. The question of the PMRA is a 
matter of the industry being very concerned about cost and cost 
effectiveness. If this agency is put in place with a savings of $44 
million, that will address cost savings and effectiveness not only 
for all Canadians but for the industry itself.
<P>
	Although many criticisms have been brought forward, I believe 
unfairly, about some of the today's issues, the central focus of the 
government is on the efficient delivery of service and top quality 
service inspection. Food inspection is our number one priority. The 
people receiving that food inspection are the people who must be 
protected. It is important for this country to have the safest food 
inspection service in the world. We are here to deliver it.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to take part in this debate on motions in Group No. 6, 
according to the groupings made by the Chair with the co-operation 
of House leaders.
<P>
	The more we move along in the point by point study of the 
amendments to this bill, the more we realize this is the greatest 
exercise in improvisation we have seen these last few weeks. If 
improvisation, carelessness and arrogance have always been the 
trademark of this government over the last two years-almost three 
years,  actually-instead of the openness all citizens are calling for, 
this bill really takes the cake.
<P>
	It is unbelievable that they should simply brush off all our 
amendments. None of them is deemed acceptable, even though 
they could easily be accepted by anybody except this arrogant 
government.
<P>
	We are simply looking for a better management of this food 
inspection agency. We are suggesting appointments should be 
made in consultation. But the government has done it again today: 
It has named a new lieutenant-governor without consulting in any 
way the government of Quebec, even if it could do it. This is a 
federal prerogative. I do not hold a grudge against the person who 
has be named, but against the office of lieutenant-governor and the 
way the government went about this nomination.
<P>
	What we are seeing here, as discussed under other groups of 
motions, is that the government would like to appoint a dozen 
persons as administrators of this agency at the sole discretion of the 
minister. I can understand the shame members opposite feel when 
they see a minister grabbing the power to appoint. They know what 
kind of appointments will be made, patronage appointments, as 
always. The appointee will have to be a known Liberal. It could be 
profitable for the slush fund. After all, Liberals have always been at 
the service of the friends of their own party and never at the service 
of the people.
<P>
	With its customary arrogance, the government wants the 
minister to appoint the 12 members of the board and rejects the 
very simple, concrete and sensible suggestion made by the hon. 
member for Frontenac, who said: ``We would like the agency to be 
managed by people who have some experience in the agri-food 
area, so we would like the committee responsible for considering 
agricultural matters here, in the House of Commons, to invite 
people to send in their résumés. Then, with the assistance of the 
subcommittees and all the parties, we could screen candidates. 
Finally, we would make our recommendations to the minister, who, 
in turn, would be able to use his discretionary power to choose 12 
members among a list of 20 candidates''.
<P>
	The minister could at least approve this solution. We think the 
committee should appoint the 12 members, but if the minister were 
to say: ``Give me a list with 20 names on it and I will choose 12 
members'', that would be some type of compromise to the 
suggestion made by the hon. member for Frontenac, who is very 
efficiently overseeing this whole matter for the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	In the proposal he brought forward, the hon. member for 
Frontenac is, in fact, saying: Our amendment has three objectives. 
First, that the 12 members of the advisory board be appointed by 
the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, after due 
consideration. Second, that beforehand the provinces and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7492"> 7492 </A></B>
<P>
representatives of the agriculture industry be allowed to submit to 
the committee the names of candidates for  appointment to the 
advisory board. That is not too much to ask of the minister.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Third, that the membership of the advisory board take into 
account the weight of each province within the federation.
<P>
	The government brags about being a national party and 
providing equal representation for all citizens. The hon. member 
for Frontenac is giving the government the opportunity to prove it. 
He said: ``If a province has 25 per cent of the Canadian population, 
then it should have three seats out of 12 on the advisory board''. 
That does not mean that the board would be controlled by a region 
or another. We will have achieved the balance all Canadians are 
striving for.
<P>
	When we consulted our people on this, they asked why we were 
consulting them about it, because it was obvious to them that the 
minister should receive suggestions from the provinces, the 
agri-food sector, political parties in general and people who could 
sit on the advisory board. But the minister was so arrogant enough 
that he turned down this suggestion, which seems absolutely 
fundamental to me.
<P>
	I understand why there is not a single Liberal member today who 
wants to speak in favour of such a thing. They say nothing and hide. 
There they are, their heads bowed down. There are so many that 
they cannot be missed. What do they say? I can see an assistant to 
the minister who is nudging a member to get him to speak on this, 
but I do not blame the member for heading behind the curtain. 
There is no justification for speaking against such logical and 
simple amendments, which would just facilitate the workings of 
any agency that we want to be effective and relevant and to do the 
work that all the members of this House want it to do.
<P>
	So, to be sure, we say that we must consult the people involved 
in the agri-food sector and the provinces, which also have a very 
important role to play. But no, the minister has told his members 
say nothing or else they will be expelled, as was the member from 
Ontario who now sits as an independent member because he dared 
to say to the Prime Minister: ``Mr. Prime Minister, you promised to 
scrap the GST, do you not remember?'' He was thrown out of his 
party because he dared to talk to the Prime Minister. This is 
democracy in the Liberal Party.
<P>
	This is an arrogant party, the party most given to pork-barrelling 
and the most corrupt party in Canadian history. It thinks of nothing 
but helping its political friends instead of serving the interests of 
Canadians and Quebecers. And the person who best personifies this 
corruption and pork-barrelling style of government is the Prime 
Minister himself. I am convinced that even the  Minister of 
Agriculture received instructions to use such a dictatorial approach 
in appointing people.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's list of party backers is a long one. The 
Liberals appointed 400 people last year to well paid positions. They 
will now appoint 500 or 600 more before the election and, 
particularly, before the holiday season. Since people will be busy 
partying, nobody will notice all these appointments, and there will 
be many of them.
<P>
	The Prime Minister instructed the minister to set up the agency 
right away, to use his discretionary power to do so; he will be given 
the names of appointees later. There are still a few Liberal 
candidates who did not get a reward or a contract, and let us not 
forget that it is the wife of the former defense minister, Mrs. 
Collenette, who makes suggestions. Members will recall that the 
defence minister himself granted contracts worth $75,000 to one of 
his fund raisers to thank him and to ask him to organize his next 
election campaign.
<P>
	This is what we are making a stand against today. I wonder why 
even Liberal members are hiding and refusing to acknowledge that 
what we are proposing is logical and that we should put an end to 
the arrogance they have been showing lately on every issue, 
especially on political appointments.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	This is worse than the Mulroney years, because Mr. Mulroney 
took the time to consult the provinces even for the choice of 
senators, but the present Prime Minister's arrogance is obvious. 
Moreover, he admitted it publicly when he said: ``I am the one who 
makes the appointments''. He also told his minister of agriculture: 
``I will name them and I will give you the list''.
<P>
	The kind of patronage, so typical of the Trudeau years,is being 
reinstated and strengthened. But that is not what was said in the red 
book. The red book said that a Liberal government would give a 
greater role to members of Parliament to improve the democratic 
process in the House of Commons. Instead of that, we are going 
back to a dictatorship.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have another opportunity to speak to this bill because the purpose 
of this group of motions is to protect the interests of those who will 
manage this system. The government wants to deny public service 
employees their vested rights. The other aspect is the one that the 
member for Richelieu, with his extensive experience, just 
mentioned so eloquently. He has seen it all, so the government 
must really have gone too far for him to make this kind of 
comment.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7493"> 7493 </A></B>
<P>
	As the member said, the government, at the end of the 
session-and that is what Canadians must pay attention to-just 
before Christmas or just before Saint-Jean-Baptiste day, tries to 
ram some bills through  the House so they will not come up again 
after the holidays.
<P>
	The member for Frontenac, with his initiative, and his 
colleagues in the agriculture committee did wonderful work, and I 
want to pay tribute to them. Even though they sometimes seem a 
little too insistent in caucus or in their personal contacts with us, 
they do make us aware of the reality. They tell us how important 
agriculture is. But that is of no interest to the members opposite, 
who are uncharacteristically silent on the subject of agriculture, not 
only today, but most of the time. This issue concerns not only 
thousands of Quebecers, but other Canadians as well. Coming from 
a rural area, even though I now live in a semi-urban area, I know 
how important agriculture is, as do most Quebecers.
<P>
	The member for Richelieu is right. Why is it that members 
opposite do not rise more often to speak to agricultural issues? 
Would it be because the Liberal government wants to ram his bills 
through the House? Would it be that it does not want its members to 
put forward too many arguments because it is afraid of our 
reaction, so it is trying to avoid debate? But is this democracy? Are 
we setting a good example? Is that the kind of behaviour we want 
our young people to see, a government that is acting as if there 
were no opposition, as if things had to go its way while it is in 
office? That is almost like a monarchy.
<P>
	I am surprised that the member for Gander-Grand Falls has not 
said a word. He usually speaks up when he sees such a flagrant lack 
of respect for democracy. Without breaking the party line, he 
usually rises in this House to point out such inappropriate 
behaviour. He did not do so today, which is rather unfortunate.
<P>
	However, since we do not have much time left, Mr. Speaker, all 
members of the Bloc Quebecois who are here today and myself 
wish to congratulate the member for Frontenac and his two 
colleagues, the members for Lotbinière and Champlain, for the 
wonderful work they do to support agriculture in Quebec. My 
thanks to the member for Frontenac.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to raise a point of order, but I 
can do it later on, when the government whip and the whip of the 
Reform Party are in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The House will now proceed to the taking 
of the deferred recorded division on the motion for second reading 
of Bill C-236, an act to prevent the importation of radioactive 
waste into Canada.

	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased to speak today 
to Bill C-202, and therefore on the amendments I tabled with a 
view to instituting a national organ donor month.
<P>
	When I spoke in April, I told you a story from real life. I feel it 
would be extremely appropriate to repeat it here, for I believe it 
offers an exceptional illustration of how reality has changed in the 
past 30 years.
<P>
	We are back in 1959, when you were far younger, Mr. Speaker, 
and I was younger too, but a little older than you. I was about to 
graduate from nursing school. Pierrette was a patient of mine. She 
was 15 years old and had been sick since about the age of three or 
four. She was suffering from kidney failure.
<P>
	In those days, there was no question of hemodialysis and kidney 
transplants. They were not even considered yet. Pierrette, at 15, 
was dying. All she wanted was to sleep but, one night, she went to 
sleep, never to wake up again.
<P>
	In those days, medical science threw up its hands in cases like 
Pierrette's. All of us felt this was terribly unfair. Science has made 
giant strides since.
<P>
	Over the course of almost 30 years of professional life entirely 
dedicated to paediatric care, I finally saw hope rekindled in the 
hearts and minds-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like you to call the House to 
order. Those who are not interested in the debate can withdraw. I 
am having difficulty hearing my colleague, and I am close by.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I fully agree with my hon. colleague. 
Would the hon. member in the corner, without naming him, either 
step outside or listen to the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I get the impression that 
you are a miracle worker.
<P>
	Over the course of almost 30 years of professional life entirely 
dedicated to paediatric care, I finally saw hope rekindled in the 
hearts and minds of parents and children. Organ and tissue 
transplants now make it possible to save lives.
<P>
	Today, increasingly sophisticated technologies make heart, liver, 
lung and pancreas transplants possible. What was a virtually 
impossible feat in 1960 has become, today more than ever, an 
everyday reality.
<P>
	In 1995, in Quebec alone, 375 people received the invaluable gift 
of life because 117 healthy people like you and me agreed to donate 
their organs after death. Yet, there are still over 500 people in 
Quebec waiting for organ transplants; in Canada, only 40 percent of 
people with the same need receive the gift of life.
<P>
	Despite the progress of science, the main obstacle remains the 
insufficient number of donors. So, the more donors there are, the 
more people will benefit from long awaited organ transplants that 
will improve their quality of life.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Last April, I was able to speak at the second reading stage of this 
bill introduced by the hon. member for Ontario. I was also at that 
time joint chairman of an organ donation awareness campaign. 
Incidently-and this is something I am extremely proud of-for 
the last four years in Laval, the second most populous city in 
Quebec and a thriving community in many areas, April has been 
declared organ donation month. So I know such a campaign can 
motivate people to sign organ donation cards.
<P>
	It is in this spirit that I introduced these amendments proposing 
that the bill provides for a full month of awareness instead of only 
one day. At the request of agencies that are very concerned about 
all aspects of organ donations, I wish to present a number of 
amendments today, and I earnestly hope that my colleagues on the 
government benches and those in the third party in this House will 
give their unanimous support to this request.
<P>
	It is important to inform the public and raise public awareness of 
the importance of organ donations. We never know when we or one 
of our loved ones might need this gift of life.
<P>
	According to a working paper on donation and distribution of 
organs and tissues in Canada, produced by the 
federal-provincial-territorial advisory committee on health 
services in 1996, there is a critical shortage of organs in Canada.
<P>
	In a society like ours that takes pride in having the best health 
care system there is, because it is available to every one, can we 
tolerate not having enough organs to give to the people that need 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7497"> 7497 </A></B>
<P>
them? The only way to change this is to make the entire population 
aware of the problem.
<P>
	As we near the year 2000, we have truly exceptional means of 
communication at our disposal. What we can do in a month is 
incredible. What is needed is political will, and I believe the 
Parliament of Canada, of which I am a member, is prepared to 
make this decision.
<P>
	In Canada, and I think this will surprise you, the number of organ 
donations per million people is one of the lowest among 
industrialized countries. In 1993, for instance, it was 13.9 per 
million; in Austria, it was 25.2; in Spain, not a very rich country, 
21.7; in Belgium, 19; in the United States, 17.7; in France, 17 and 
in the United Kingdom, 15.5.
<P>
	In addition to having one of the lowest organ donation rates, we 
are seeing an increase in the number of people in Canada who are 
waiting for organ donations. It is clear that progress in medicine is 
widely reported and that people know what they are entitled to and 
what they can benefit from. A way must be found, therefore, to 
meet their needs.
<P>
	In 1995 in Canada, 2,500 people were awaiting a transplant, an 
increase of 15.5 per cent over 1994. Everyone will agree that it is a 
significant increase and that it clearly signals a need for public 
information.
<P>
	Obviously, a Canada wide public information campaign is called 
for. A month long information campaign, in April, when nature 
revives and life breathes anew, is needed, I think, to let people 
know the importance of the situation and our responsibility as 
individuals, because too many things still stand in the way of organ 
donations.
<P>
	According to a 1994 survey undertaken by Mutual Life, whose 
excellent efforts toward public awareness I am proud to honour, 77 
per cent of Canadians said they were prepared to donate their 
organs, although only 58 per cent of them said they had signed a 
donor card.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	There is many a slip from the cup to the lip and I think we can 
change that if Parliament unanimously supports these amendments.
<P>
	The gap between attitudes and behaviour can probably be 
explained by the fact that we do not know how other family 
members feel about this. There are also the fears, the bias and the 
lack of trust in the operations.
<P>
	Therefore, I believe that the great shortage of organs and the 
importance of this cause are worth a month of effort to inform the 
public. I want to thank my colleague, the member for Ontario, for 
this extraordinary idea he had to ask that one day, April 21, be 
devoted to that cause and I am sure he will agree with me that this 
day should be the culminating point of a whole month dedicated to 
raising awareness of organ donations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to speak on this bill today, at the report stage.
<P>
	This bill has a story. It started about two years ago.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is a bill which unites the House of Commons in a common 
front that puts aside politics and the ideological differences which 
we have. It is an issue which allows us to consider that perhaps the 
greatest gift we can give to other people in passing away is the gift 
of life.
<P>
	The genesis, the origin of this bill was made possible by the 
sacrifice which was made by one young individual, a very young 
Canadian, a former constituent of mine, Stuart Herriot, better 
known among those who knew him as Stu Buddy.
<P>
	This bill has received the accolade of the Stu Buddy bill. That is 
for good reason. Today in the gallery we welcome Tim Herriot, the 
father of Stuart Herriot, and his aunt, Linda Rumble, who 
spearheaded this bill. On behalf of the House I congratulate them 
on their efforts.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Laval Centre indicated, in Canada we 
need to address the fact that nearly 1,100 people die every year 
waiting for the gift of life. Fortunately, in 1994-95 four people, 
who are alive and very healthy today, received the gift of life 
compliments of the sacrifice that Stuart made when he was 
tragically killed on April 21.
<P>
	I do not know if it is divine intervention or just fate, but whatever 
the case may be, it turns out that the week which has customarily 
been named to honour organ donation has been the third week of 
April. It is ironic and perhaps tragic, but also, in a very strange 
sense, positive that April 21, the day on which Stuart died, is also 
the week that would allow the House of Commons to consider not 
only a national organ day, but perhaps, as the hon. member from 
the Bloc has said, a national organ donor month.
<P>
	I do not want to play politics with this bill. The intent is to make 
sure that the bill, which received unanimous consent at second 
reading and went through committee without 
amendment-certainly there were no objections from the 
government, the Bloc or Reform-perhaps by way of compromise, 
provide a national organ donor week.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	I want to speak on that for just a brief moment because we are 
now dealing with lives and lives no know boundaries. They do not 
know a jurisdiction between Canada and the United States or 
between various regions or various cities of the country. It just so 
happens that the U.S. congress has already recognized the third 
week of April as being its national organ donor week. In a mood of 
harmonization I think the ultimate goal, the higher goal which 
transcends again the politics and political barriers, I would hope 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7498"> 7498 </A></B>
<P>
that we could perhaps as a Parliament at the very least consider this 
week.
<P>
	I understand the hon. member has suggested the month as she 
said so very eloquently, but I think we have to try to do what we can 
here today. I am pleased to have had an opportunity to work with 
her on this bill. I know she has met many people, as so many of us 
have, young people and older people who have given away that part 
of themselves in dying with the understanding and the knowledge 
that they may give life to other people.
<P>
	The importance of this bill should not be forgotten in terms of 
what it is trying to accomplish: awareness and education. Without 
those two elements, despite having the means to provide more 
transplants, we will still wind up in deficit situation of nearly 1,100 
people dying every year because they do not or cannot wait to 
receive the gift of live.
<P>
	I hope we are not in a position where we forget the sacrifices 
being made by those and other people who tonight at this very time 
are either on dialysis machines or awaiting in the various hospitals 
around this country for the gift of life.
<P>
	It is my belief that this House from time to time may be 
criticized for getting mired down in politics, of getting mired down 
in the day to day distractions based on ideologies and what not. 
This bill brings a common sense of purpose and a common sense of 
unity to the posterity of our own species, of our own society and of 
mankind.
<P>
	In recognizing that the hon. member has made these motions and 
in the interest of perhaps getting this bill passed as soon as 
possible, and honouring the sacrifice made by young Stu Buddy I 
ask if it might be possible that we make an amendment to the 
motions that have been put forward, in the interest of getting this 
done before Christmas in the context of giving.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by replacing the word ``month'' with the word 
``week''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I submit this now.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Would the hon. member indicate by his 
amendment if he is changing the word in each of the motions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If the hon. member has a question or 
anything else, with the unanimous consent of the House and in the 
spirit of Christmas, I think we should let the hon. member for Laval 
Centre speak first.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as you know, we get what we can get. I would really like 
the House to vote on the amendment that I tabled. I continue to 
think that, maybe, a majority of members will vote in favour of a 
national organ donor ``month''.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	If the amendment that I tabled on behalf of Quebecers is 
rejected, I will, of course, vote for a national organ donor week, 
since it is better than nothing.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I clearly asked that my 
amendment be voted on. If the amendment is rejected-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault: </B>It is impossible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> It is impossible. I understand. I will 
vote in favour of one week, but I want one month. Mr. Speaker, 
does this mean my amendment will be dropped, or are we still 
going to vote on it?
<P>
	If the amendment to the amendment deals with the amendment, 
the amendment per se has to be rejected first, right?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> For better or worse, the House must vote 
on the amendment tabled by the hon. member. If it is negatived, the 
hon. member will be allowed to then submit her amendment. You 
do not agree?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I must follow the rules of this House. The 
hon. member for Laval Centre has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, you will certainly 
understand that I would never question your judgment, so I will 
oblige with pleasure since it is almost Christmas.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is on the amendment to the 
amendment. All those in favour of the amendment to the 
amendment will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the yeas have it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> On division.

There are quite a lot of members in the House on this Thursday

their organ donor card.
<P>
	If they have done so, I ask them to take the opportunity, during 
the holiday season, to encourage their relatives, their friends and 
their constituents to do so as well and, above all, to tell people that 
it can be done.

<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is not 
very often that I am found without words. There is one person who 
should be smiling here apart from every member of Parliament and 
to whom I have to give so much thanks.
<P>

-especially members opposite and members on this side of the

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="OFFICIALLANGUAGES">OFFICIAL LANGUAGES</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on November 28 I asked the Minister of Human 
Resources Development a question. I asked if in his discussions 
with the provinces regarding the transfer of labour market training 
from the federal to the provincial governments, he had taken steps 
to ensure that the principles of the Official Languages Act will 
continue to apply. In other words, will francophones outside 
Quebec continue to get training in French and anglophones in 
Quebec to get their training in English. There has been great 
concern over this matter because there were too many cases in the 
past when provincial governments denied services to their 
language minorities.
<P>
	Recently, the Quebec government had bilingual signs removed 
from the Sherbrooke hospital and in the Ontario legislature, a 
government member insulted an opposition member for speaking 
French.
<P>
	For matters coming under the federal government, services are 
now given in English and French throughout the country where 
there is significant demand. These rights should not be lost when 
training programs are transferred to provincial governments.
<P>
	When airports were transferred to local authorities and when Air 
Canada was privatized, there were provisions in the legislation to 
protect these language rights.
<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
	I asked my question on November 28 and the government 
concluded the first formal transfer agreement with Alberta on 
December 10. In this agreement the following is stated: ``In areas 
of significant demand, Alberta will provide access to the benefits 
and measures and national employment assistance service 
functions in both official languages''.
<P>
	These words are similar to section 22 of the Official Languages 
Act which reads in part as follows: ``Every federal institution has 
the duty to ensure that any member of the public can communicate 
with and obtain available services in either official language in 
Canada or elsewhere where there is significant demand for 
communications with and services from that office in that 
language''.
<P>
	It is essential that the term ``significant demand'' is defined and 
interpreted in the same way as it is for the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	In his answer on November 28 the minister said that the new 
Employment Insurance Act provided for service  in either official 
language where there was significant demand. I looked through the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7500"> 7500 </A></B>
<P>
act very thoroughly and I was not able to find that article. I would 
ask the parliamentary secretary to identify the article in question.
<P>
	I also want assurance from the government this evening that all 
the other agreements, including the one from my province of 
Quebec, have provisions similar to that of Alberta or even better, 
that they contain provisions to guarantee training in both official 
languages.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, I am happy to give the government's 
response.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Government of Canada strongly believes that minority 
official language communities are entitled to receive services in the 
official language of their choice. That is why under the Official 
Languages Act the Government of Canada as a whole is firmly 
committed to ensuring that any member of the public can 
communicate with the federal institutions and receive available 
services from these institutions in either official language.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is also committed to ensuring that 
services provided on behalf of federal institutions are provided in 
either official language.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since the Government of Canada recognizes the importance of 
this basic right, Part II of the Employment Insurance Act was 
amended to ensure that access is provided to benefits and measures 
in both official languages in areas of significant demand.
<P>
	Since minority and community organizations are concerned 
about how they will be affected by federal-provincial negotiations 
on labour market agreements, I would like to reiterate that this 
question is part of negotiations and that any agreement will contain 
clauses guaranteeing that services will be provided in both official 
languages.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I asked all Human Resources Development Canada officials to 
translate this commitment toward respecting the rights of minority 
groups with respect to official languages into their day to day 
activities as well as to ensure that adequate and equitable resources 
are made available to serve these communities.
<P>
	I hope this information helps to convince the member of the 
Government of Canada's commitment to ensuring the vitality of 
anglophone and francophone minorities and of our support for their 
economic, cultural and social development.
<P>
	Our actions also reaffirm this government's desire to work 
closely with communities to ensure that the rights of minorities are 
respected throughout Canada.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
November 27 1996 I asked the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration a question regarding the abuse by immigration 
officers of Algerian nationals seeking refugee status, including 
excessively long detentions, intimidation, harassment and other 
arbitrary practices.
<P>
	Just hours before I asked this question of the Minister, I had 
attended a press conference with representatives of the coalition for 
the respect of human rights to condemn this unacceptable situation 
which is unworthy of a democratic country such as Canada.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	This coalition is made up of the Refugee Assistance Committee, 
the Office des droits des détenus, the Ligue antifasciste mondiale, 
the Canadian Council for Refugees, the Table de concertation de 
Montréal pour les réfugiés and the Civil Liberties Union.
<P>
	The minister said she was surprised to learn about this press 
conference. She said she had never been informed of these ``very 
serious allegations'', which is not true since I had told her myself, 
in this House, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. Immediately after I 
got her answer, I sent her a copy of the comments I made on last 
May 27 in this regard, here in this House.
<P>
	Moreover, according to the coalition, the minister had been told 
about these abuses as early as last April and May, but she never 
followed through with these complaints.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has asked the minister on many occasions to 
stay the deportation of refugees to Algeria where violence is still 
prevalent. If returned, they face huge dangers. These nationals have 
every right to fear for their lives and safety.
<P>
	I am heartened by the fact that as of yesterday the federal 
government has decided to put off for a week carrying out orders 
expelling people to Zaire. This country has now become a high risk 
country. Hopefully it will postpone doing so indefinitely.
<P>
	At the present time, only Burundi, Rwanda and Afghanistan are 
considered high risk countries. I hope Algeria is included, for there 
have been some damning reports on human rights abuses in that 
country.
<P>
	I am seriously concerned about the behaviour of the immigration 
officers accused by the coalition. Among the actions listed are: 
excessive use of detention, the use of false information, denial of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7501"> 7501 </A></B>
<P>
the right to a lawyer during  deportation procedures and rejection 
out of hand of any claims relating to the risks of returning.
<P>
	In response to my question, the minister promised to act on this 
matter. I am asking her, once again, to immediately put an end to 
these odious, discriminatory and arbitrary practices by her 
immigration officers, and to order a thorough investigation into 
this matter. The officials responsible for these acts ought to be dealt 
with appropriately.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to wish a Merry Christmas, and all the 
best for 1997, to all immigrants and refugees in Canada and in 
Quebec, and to all my colleagues in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister </B><B>of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Bourassa has spoken of allegations of illegal or improper behaviour 
by immigration officials. These are grave accusations which the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration takes very seriously.
<P>
	This government firmly believes that the immigration 
enforcement program must be carried out with the highest level of 
professionalism and respect for individuals. It must also operate 
within the law. CIC is committed to maintaining and defending the 
integrity of Canada's immigration and refugee determination 
system.
<P>
	Let me make it perfectly clear to the hon. member that any 
substantiated allegation of improper behaviour is investigated and 
acted upon by CIC, and I say substantiated. There is an effective 
mechanism in place whereby instances of wrongdoing can be 
reported and are addressed.
<P>
	We have repeatedly invited anyone with documented knowledge 
or substantiated allegations of incidents of abuse of authority by 
our officials to come forward.
<P>
	The minister has asked departmental officials to meet with 
members of the coalition in order to obtain further details of their 
allegations.
<P>
	With regard to the hon. member's other assertions that we do not 
offer adequate protection to refugees fleeing civil wars, I can only 
say that we have a good refugee determination system in place 
which is universally recognized as among the very best in the 
world. We are the only country to be awarded the Nansen medal for 
our commitment to helping people in need. Just a few weeks ago 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees sent a letter 
congratulating Canadians on the 10th anniversary of the awarding 
of the medal. Our proud tradition of humanitarianism continues 
today.
<P>
	Let me assure the hon. member that when we deal with difficult 
refugee cases, we look at each file very closely before any 
decisions are made.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRENT-SEVERNWATERWAY">TRENT-SEVERN WATERWAY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
October 28 I asked the Minister of Canadian Heritage about the 
raising of $200,000 in water lot licence fees along the Trent-Severn 
waterway. There is a great concern that marinas will be liable to 
millions of dollars in municipal taxes if these fees are levied. I 
asked the minister what was going to be done to help the 
Trent-Severn operators in this matter.
<P>
	A group of marina operators, many of them from my riding of 
Peterborough, worked all summer to find a fair way of raising these 
moneys. Just when they were close to an agreement, they were 
given a legal opinion that this method of levying the fees puts them 
at risk in the future for additional municipal taxes. Before 
commenting on this situation further, I would like to discuss the 
merits of the Trent-Severn waterway.
<P>
	This waterway is a series of natural and artificial water bodies 
which links the upper and lower Great Lakes. It was completed 
almost 100 years ago following a route used for thousands of years 
by aboriginal peoples. It is part of our national heritage. That is one 
of the reasons that Parks Canada manages the waterway on behalf 
of all Canadians.
<P>
	The waterway is also the centrepiece of a corridor of tourism, 
recreation and other economic and social activities. The presence 
of the system helps generate tens of millions of dollars in that 
corridor. The Trent-Severn waterway is also an elaborate system of 
water, including flood control.
<P>
	The waterway is much more than a canal. Its worth cannot be 
estimated simply in terms of its cost effectiveness as a route for 
boats. Yet in a recent auditor general's report, that is how the 
waterway was treated.
<P>
	The auditor general said that it would save money if some locks 
were closed. This would destroy the waterway as a system. It 
would take away from its heritage role and it would have serious 
economic impacts on all communities and for all residents in the 
corridor around it.
<P>
	I was delighted that in response to the auditor general's report 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage publicly stated her support of the 
Trent-Severn waterway as a complete system from Lake Ontario to 
Georgian Bay.
<P>
	In times when governments are all downsizing, there is a great 
danger that the federal government will give up or neglect powers 
and obligations that it has in policy areas which affect the lives of 
all Canadians, Canadians alive today and Canadians yet to be born. 
This is one of those areas.
<P>
	Taking all this into consideration, is it any wonder that marina 
operators as well as the entire Trent-Severn community are 
concerned about the proposed water lot licences and their impact.

operators recognize that they have to help support this wonderful 
waterway but the method of payment must be fair and equitable.
<P>
	I trust that the parliamentary secretary will have some 
encouraging and reassuring words this evening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last March in response to commercial water lot operators' 
concerns that insufficient consultation had occurred regarding the 
new rates, the Rideau and Trent-Severn canals were instructed by 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage to undertake further 
consultations with commercial operators.
<P>
	Over the summer, canal staff gathered input on the proposal from 
operators by visiting all known commercial operations. The 
minister stated at that time that revised rates would be made public 
only after those consultations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The minister shares the member's concerns. That is why 
discussion groups were formed for each canal. Their mandate was 
to determine fair rental rates that will allow canals to reach their 
revenue objectives.
<P>
	Staff gathered comments from all known operators over the 
summer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The groups proposed and recommended a rental structure that 
would set new rental rates for primary water lots at twice the old 
formula plus a base fee of $150 annually. The rental rate for 
secondary water lots would remain at the old water lot rate. The 
formula developed received general support throughout the 
business community.
<P>
	The application of municipal property taxes to water lots on 
federal property became a very important issue, particularly on the 
Trent-Severn waterway. To assist in resolving a municipal taxation 
issue, canals staff have sought clarification from the appraisal 
branch of Ontario for a provincial interpretation of the Assessment 
Act with regard to commercial water lot licences on the canals.
<P>
	Now that the consultations with the marine operators have been 
completed, it is the intent of the government to announce new 
commercial water lot rental rates effective April 1, 1997 in the very 
near future.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> A motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.55 p.m.)
