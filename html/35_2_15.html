	The House resumed from March 7 consideration of the motion 
that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government; the amendment and the amendment to the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 1996 
budget is about the future, the secure prosperous future all 
Canadians desire. If any group represents Canada's future it is our 
young people. That is why the Liberal government's commitment 
to fair, sustainable and secure social programs would be incomplete 
if we did not include action to assist children who are the most 
vulnerable and in the greatest need. At long last this budget 
introduces a new strategy to strengthen protection for children 
buffeted by divorce and separation.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance told Parliament on March 26, and as 
many Canadians have known for some time, the current child 
support system has added to the uncertainty and anxiety many 
Canadians feel. The minister clearly outlined that in our view 
children should be the first in line. Child support is the first 
obligation of parents; it is not discretionary.
<P>
	The budget acted on that principle. It announced the child 
support reforms which take wide ranging action to ensure the child 
support system is based on what is best for children. To start with, 
the government is changing the way child support payments are 
taxed. Until now child support payments have been tax deductible 
for the paying parent and taxable as income for the parent receiving 
the payments.
<P>
	The budget proposes that we move to a system known as no 
deduction, no inclusion. What does that mean? Custodial parents 
will no longer be required to include child support payments in 
their taxable income and support paying parents would not deduct 
these payments from their taxable income. These new tax rules will 
apply  to court orders or agreements made on or after May 1, 1997.
<P>
	Child support paid under a court order made before May 1, 1997 
would continue to be deductible by the parent and included as 
taxable income by the recipient until the support payment is 
changed by a court ruling or the parties add a clause to their 
agreement providing that the new tax rules will apply, or the payer 
and recipient file a joint election with Revenue Canada.
<P>
	Coupled with this important tax change is a second major 
component of the child support reform. The government is 
introducing child support guidelines to make support awards fair 
and more consistent and to reduce the degree of conflict between 
separating parents.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	These guidelines will be used across Canada by the courts, 
lawyers and parents to establish appropriate support payments. 
They include a payment schedule, a set of tables showing the basic 
amount of support to be paid according to the number of children 
and the income of the support paying payment.
<P>
	The second part of that is that scheduled amounts can be adjusted 
to recognize individual family circumstances. Special expenses for 
child care, health care, education or extracurricular activities can 
be added to the scheduled amount provided that these expenses are 
reasonable and necessary in light of the needs of the children and 
the means of the parents.
<P>
	The guidelines allow a court to alter the award in exceptional 
circumstances where it would cause undue hardship to either parent 
or to the child.
<P>
	The third component of the child support reform strategy will be 
the enhancement of the federal-provincial enforcement measures. 
Children benefit from fair support awards only if they are paid in 
full and on time. The numbers are appalling. Far too many children 
in Canada are left without adequate financial means because one of 
their parents is willfully ignoring their responsibility to their 
children. Some one in four children's parents are fully paid up in 
their child support awards. This is an appalling situation.
<P>
	As a federal government we must remember that child support is 
mainly a provincial and territorial responsibility, and so the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="792"> 792 </A></B>
<P>
measures we are proposing compliment the enforcement efforts 
and strategies at that level.
<P>
	It should be emphasized that we are targeting parents who are 
persistent defaulters on their support payments. How are we to do 
that? We will start a national public awareness campaign that will 
aim at changing public attitudes about child support. It is not 
discretionary; it is the first responsibility of parents.
<P>
	We will provide provincial enforcement programs with a new 
enforcement mechanism. Legislation will be enacted that will 
authorize the suspension of federal licences, privileges and 
certificates such as passports when someone has demonstrated 
persistent wilful default.
<P>
	The federal government will provide up to $13.7 million over 
five years to help the provinces expand the use of more aggressive 
enforcement measures and streamline the collection of out of 
province orders.
<P>
	Improvements to the federal tracing service will allow the 
release of certain information from designated federal information 
banks to help locate defaulting debtors. This will include Revenue 
Canada to the list of departments whose data bases can be searched 
at the request of provincial enforcement agencies.
<P>
	We will also improve federal pension diversions to ensure this 
measure can be applied to persistent defaulters. This can be done 
even if the defaulter refuses to apply for pension benefits to ensure 
the maximum amount of benefits goes to child support.
<P>
	Improvements to computers systems will allow for on line 
computer access between federal, provincial and territorial 
enforcement services. This will enhance the efficiency of the 
garnishment and tracing service and greatly facilitate the exchange 
of information.
<P>
	This is concrete and substantial action, but I am glad to say the 
1996 budget plan does not limit new assistance to children whose 
parents are separated or divorced. There is another very important 
measure. The budget announces we will be doubling the working 
income supplement under the child tax benefit in two steps.
<P>
	This will ensure and encourage employment and self-reliance by 
helping low income parents meet some of the expenses resulting 
from membership in the paid workforce, expenses like child care 
and transportation. It also helps make up for the benefits lost by 
parents who leave social assistance to re-enter the workforce.
<P>
	Beginning in July 1997 we will go from the current maximum of 
$500 to $750, and in July 1998 it will be increased to a maximum 
of $1,000. When fully phased in this will result in an additional 
$250 million in support annually to approximately 700,000 low 
income working families, one-third of which are single parent 
households.
<P>
	I am proud to be part of a government that puts children first, 
that thinks about the cost of not taking care of our children and that 
makes sure parents understand the responsibility to their children.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	I am sharing my time with my colleague from Hillsborough who 
will take the remaining time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague for a very 
fine budget address.
<P>
	I start my budget address, as I know all members do, by 
congratulating the Minister of Finance for yet another successful 
budget. Like the two previous budgets, the needs and wants of 
Canadians have been addressed. It will result in the creation of jobs 
and promote economic growth by further reducing the deficit. To 
the minister I say a good job, well done.
<P>
	The government is continuing the processes that began with the 
1994-95 budget. The comprehensive strategy for federal finances 
determined is measured and responsible. The government is 
determined because we are not letting up our fight to reduce the 
deficit. The books will be balanced. The debt to GDP ratio will be 
on a constant downward track year after year.
<P>
	It is measured because our fiscal action is not indiscriminate and 
mindless but is structured to a pace conducive to efficient 
adaptation. It is designed not as a quick fix but to achieve long 
term, permanent progress.
<P>
	There are those in the House who would want us to believe that a 
quick trashing of the government books would be the cure all of the 
national debt. The government knows that deficit reduction must 
be measured in order for it to be sustainable.
<P>
	Our approach is responsible because it is a strategy that involves 
carefully weighing the needs of our economy and our society and 
equally carefully designing the policy options to meet those needs. 
Just as important, we are striking the balance necessary to keep 
Canadians on side for our deficit reduction efforts.
<P>
	Again, referring to the slash and burn tactics of some people in 
the House, their approach would result in a revolt so massive it 
would make the Ontario strike look like a walk in the park.
<P>
	We all know the reasons behind reducing the deficit but I feel 
they must be reiterated. The lethal combination of high interest 
rates and deficit borrowing also means a growing share of 
government resources must go to interest payments on a growing 
debt.
<P>
	That is why we have acted, not because tackling Canada's fiscal 
problem is not a goal in and of itself but because it is a fundamental 
component for our natural growth, new jobs and economic security.
<P>
	We have maintained our focus on reducing program spending 
because the debt is a problem created by government and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="793"> 793 </A></B>
<P>
solution should focus on cutting in our own back yard. Therefore 
there are no tax increases in the 1996 budget; no personal taxes, no 
corporate taxes,  no excise taxes. This is good news to people in my 
riding and to all Canadians.
<P>
	The federal government has fought quite hard to reduce the 
deficit since taking office. However, what is equally important is 
that the provinces and territories are doing the same. The provincial 
and territorial governments are well on their way to balancing their 
budgets. The combined provincial-territorial deficit has been cut to 
$12.6 billion in 1995-96 from its peak of $25 billion in 1992-93. 
This is a drop of 3.6 per cent of GDP to 1.6 per cent.
<P>
	I am pleased to say the P.E.I. provincial government had a 
balanced budget in 1995 and it did so without major tax increases. 
Even more impressive is the $3.4 million surplus for the 1996-97 
fiscal year presented last week in the provincial legislature by the 
provincial treasurer, the hon. Wayne Cheverie.
<P>
	As a result, Canada's total government sector deficit is projected 
to improve sharply relative to other G-7 countries. This is very 
important for an open country like Canada.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	Since over 30 per cent of our national income is generated by our 
exports, it is important that we remain competitive. All levels of 
government are helping to do that by getting their fiscal houses in 
order. For its part, the federal government is reforming the way it 
conducts its affairs. This and the past two budgets are reducing 
waste and inefficiency and redefining the government's programs 
and activities. These actions will ensure that program spending 
continues to fall through 1998-99 delivering major fiscal savings 
into the future.
<P>
	The federal government will further clarify its core program 
responsibilities in the economy. The government will make these 
programs more efficient and effective in order to deliver better 
quality services at a lower cost to the taxpayer.
<P>
	The program review which was initiated in the 1994 budget is 
continuing. We are still exploring new ways to improve the 
delivery of service and reduce costs. The essence of these changes 
is to give service delivery organizations greater autonomy to 
provide their services in ways that are more responsive to the needs 
of their clients and more cost effective.
<P>
	This will reduce overlap and duplication. Through co-operation 
and partnerships with the provinces and territories, these goals can 
easily be achieved. We are working with the provinces on a 
continuous basis to improve services to Canadians.
<P>
	I have spoken long enough on our deficit reduction agenda. For 
the benefit of hon. members on the other side of the House I would 
now like to talk about some of the benefits of our efforts.
<P>
	Last year the Minister of Finance and cabinet announced the 
implementation of the Canada health and social transfer. As a result 
of the efforts, this transfer will be stabilized and will even begin to 
grow. That is right, it will grow. The CHST will be stabilized at 
$25.1 billion from 1997-98 to the turn of the century. After that this 
transfer will actually grow according to a formula tied to economic 
growth.
<P>
	To the residents of my province of Prince Edward Island this 
means that the 1997-98 CHST will amount to $114 million and by 
the year 2003 it will be up to $122 million. That is good news for 
our provincial government and for Islanders as a whole.
<P>
	Further good news is the guarantee of the cash portion of the 
transfer. The cash floor within the transfer will be guaranteed by 
legislation. This is quite different from the old direction of the 
transfer that would see the cash portion totally disappear within a 
decade. The stability of this transfer is very important to the 
provinces. This will provide greater clarity for their own budget 
forecasts.
<P>
	The groundwork of our deficit reduction was laid out in the first 
half of our mandate. The savings accrued from those hard decisions 
now allow us to turn our attention to other items of concern to 
Canadians. It is through our efforts that our social programs will be 
saved.
<P>
	I for one am glad that when I go back to my riding on the 
weekends I can tell my constituents that the Prime Minister's 
promise to seniors has been kept. The changes announced in this 
year's budget do not affect today's seniors. The pension of every 
Canadian who is 60 and over as of December 31, 1995, and their 
spouses regardless of age, will be fully protected.
<P>
	When the new seniors benefit is implemented in 2001 these 
seniors may choose whichever system is more advantageous, either 
moving to the new system or maintaining their OAS/GIS 
payments. It should be emphasized that savings will come from 
slowing the rate of growth in program costs, not at the expense of 
those in need. While the savings at first will be small, they will 
build year by year to about 11 per cent of program costs by the year 
2030.
<P>
	Legislation will be tabled later this year and we will be inviting 
public submissions on the proposal to be followed by consultations 
through parliamentary committee hearings. The response should be 
positive because the seniors benefit meets these key public goals: 
reducing the long term costs will make the public pension system 
more sustainable; targeting help to those who need it most is the 
fairest way to reduce costs; and with the new seniors benefit all 
Canadians, particularly the young, can be assured the public 
pension system will be there for them now and in the future.
<P>
	Another item of concern to Canadians that has been addressed by 
this budget is reform of child support as was  mentioned by my 
colleague a few moments ago. A more equitable treatment of 
support payments will be implemented. As of May 1, 1997 the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="794"> 794 </A></B>
<P>
system will move to a no deduction, no inclusion format. The 
payers of the support payments will no longer deduct them from 
their taxable income and the custodial parents will not include 
them in their taxable income.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	There will also be guidelines for the payment of child support 
and greater measures for the enforcement of those payments. The 
approach will address the first priority: our children. These 
children are our future. We must provide for them as much as we 
can.
<P>
	That brings me to our next point: investing in our future. The 
government is taking durable, meaningful steps forward rather than 
relying on short term direct spending programs which only result in 
a step back when we look at the long term effect. It emphasizes 
collaboration with partners and strategic investments to steer the 
forces of the economic change toward greater employment, 
employment that is sustainable.
<P>
	But first things first. For the sustained economic growth needed 
to deliver new jobs, we must start by securing Canada's economic 
fundamentals which as I have said earlier means getting the deficit 
down and keeping it down. High persisting deficits go hand in hand 
with high interest rates. High interest rates as we all know 
discourage investment, borrowing and consumer spending. 
Ultimately they discriminate against jobs.
<P>
	We have a plan. We will focus on getting our youth on the job. 
The first job is very important. Giving our youth a better chance at 
their first job will improve their confidence and ability to get the 
equally important second job. Our youth programs will accomplish 
this task. Coupled with our learning package these measures will 
provide the means for young Canadians to get the education and 
experience to obtain the challenging and rewarding career for 
which they strive.
<P>
	However, government cannot do it alone and more important, as 
has been said, it is not supposed to. The role of government is to 
create the economic environment which will allow the private 
sector to create the jobs that are needed to get Canadians back to 
work.
<P>
	It is through partnerships with the private sector that our role can 
be fulfilled. One way the government can do this is to target its 
investment in the key areas of our economy.
<P>
	The budget also increases investment in technology and 
innovation through a number of actions over the next three years 
funded by the reallocation of $270 million from budget savings. 
For example, Technology Partnerships Canada will be established 
to encourage risk sharing with the private sector and to leverage 
investment in the development and commercialization of high 
technology projects and processes. Funding will  grow from about 
$150 million in 1996-97 to about $250 million by the year 1998-99.
<P>
	I believe this is important for all Canadians and I believe it is 
important for my province of Prince Edward Island. We have the 
capabilities to succeed in the high technology world. All we need is 
help to tap into it. Islanders welcome the possibilities that come 
with the focus on high growth sectors of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	I urge Prince Edward Islanders to take full advantage of this 
focus. We have little to lose and so much to gain. It is possible to 
create year round employment on the island and it is up to the 
private sector to create those jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
comments of the hon. member for Hillsborough were along the 
lines that the deficit has been reduced year after year by the Liberal 
government. Certainly that is true, although we have seen the 
federal debt rise to some $600 billion. It has increased over $100 
billion in the time of its mandate.
<P>
	Given that the debt is rising so dramatically, could the hon. 
member for Hillsborough tell us what specific target date the 
government has for reducing the deficit to zero, to have a balanced 
budget, which will enable it to start paying down the debt? Can he 
give us a date?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said in my speech, we have worked 
on deficit reduction. We will continue to do so until the books are 
balanced. I will certainly not give him a date as to when that might 
be, but I can tell him that we are much better prepared to do it now 
than we were over the last number of years. It certainly will take 
place in the distant future.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very attentively to both the Liberal speakers.
<P>
	The best security we can offer the children of Canada are parents 
with a stable income. The greatest threat to the economic stability 
of a family is the unrestricted power of government to tax away its 
wealth.
<P>
	There is an ever rising demand on the revenue dollar to pay the 
interest on an ever rising debt. When the Tories replaced the 
Liberals in 1984 they inherited a $200 billion debt from the 
Liberals. In nine years they added another $300 billion to it. The 
first budget presented by this government promised to add another 
$100 billion to that.
<P>
	When we talk about the security of families and children, that 
debt is the greatest threat to their security. It is the greatest threat to 
good long term, well paying jobs for the parents of those children.
<P>
	I admonish the members who have spoken and also the 
government. As the demand on the revenue dollar continues to 
increase to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="795"> 795 </A></B>
<P>
pay the ever rising interest on our ever increasing debt, the security 
of the individual  family is weakened. The greatest thing we can do 
is to get spending under control and reduce the amount of money 
we need to pay the interest on this huge debt.
<P>
	The greatest transfer of wealth that is going to occur in 1997 is 
not to the provinces or to individuals in Canada. It is going to be to 
those we borrowed the money from, to the tune of approximately 
$50 billion a year.
<P>
	Would the hon. member care to address his views on the threat 
that this picture poses to the economic security of families and 
children in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Mr. Speaker, we all know that the best thing for 
security is full time permanent jobs. The debt is astronomical and 
we all realize that. The government has started to get the deficit 
under control. It has offered some enhancement for the future. The 
economy is going well and jobs will be created if the climate is 
there. I believe the budget has done that. Reports from the media 
state that this is what people in the business community think. It is 
not perfect. I will be the first to admit that. It is probably not in total 
what I would like to see, but it is a lot better than it was when we 
came here. I can guarantee it will continue to get better.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
speaking today as part of the debate on the budget announced on 
March 6 by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Unlike the hon. member who spoke before me, I have no 
congratulations whatsoever for either the Minister of Finance or 
the government for a budget I find deplorable, inequitable, 
regressive and inhumane in a number of ways. The main victims of 
this third Liberal budget are the ordinary folk, the workers, the 
unemployed, the welfare recipients, the elderly, the immigrants, 
the low income families.
<P>
	The other main victims are the provinces, all of the provinces, 
Quebec in particular, which will see their transfer payments 
reduced.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	The massive cuts in this Liberal government's three budgets, in 
particular the last one, are doing great harm to the people of Canada 
and the people of Quebec, and in particular to the ordinary folk in 
my riding of Bourassa, in Montreal North. My riding contains 
many single parent families, many retired people, many 
unemployed people and many, very many, immigrants. These cuts 
do great harm to the 600 people who are on the Montreal North 
waiting list for low rental housing.
<P>
	As I have said, this is an inequitable and unjust budget. The 
unemployment insurance reform and the reduction in transfer 
payments to the provinces for social assistance, health and 
post-secondary education have already sent shock waves through 
the population, and continue to do so. It is my belief that these 
brutal cuts may well trigger a major social crisis in this country.
<P>
	There have been many demonstrations everywhere in Canada 
against the cuts in social programs and against the cuts in 
unemployment insurance, particularly in the Atlantic provinces. 
Everywhere in Quebec, including Montreal, Shawinagan in the 
Prime Minister's riding, Quebec City, the Gaspe, and in Ontario.
<P>
	I believe that these brutal and inequitable cuts are coming close 
to the limit Canadian and Quebec society will tolerate. As we can 
see everywhere, the social situation is becoming increasingly 
explosive, particularly because people can see that the budget is 
unfair, that the major companies, like the banks, and the people in 
the upper income brackets are either not affected at all or only 
barely so.
<P>
	Instead of the government talking with workers or organizations 
representing them, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
is directing insults and accusations at the union leaders, 
particularly the president of the Canadian Labour Congress, the 
union that represents most Canadian workers, with its 2.4 million 
members.
<P>
	On top of that, the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
who should be advocating dialogue among all sectors of society, is 
refusing to meet with the president of the CLC to discuss the cuts in 
social programs and the cuts to unemployment insurance.
<P>
	It is incredible that the government, which is no longer 
contributing to the unemployment insurance fund, is making 
improper use of the $5 billion surplus in the unemployment 
insurance fund, and it is unacceptable. A number of members have 
said here that Quebec receives more in unemployment insurance 
than it contributes. I tell you that, in 1995, employers and workers 
in Quebec paid $4.530 billion dollars into the fund. UI claimants in 
Quebec received only $4.340; a difference of $195 million, which 
was not returned to Quebec. This, despite the fact that, for 
February, the rate of unemployment in Quebec was 11.3 per cent, 
or 414,000 workers actively seeking employment. There is no 
mention of those who are leaving unemployment insurance to go 
on welfare.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	For Canada, the unemployment rate in February was 9.6 per 
cent, or 1,539,000 unemployed workers. That is a lot. It is 
scandalous. What is more, in 1995, the figure was only 1,514,000.
<P>
	I was a UI referee for eight years in Montreal, and all those I 
met-the recipients and the lawyers-used to tell me about the 
need to improve-and not decimate-the UI program, which was 
set up under pressure from the labour movement and the workers. 
The Liberals are in the process of destroying this important social 
benefit.
<P>
	When the Conservative government was in office in 1990, 87 per 
cent of unemployed workers were receiving benefits. In January 
1996, under the Liberal government, 46 per cent of unemployed 
workers were receiving  benefits. Less than half. That is outra-
<P>

<P>
geous. That is why the Bloc Quebecois, like the labour movement 
as a whole, demands that Bill C-12 be immediately withdrawn.
<P>
	In this budget, we expected the government to submit a plan to 
revive the economy and create jobs. Yet, there is nothing of the sort 
in his budget, despite the Liberal Party's famous election promise 
of ``jobs, jobs, jobs''.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to salute those attending the summit on 
the social and economic future opening tonight in Quebec City. 
This is a Quebec government initiative involving the participation 
of unions and employers, among others. I hope that the results of 
this summit will benefit all the people of Quebec and that those 
taking part will take adequate measures to revive the economy and 
create jobs.
<P>
	One of the things that I found most shocking in this budget is that 
it reduces the tax benefits for labour sponsored venture capital 
funds. There is nothing to create jobs in this budget, which cuts 
moneys to the very organizations that seek organizations that seek 
to create and maintain jobs. These labour sponsored venture capital 
funds are effective tools to create jobs. Yet, the government is 
cutting the federal tax credit rate for these funds from 20 to 15 per 
cent and lowering maximum investment from $5,000 to $3,500.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	There are 19 workers' funds in operation in Canada. The funds' 
assets amount to $2.5 billion or $3 billion. They have invested 
more than $850 million in the Canadian economy since they were 
established. In Quebec alone, the fund established by the FTQ, or 
Fédération des travailleurs du Québec, has helped maintain or 
create about 40,000 jobs. Forty thousands jobs in a single province, 
that is very significant.
<P>
	The government claims it wants to get Canadians back to work. 
But why hit workers so hard, and their funds, which are used 
mainly to invest in small and medium size businesses? What is 
terribly unfair in all this is the fact that these cuts affect mostly 
Quebec, where half the money in these investment funds comes 
from.
<P>
	In response to a question by the Bloc Quebecois a few days ago, 
the Minister of Finance said that this kind of tax incentive would be 
reduced, since these funds are now very well established. But it 
certainly is not the case with the CSN's-the Confédération des 
syndicats nationaux-action fund. This is a new fund, which is not 
yet very well established and therefore requires government 
support.
<P>
	I worked on establishing the Fonds de solidarité de la FTQ when 
I was a servicing representative, and this fund has helped thousands 
of FTQ members, people who do not make a lot of money, in 
allowing them to put money aside toward their retirement. It also 
helped maintain or create 40,000 jobs, as I mentioned earlier. Why 
attack this  fund? The proposed cutbacks will slow down job 
creation in Quebec, and particularly in regions where economic 
growth is sluggish.
<P>
	A study conducted by the Canadian Labour Market and 
Productivity Centre shows that the government recoups the tax 
costs relating to workers' funds within three years or less. This 
study takes into account benefits such as the following: with these 
funds, tax revenues increase as a result of investments being made; 
also, reliance on the UI system is reduced because more people are 
at work and fewer claim UI benefits.
<P>
	But the government did not attack the registered retirement 
savings plans, the RRSPs, in its budget. As we all know, such tax 
deductions can help create employment, but 20 per cent of this job 
creation could take place abroad. Twenty per cent of RRSP 
contributions can be invested abroad.
<P>
	Why cut in investment funds then? As I said earlier, 
unemployment is at 11.3 per cent in Quebec, and more than 
800,000 Quebecers are on social assistance.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	The FTQ had the extraordinary idea of setting up this Fonds de 
solidarité a few months ago. I was there, to help complement this 
initiative by establishing regional funds. Nine of these regional 
funds, which will be set up everywhere in Quebec, have already 
been created. I congratulate the FTQ and the officials of the fund 
for their extraordinary contribution to promoting job creation. I 
should point out that the Quebec government and the 
administrative regions are partners in these regional funds.
<P>
	What does this budget provide regarding old age pensions? The 
government creates a new seniors benefit to replace old age 
security, guaranteed income supplement, age credits, as well as 
pension income credits. The most dangerous aspect of this budget 
is that this new seniors benefit puts an end, once and for all, to the 
universality of benefit programs for seniors. This is very serious 
and simply unacceptable. The principle of universality applies to 
all social security programs.
<P>
	The minister tells us that most of these measures will not affect 
current retirees, but future generations will be severely hit by these 
changes. In my riding, in Montreal North, the Association 
québécoise de défense des droits des personnes retraitées et 
préretraitées opposes the federal government's decision. It is 
firmly opposed to any reform that would undermine the benefits 
program for the elderly.
<P>
	As for corporate taxation, we, Bloc Quebecois members, and 
myself in particular as the member for Bourassa, expected the 
government to review the corporate tax system. There is currently a 
shortfall of close to $10 billion. We must put an end to tax havens. 
There is no reform in this budget, only promises and  commissions. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="797"> 797 </A></B>
<P>
There is nothing concrete. Meanwhile, the profits of major banks 
exceeded $5 billion in 1995.
<P>
	This explains the tax revolt. Everyone knows that banks do not 
pay their fair share of taxes. The banks that registered these 
sky-high profits are the same ones that made massive layoffs. We 
demand a true corporate tax reform, as well as the establishment of 
a minimum tax for corporations.
<P>
	According to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration's 
estimates, expenditures for 1996-97 will reach $621.5 million. The 
budget for ICSI will be $76.8 million. This is $8.1 million in 
additional resources for that activity. I do not see the reason for 
spending more to promote citizenship.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the time allotted to the 
hon. member for Bourassa has expired.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great attention to the remarks of the 
member for Bourassa, particularly the comments about the 19 
labour investment funds that have total assets ranging from $2.5 
billion to $3 billion. I know a little bit about them and I take 
exception to his suggestion that these funds are unfairly attacked in 
the budget. He seems to be implying that these funds are creating 
jobs.
<P>
	They are not creating very many jobs. They are great for 
investors because of the tax credit but most of their assets are tied 
up in blue chip stocks and money market vehicles.
<P>
	Would the member for Bourassa support me in pressing the 
government for an amendment that would require the labour 
investment funds to invest at least half their assets in Canadian 
small businesses so that at least $1.5 billion of it would be used to 
create jobs?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez: </B>Mr. Speaker, in Quebec this is what is being done. 
The FTQ's Fonds de solidarité is investing in small and medium 
size businesses. This fund has already created 40,000 jobs. It is a 
start. But I think that it must go further. I am in agreement with the 
general idea of my colleague from Hamilton-Wentworth, but 
until now this initiative has been a complete success. After the 
FTQ's Fonds de solidarité was created, 15 other such funds were 
set up in Canada, including in British Columbia and Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to ask my colleague a few questions. I wonder if he would 
give me his reaction to the comments in the media regarding the 
government's budget.
<P>
	Constituents in my riding, for example, are happy to hear that 
there is no increase in taxes, that there will be  additional cuts 
within government, that funds have been earmarked for the purpose 
of doubling the amounts spent on creating summer jobs, that there 
will be this new initiative to create entry level jobs for young 
people in order to give them experience. They have praised the 
government because it continues to target the deficit and make 
progress. Despite the cuts, it will be able to increase transfers to the 
provinces for health, education, training and social assistance.
<P>
	I therefore wonder if he has any comments to make. I find it 
surprising that the comments he is reporting from his riding seem 
to be very different from those I have been hearing in mine.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, true, there are no new taxes. But 
everybody knows Canadians have been taxed to the hilt, especially 
under the Conservative government. We are told there are no 
additional cuts in this budget, but it is not so. There are several 
cuts, especially to transfer payments to the provinces. These cuts 
are huge. Most cuts announced in the last budget are coming into 
force this year.
<P>
	He points to the job creation initiative for young people. I have 
seen how it has been welcomed by young people. They are not very 
pleased with this kind of job creation. This is not what they wanted. 
This is not significant. The government should have tried a bit 
harder in this area.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to pick up on the 
discussion of labour sponsored venture capital funds. The hon. 
member is correct in pointing out that they have been very 
successful, particularly in the province of Quebec. However, the 
government must at all times look at the total picture and weigh the 
effectiveness of incentives provided against other measures 
presented in the budget.
<P>
	As the budget papers point out, those venture capital funds have 
approximately a two-year supply of capital based on the level and 
the rate of investment that has been engaged in by those funds. It 
seemed to be an appropriate and reasonable measure to scale back, 
to temper the incentive a little bit.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member thinks that government should 
never re-examine and balance the incentives that it provides and 
just keep on benefiting one sector on and on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, such investment funds are 
revolutionary. When they were first created, not too many people 
believed they would work. Small investors, workers whose salary 
might be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="798"> 798 </A></B>
<P>
barely above the  minimum wage, are encouraged to invest in these 
funds, which will provide for their retirement.
<P>
	The goal of these funds is not purely economic. They also have a 
social goal. For instance, the businesses in which the FTQ fund has 
been investing offer economic training to their workers; they learn 
how to take part in managing the firm. The fund is doing a great 
job.
<P>
	Why not tackle some other problem areas? Why not go after tax 
havens instead of workers' funds, and why not levy a minimum 
corporate tax, as is done in the U.S.? There are many areas other 
than workers' investment funds where the government could have 
found more money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I shall be sharing my time with the Secretary of State 
for Multiculturalism and Status of Women.
<P>
	I am most pleased today to be able to take the floor in this noble 
institution to speak on the 1996 budget. This is the third one we are 
presenting, aimed at guaranteeing Canadians budget stability and 
an economy that is vigorous, dynamic and competitive, in today's 
harsh economic context.
<P>
	Along with the 1994 and 1995 budgets, this one maintains a 
broad strategy that is deliberate, measured and responsible and is 
aimed at putting federal public finances on a sounder footing. It is 
deliberate, because our efforts are continuing unrelenting. As the 
Minister of Finance has pointed out, in our implacable fight against 
the deficit there is no going back. We are going to balance our 
books. We shall also put the debt-GDP ratio onto a permanently 
descending curve, dropping lower every year.
<P>
	It is measured, because our action plan is not being applied in a 
blind and reckless manner; it is well structured and proceeding at a 
rate that will allow efficient adaptation. What we are aiming at is 
not a quick fix but permanent progress over the long term.
<P>
	It is responsible, because this is a strategy which requires us to 
take the needs of the economy and of society into account, and to 
use particular care in designing the strategic options which will 
equip us to meet those needs.
<P>
	What is more, we are seeking the necessary balance to allow 
Canadians to join us in our efforts to reduce the deficit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There remains no question about the need for dramatic and 
disciplined action. High public sector deficits and debt have sapped 
confidence, soaked up domestic savings and led to a sharp increase 
in the country's net international indebtedness. Canadians were 
paying a painful high price through the punishing pressure that 
high deficits place on interest rates. This  takes away consumer and 
business investments and drives down job creation.
<P>
	The lethal combination of high interest rates and deficit 
borrowing also meant that a growing share of government 
resources must go to interest payments on a growing debt. This 
year those charges will cost the federal government $47 billion, 
money that cannot go to lowering taxes, aiding those in need and 
helping our economy create new jobs.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These, Mr. Speaker, are our reasons for doing what we did. It is 
not because solving Canada's budget problems constitutes an 
objective in itself, but because it constitutes a fundamental 
component of our national growth, of job creation, and of 
economic security.
<P>
	In the first two budgets, we began a process of improving our 
public finances and of restoring the state's budgetary credibility, 
after years of failing to control the deficit.
<P>
	By setting credible rolling two-year targets, by basing budget 
planning on cautious economic assumptions and by creating 
substantial reserves for contingencies, we are making public 
finances once again credible.
<P>
	The first two budgets provided for unprecedented cuts to 
program expenditures. These structural cuts focussed on the 
medium term. Thanks to them, the 1995-96 and 1996-97 objectives 
of reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of the GDP will be met, despite 
the fact that the growth of the GDP is slower than expected.
<P>
	This progress is due in part to the fact that interest rates are also 
much lower than expected, and this in turn offsets the negative 
effect of the slower GDP growth.
<P>
	The measures announced in the 1996 budget strengthen and 
extend those of our initial budgets and provide an added push 
toward the achievement of our economic and financial goals.
<P>
	We set our sights on the reduction of program expenditures, 
because the debt problem was the creation of the governments. 
They must therefore resolve it by putting their own affairs in order.
<P>
	Therefore, the 1996 budget provides for no increase in taxes. 
There is no increase in income taxes for individuals or 
corporations, and there is no increase in the excise tax.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Expenditure cuts in the 1996 budget will amount to $1.9 billion 
in 1998-99 and will build on the reductions of the two previous 
budgets to keep program spending on a downward track.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="799"> 799 </A></B>
<P>
	Here is a point that must be emphasized: a full 87 per cent of 
the cumulative fiscal actions taken from 1994-95 to 1998-99 will 
have been expenditure savings.
<P>
	Together the three budgets will contribute $26.1 billion in 
savings for 1997-98. This action, together with the reform of the 
employment insurance program, will ensure that we hit the new 
deficit target, to bring the deficit down to 2 per cent of GDP.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Thanks to the measures announced in the budget, we will 
manage to save an additional $28.9 billion in 1998-99, which 
means that the deficit will continue to shrink.
<P>
	There is no doubt we have taken a historical step. The program 
expenditures, that is, all expenditures less interest payments, could 
shrink for six consecutive years, until 1998-99. These are actual 
cuts in real dollars. Expenditures would shrink from $120 billion in 
1993-94 to $105.5 billion in 1998-99, that is, a reduction of 12 per 
cent in the amounts spent.
<P>
	In real terms, the level of program expenditures, adjusted to 
reflect inflation, will in fact be below that for 1984-85.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Program spending, as compared to the size of the economy, will 
be at its lowest level since 1949-50. The debt to GDP ratio, or what 
we owe as compared to what we produce, will drop by 1.1 per cent 
to reach 73.7 per cent in 1997-98. This will be the first significant 
drop since 1974-75.
<P>
	Another fiscal element is worthy of mention. Calculated the 
same way a number of countries, including the United States and 
the United Kingdom, measure their deficit, our financial needs 
reached $30 billion in 1993-94. In 1997-98, they will have dropped 
to only $6 billion. As compared to the size of the economy, this is 
the lowest they have been in nearly 30 years. At this rate, we will 
likely have the lowest shortfall of all G-7 central governments.
<P>
	Two additional points are worthy of mention. First, the economic 
assumptions included in the budget plan are once again more 
conservative than the private sector's. For instance, our projections 
for 1997 are based on interest rates nearly 1 per cent higher, or 80 
base points, than the private sector's forecasts.
<P>
	If economic forecasts reach or surpass the planned levels, the 
deficit could be lower than our 2 per cent deficit target for 1997-98. 
Any unused portion of the contingency reserves will be used 
directly to reduce the deficit even further.
<P>
	Second, the federal government's fiscal health is not the only 
one to improve; that of the provinces and territories is also 
improving markedly. The combined deficit of the provinces and 
territories dropped from a  record $25 billion in 1992-93 to $12.6 
billion in 1995-96, from 3.6 per cent to 1.6 per cent of GDP. 
Consequently, in Canada, the total government deficit should 
improve significantly as compared to the other G-7 countries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1992 the combined government deficits in Canada stood at 7.4 
per cent of GDP. That was double the G-7 average of 3.7 per cent 
and the second highest behind Italy. This year Canada's total 
government deficit will have fallen below the G-7 average to rank 
second lowest among the the G-7 countries, just behind the United 
States. By 1997 our country's total government deficit should be 
the lowest of the G-7 based on the each country's current plans.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Obviously, we are making sustained progress, as are all major 
public administrations. The biggest winners will be Canadians. We 
are taking the necessary steps to lower interest rates, increase 
competitiveness, promote job creation, and improve economic 
security. You can be sure we will stay the course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to correct something that my distinguished colleague 
from Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle said. Our distinguished 
colleague who represents a part rural, part urban riding in this 
House is sticking his chest out and boasting about what a 
responsible budget this is, stating that it was not raising taxes for 
individual taxpayers or the big companies, in a word, it is not 
hitting anybody. There are a few points however in his speech that 
sound dishonest to me in that not all the truth is being said in some 
instances.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	It is true that it did not raise taxes on fuel, tobacco and alcohol, 
but will he recognize however that, by going after milk subsidies in 
its budget, the government will be contributing to making the price 
of butter go up 28 cents a pound and the price of cheese 50 cents a 
kilo?
<P>
	In fact, by eliminating over a period of five years the $4.62 per 
hectolitre milk subsidy, this government is directly attacking 
industrial milk producers and indirectly attacking all Canadian 
consumers, who will see their taxes go up not on alcohol, tobacco 
and fuel, but on their food baskets, and on butter and cheese in 
particular. Is that what he calls a responsible budget?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bertrand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend opposite for 
his question. As you probably know, since our government came to 
office in Ottawa, some 500,000 or 600,000 jobs have been created. 
Obviously, in certain areas, it will be a little more difficult to create 
jobs, but on the whole, the number of jobs created for the long term 
will certainly outweigh the incidental aspects, so to speak, of the 
finance minister's budget.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the speech and was quite impressed at how 
good things are in Canada.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would comment on some questions 
Environics polled from December 12, 1995 to January 11, 1996. 
The first question asked was: Generally speaking, do you approve 
or disapprove of the way the government is handling the economy? 
Approve, 26 per cent; disapprove, 68 per cent.
<P>
	The second question asked was: Generally speaking, do you 
approve or disapprove of the way the current federal government is 
handling the deficit reduction? Approve, 24 per cent; disapprove, 
67 per cent.
<P>
	It gets even gloomier. What about taxes? Generally speaking, do 
you approve or disapprove of the way the current government is 
handling taxation? Approve, 19 per cent; disapprove, 77 per cent.
<P>
	Where is the rosy picture we were just hearing about?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bertrand:</B> Mr. Speaker, since taking office, the deficit 
percentage has gone down from 5.9 per cent to 3 per cent. The 
government is meeting its targets. Next year it will be hitting 2 per 
cent.
<P>
	I am surprised that the member from the third party likes polls so 
much considering that his party is staying at 10 per cent and has not 
moved for a long time.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am proud to speak in support of 
the recent budget brought down by my colleague, the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	This is a good budget. It is a balanced budget and a Liberal 
budget. It continues to support the government's commitment to 
prudent fiscal planning and to a deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP 
while creating opportunity highlighted in the red book for youth, 
women, children and seniors. It continues to secure the future of 
social programs for all Canadians regardless of region. In fact, it 
sets firmly the infrastructure essential to the building of a nation as 
it embarks on the new millennium, a strong, economic and social 
union. It was a pleasant coincidence that the budget was tabled 
during International Women's Week because the budget has many 
initiatives that will advance the economic independence of women, 
albeit in a time of economic restraint.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	There were creative new policies that showed how equality can 
be served when there is a strong political will to do so. The budget 
serves women in all stages of their lives; as students, as youth, as 
mothers, as entrepreneurs, as seniors. It does so by using a variety 
measures from enhancing access to education and training, to 
investment of actual dollars toward low income families, many 
being single mothers.
<P>
	Let me point out some of the creative measures in the budget that 
show how the government understands the reality of women's 
lives. The initiative that received the most media attention has been 
the child support package. The object of this reform is to place the 
well-being of the child first. It is based on the clear principle that 
support of one's child is not discretionary but is a duty.
<P>
	It makes four specific changes. The first is a non-inclusion, 
non-deduction tax policy that not only puts more money in the way 
of the child but levels the playing field between divorced parents 
and those families that stay together.
<P>
	Second are specific guidelines that will set payment levels based 
on the gross annual income of the non-custodial spouse with room 
for relief if there is hardship to that parent.
<P>
	Third are enforcement measures that would ensure the 
compliance of a non-custodial parent who wilfully reneges on 
payments by denying access to passports or other federal licences. 
The data base of Revenue Canada will be utilized to track these 
parents who try to evade provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Fourth and most important, the moneys realized by Revenue 
Canada from this change in tax policy will be used to double the 
working income supplement to 700,000 low income parents, 
one-third of whom are single parents.
<P>
	The Prime Minister spoke in his reply to the throne speech of 
creating security for older Canadians. The budget made good on 
that promise. The new senior's benefit which will combine OAS, 
GIS, the tax and pension benefits into a single tax free payment will 
benefit nine of out ten single women. Almost 60 per cent of seniors 
are women, many of whom live in low income situations. In fact, 
80 per cent of seniors, single or couples have low incomes of under 
$45,000 and they will get the same or more money under this new 
plan. Also, this new seniors benefit is fully indexed.
<P>
	This innovative move which targets low and modest income 
seniors is the only way we can ensure the future sustainability of 
the old age security which today represents one-fifth of federal 
government spending. The government continues to show its 
commitment to fairness. While securing the future of low and 
income seniors we have also given assistance to those future 
seniors who will depend mostly on private incomes by removing 
the limits on RRSP carry forwards.
<P>
	The child care expense deduction has been expanded so that it 
applies more widely to parents pursuing full time studies while 
raising their families. This will help women get an education or 
training, to enter the workforce and secure their economic 
independence.
<P>
	Single parents will now be allowed the same deductions 
available for couples pursuing full time studies, and the age limit 
for day care has been increased from 14 to 16. These simple 
initiatives 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="801"> 801 </A></B>
<P>
have recognized the reality of women's lives and that of their 
children and has levelled the playing field so that women's access 
to education and training can be expanded.
<P>
	The budget is not only about women, it is about the 
government's continued recognition of the importance of small and 
medium size business and how they play a role in job creation.
<P>
	Concerning the new world of technology the 21st century 
Canadian must face and master about the globalization of putting in 
place policy initiatives that would improve the access of small 
business to global markets, policies that would increase access to 
the Internet, that would enhance research into environmental and 
biotechnologies, in every way the budget has moved Canada into 
the competitive starting line for the new millennium. I am gratified 
to see that my province of British Columbia, the leader in 
environmental and biotechnology, will benefit from these policies.
<P>
	Women, seniors and entrepreneurs represent today's world. How 
do we build a tomorrow? How do we ensure our productivity 
increases and that we can ensure our continued evolution as a world 
competitor? The answer lies in our youth, and by making youth a 
priority the budget has again shown itself to be forward looking and 
progressive.
<P>
	I can go on about partnerships with the private sector to give 
youth their first jobs and to get them out of the catch-22 situation of 
no job without experience, no experience without a job. I can talk 
about the doubling of summer jobs, the increased Youth Service 
Canada initiatives for community work or I can speak to the 
increase in RESPs or the increase in the tax credits for education, 
but there is not enough time.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Liberal governments throughout Canada's history have put into 
place the social infrastructure we have come to take for granted: 
medicare, social security, post-secondary education subsidies, 
student loan programs.
<P>
	It is appropriate that a Liberal government spearhead the 
evolution of these programs so that they are relevant to the needs of 
the 21st century Canadian and to the new federal-provincial 
partnership.
<P>
	When the CHST was brought in as a positive alternative to the 
established programs financing and CAP in the last budget, I saw it 
as a positive step in a new decentralization of management.
<P>
	Stabilizing the cash component in the budget at $11 billion and 
setting in a five-year plan that would see an increase in the transfer 
of payments in the last three years are other moves in securing a 
future for Canadians which will ensure Canada continues to have a 
strong social and economic union as we move into the next 
millennium.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague from the government has just stated that this is an 
excellent budget. I, on the other hand, could say that this budget is 
hypocritical toward women and young people. Although it refers to 
subsidies to provide our young people with summer jobs, we know 
full well that the government had already cut $25 million in the 
previous budget. So this is the lesser of two evils. The budget tries 
to make some adjustments, but the last budget still contained cuts 
to community group programs for women.
<P>
	These groups have seen their funds reduced by 31 per cent over 
six years. The last budget cut funding for women's organizations 
by 6 per cent. I am not so complimentary or positive about this 
budget. Look at what is happening today. People are still 
demonstrating. I was watching the news earlier and everywhere in 
Quebec and Ontario people are demonstrating. The federal 
government has cut transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	People are indicating that they are not happy with this budget. 
Do they seem happy? Not at all. They are warning us that our social 
programs are in danger because of the government's pervasive 
cuts. There was an attempt to please young people and women, but 
women also want jobs. I feel that neither this budget nor the last 
one created jobs for women, or that real, concrete measures were 
taken.
<P>
	The federal government has not invested a red cent in the UI 
fund, and yet it wants to centralize. The UI fund is even running a 
surplus, which the government plans to use to reduce its deficit.
<P>
	I, for one, do not think this is a good budget for women. It is not 
what women are telling us. The last budget came under severe 
criticism, and I do not think that this budget will improve women's 
lot. Giving them the right to receive UI benefits and the income 
supplement will not create jobs, but simply ease the economic 
situation. However, for young women, for women returning to the 
labour force, there are no job creation initiatives.
<P>
	My colleague also talked about nation building. I would like to 
ask her this: Is she aware that, within the nation they want to build, 
there are founding peoples, including Quebec francophones and 
natives?
<P>
	I am very pessimistic about this budget. I would call it a 
hypocritical budget. It does not show any desire on the 
government's part to decentralize. There is some duplication. I 
think that, with all the commissions-on revenue, on health-it 
promises to set up, the federal government is once again trying to 
create jobs for its own people at the expense of the provinces.

<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to respond to my hon. 
colleague's questions. My colleague has forgotten some things and 
probably has not read the full budget.
<P>
	How can my colleague say that in the budget we have not put 
into place anything for women? The obvious concern of everyone 
is that putting money into programs is the only answer. We have 
made some fairly creative and innovative changes in the budget. 
We have changed tax structures. We have increased the ability for 
many more women, especially single women, to have access to day 
care, including single women who are parents attending high 
school. This a very innovative budget.
<P>
	I was at the United Nations last week. When we talked about 
some of these tax initiatives, countries in which fiscal restraint is 
the order of the day were extremely excited to see some of the ways 
we were able to give women economic independence and ensure 
their equality in times that are tight.
<P>
	The hon. member maybe should stop looking at the old ways and 
start looking at some creative, innovative ways to go about 
changing things.
<P>
	The hon. member speaks of summer jobs as if the program is 
something which is not worthwhile. Imitation is the best form of 
flattery. British Columbia has just embarked on a summer job 
program that echoes ours exactly. Therefore it tells us we are on the 
right track to helping youth.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
	As I speak to the budget today, I cannot help but think it is 
almost a waste of my time. Through a series of unforeseen 
circumstances we are here on the second day of debate on the 
budget, almost two weeks after it was introduced in the House. 
Already the budget is of little if any concern to the Canadian 
people. It was insignificant 12 days ago when the finance minister 
gave the budget speech and it is of even less significance today.
<P>
	The budget the government members are so proud of is a budget 
that does nothing. Actually it seems to be the rallying cry of the 
Liberal government, the party that does nothing and is proud of it.
<P>
	I know I am being a little facetious here. After all, the 
government has done something. After three years in power the 
government will have added $100 billion to the national debt. For 
some unknown reason members opposite seem to think this is a 
great thing to have done. I would like to put their record into some 
statistical perspective.
<P>
	The Liberal government has been in power for less than 2.5 per 
cent of the 129 years Canada has existed as a country. During this 
short period it is responsible for 17  per cent of the entire debt. 
There is a record these Liberals can be proud of. They have been 
able to run up the debt at a faster rate than any other government in 
the history of Canada.
<P>
	I can see the Liberals in their caucus meeting chanting ``we are 
number one, we are number one''. Unfortunately the members of 
the government have actually bought the premise that having a 
deficit of 3 per cent of GDP is some magic elixir. Three per cent of 
GDP is irrelevant when the national debt is 75 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	This massive debt load we carry is the biggest threat to our social 
programs and the greatest hindrance to increased employment. The 
government is following in the same footsteps as the Tories when 
they came to power in the mid-1980s. It is not doing things 
differently. It is not being creative.
<P>
	The Tories also took modest steps to improve on the disasters the 
previous Liberal government had created, and then congratulated 
themselves for their meagre accomplishment. The Tories failed to 
take advantage of a booming economy to get their finances in 
order. When the recession hit, they were in dire straits.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately the Liberals do not seem to have learned from the 
mistakes of the Tories. Here we are with some of the lowest interest 
rates in the last 30 years, a booming economy in the United States, 
low inflation, yet our economy is stifled by sluggish growth and we 
still have far too many people unemployed. What is the problem? 
In case government members have not noticed, it is the debt.
<P>
	The debt costs Canadians $50 billion a year in interest payments. 
It astounds me when I hear members of the government and the 
socialists complain about our banks earning billion dollar profits. 
Do they not realize that much of the profit the banks earn is from 
interest payments on money they lend to the federal government? It 
is not just Canadian banks. Each year our government sends almost 
$20 billion of taxpayers' money to foreign banks and financial 
institutions.
<P>
	Has the government not realized that with almost 33 cents on 
every dollar the government spends going to service the debt that it 
is extremely limited in what it can accomplish?
<P>
	The Reform Party knows the problem is the debt. The IMF 
knows the problem is the debt. Even the CIA knows the problem is 
the debt. That is right, the CIA.
<P>
	While surfing the net last week, my office came across the CIA's 
home page. While it does not list all its secrets on the Internet, it 
does list its analyses on all the countries around the world. It has a 
very thorough eight page listing on Canada. Of particular interest 
was its information on our economy. In summary, the CIA  states: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="803"> 803 </A></B>
<P>
``With its great natural resources, skilled labour force and modern 
capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects, although 
the country still faces high unemployment and a growing debt''.
<P>
	If everyone else recognizes the problem, why has not the 
government? Instead it brags about a deficit of around $30 billion 
this year and $20 billion and some next year.
<P>
	What is particularly troubling is how the government is reducing 
the debt. Much of its cost cutting has involved a reduction in 
transfers to the provinces. That means the federal government is 
not seen cutting any of its programs; rather the provinces have to 
cut theirs. It looks good for the feds, but the real losers are the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	The other major sleight of hand is how the government is now 
using unemployment insurance premiums to subsidize other 
government spending. It is true that two years ago the 
unemployment insurance fund was in a deficit situation, but that 
deficit has been eliminated. By the end of this year there will be a 
$5 billion surplus. By next year there will be close to a $10 billion 
surplus.
<P>
	Is the money being saved in a special unemployment fund which 
can be used the next time there are more expenditures than 
revenue? Of course not. It is put right into the consolidated revenue 
fund. Is there any chance that the government will reduce the 
premiums so that employers and employees will have more money 
in their pockets to stimulate the economy? Of course not. The 
government is keeping the money in its pocket so it looks like it is 
doing something about the deficit.
<P>
	The government should be spending less time on optics and 
more time on doing the right thing. What is the right thing? To 
figure that out I think the best minds in the Liberal Party scour 
through the Reform Party's policies to see what idea they can steal 
next. If the government continues to steal the Reform Party's 
policies and platforms, it will eventually get around to addressing 
the debt. After all, it has already adopted our policies on seniors.
<P>
	In my constituency there is a large senior population. 
Amendments to the old age security program will be viewed with 
particular interest. In the last election campaign the Reform Party 
suggested two changes to OAS: calculating income on a family 
basis and eliminating payments to high income earners. I recall the 
Liberals condemning us for these suggestions. ``How unfair to use 
family income to calculate benefits'', they said. ``It is heresy'', 
they stated, ``for Reform to suggest that we eliminate payments to 
high income earners, as that would mean the death of 
universality''.
<P>
	What do we see in this budget? The end of universality and the 
family based income calculation. It is so typical of this government 
to say one thing to get elected and then do the opposite when in 
government.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	If this government had just adopted our position on the debt and 
deficit, it could have saved Canadian taxpayers billions of dollars 
in interest payments. It could have prevented billions of dollars 
from being sent out of the country to foreign financial institutions. 
Maybe it could have let Canadians enjoy some of that excellent 
economic potential that we would have if it were not for our debt. 
Hey, if you do not believe us, go ask the CIA.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Nunatsiaq, Lib.):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting to hear the hon. member 
complain about all the things the government is doing wrong, while 
at the same time telling us that the UI deficit has gone, that it is 
now in surplus. Today we have the lowest interest rates in 30 years 
and a low inflation rate. I cannot figure out what the hon. member 
has to complain about. She just told Canadians that this 
government has done a very good job of attacking those things.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned at the beginning of her speech 
something about how we are cutting the social programs. I am 
wondering what she would do for single parents who are having a 
hard time in their day to day living or for the aboriginal people who 
are at the bottom end of the economic scale, and which we are 
doing something about to address, such as the Nisga'a case. We are 
trying to right the wrongs that have been done over the years. The 
Reform Party does not support the negotiated agreements we have 
made with the Nisga'a or any other land claims. Reformers think 
we are giving away the land and the money to aboriginal people.
<P>
	What does the hon. member think the government should be 
doing to address the wrongs that have been done to the aboriginal 
people over the issue of lands and other rights, as well as the 
disabled and all the other social issues?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that a member 
from the Liberal government asks what we are going to do. I will 
tell him what we would do.
<P>
	We would not be taking the money from the workers in higher 
unemployment insurance premiums so that the government can say 
it is looking after the deficit. We would be reducing the premiums 
so that the workers would have more money in their pockets and 
the employers would have more money in their pockets so they 
could create more jobs.
<P>
	This is interesting coming from a member on the government 
side which has taken $6.3 billion out of provincial transfers. The 
Reform Party would support education, health and social services 
for the single parents and for those who need help. The Liberal 
government has taken $6.3 billion away from those  transfer 
payments. The Reform Party on the other hand, in our budget that 
at least balanced the books instead of having 3 per cent of GDP, 
only took away $3.3 billion. It is incredible that we have members 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="804"> 804 </A></B>
<P>
on the government side who are taking money away from the most 
needy in this country far more than the Reform Party ever talked 
about doing. I am offended.
<P>
	What would I do with the aboriginal people? What is missing in 
all of these treaty agreements is any talk about how the moneys will 
be used to create employment, to create economic opportunities for 
the Nisga'a people. It does not talk about how the Nisga'a people 
are going to take on the responsibilities of self-government and 
control the development of their communities.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Those are the things that are missing from the agreement. The 
only thing these agreements deal with is how the money will be 
transferred from the federal government to the aboriginal people 
without any notion of how they are going to use that money to 
remove themselves from dependency on the government. Those are 
the things that need to be talked about.
<P>
	How are we going to give aboriginal people the ability to walk 
away with their heads held high without having to continually go 
back to government for more financial assistance? That is what the 
native people are asking for. They want the ability to be the same as 
every other Canadian and the government is not doing that for 
them.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before I begin my comments on the budget debate I would 
beg the indulgence of the House. I would like to put on record a 
clarification and a correction to some comments I made in the 
throne speech debate in which I referred to events or the notion of a 
distinct society in Quebec as being inherently racist and tribalist in 
nature.
<P>
	On reflection and seeing those comments in print I was most 
uncomfortable because I felt the linking of the term racist was 
inappropriate; it was wrong. By any inference I would not want 
<I>Hansard</I>, the official record, to show in any way that I would 
suggest separatists are racists and that Quebec society is racist in 
nature. In my experience it is not.
<P>
	I reiterate Quebec society is very tribal. There is tribalism and a 
sense of the necessity to circle around a group. I think tribalism is a 
very accurate description of what is going on with the separatists in 
Quebec. Again, I would beg the indulgence of the House to allow

<B><A NAME="805"> 805 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. All I wanted was 
to have it on the record.
<P>
	It is really puzzling that the country can be in the state it is in 
today and yet the people are not out in the streets rioting. They do 
not seem to be particularly upset. One has to ask what it is about the 
human nature and the body politic in Canada which does not hold 
the Liberal government accountable for 30 or 40 years of 
mismanagement of the economy. It got us into this mess in the first 
place.
<P>
	If you are looking for ground zero on what screwed up our 
economy, we are looking across at it right now, the descendants of 
this paternalistic liberalized state. Why are the people not enraged, 
particularly the young people in our society who are in university 
or high school and are looking at their futures? Why do they not 
feel some sense of passion at the fact that their generation is going 
to be paying the bills and will have a substantially diminished 
lifestyle because my generation and the generation that preceded 
me lived beyond its means?
<P>
	What it is about human nature and about being Canadian that 
allows us to accept this? I know we got into this mess gradually. We 
all know the story about the incipient nature of gradualism and 
why, we got up this morning and noticed that we had a debt and we 
were paying almost 40 per cent of every dollar that goes into the 
federal coffers to pay interest on money we have already spent. 
Nobody would have envisioned that 30 years ago. Even the 
Liberals would say it was irresponsible to do that. It was a gradual 
thing. We gradually grew into it so that we did not have that shock 
to our system.
<P>
	Everyone sees what is going on now in the country and where it 
is our responsibility to pay. As a society we have elevated certain 
demands. As individuals citizens we expect certain things from 
government that we used to expect from ourselves. Once we 
expected to be personally responsible but over the last 30 years or 
so we have come to count on the federal government to be 
responsible for our welfare and how we get along in life.
<P>
	I give this government and the present finance minister full 
marks for taking the first tentative steps to do what has to be done. 
Perhaps that is the difference between this government over others. 
Could you envision the Liberal government opposite, even taking 
the tentative steps it has in the right direction, if it was facing the 
kind of opposition that the Conservative government in 1984 was 
facing? The body politic in Canada has shifted so much that the 
Liberal members are now looking across at us and we are telling 
them what to do but to do it with more vigour and more fire in their 
belly. We are saying that the sooner and faster we do it the better 
our children and grandchildren will be.
<P>
	The Liberal members look across to us and we are telling them to 
get on with the job. However, the Conservative members in 1984 
were looking across at a  Liberal opposition that cried bloody 
murder every time the Conservatives made a tentative step in the 
right direction. That is why the Conservatives lost the will of the 
people. They did not have the courage to stay the course. They were 
elected on a platform of fiscal responsibility. They did not do it and 
now the Conservative Party is dead across the country.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	Today the Liberals are tentatively taking the first steps in the 
right direction, urged on by the Reform Party. The Bloc really does 
not have a philosophy. Every once in a while its members will say 
``do not do this'' and ``do not do that'', but they really do not 
understand or do not have a sense of passion other than getting 
Quebec out of Canada.
<P>
	The Reform Party is making it possible for the Liberals to do 
what the Conservatives should have done. The Liberals know in 
their hearts what must be done because they got us started on this 
terrible path 30 years ago. That is the reality of the situation. 
However we have to continue to ask, how did we find ourselves in 
this situation? How did we allow this to happen?
<P>
	The federal government right now is passing off to the provinces 
responsibility for social programs, for the infrastructure of our way 
of life that had previously been paid for by the federal government 
but is now paid for by provincial governments. It is not sending 
money along to pay the bills. Therefore it is the provincial 
governments that have to pay the piper. The federal government is 
calling the tune, the provincial governments are paying the piper.
<P>
	We see even now the strangest of all things. Miracles can 
happen. The ex-leader of the official opposition, Mr. Bouchard, is 
now the premier of Quebec. All of a sudden there is a revelation. 
He finds that there is another priority. If Quebec does not get its 
financial house in order what difference does it make if you are 
bankrupt and broke in French or English? Perhaps he is starting to 
get his priorities together.
<P>
	The problem with this budget is not its general direction. The 
problem is that it is not honest. Over the years the federal 
government has set up an expectation of delivery of services across 
the country. It cannot afford to do it but it does not have the courage 
to say: ``My friends, we have been living beyond our means. It is 
time to tighten our belts. We must do it without sloughing off the 
responsibility to other orders of government. We must take the heat 
ourselves''.
<P>
	That is the great tragedy of this budget and in my opinion the 
great tragedy of the Liberal government as a whole. It has the 
ability right now to do what it knows must be done and to do it with 
vigour instead of backing into it and being embarrassed about it. It 
has to be done with vigour and it has to be done with dispatch 
because the longer it drifts, the more pussyfooting around that it  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="806"> 806 </A></B>
<P>
does, more of the problems of our grandparents are going to be put 
into the hands of our grandchildren.
<P>
	As parliamentarians our responsibility is not to our 
grandparents. It is to our grandchildren. Everything that we do 
should be done with an eye to the future.
<P>
	I expect I will receive a few questions from those opposite. I see 
some of the members are busy scribbling some information down 
and I know that soon they will be rising from their chairs, hopefully 
to take me to task and to ask me to defend my thesis that they 
started it and that they do not have the courage to take it as fast and 
as far as they should to solve the problem. I would use as a 
foundation for that statement the fact that the Prime Minister in his 
budget address passed off responsibility to the private sector for job 
creation.
<P>
	The Liberal government campaigned on a platform of jobs, jobs, 
jobs, getting rid of the GST, saying and doing whatever it took to 
get the maiden out. The Liberals were doing whatever it took to get 
the votes in order to get here.
<P>
	The Reform Party philosophically differs from the Liberal Party 
in a number of areas. One major area is that we understand very 
clearly it is the role and the correct area of our economy for the 
private sector to create and deliver jobs. Job growth in the future 
will come from investment in the private sector by the private 
sector. It will not come from the public sector.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	The government challenges the private sector to help. There are 
some good things about it, such as the challenge to hire students 
during the summer. That is a good challenge. The private sector can 
take it up and hire students. It can create work so that the flowers of 
our future will have a sense of self-worth. We all must buy into 
that.
<P>
	I do not think it is necessarily bad to say: ``We have to come 
together. We have to do it''. However, the responsibility of the 
federal government is to create a climate which will allow the 
private sector to do what the private sector must do: be efficient 
and innovative. To do that a climate must be created which will 
allow the private sector to retain earnings; to retain wealth. It is the 
reinvestment of private wealth that creates jobs. If entrepreneurs 
decide that they are going to risk everything in order to create a 
business they must know that they will be able to retain some of the 
fruits of their labour.
<P>
	The job of the federal government is to create the lowest possible 
tax environment, with a good infrastructure, that will allow the 
private sector to compete in the global marketplace.
<P>
	I would like to mention some of the budget considerations with 
respect to divorce, child support and so on. I have a great deal of 
experience in making  maintenance payments. I believe that the 
government is moving in the right direction. When people bring 
children into the world, it is the responsibility of the parents, 
whether or not they are divorced, to raise, nurture and care for their 
children. The government is taking the first steps in the right 
direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now I can complete the question which I tried to ask 
earlier when I was cut off because of time constraints.
<P>
	On page 29 of today's Quorum there is an article entitled ``View 
from the West'' which states that Michael Walker, boss of the 
Fraser Institute and the chief guru of the Conservative movement 
on economic matters says that he was frankly impressed and 
reassured by the finance minister's budget. ``Far from being a 
do-nothing budget, it is probably the most significant budget 
produced by the federal government in the late 20th century''.
<P>
	Among other things he said that it showed the government is on 
track to reduce the deficit to zero by the end of the decade. It 
showed that federal spending cuts were actually more severe than 
those of the Klein government in Alberta. It showed that Canada 
was borrowing less than any other G-7 country.
<P>
	That third point is very important. I hope the hon. member will 
compare his notes with this article and tell us where he stands on 
the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member opposite most graciously for giving me the opportunity to 
rise once more to address that article.
<P>
	Visitors to Washington know the famous Lincoln memorial 
which is dedicated to Abraham Lincoln, who was considered to be 
the number one reformer of the Americas. It was the Reform 
Republican Party that Abraham Lincoln started. He, as everyone 
here knows, is regarded as one of the most pre-eminent politicians 
in modern history. He said: ``If you do not care who gets the credit, 
there is no end to what may be accomplished''.
<P>
	We have raised the issues of fiscal responsibility in the House of 
Commons. We have made it politically correct to be fiscally 
responsible. If not for the Reform Party day in and day out holding 
the Liberal's feet to the fire, telling them to pay attention and 
change what the Liberal Party has been doing for the last 30 years, 
pay attention to fiscal concerns and make sure we do not leave our 
grandchildren a legacy of debt, if not for Reform Party singularly 
pushing this issue year after year, time after time, the Liberals 
would not have had the courage or the fortitude to do what in their 
hearts they knew they must.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="807"> 807 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	We can thank Abraham Lincoln and thank the Reform Party. 
Remember these words: ``If you do not care who gets the credit, 
there is no end to what may be accomplished''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after hearing the speech by the member for 
Edmonton Southwest I cannot help believe I have heard those 
words before. It appears he simply paraphrased the budget speech 
of the hon. Minister of Finance.
<P>
	He also talked about creating at atmosphere for business. There 
was a major announcement by the Minister of Industry last week 
dealing with science and technology. He indicated there is a need to 
create at atmosphere for private business. Friday's Calgary Herald 
said: ``The Liberals have moved on settling the economic table for 
private business''.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member whether he approves of the budget, of the 
atmosphere being created by the Minister of Finance. In effect is he 
putting his stamp of approval on the budget speech?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, anywhere strong hand and 
courage are seen, they should be appreciated and respected. I can 
imagine the Minister of Finance in his caucus has had some the 
most egregiously difficult times in changing the direction of the 
Liberal government of 30 years, making members look carefully in 
a mirror and asking: ``Oh my God, what have we done to our 
country, to the future of our country? What have we done to our 
grandchildren?''
<P>
	For the minister to have the strength to go into his caucus and 
pull half the caucus along grudgingly, that must be respected. 
While I do not agree the budget is fast enough or strong enough, the 
last Liberal budget is a light year ahead of the last 30 years of 
Liberal budgets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest because probably unknowingly in his speech he gave 
credit to 40 Liberal MPs who sat in the House between 1984 and 
1988 for scaring the blazes out of 212 Tories in the House. Then he 
gave credit to some 80 Liberal members who sat here between 
1988 and 1993 for polishing them off and putting the government 
in place to run the country.
<P>
	No matter when budgets are delivered in a parliamentary session 
and regardless of the fiscal issues surrounding a budget, each 
budget in turn has its impact on various segments of society.
<P>
	The last two budgets have been aimed at getting federal finances 
in order. This budget is no exception to recent fiscal policies 
because there are benefactors and then there are others who get hit 
negatively.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance does not have an easy role. Unlike his 
predecessors in the Tory days, when he sets a target he has every 
intention of meeting it. With all this scenario, it behoves us not to 
lose sight of those things in our economic structure that have 
served us well in the past and which will build a good future in the 
days ahead.
<P>
	Sometimes there is a very thin line between cost cutting to save 
money and cost cutting which in the long run does not serve as well 
as hoped.
<P>
	These are the challenges that face the Minister of Finance and 
the government today. There are a host of positive things in this 
budget and there are other items that lay the groundwork for 
difficulties to come.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	We are ensuring a secure, stable and growing system of federal 
support for medicare, post-secondary education and social 
assistance through the Canada health and social transfer to the 
provinces. There will be no further cuts in the transfer to the 
provinces. We have announced a firm funding commitment for a 
five-year period beginning in 1998-99.
<P>
	For the first two years the Canada health and social transfer will 
remain constant at $25.1 billion and for the next three years it will 
increase each year. For the first time the federal government has set 
a cash floor for transfers. The cash component of the Canada health 
and social transfer will never be lower than $11 billion a year 
during this period.
<P>
	We are acting to restore confidence in the old age security 
system by creating a new seniors benefit to take effect in 2001 
designed to help those who need help the most. That is the way it 
was when I first came into the House.
<P>
	As promised, current seniors will continue to receive the benefits 
they receive now. The changes will ensure the sustainability of the 
system for years to come. Canada's future depends on our ability to 
show innovative technology leadership, and the government's 
commitment to jobs and growth was reinforced in both the speech 
from the throne and the budget.
<P>
	The budget outlined priorities for investing in our future in three 
strategic areas: creating better ways to get young Canadians into 
the job market, expanding our efforts to increase international 
trade, and accelerating the development and use of technology. 
Technology is a priority because it is fundamental to increased 
economic growth in this country or any other modern day country.
<P>
	In his budget speech the finance minister spoke about investing 
in the future, about providing hope for jobs and for growth. He 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="808"> 808 </A></B>
<P>
said: ``If our future is to be brighter, we  must invest in it''. Clearly 
this is good business and it is also good government.
<P>
	Although not specifically mentioned in the budget speech, one 
outcome of the prebudget program review has been a 42 per cent 
cut in the annual allocation to Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. The 
cut, to be administered over two years, was apparently the result of 
a purely business assessment, by government and by a firm brought 
in, of the short term needs of that crown corporation. It was based 
on bottom line logic from a consulting firm, not the vision for the 
future.
<P>
	The government, through the Minister of Natural Resources, is 
attempting to find a new home for this one-half century of proven 
basic research that was started at Chalk River, Ontario about 50 
years ago. What has only now become clear is that this 42 per cent 
cut in the business support spread out over two years has been 
transformed by AECL into the complete removal of all its basic 
research activities, some immediately and the rest within a year. It 
is cashing in on the very investment on which the future depends.
<P>
	Basic or fundamental research is the search for scientific 
knowledge without a specific application in mind. This generalized 
search for knowledge is essential if real innovation is ever to occur 
because tomorrow's application of today's research usually cannot 
even be imagined today; we cannot command what we do not 
know.
<P>
	A good example is about 170 years ago an accomplished British 
scientist was asked by the Royal Society to improve optical glass, a 
task which he felt he could not refuse. After 10 years of fruitless 
labour he wrote in 1831 to ask permission, ``to set aside the glass 
work for a while that I may enjoy the pleasure of working out my 
own thoughts on other subjects''. In other words, he wanted to do 
some pure research.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Within two months Michael Faraday had discovered 
electromagnetic induction and built the first prototype dynamo in 
world history. From those two months of basic research have come 
today's mammoth electricity generators that supply our industry 
and give us lights in the House.
<P>
	There are two important questions that arise from this story. 
First, would the world today have been a better place if the Royal 
Society had insisted that Michael Faraday continue his efforts on 
the more practical application of glass? Second, is it likely that any 
government committee or task force in 1831 would have arrived at 
electromagnetic induction as a strategic technology worthy of 
public support?
<P>
	The answer to both these questions is a resounding no. This 
historical observation is not lost on the G-7 countries today. For 
example, a document entitled ``Science in the National Interest'', 
issued and signed by  President Clinton in late 1994, states: ``We 
understand that the fruit of fundamental research initiatives may 
not ripen for some time. The time scale can be long and success 
may hinge on facilities and interdisciplinary research teams that 
take years to assemble. Even in the face of current budgetary 
pressures, considerations about fundamental science must remain 
integral to the agency planning activities. We cannot allow a short 
term mission focus to compromise the development of the 
intellectual capital vital to our nation's future''.
<P>
	Even more emphatic is the example of Japan. Its response to the 
recent downturn in its economy has been to double its spending on 
basic research.
<P>
	In light of these facts, it is astonishing that we are now 
threatened in Canada with the dismantling of one of the best 
examples we have of a marriage of basic research and 
economically successful applications.
<P>
	Basic research in nuclear science has been an essential part of 
the country's nuclear program since the mid-1940s when it was 
started under the National Research Council. It has supplied the 
fundamental knowledge required by the industry, provided many of 
its leaders and given lustre to the national effort by its international 
reputation for excellence.
<P>
	As a result AECL and its partners have produced the best 
performing and most versatile reactor system in the world. They 
have done so at a fraction of the research and development cost of 
any of their competitors. The industry now employs 30,000 
Canadians, contributes more than $3 billion per year to the gross 
domestic product and generates over $500 million in federal tax 
revenue.
<P>
	In addition to its role in launching and sustaining this industry, 
the basic research components of AECL are also serving as 
national laboratories for university researchers and Canada around 
the world. They foster research in nuclear science and other related 
fields throughout the country. They offer facilities no one 
university could operate and maintain on its own. They give many 
university professors access to the frontiers of world science they 
could not otherwise find without going abroad. They train students 
who form the next generation of Canadian researchers.
<P>
	These labs at Chalk River perfected the O ring for the U.S. 
shuttle when the previous shuttle had blown up. They 
manufactured and developed radio isotopes which are used in 
hospitals around the world today. I emphasize that at Chalk River 
our scientists and researchers handle radioactive wastes from 
hospitals across the country.
<P>
	These national laboratories for basic research at Chalk River 
have been centres of excellence for decades. They have been 
examples of a partnership among government, industry and the 
universities. In short, they are exactly what the Canadian 
government seeks to create as we prepare for the next century.
<P>

<P>
	I am hoping, and so are many others, that the Minister of Natural 
Resources will find a new home for such physics organizations as 
TASCC and Neutron Scattering and that environmental research 
will not be scaled back at Chalk River at this time.
<P>
	These are the 260 letters that have been received from top 
scientists from across Canada and from approximately 30 countries 
around the world who respect the basic research that is going on in 
Canada today. I lay this before the House today because it is an 
important matter for the future of Canada.
<P>
	The stress testing of aircraft parts of the aircraft we fly in has 
been done in these labs. The aerospace industry has benefited 
greatly. Bertram Brockhouse, our 1994 Nobel laureate, worked in 
the physics labs at Chalk River. His award was granted because of 
the work he did in the 1950s and 1960s.
<P>
	My message today is: Let us find a new home for these facilities 
so that they are not lost, so that Canada's science community does 
not have a brain drain and that we continue to lay the excellent 
groundwork for years to come for basic research and development 
in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to comment on the speech made by the most senior 
member of this House. The hon. member sometimes referred to the 
budget, sometimes to the speech from the throne, and sometimes to 
more or less concise interpretations regarding the budget.
<P>
	I want to remind our most senior member that everything that 
goes up must come down. While it is true that the Liberal Party 
ousted the Conservative Party from this House, it is also true that, 
in 1984, the Liberal Party was severely decimated. What is there 
about job creation in the recent budget tabled by the Minister of 
Finance? Nothing, absolutely nothing, except that the government 
will double the very minimal amount allocated for summer jobs for 
students.
<P>
	I am talking about job creation, because in 1993, in its red book, 
the Liberal government boasted about creating jobs, jobs, jobs. The 
fact is that when 20 jobs are created in one region of the country, 19 
are lost in another region. So, when the government says that 
560,000 jobs were created last year, let us not forget that there were 
massive layoffs almost equivalent in size. Consequently, the 
unemployment rate remains essentially the same, while at the 
provincial level, the numbers on the welfare rolls have increased 
drastically.
<P>
	I wonder why the Minister of Finance, who is said to have 
consulted the majority of his colleagues, did not focus on job 
creation, instead of constantly talking about the deficit. After all, 
jobs are what people want. This  government is no better than its 
predecessor; in fact, it is worse than the previous Conservative 
government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not go along with the scenario 
the hon. member just outlined. Everyone in this House who can 
add, subtract and divide knows full well that if we allow things to 
continue to escalate and get out of control, then interest rates will 
rise and there will be greater unemployment. The Minister of 
Finance is trying under very difficult circumstances to put a solid 
base on the financial structure of the country so that we will not 
have higher unemployment or high interest rates. Interest rates now 
are the lowest they have been in three decades. This alone will help 
businesses to grow. It is up to government to lay some firm 
foundations on which private enterprise can grow, bloom and hire 
people. Over the years governments have done this.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	In the early 1980s the Liberal government, and I sat here with it, 
brought in deficit budgets. However I point out to the hon. member 
that unemployment was extremely high. Canadians across the 
country were having a very difficult time. World inflation was sky 
high. People said that never again would we see one digit interest 
rates in this country. That was in the early eighties and look where 
we are now. Interest rates are the lowest they have been in three 
decades. We have a solid financial plan.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is not delivering a powerful speech and 
then running away to hide and then give in to everything like the 
Tories did. As a result, the debt continued to grow under the Tories 
because there was no will in the Prime Minister and other members 
of the cabinet to back up their own finance minister. That is why 
the Tories are not in the House today. Canadians know the 
difference.
<P>
	I remember when we sat across the way and criticized the Tory 
government on its many weaknesses. God knows, we did not have 
to look very far for those. I say to the hon. member that I too know 
how easy it is to get up and deliver a speech from that side of the 
House and try to attack the solid foundation which is being built for 
the financial structure of the country on this side of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege and honour to rise 
in this place today in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Transport and participate in the response to the budget.
<P>
	Before I begin, permit me to make a short message. I want to 
recognize the excellent work done by the first round of 
parliamentary secretaries, particularly my predecessor and friend, 
the hon. member for London East. Along with my 24 recently 
sworn in colleagues, I acknowledge the significant role played by 
our  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="810"> 810 </A></B>
<P>
predecessors in bringing about the many accomplishments of the 
government during the first half of its mandate. My fellow 
parliamentary secretaries and I look forward to upholding that high 
standard set by them.
<P>
	I also extend my congratulations to the hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria. Those of us who have had the pleasure of 
working with her appreciate her sincerity and dedication to her 
parliamentary duties. I am confident she will do a solid job in her 
new role as Deputy Chair of the committee of the Whole.
<P>
	With regard to the budget, I have listened intently to the 
members opposite. We all realize it is easier to criticize good 
government than it is to provide it. Although constructive criticism 
is a valuable tool of democracy, the key difference between those 
who provide good government and those who merely criticize is 
courage. Good government is driven by courage and concern for 
the well-being of one's nation. Unfortunately in most cases, the 
destructive criticism offered by members opposite is driven by 
political opportunism, posturing and underwhelming tactics.
<P>
	I am proud to say that on this side of the House the principles and 
practices of good government have been enhanced by the courage 
and constructive criticism within our own caucus. In recent days 
there has been a great deal of gloom and doom espoused 
throughout the country by those who seem to have overlooked our 
nation's great potential. The recent speech from the throne focused 
on ensuring opportunity for Canadians by means of a strong 
economy, providing security for all Canadians and bolstering a 
modern and united country. The budget secures our financial 
future. Our deficit reduction plan remains on track.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	It has been said that the primary role of a good government is to 
make things better for the governed. This government is offering 
hope and opportunity for all Canadians who are willing to show 
courage, resolve and faith in our great nation.
<P>
	We are providing hope and opportunity by challenging the 
private sector to create jobs for young people in our country. We 
will also double the number of federal student jobs available this 
summer. This initiative will help to reduce the unemployment rate 
among young people and provide them with valuable work 
experience and decent wages.
<P>
	Canada has a competitive advantage in the world with respect to 
aerospace and environmental technology. In fact there is some 
excellent science and technology research work being conducted at 
McMaster University in my riding of Hamilton West. In order to 
bolster our national and international strength in this area, the 
government has committed itself to the development of a Canadian 
technology network.
<P>
	Since the Canadian economy is so heavily dependent on exports, 
the government will make every attempt to continue tapping into 
emerging markets abroad in order to further enhance our share of 
the international demand for Canadian goods and services.
<P>
	With regard to security, we have to ensure that all Canadians are 
provided with an adequate social safety net. That means protecting 
vital social programs like medicare and making sure that 
Canadians in need of health care services have universal access to 
them. We must provide pension security for our seniors, as well as 
for future generations to come. A secure social safety net is too 
important to ignore. In fact Canadian core values are reflected by 
our social safety net and our willingness to preserve it.
<P>
	With regard to employment, although Hamilton has one of the 
lowest unemployment rates in the entire country, there are still 
many people in my hometown and in other cities across Canada 
who are looking for work. To address this, the government remains 
committed to implementing a new employment insurance system 
this summer in order to help Canadians find jobs and keep them.
<P>
	Canada is blessed with a highly employable workforce. Our job 
is to create a climate that is conducive to increased levels of 
personnel recruitment in the private sector and stable employment. 
With the help of the provinces and the private sector, we will 
achieve our goal of generating jobs and stimulating economic 
growth in Canada.
<P>
	In the process of strengthening our nation and making things 
better for the governed, the Government of Canada has made 
significant progress in several areas.
<P>
	In the transportation sector, with which I am most familiar, the 
government has taken steps to ensure that Canada has a safe, 
efficient, affordable, globally competitive and environmentally 
sound national transportation system.
<P>
	In aviation the government has reached an agreement in 
principle with a not for profit corporation called Nav Canada to 
commercialize Transport Canada's air navigation system. This 
move will save taxpayers $1.5 billion and will eliminate a $200 
million a year subsidy. A year after signing a historic open skies 
agreement with the U.S., Canada is reaping the benefits of 
increased air services to various Canadian and American 
destinations.
<P>
	Transport Canada is also proceeding with the transfer of select 
Canadian airport facilities, such as Hamilton Airport, to municipal 
and local area interests. The transfer of various Canadian airports 
combined with the creation of a national airport system will 
strengthen Canada's air transportation system and make it more 
responsive to regional and community based needs and economic 
objectives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="811"> 811 </A></B>
<P>
	In the rail sector, the recent commercialization of CN 
represented the largest and most successful initial public offering 
of shares in Canadian history. The government remains committed 
to implementing legislation which will make it easier for Canadian 
companies to move people and goods safely, efficiently and 
affordably across Canada by rail.
<P>
	In the marine sector, under Canada's new marine policy, ports 
will be commercialized. A national ports system will be created 
consisting of those ports that are important to domestic and 
international trade.
<P>
	These are just a few examples of the progress that is being made 
by this government in the transportation sector.
<P>
	It is worth noting that over the past 28 months we have followed 
through on almost 75 per cent of our red book commitments. At the 
same time we have managed to reduce the federal budget deficit to 
its lowest level in two decades.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	It is also worth noting that the budget contained no tax increases. 
The budget provides Canada with a framework for growth and 
security. Furthermore, deficit targets have been and will continue 
to be met. This should be comforting for all Canadians.
<P>
	The government is following through with a new tax free seniors 
benefit which will be incorporated into the OAS/GIS pension 
income credit and the age credit; tax relief for recipients of child 
support payments; a $50 million allocation to the Business 
Development Bank which will allow for the extension of up to 
$350 million in loans to small and medium size businesses; over 
the next three years $315 million for youth job opportunities which 
includes doubling youth summer employment program funds from 
$60 million to $120 million.
<P>
	One hundred and sixty five-million dollars over three years will 
be for education and skills development for young people; $270 
million for technology and innovation initiatives; 25 per cent per 
month increase in the education tax credit; $170 increase in the 
tuition education credit; $500 increase in the registered education 
savings plan; $10,500 increase in the lifetime education 
contribution limit.
<P>
	It was stated by the Canadian press news agency that the federal 
budget represents: ``Deficit reduction without tears or taxes. The 
Minister of Finance delivered a good news budget on March 6 that 
adds muscle to his deficit fighting strategy with minimal sting for 
ordinary Canadians''.
<P>
	As we approach the second half of our mandate with the support 
and constructive input of concerned citizens throughout Canada, as 
stated earlier the government will continue to make decisions 
designed to make life better for the governed.
<P>
	I am proud of our accomplishments and I am optimistic about 
the future of our great nation and the collective future of my fellow 
citizens. I consider it a great honour and privilege to serve my 
constituents and my country. I believe in good government. I 
believe the people of Canada deserve nothing less.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I always like the positive rhetoric I hear from the other 
side, especially when it comes from the member for Hamilton 
West.
<P>
	Looking at the Environics poll, if things are so positive how 
come only 14 per cent of the people think the recession is over and 
86 per cent believe we have a recession? Statistics Canada said that 
in 1995 we had a record number of bankruptcies at 78,000.
<P>
	That does not sound quite as positive to me and maybe I could be 
filled in on some of those things which I have not taken in from the 
hon. member's speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the honourable member 
could tell me the date that poll was taken and the number of people 
in the poll.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> January 11, 1996.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> The budget came out on March 6. The budget was so 
popular among Canadians that I can almost bet the honourable 
member opposite that when the next poll is taken, which I hope is 
after Canadians have had time to absorb all the fantastic news 
contained in the budget, the honourable member opposite will be 
eating humble pie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport 
about that aspect of the budget which a number of his colleagues 
have touched on, the rewriting of the Tax Act with respect to 
custodial payments or payments for child support.
<P>
	How does he rationalize the change in the Income Tax Act which 
to me, if he will listen to his logic, appears to be a tax grab because 
payment now for child support is no longer deductible?
<P>
	It is acknowledged by the finance minister that there will be 
extra revenues to the government. It makes it sound like it will 
really do something with that money in the budget. It will increase 
the child tax credit.
<P>
	If in the current system before it made this change the agreement 
between the couple was taxable, deductible, all that money was 
within the family.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	Now the government has taken this issue and said: ``Not all the 
money that will be shared between the two of you will be within 
your family. We will make it non-deductible, keep some of it 
ourselves and help a whole bunch of other people''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="812"> 812 </A></B>
<P>
	I have been trying to speak slowly to clarify my logic. Does 
that not mean that some of the money that would have been 
available for the children within that family will now be 
redistributed to other families?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his serious 
question. I believe rationalization comes in the knowledge that 
children will be better served. The spouse who looks after the 
children in most cases is the woman. The estranged husband will 
no longer be able to take advantage of the tax system; instead it will 
be the woman looking after the children. It is the children we are 
looking out for and the supporting parent will not have to declare 
that as income.
<P>
	I think that is a bold step forward by the government, a 
progressive step forward by the government, one which will again 
serve the children of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, how does 
the member reconcile his statement that the budget has brought no 
tax increase with the reality that as a direct result of the budget over 
$700 million more in tax will be paid? It sounds like double talk. 
How can the member reconcile his statement with the reality of the 
budget?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member forgets the government is 
on the positive side of the ledger, seeing the glass half full. As a 
direct result of the budget brought forward by the Minister of 
Finance the Canadian economy will take off, jobs will be created, 
people will be buying products made in Canada by those who will 
work in Canada in jobs to provide those products. That will provide 
the government with the income the member is wondering about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose 
of my remarks today is to offer some few clarifications concerning 
the 1996 federal budget tabled on March 6 by the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	We must admit that, overall, this year's budget was perceived in 
a very positive light by the people of Quebec and of Canada. Their 
general impression of it was there there will be no new direct tax 
increases for individuals this year.
<P>
	This is a budget that did not make any serious waves, and left 
everyone feeling that they had been let off the hook, but 
appearances are deceiving. The Minister of Finance pulled it off 
very well, we must admit. He pulled off a really good one this time.
<P>
	This year, the deficit will be a mere $32.7 billion, which shocked 
few people. According to most of the experts, the Minister of 
Finance has presented a good budget, because the taxpayers of 
Quebec and of Canada were expecting the worst.
<P>
	I would like to point out, too, that the Minister of Finance has 
managed to have a lesser deficit than his  predecessors, which 
seems to be a great accomplishment. It was managed in two main 
ways. First, by passing the buck. The buck was passed on to the 
provinces by reducing transfer payments for education, health and 
social programs by $7 billion over two years, which means $1.2 
billion in additional cuts for Quebec alone, or possibly more. 
Second, by dipping his hand into the surplus in the unemployment 
insurance fund, to the tune of over $5 million.
<P>
	In concrete terms, this means no tax reform, no public debate on 
social programs, no intention to review the question of tax havens 
for those who are not paying taxes.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, this budget provides absolutely no measures to 
revive the labour market. Nothing new to create jobs. Already they 
have run out of ideas; the Liberal government is already worn out.
<P>
	The government continues to hold out for a long-overdue 
economic recovery to carry it along. Why are the Liberals in 
Ottawa not delivering the promised jobs? Page 89 of the Budget 
Plan tabled in the House of Commons provides, and I quote: 
``-the average level of output in 1996 is forecast to be 1.9 per cent 
higher than in 1995-'' This means that the federal government 
expects a moderate growth of 2.5 per cent for 1996. Reality, 
however, is quite different from the budget plan the government 
drew up for itself in order to create the jobs that never materialized 
in 1995, but were the watchword of the red book of the 1993 
election. Unfortunately, in 1995, growth was no more than 0.6 per 
cent. However, in the 1995 budget, the government forecast a 
significantly higher level of growth, a level of real growth of 3.75 
per cent, which is six times less than forecast. What a minister.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that, since the Liberals came to power at 
the end of 1993, the economy has not stopped collapsing, and the 
deficit has not stopped growing exponentially, despite appearances 
of sound management of public funds and reforms that have not 
stopped expanding the gap between rich and poor. It is a very sad 
state of affairs.
<P>
	The cost of the public debt of the federal government is the 
prime component of federal spending, representing 29 per cent of 
all expenditures in 1995-96. In 1996-97, debt charges will 
represent over 30 per cent of the federal budget. I should also point 
out that 36 cents out of every dollar of tax revenue collected in 
1995-96 currently goes to paying interest on the federal debt. It is 
written in black and white on page 121 of the Budget Plan. At this 
rate, less than two years from now, debt charges will be the federal 
government's single largest item of expenditure.
<P>
	In 1993-94, the first year the Liberals were in power in Ottawa, 
the deficit was $42 billion. The second year, it was $37.5 billion. 
And the third year, $32.7 billion.  After three years of Liberal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="813"> 813 </A></B>
<P>
government, we have accumulated $112.2 billion in debt. That is a 
large sum of money. What the government is doing is playing the 
financiers' game. Lenders are getting rich at our expense.
<P>
	Just to service the debt in 1993-94, Canada has paid its creditors 
$38 billion. In 1994-95, creditors were paid $42 billion and, in 
1995-96, we paid $47 billion to service the debt. Since the last 
election, in 1993, the government in Ottawa has added $112.2 
billion to the deficit; as a result, the people of Quebec and Canada 
have paid more than $127 billion to our happy creditors. And they 
would have us believe that the deficit is being reduced. On the 
contrary.
<P>
	Debt charges will be increasing faster, even if the annual 
government deficit is getting lower. Interests are making the deficit 
increase at an alarming rate. The total federal debt for the past 
fiscal year was $578.4 billion. This means that, next year, debt 
charges should be about $47.8 billion, or an $800 million increase 
over last year, in spite of cutbacks.
<P>
	For 1997-98, according to government forecast, debt charges 
should be $49 billion, or a $1.2 billion increase in just one year.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	At this rate, the federal government's debt will climb to $603 
billion by this time next year. This is the unfortunate reality of 
Canada's public finances. Where does all this money go? Who 
benefits? Who pays the bill at the end of the day? It is taxpayers 
like you and me, more specifically the middle class. These people 
are getting sick and tired of being squeezed like lemons. Taxpayers 
are fed up with random reforms that do nothing to address the 
problem so that, at the end of the day, it is still the same people, and 
especially the middle class, who get stuck with the bill.
<P>
	This year, individual Canadians will pay a total of $60.5 billion 
in income tax. Workers and employers will contribute $18.5 billion 
to the UI fund. Taxpayers will shell out over $17.2 billion for the 
GST. In 1995-96, taxpayers in Quebec and Canada will pay a total 
in excess of $130.6 billion into the federal government's coffers.
<P>
	Does the government realize what it is asking taxpayers, and 
more specifically the poorest in our society?
<P>
	Here are some realistic suggestions to help the government 
reduce its deficit and thus restore confidence. First of all, this year, 
the Governor General of Canada will cost taxpayers over $9.8 
million and the Senate, $40.7 million. How much longer can we 
afford such luxury?
<P>
	Do we still need a budget of more than $10.5 billion for national 
defence? There is still $6.4 billion in unpaid taxes this year. What 
is the federal government doing to collect these unpaid taxes? How 
long must we wait for the federal government to close the 
numerous tax loopholes, including family trusts that shelter 
billions of dollars.
<P>
	In conclusion, why should the federal government not cut 
Canadians' tax rate? Is this an unrealistic or silly idea? Not at all. 
Reducing the tax rate would help stimulate the economy by 
increasing consumption, thus creating jobs while raising 
government revenue.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, you will 
understand that, having listened to such ridiculous remarks, 
remarks that have nothing to do with the reality and are in fact an 
insult to the intelligence of Canadians, I just had to respond.
<P>
	The subject of transfer payments was raised earlier; I will just 
touch on it because I know that we are short on time. In discussing 
this issue of federal transfers to the provinces, the people opposite 
fail to mention that the Quebec finance minister had made forecasts 
regarding transfer payments and that those announced in the budget 
speech are $600 million higher than anticipated by the Quebec 
government.
<P>
	They fail to mention that, for the very first time, a Canadian 
government has had the courage to develop a five-year plan to 
ensure stable, and not just stable, but progressively higher transfer 
payments by establishing a cash transfer threshold.
<P>
	They also fail to mention, which is unfortunate, that equalization 
payments keep growing from year to year and that the province of 
Quebec greatly benefits from these payments. The subject of 
employment was also raised, to complain about the lack of 
employment measures.
<P>
	You will understand how staggering it is for me to hear such a 
thing, given the fact that the federal government's role is to form 
partnerships and create a climate conducive to good investment. 
Deficit reduction fosters job creation. Technology Partnerships 
Canada, the program announced by my colleague from Industry 
Canada, is much appreciated by Canadian industry and small 
business. And so is the program geared toward young people; $315 
million are allocated to this program. There is also the export 
financing program involving the Export Development Corporation.
<P>
	These are measures which prove that the government is headed 
in a direction leading to the development of a sustainable economic 
safety net that will foster the creation of steady jobs.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	To conclude, regarding the employment insurance, the amounts 
that will be set aside as a result of the proposed reform will be 
invested in this employment insurance, to maintain stable 
contributions and build a reserve to sustain this stability even 
through an economic recession.  It should also be pointed out also 
that this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="814"> 814 </A></B>
<P>
government is the first government to hit its 3 per cent of GDP 
deficit reduction target. Those are the real figures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, the secretary of state tried 
to be insulting. He tried to promote his doctored budget. He did not 
pay any attention to my comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Just read the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> I did read the budget, as he suggests. 
Some facts are undeniable. Regardless of what the secretary of 
state may say, the debt has gone up $112 billion, and that must be 
pointed out. That upward trend seems endless. The federal 
government offloaded its deficit onto the provinces. It took $5 
billion from the UI fund. Do you think this is how we will solve the 
problem in a lasting way and create jobs in Canada? Absolutely 
not.
<P>
	Of course, the secretary of state will not agree with the 
suggestion I made toward the end of my comments, because he is 
satisfied with small traditional methods that do not work. However, 
if we managed to lower the rate of taxation, more money would 
circulate; people would spend and invest more. In the end, there 
would be a lot more money for the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
1970, Canada showed discipline by setting up a supply 
management system in the agricultural sector. Over the last 25 
years, dairy, poultry and egg producers had to show self-discipline 
and comply with strict rules under this supply management system.
<P>
	These producers have quotas which they must reach but not 
exceed. Everyone benefits: the producers, the processors and the 
consumers. Producers are guaranteed a stable price for their 
product, and processors benefit from a reliable, quality and stable 
supply; As for consumers, they benefit from a very high quality 
product at a fair and reasonable cost.
<P>
	But then our good Minister of Finance decided to get involved. 
In March 1995, one year ago, he announced that subsidies to 
industrial milk producers would be reduced by 30 per cent over a 
two-year period. Twelve months later, the same Minister of 
Finance, a Liberal member representing the urban riding of 
LaSalle-Émard, once again targets industrial milk producers, and 
particularly Quebec's 12,000 industrial producers, who provide 
close to 50 per cent of the country's industrial milk.
<P>
	To make things worse and even more unfair, in his 1995 budget, 
the minister not only reduced the subsidy by $560 million, thereby 
committing an injustice, but he also allocated close to $3 billion to 
western producers.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	And in order to save the full amount of the milk subsidy he is 
abolishing, in order to save $160 million, he  comes up with 
nothing to compensate the milk producers. These folks should not 
expect to be defended by Liberal members of this House.
<P>
	I recall the Liberal candidate who won the election in 
Brome-Missisquoi, who is sitting here. There he is, looking at me 
obviously. He went around his riding saying: ``I am going to 
Ottawa to defend you, to represent you'', and this was in a largely 
rural riding. What does he have to say about these unfair cuts to 
milk producers? He remains silent. He does not say a word. And 
again on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, I visited five ridings to meet 
with milk producers. They asked me: ``Where are our government 
members in Ottawa?'' Let us face it, MPs from the western 
provinces and the Maritimes will not be heard defending milk 
producers here. They hardly have any in their provinces: 50 per 
cent of milk producers are in Quebec and 30 per cent in Ontario.
<P>
	But in Ontario, of 99 MPs, only one is a member of the Reform 
Party. I ask the 98 Liberal MPs from Ontario, what have you said in 
defence of your industrial milk producers? Nothing. We have not 
heard a peep out of you.
<P>
	Last year, you managed to find $3 billion in compensation for 
western grain producers, but for milk producers in Quebec and 
Ontario, you came up empty.
<P>
	So, the only ones you will see speaking out in this House against 
this unfair situation are the members of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I remember very clearly at the time of the last referendum in 
Quebec hearing the leader of the opposition, a Liberal, say in the 
riding of Portneuf: ``You cannot vote no, you are getting a subsidy 
from the government in Ottawa for your industrial milk''. As it 
happens, I have been to see one of my friends, a producer, who told 
me about the subsidy he received for the month of January.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, would you like me to continue after question 
period?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Yes, my dear colleague. You may continue after 
question period. You have approximately four or five minutes 
remaining. I would remind you that we may not use props in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	We will now proceed to statements by members.

with joy and emotion that the inhabitants of Bellechasse, the 
Côte-du-Sud and all of Quebec learned that the persistent efforts by 
the local population to preserve and develop Grosse-Île have borne 
fruit. 
<P>
	Grosse-Île was a quarantine station for tens of thousands of Irish 
between 1832 and 1937. Next year, on the occasion of the 150th 
anniversary of the cholera and typhus epidemic, which claimed 
over 5,000 victims in 1847, the Irish cemetery on Grosse-Île will 
be restored and a monument to the medical staff erected.
<P>
	This is also an opportunity to recall the devotion and hospitality 
shown by French Canadians towards the Irish, a number of whom 
were adopted by French Canadian families. Having shared the 
same land and history as our Irish neighbours for several 
generations, we have all absorbed their values: courage, tenacity 
and determination. Long live Grosse-Île and the Irish memorial.

	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians breathed a sigh of relief once again after the tabling of 
our finance minister's budget. Our government's third budget does 
not contain any individual or corporate tax increases. According to 
the minister's forecast, the federal deficit will be $17 billion or 2 
per cent of the GDP for the 1997-98 fiscal year.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has shown that it is possible to manage 
public finances strictly without increasing the taxpayers' burden in 
order to secure a better future for all Canadians.

<P>
	On Friday the Reform finance critic tried to present a new and 
softer image. He said that the Reform taxpayers' budget would 
only cut $3 billion from transfers to provinces and $16 billion in 
total over three years and still balance the budget. The hon. 
member seems to have trouble with his addition and subtraction. 
He should watch out or one of his colleagues will cane him.
<P>
	I checked the three-year budget presented by Reform last year. It 
clearly calls for cuts of $25 billion, $15 billion of which would 
come from social programs. Other cuts to eliminate the deficit 
were not revealed to the public.
<P>
	Canadian voters are too smart to be fooled by the magic wands 
offered by the Reform Party. Its performance shows, first, that it 
cannot add numbers, let alone balance a budget; second, its 
numbers change from year to year; and, third, votes count not 
integrity.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Human Resources  Development's unem-
<P>
ployment insurance reform continues to stir up anger among 
workers nearly everywhere, particularly in regions where there is 
the most seasonal work.
<P>
	The Minister's reform, by cutting benefits back $2 billion dollars 
more each year for the next three, will keep very many people 
without jobs from collecting benefits under the plan.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Human Resources Development confirm the 
figures given in this morning's <I>Globe and Mail</I>, namely that last 
January no more than 46 per cent of Canada's jobless were 
collecting benefits, whereas the figure for 1990 was over 87 per 
cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition's 
question based on a newspaper article does not reflect in the least 
what is going on at the present time.
<P>
	We are still working with the employment insurance program in 
place. Before making a detailed report of what will happen once the 
amendments we are going to make to the act are implemented, I 
believe we have to wait for the work of the parliamentary 
committee to be over.
<P>
	Already, certain fairly considerable changes are taking shape. 
Within a few weeks, I hope the work of the committee will enable 
us to provide exact figures on the impact of all of the changes to be 
made to bill C-12.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the Minister agree with the figures advanced by the 
Canadian Labour Congress, which claims that the government's 
cuts to the unemployment insurance plan may mean only 35 per 
cent of those without jobs will collect benefits when the new plan 
comes into effect, if more than substantial changes are not made?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I indicated to the hon. Leader 
of the Opposition, the need to assess the impact of all of the 
changes to the employment insurance legislation is absolutely 
essential. That is why we have undertaken to make sure, as the 
parliamentary committee continues its work on this matter, that we 
will be able to deal with an analysis that will demonstrate clearly 
what the benefits are and where the savings will come from.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. Leader of the Opposition that in all 
cases, attempts will be made to ensure that the changes are 
equitable and fair to everyone who has to have access to the 
employment insurance system.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the eyes of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, justice means making cuts that are equal for 
everyone.
<P>
	A Canadian Press report tells us that the government has 
launched a $2 million publicity campaign aimed at counteracting 
the protests against unemployment insurance reform, in the hope of 
triggering a debate between western Canadians, many of whom 
feel that the unemployment insurance scheme is too generous, and 
eastern Canadians, for whom unemployment insurance is a 
socio-economic necessity.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the Minister's new strategy for 
winning out over the unemployed is to divide and conquer or, in 
other words, to provoke confrontations between west and east in 
order to get his reform and his cuts across?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker. Moreover, it is my belief 
that it is very important to ensure that the changes to be made to the 
employment insurance system in this country avoid any possibility 
of east-west conflict, or what is more important, conflict between 
the have and the have nots in terms of employment.
<P>
	I hope that the proposals made by the committee members of the 
same political stripe as the leader of the opposition will include 
some that will enable us to demonstrate clearly and precisely that 
the proposed changes must be equitable and just for everyone in 
every part of this country.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	This is no easy task, no doubt about it, but we hope that, with 
everyone's co-operation, we will manage to find appropriate 
solutions.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development said on Friday that 
there was one thing he was absolutely committed to and that was 
the fiscal parameters of the reform agreement. He had better not 
count on us for help, because that makes no sense, the plan already 
has a surplus. Worse yet, the deputy minister of human resources 
development said, on January 25, that high income earners would 
not have to further fund employment insurance because they were 
not frequent users and it was the job of frequent users, that is the 
low income earners, to do so.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that, with his successive reforms, not 
only are fewer people entitled to benefits, but it is the low and 
middle income earners who feel the effects of them? Will he at 
least dissociate himself from the remarks of the deputy minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the reform as  proposed, 
without amendment, shows very clearly our intention to reduce 
benefits available to the higher income earners. Obviously, we had 
to re-align the entire system. This is how we managed to ensure 
that low income workers have an opportunity to increase their 
family income by $2,500.
<P>
	We found ways to ensure that hundreds of thousands of people 
could have access to the program for the first time, because we are 
changing the system so it will be based on hours of work and not 
weeks.
<P>
	I think time will show, at the end of the exercise, that the 
employment insurance program is much more accessible to people 
who, in the past, had no access to it. Obviously, this will cost those 
with higher incomes a little. This is why we see people in certain 
parts of the country where, generally, people earn very little indeed, 
people who work in seasonal industries, we see union leaders out 
and about in these areas, because they know that the real reform is 
being done absolutely fairly to ensure that those with lower 
incomes are protected and those with higher incomes pay the price.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister should read and understand his own legislation. By 
reducing maximum insurable earnings from $42,400 to $39,000, he 
deprived the fund of $900 million a year. And he went to get this 
money from the low income workers.
<P>
	Is the minister aware that he is proving the government's lack of 
belief in the broad principles underlying the implementation of 
social programs: redistribution of wealth, equity and social justice?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I know my colleague is a strong 
believer in the need to try to be fair. I really do not understand why 
she is saying we are not meeting the need to redistribute our limited 
resources.
<P>
	My hon. colleague is wondering whether, by reducing the 
amounts available from $42,000 to $39,000, we were not doing 
something disastrous. However, she made no comment on the fact 
that, in reaching this decision, we wanted at all cost to protect those 
earning very little, either individually or for the family.

<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

that chief of defence staff General Boyle had consulted with his 
predecessor about the allegations by the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg to the establishment of a joint Quebec army or 
alternatively two separate armies. There were no such studies 
conducted by the Canadian Armed Forces or by the Department of 
National Defence. The chief of defence staff also consulted with 
other senior generals and is continuing those discussions with other 
senior officers.
<P>
	We are assured that all of the officers of Her Majesty's armed 
forces are loyal Canadians and execute their duties faithfully.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Bloc's defence critic has confessed, and I quote: 
``There were officers who were already prepared to create the 
nucleus of a Quebec defence staff. There are people who have 
confided this to me already. Absolutely, even officers''.
<P>
	On Friday, the minister told the House he expects the Bloc 
member to come forward and give us proof. Canadians were 
surprised to learn that the minister expects the Bloc member to 
voluntarily come forward with the names of these officers.
<P>
	Canadians want to know why the Minister of National Defence 
does not exercise the due process available to him and compel the 
member to tell Canada what he knows and to name names.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would not 
want to insult the House of Commons.
<P>
	There is a motion now being debated which could send this 
entire matter to a parliamentary committee. Certainly, the 
allegations made by the hon. member on Thursday are linked with 
the letter that he sent before the referendum.
<P>
	I want to respect Parliament and let Parliament decide whether 
or not the matter should go to committee. If the matter goes to 
committee, the burden of proof is on the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg to name names, give minutes and tell us the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am sure the Canadian public is demanding that the 
government do its job and govern this country, which it is not 
doing.
<P>
	We know two things. One, the Bloc Quebecois member said that 
officers were prepared to create a Quebec defence staff. Two, the 
Bloc Quebecois member said these officers confided this to the 
hon. member for Charlesbourg.
<P>
	Canadians want to know why the Minister of National Defence 
refuses to do anything about these admissions.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, allegations have 
been made by the hon. member for Charlesbourg and now he is not 
so sure that what he alleged on Thursday is actually true.
<P>
	Any member of the House can make any statement. That does 
not mean to say the armed forces or any department has to launch 
an investigation. In this case the hon. member can rest assured that 
Parliament will deal with the matter through committee. All of the 
questions he has asked today should rightly be asked at the 
committee, not of the government but of the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg.

Development.
<P>
	His planned unemployment insurance reform will bring the 
maximum yearly pensionable earnings down from $42,389 to 
$39,000 in five years.
<P>
	Since employers will no longer contribute to unemployment 
insurance once this new ceiling is reached, does the minister realize 
that this measure will encourage businesses to ask their workers to 
do more overtime?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, obviously, it is very difficult to 
forecast how businesses will behave but we believe that generally 
the changes to unemployment insurance will result in providing 
coverage and access to the program right from the first hour 
worked. This will be very beneficial for many workers across the 
country.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague knows, there is in the bill a system to 
monitor the impact of all the changes. If results do not meet the 
program objectives, we will have to take corrective action, of 
course.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources

has been, and everyone who is familiar with what is going on is 
aware, that week in week out, month in month out, young people 
and women in every part of Canada have had to go to work for 13 
and 14 hours. Not only did they not qualify for unemployment 
insurance but also they did not get access to any of the programs 
that were designed to support people in the workplace.
<P>
	What we have done is to respond to a request from people who 
understand how the system was exploited. We have gone to an 
hours based system. We believe that women and young people will 
benefit from the system.
<P>
	As I indicated to my learned friend, we have foreseen that there 
will be changes and there will be impacts arising out of this new 
legislation that may not be helpful. That is why we are going to 
have a monitoring process in place, to ensure that the changes are 
fair and equitable and that employers and employees both respect 
the objectives of the new legislation which is to provide first hourly 
coverage for young people and women, people who in the past 
oddly enough were not working overtime, they could not get 15

question is for the solicitor general.
<P>
	Correctional Service of Canada has assisted Clifford Olson in 
producing a series of videotapes about his sadistic crimes. Now we 
are informed that Clifford Olson has received a copyright for these 
tapes. Given the fact that five of these tapes are in the hands of 
Robert Shantz, Olson's lawyer, there is the potential they may fall 
into the hands of the media, or even worse, into the hands of the 
commercial distributors.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us why copies of the tapes were given to 
Mr. Shantz and what the solicitor general will do to retrieve them?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the tapes in question were 
in the hands of Mr. Olson's lawyer as a result of an agreement 
entered into by the former warden of the penitentiary in 
Saskatchewan in June 1993. The agreement allowed for the taping 
to occur, as was done. Unfortunately this took place in 1993.
<P>
	Both the solicitor general and the commissioner of corrections 
deplore the situation. We are looking into the matter in great detail. 
We will assure all Canadians that no criminal will be able to profit

like Olson receive either educational grants from Correctional 
Service of Canada or student loan funding or both so that they may 
take university education. Will the solicitor general deny that this 
killer, Clifford Olson, is receiving a student loan to further his 
university education?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor

	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. On page 94 of the red book, 
we can read, and I quote: ``The integrity of government is put into 
question when there is a perception that the public agenda is set by 
lobbyists exercising undue influence away from public view''.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	What are we to think about the credibility of the taxation 
committee, six of whose eight members contributed more than 
$80,000 to the Liberal Party in 1994?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
do not know if they made contributions as individuals, in 
partnership or if they are companies.
<P>
	I am convinced that they likely made donations to other political 
parties at the same time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
government gives contracts to defeated candidates and provides 
government committee seats to those who contribute to the election 
fund. The Liberals have come full circle.
<P>
	To ensure the transparency of the decision making process, does 
the minister commit to at least expand the committee to include 
parliamentarians, so that the taxation review will be public and that

the  recommendations and decisions will be made in the public 
interest?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
any discussion concerning the taxation review will certainly be 
public, because the objective of that committee is really to prepare 
a background document that will be used for consultation, 
undoubtedly by parliamentarians, including members of the

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, UI premiums are creating a $10 billion surplus. This 
money belongs to the UI system and therefore to Canadian workers 
and employers. When will the government reduce the regressive, 
job killing UI premiums on Canadian workers and employers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at 
the last revision, and of course a revision occurs every fall, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development announced a reduction 
in premiums. There was a savings passed on of $1.2 billion. The 
answer to the hon. member's question is: We have already done it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in spite of the announced reductions and the reductions 
which will be coming in the next few months, the budget document 
indicates that the surpluses for the next two years of $10 billion 
have taken into account those reductions. However, the 
government now plans a $2 million campaign to advertise changes 
to the UI system.
<P>
	Canadians need jobs, not UI advertisements. Will the minister 
stop this costly advertising campaign and simply reduce premiums 
to create jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand the hon. 
gentleman's concern about the UI surplus and I understand his 
concern about jobs.
<P>
	I wish it were as simple as cancelling a program to provide over 
a million Canadians who receive UI benefits with the information 
which they will require as a result of the changes we are bringing to 
the act. If it were that simple, I want to assure the hon. gentleman 
that we would be happy to cancel the campaign, if we knew it 
would work as a result of creating all of those new jobs.
<P>
	However, in the real world, all of these men and women across 
the country have been confronted for the past three or four months 
with an act that we know will be changed. A lot of amendments 
will undoubtedly be brought to it in the next few weeks. Therefore 
it is only fair to assume when we have in excess of a million people 
who are involved in the employment insurance program  that we 
have to spend some money to ensure they understand what the new 
rules will be.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to the government's own figures, the new 
formula to determine the Canada social transfer is such that 
between 1996 and 2003, the only provinces which will see an 
increase in federal funding for their social programs are Ontario, 
British Columbia and Alberta, that is the three richest provinces of 
Canada.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance explain that a transfer which is 
meant to help the neediest in our society will increase only for the 
richest regions of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it 
is precisely for the same reasons that the seven other provinces will 
receive more in equalization payments than the three provinces 
mentioned.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	In other words, you have to consider the transfers as a whole. If 
you do that, you will see that Quebec will be doing very well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, clearly we do not have the same figures, although I took 
them out of the minister's own budget. The figures I have say that 
the three richest provinces of Canada will, up to 2003, see their 
share of the Canada social transfer increase while the poor 
provinces will see theirs decrease.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Look at the budget. This is serious. If the Minister 
of Finance does not even know his own figures there is a problem 
somewhere.
<P>
	What kind of logic brings us to this result, which shows an 
increase in federal contributions to the richest provinces while the 
poorest regions of Canada will see a decrease in federal 
contributions? Could he explain to me the logic of this system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, as to the formula, at the end of the fifth year, transfers to 
the provinces will have increased from $25.1 billion to $27.4 
billion-that is the total transfer to the provinces. Second, the 
transfers under equalization will increase for the provinces.
<P>
	I am sure that the hon. member is not interested only in the 
Quebec situation, but Quebec will receive 31 per cent of transfers 
for 25 per cent of the population.

<P>
	There are a number of things my department is doing with regard 
to this issue. March 21 is the day United Nations has set for the 
elimination of racism in the world. For weeks prior and for weeks 
following there will be a series of events set up to bring to the 
attention of Canadians, especially young people, the issue of 
racism in this country.
<P>
	We do not concentrate on racism only during that period. All 
year round the department of multiculturalism looks carefully at 
how we set up projects and programs in order to assist social 
cohesion. We work with the Minister of Justice, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development and with the solicitor general to

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
finance minister has once again picked Canadians' pockets with 
another tax grab on RRSPs.
<P>
	By eliminating the deductibility of the administration fee on 
self-directed RRSPs and lowering the maximum age for 
contribution by two years, the government engages in sneaky tax 
grabs while preaching fiscal restraint.
<P>
	How can the finance minister justify this delayed action tax grab 
while preaching no new taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the reason for taking the decision on deductibility was that what we 
were dealing with were charges that were utilized primarily, in fact 
overwhelmingly, by higher income Canadians. Also, these were 
fees were not available to lower income Canadians simply because 
of a lack of disposable income.
<P>
	If I understand what the hon. member is recommending, there 
should be tax breaks available in practice for the well of that would 
not be available to the less well off. That is the reason they exist 
and that is the reason we will fight that kind of idea.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
message to the government is that it has a spending problem, not a 
revenue problem. That is the message we want to get through.
<P>
	It is quite clear that this dismantling of the RRSP program is 
under way by the Liberal government. First, it reduces the 
maximum contribution limit. Second, it froze those limits. Third, it 
eliminated the deductions. Fourth, it has attacked seniors who will 
be living long enough to enjoy their hard earned savings.
<P>
	Why is the finance minister so determined to dismantle the 
RRSP program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me simply give one example of a change we brought to the RRSP 
program. Prior to the last budget there was a restriction that people 
could go back only seven years in order to make maximum use of 
it.
<P>
	We eliminated the seven years because we recognized that there 
are a lot of young families which are not able to take advantage of it 
because they were raising their children and which would be able to 
use that space later on when their children had left the nest. What 
we have done is open it up so that all Canadians can use the RRSP.
<P>
	Once again the question is why does the Reform Party think the 
only purpose of the country and government is for the rich? We 
think it is for all Canadians.

<P>
and people in the community. A package was put together. We 
thought it  was appropriate and so we went along with what the 
opposition suggested.
<P>
	The problem is now we have to develop a housing authority 
within the community to make sure housing is properly allocated 
and that there is proper policing. It is difficult, especially in Oka 
now with two chiefs, but we are working toward that end. I met this 
morning with the negotiator to see if we could have some positive 
movement in there.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I say to 
this minister, who has been touring Quebec for a while trying to stir 
up trouble between the First Nations and Quebecers, that he will 
not succeed. He should deal seriously with the issues that concern 
him. He just seems unable to find a solution.
<P>
	My question concerns his incapacity to solve the problem of 
illegal occupation of houses, because that is the basic problem in 
Kanesatake. It has a number of consequences, including a major 
loss of revenue for Hydro-Quebec.

more enlightened than others of his party.
<P>
	What we are doing is fulfilling the recommendations and the 
advice given by the Reform Party in the finance  committee of the 
House when it dealt with the GST. It simply said we should replace 
it with a harmonized tax. It went on to say that will obviously 
require future negotiations with the provinces. The Reform Party 
was right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
confirms the finance minister is the master of myths.
<P>
	Our report, if he read the first part, recommends tax reform and a 
simplified system of taxation to replace the GST. It was in the final 
form, out of context, that he was taking our recommendation, but 
that is fine; he is the master of myths.
<P>
	Will he confirm for the House that the real problem he is having 
with the new Liberal supertax, which he is trying to get co-opted 
with the provinces, is that the combined rate, for instance, in 
Ontario of the 8 per cent and 7 per cent to 15 per cent would 
actually represent a $2 billion to $3 billion increase to the 
consumers of Ontario? That is why he is having trouble.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has ``mythd'' the point. There is no possibility of 
a supertax. What we are seeking is a harmonized tax.

another, any province would have the ability to right that and to 
shift it back. There is all kinds of flexibility built in there.

State for Agriculture said, the dairy subsidy was not eliminated 
with the industry's consent. The Fédération des producteurs de lait 
du Québec condemned this measure, which will lead to losses of up 
to $8,000 for the average farm.

measure hurting dairy producers, nearly 50 per cent of whom live 
in Quebec?

<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the time of the federal budget in 
1995 we indicated certain staged reductions in the dairy subsidy 
that would take place during the current fiscal year and the next 
fiscal year.
<P>
	We also indicated that we would consult with the dairy industry 
across Canada, particularly in provinces like Quebec and Ontario 
where the dairy industry is concentrated, to discuss the future of the 
dairy subsidy beyond the initial two years that were dealt with in 
the budget last year.
<P>
	Those consultations took place very extensively. They involved 
me, my parliamentary secretary, my departmental officials, the 
Canadian Dairy Commission and a broad cross-section of 
representatives in the Canadian dairy sector.
<P>
	We raised very clearly the fiscal difficulty the government was 
facing. We indicated the dairy subsidy would not be sustainable for 
the long term. We sought their advice in terms of how best to 
handle the dairy subsidy in those circumstances. A wide variety of 
options was discussed in terms of how this situation could be 
managed. The dairy industry very clearly indicated that while it 
would prefer to retain its subsidy, faced with the fiscal reality of the 
country to deal with this issue it  would recommend the phase out 
approach that we have implemented.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the 
minister aware that eliminating this subsidy without any kind of 
compensation compounds the unfairness in federal spending in 
Quebec, where his department will spend a mere 8 per cent of its 
budget this year?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously one of the issues that 
remains to be dealt with, an issue the dairy industry in terms of 
producers and processors is very anxious to deal with, is the 
question of future pricing.
<P>
	Under the Canadian system of supply management producers 
will have the opportunity to deal with the price setting regime in 
the future in consultation with processors and the Canadian Dairy 
Commission. It is obvious that as the producers no longer have 
access to what they call the direct payment they will want to recoup 
a good portion of that, as much as they possibly can, from the 
pricing system.
<P>
	Over the last 10 years or so the general inflation rate with respect 
to food products in Canada has been in the order of 30 per cent. By 
contrast, the inflation rate with respect to dairy products in Canada 
has been only in the neighbourhood of 16 per cent, which indicates 
there is some room for price adjustment.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FINANCIALSTATEMENTOFTHEMINISTEROFFINANCE">FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE</A></H4>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approve in general the budgetary policy of the government, and the 
amendment, and the sub-amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to pick 
up where I left off, I was in the midst of condemning the unfairness 
of the finance minister's last budget. I was saying that nearly 50 per 
cent of Canada's industrial milk comes from Quebec, and that the 
farmers in my region produce 10 per cent of Quebec's industrial 
milk.
<P>
	I was also saying that the Minister of Finance will cut Quebec 
dairy producers' income by five to seven per cent. I was 
demonstrating how unfair it is by using the rule of three-and I 
urge dairy producers to listen closely to my reasoning. Last year, 
the Minister of Finance paid close to $3 billion to grain producers 
in western Canada in compensation for eliminating grain transport 
subsidies. The Liberal government gave $1.6 billion out of this $3 
billion to individual grain producers, depending on the size of their 
farms. Again, this $1.6 billion was not taxable and, by giving $1.6 
billion to grain producers, the government will save $560 million 
in the future. As a result of eliminating dairy subsidies, the 
government will save $160 million in Quebec. If, in order to save 
$560 million, the government spent $1.6 billion, how much should 
it pay dairy producers in compensation for the $160 million in 
cuts? Using the rule of three, I arrive at some $400 million.
<P>
	The Liberal government is imposing a $400 million penalty on 
dairy producers, if we want to be as fair to them as to grain 
producers in the west.
<P>
	The agriculture minister stated earlier that he had consulted with 
dairy producers. With all due respect, what he said is wrong. Last 
weekend, I toured five ridings and met with dozens of dairy 
producers. I have here a statement showing that, for all of January, 
the Canadian Dairy Commission paid a dairy producer in my riding 
$506 in subsidies.
<P>
	Would dairy producers accept losses of $7,000 or $8,000 a year? 
No way. What the minister should tell us is that he indeed 
consulted, but with milk processors, not dairy producers.
<P>
	Dairy producers managed to adjust to competition by reducing 
costs.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Today, they are being rewarded with cuts of five to seven per 
cent, which represent average losses of $8,000 per dairy farm in 
Quebec. The government is being unfair.
<P>
	This government told us that it had not raised taxes. That is true. 
It will, however, raise the cost of the food basket, including dairy 
products like butter and cheese. The cuts imposed by this 
government will translate into a price increase of 28 cents a pound 
for butter and 50 cents a kilo for cheddar cheese.
<P>
	I therefore condemn the 1996 budget as unfair to dairy producers 
across Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I paid great attention to the remarks of the member for 
Frontenac. I must say I am sometimes mystified by the position the 
Bloc Quebecois takes from time to time.
<P>
	In the course of his remarks the member was commenting on 
how the Quebec milk producers produce 50 per cent of the 
industrial milk for the rest of Canada. In the same breath he was 
extolling the virtues of the milk marketing board which is a 
Canadian institution. This is a contradiction in the position by the 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	The milk marketing boards, the supply management system, are 
very much a federal institution. If Quebec were to separate it would 
spell the end of the supply management system. Would the hon. 
member not admit that this would cause great hardship to the milk 
producers and would lead to the loss of many hundreds of family 
farms?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is nothing 
surprising about what my distinguished colleague told this House. 
Just this weekend, milk producers were asking me: ``Why are Bloc 
members the only MPs rising in the House of Commons to 
represent our interests?'' I can understand their feelings.
<P>
	I had our research staff dig out the following information. New 
Brunswick-represented by only one opposition member, a 
Conservative-accounts for 1.25 per cent of all industrial milk 
production. There is not much point in making tremendous efforts. 
Nova Scotia, 1.32 per cent, all Liberals. I have not seen one Liberal 
member rise in this House to oppose the government. Prince 
Edward Island, 1.91 per cent. All Liberals anyway. They are 
playing dead. Saskatchewan, 2.49 per cent; Manitoba, 3.76 per 
cent; British Columbia, 4.31 per cent; and Alberta, 6.52 per cent.
<P>
	The members representing these provinces cannot be relied on, 
especially Liberals. There is, of course, the leader of the Conserva-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="829"> 829 </A></B>
<P>
tive Party who represents a riding  in Quebec. I shall direct the 
following question to him: ``Hon. member for Sherbrooke, why do 
you not rise in this House to defend the interests of your 
constituents?'' He remains as mute as a maggot.
<P>
	As for the hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi, who boasted 
about coming to Ottawa to defend his farmers, these producers, 
whom I met, asked me: ``What is our MP doing for us in Ottawa?'' 
My answer was: ``He remains as mute as a maggot. He does not say 
a word in your defence''. That is true. Take a look in <I>Hansard</I> and 
show me when he rose in this House to defend his farmers. Never.
<P>
	Ontario produces 30 per cent of all industrial milk in the country, 
while Quebec produces 47.57 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	I did not see a single Ontarian rise in this House, not one, but that 
is understandable: 98 out of 99 are Liberals. They are buying their 
finance minister's budget. They will applaud it even if it is no 
good. That is why only Bloc members are rising in this House to 
represent the interests of Quebec milk producers.
<P>
	What our producers will be forced to do is to go before the 
Canadian Dairy Commission to request a price increase. If they do 
not, some of them are facing bankruptcy, while others will literally 
be working for peanuts.
<P>
	Did you know that each 10 per cent increase in the price of butter 
entails a 7 per cent drop in sales? All this because a number of 
consumers will no longer be able to afford to buy butter at the price 
it will have to sell for.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first I want to congratulate my 
colleague, the Minister of Finance, on his excellent budget. The 
minister has once again reached his goal of reducing the deficit. 
This is the second time he manages to do that, thus succeeding 
where his predecessors of the last decade failed.
<P>
	By targeting expenditures with determination, consistency and 
intelligence, the minister largely contributed to establishing a 
visible and sound financial environment. Indeed, a sound national 
balance sheet is an essential prerequisite to grow, prosper and 
improve our standard of living at the turn of the century. Such a 
balance sheet is the only durable basis that will allow us to 
maintain the best social security system in the world for future 
generations. Our goal is to achieve nothing less than that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The United Nations, the OECD, as well as men and women 
around the world who seek to move to Canada all tell us that we 
have the best country in the world but here at home, Canadians 
need a reality check. We must challenge Canadians who do not 
agree that we are the best to tell us where countries do it better, 
more  effectively and with better results, not where governments 
spend more money, but where they get more for their money.
<P>
	We need to determine what nation allows low and average 
income seniors to retire with better security. What country has a 
better and more accessible post-secondary education system? What 
country has a better, more inclusive employment insurance system 
that balances the need for reasonable income benefits with active 
re-employment measures, including a basic income for low income 
families?
<P>
	We must challenge Canadians who no longer have faith in our 
system to tell us in what country single mothers have better access 
to re-employment programs or child care assistance. What country 
has a more accessible and effective public health care system? 
Where in the world can disadvantaged citizens be assured of a 
stronger safety net to support their needs for food, shelter and basic 
services?
<P>
	Canadians are going to have to learn to benchmark what we have 
achieved against the programs and practices of other G-7 and 
OECD countries, not against some phantom abstract notion of what 
we think we should have accomplished or deserve to have in the 
future.
<P>
	The message that is fundamental in this budget is that the Liberal 
government is committed to modernizing and securing the 
Canadian social safety net and we make real strides toward meeting 
that goal. I do not hesitate to say that this is the first Liberal budget 
we have seen in this country in 12 years. We have reason to be very 
proud of it. The Minister of Finance had to struggle through his 
first few years cleaning up the mess that was left behind. Our 
objective is unmistakable: a Canadian social safety net that is 
affordable, effective and contemporary.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This budget is a major step toward a sustainable and reliable 
government pension plan for seniors in the next century. The new 
seniors benefit, which will take effect in the year 2001, is a 
practical and progressive solution to the costs related to our aging 
Canadian society. These costs must be contained, while also 
ensuring that most retired people will be as comfortable, if not 
more, than is currently the case under the old age security and 
guaranteed income supplement programs.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Most retired people in the year 2001 will enjoy greater 
protection. A full 75 per cent of seniors will be treated as well, if 
not better, in the year 2001 than now. Given the demographic 
projections for the next 25 years, this is quite an achievement.
<P>
	The second component of the reform is to design the Canada 
pension plan so as to make sure that all Canadians can rely on it 
when they retire. Negotiations  are currently under way between 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="830"> 830 </A></B>
<P>
the federal and provincial governments to find a sound long term 
financial base for the CPP.
<P>
	We must find the best and most sustainable balance between the 
necessary increases to the contribution rates and the amendments 
to the benefit structure, so as to ensure the plan's middle and long 
term viability.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The budget demonstrates the priority we place on helping young 
people find their place in an increasingly competitive and tough 
global job market. We are investing in jobs for youth. The budget 
provides $105 million extra per year for three years to assist our 
efforts to help our young people get jobs. As part of this new 
funding the Government of Canada will double to $120 million the 
support for private, public and not for profit partners to create 
summer jobs this year alone.
<P>
	We are helping to make work pay by doubling the working 
income supplement by 1998 to $1,000 a year per family. This 
special supplement is targeted directly at our nation's low income 
working families and will give our children a better future.
<P>
	The right of children of divorced parents to adequate financial 
support will be respected. Major tax changes linked to new 
standardized guidelines nationwide for child support will be 
brought into effect and will be backed by tougher enforcement.
<P>
	At the same time, we are helping working parents, particularly 
single parents, by broadening the child care expense deduction. 
These are parents who cannot be at home and need child care 
because they are on the job or taking courses to help them get a job. 
Eligible parents with teenagers between the ages of 14 and 16 will 
now be able to receive the deduction.
<P>
	We are adding an extra $80 million a year to fund student tuition 
fees and education tax credits. The limits have been raised on 
registered education savings plans.
<P>
	We are especially proud that this budget provides for a 
permanent floor for cash contributions to the provinces for health, 
post-secondary education and social services.
<P>
	When the growing value of tax point transfers are included, 
worth some $14 billion this year, it means that overall the size of 
the CHST will stabilize next year and the two years following at 
$25 billion. By the turn of the century, the full value of these 
important transfers will begin to rise in a way that directly tracks 
economic growth. By putting these important transfers on a solid 
footing and establishing a growth path, we are demonstrating our 
unshakeable commitment to the Canadian social union.
<P>
	We are ready to fulfil our responsibilities as a strong partner with 
the provinces which deliver the social programs and services to our 
citizens. This is the unique genius of the Canadian federation; this 
country was built by the national and provincial governments 
working co-operatively, recognizing and respecting the strains and 
tensions inherent to all federal systems. The implementation of the 
CHST marks a new era in the fiscal arrangements that support the 
Canadian social union.
<P>
	The 13.5 tax points ceded to the provinces in 1977 to help pay 
for health and post-secondary education are now worth some $14 
billion. They are every bit as important as is the cash component 
we hear so much about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Indeed, in the speech from the throne as well as in last year's 
budget, our government committed itself to co-operate with the 
provinces to define by mutual consent the principles and rules of 
the Canadian health and social transfer.
<P>
	Now that the long term funding rules have been decided upon, 
including the transfer distribution formula, we are going to have 
discussions on the principles. We have retained the five principles 
of the Canada Health Act with the proviso that provinces cannot 
discriminate according to the place of residence in the delivery of 
social services. Moreover, we are ready to discuss with our 
partners.
<P>
	We are all increasingly aware of the unacceptable human deficit 
our society is confronted with.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	This deficit can have all sorts of fiscal and other consequences 
for future generations of Canadians. But we do not have the means 
required to assess this human deficit, and we must understand the 
problem well in order to solve it.
<P>
	We do not have a good system of social indicators similar to the 
economic indicators we all know-inflation, unemployment, 
growth, monetary aggregates, etc.-on which the government 
bases many of its decisions. This is a need that all governments 
should try and meet together. A lot of crucial work awaits us in this 
sector.
<P>
	The budget clearly revives our plan to put our social safety net 
on a sound basis.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The employment insurance bill is before the House and it is 
hoped it will be implemented on the target date of July 1, 1996. 
This important pro-employment initiative is now being examined 
in committee where members will have an opportunity to make 
some adjustments that will improve the overall balance and 
fairness of the package.
<P>
	Without prejudging the specific amendments that will be 
brought forward, I have already made it clear that we must have 
changes that will do the following. Resolve the problem of gaps in 
employment that unfairly affect benefits for workers in some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="831"> 831 </A></B>
<P>
industries across the country where work patterns are irregular. The 
system must be connected much more closely to changes in local 
employment conditions. As jobs become available everyone should 
be obliged to take whatever work is available and must be well 
motivated to do so. The social safety net should be reinforced by 
ensuring an appropriate income floor for low income workers, 
particularly in our large cities where there are significant numbers 
of working poor who must have access to employment insurance.
<P>
	A fundamental feature of employment insurance is the 
reinvestment in direct, results oriented re-employment measures 
for unemployed Canadians. We understand the enormous and 
turbulent impact of technological change on workplaces 
everywhere. Our intention is not to interfere with the provinces but 
to work in partnership with them.
<P>
	As announced in the throne speech, the government is totally 
committed to accelerating discussions with the provinces to get 
agreement on how to best harmonize labour market activity. 
Already the draft report of the provincial Ministerial Council on 
Social Reform, the Quebec government statement of principles on 
a possible labour market agreement and part II of the EI legislation 
together provide for the orderly withdrawal of federal activity and 
training, and to explore new approaches and the appropriate roles 
and responsibilities of each level of government for strengthening 
national and local labour markets.
<P>
	We plan to work closely with the provinces in the coming 
months to find a mutually acceptable way of strengthening access 
to child care services, thereby helping to reduce for many low 
income families and single mothers a serious barrier to jobs and 
economic independence.
<P>
	However, I want to emphasize that as the throne speech stated, 
the Government of Canada will not use its spending power to create 
new shared cost programs in areas of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction without the consent of a majority of the provinces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To conclude, I repeat that the Government of Canada is 
determined to see to it that at the beginning of the next century this 
country offers its people the best social programs and the best tax 
and fiscal conditions in the world. The last budget tabled by my 
colleague the Minister of Finance will be a great help to that end, 
by giving us better control over our deficit while hastening the 
reform and the strengthening of the Canadian safety net.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I take note of the many 
members who wish to participate in the question or comment 
period. I will endeavour to facilitate the  participation of as many as 
possible. I can only do that with the co-operation of both the 
members asking questions and the minister responding. Perhaps 
members could keep individually to two-minute interventions.
<P>
	I will begin with the hon. member for Frontenac, then the hon. 
member for Calgary Centre. We will see how things go from there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you 
acted somewhat like King Solomon, which is very much 
appreciated.
<P>
	I listened with much interest to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, who, of course, was not about to criticize 
the budget of his colleague, the Minister of Finance. It was to be 
expected. However, I could criticize the member from Acadia, a 
riding that is not, relatively speaking, the richest of the 
country-no insult intended for its citizens-because his 
government is reducing the deficit largely at the expense of the 
little people.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	It is for a good reason then that, in his own riding, the 
government's budget as well as its UI reform are being criticized. 
Are there any measures on tax shelters in the budget? No. Does the 
budget contain measures to tax big corporations, and I take the 
liberty of quoting the president of Bombardier, who does not 
remember the last year he paid one cent of tax to the federal 
government? What is there in the budget on major 
corporations-and the Minister of Finance himself is right in 
there-who register their boats in the Bahamas? There is 
absolutely nothing against that.
<P>
	What is there in the budget for job creation, which was the Prime 
Minister's slogan-``Jobs, jobs, jobs''. Nothing, except for the 
meagre $60 million more or the $60 million already earmarked for 
summer career jobs for students. There is nothing for job creation. 
This budget does not get a passing grade.
<P>
	I invite the minister to take a few minutes to try to explain to his 
constituents, among others, how this budget is fair and equitable, 
particularly for ordinary people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, if you allow me, I would like to say 
that when describing the people from my riding I never make a 
distinction between big or small, rich or poor. I have a great respect 
for all of my constituents and I am perfectly aware that there are 
serious concerns every time we have to discuss social programs. 
What I regret is when those concerns are exploited and that is 
something I have no intention of doing today.
<P>
	My hon. colleague made a few comments on big companies, 
including one I would have thought the hon. member would be 
particularly proud of because of its international reputation in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="832"> 832 </A></B>
<P>
aerospace area. But I will  leave that to others because I would like 
to speak to a particular point.
<P>
	The hon. member for Frontenac asked me what there was in the 
budget on job creation. He forgot to mention the $800 million in 
the reinvestment fund included in the employment insurance 
program we are proposing, $800 million when fully implemented. 
There is another $300 million transitory fund specifically aimed at 
helping regions where the unemployment situation is the worst. Of 
course, for my hon. colleague, that $1.1 billion was not important. 
Apparently, he did not even notice it when reading the budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very 
seldom that I get a chance to make a comment and ask a question of 
a cabinet minister during debate so I appreciate this. This is one of 
my first opportunities and I have been here for over two years.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Human Resources Development confirm 
the current size of the UI fund? I know during the campaign there 
was a deficiency of about $3 billion. I know there is a surplus and I 
would like to see the amount confirmed. I anticipate it is going to 
grow. At what point would he consider offering tax relief to this 
sector by lowering premiums?
<P>
	I come from the private sector and I know what employers and 
employees think of payroll taxes. It is a subject of concern to many 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	My final question for the minister is this. Has there been talk or 
consideration given of reconciling the UI fund in the future? Has 
consideration been given to making it into an insurance program 
between employer and employee that stands alone, regulated and 
monitored by the federal government to ensure that people get their 
proper benefits as opposed to co-mingling the fund into the general 
account and using it to apply on current revenues?
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, as usual the member for Calgary asks 
excellent questions and I want to address each of them.
<P>
	First, we have to be very careful with respect to the principle of 
insurance as it applies to employment insurance. I have spoken to 
people who are involved in the insurance business. For example, I 
do not know of anyone who has bought death insurance. Agents 
usually try to sell it as life insurance. They do not sell sickness 
insurance. They sell it as health insurance. All of my adult life I 
have had term insurance. I hope the hon. member for Calgary will 
understand why I am glad no one has collected on it yet.
<P>
	We have to be extremely careful because insurance can have 
different functions. There has to be a sharing. People who have full 
time jobs and long attachments to a  job are probably extremely 
pleased that they have never had to go to the employment insurance 
system for support.
<P>
	We have to be extremely cautious when we make the changes to 
retain equity and fairness. People told me on the weekend that they 
were prepared to change places with people who felt there was too 
much unemployment insurance money going into certain parts of 
the country. They would exchange the unemployment insurance 
cheques for the full time jobs that existed in certain parts of the 
country, for example, in the automobile industry in Ontario. I say 
that knowing my friend is from the great province of Alberta. There 
is always a need to try to keep some balance.
<P>
	I agree we have to look at the surplus. The hon. member asked 
what the amount is now. We have just come out of a deficit 
position. We have been running a surplus on current account but 
there was an existing deficit in the UI fund. In the last few months, 
probably since December, we have moved into a surplus position. 
The budget documents indicate that we may get to approximately 
$9 billion to $10 billion in a couple of years.
<P>
	I do not think there is any doubt that the Minister of Finance 
would be prepared to tell my hon. friend that there is a level at 
which the surplus has to be controlled. I will indicate my interest as 
well. The member would know that the surplus is merely a myth in 
the sense that it is a liability the government has when it uses it in 
the CRF because it is a debt owed to the employment insurance 
fund.
<P>
	Although it is useful in managing the deficit to some extent, in 
the final analysis it will have to be used to protect against a 
downturn in the economy. We want to avoid the kind of scenario we 
had a few years ago when the country was in a recession and 
premiums were going up when companies and individuals were 
least able to pay them. I take my hon. friend's comments seriously. 
We have to look at where we are going to put a ceiling on the 
surplus.
<P>
	To answer another point he made, I do think the right way to go 
about it will be to make some dramatic changes in the premium rate 
because it is a payroll tax. It is a disincentive. We can address that 
in the next 18 months if we continue on the present trend of an 
increasing amount in the reserve. Jobs are also being created in the 
private sector that will allow for premiums to be adjusted 
downward.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened carefully to the minister's remarks. Naturally, when we 
hear such remarks, we must focus primarily on the role this 
minister plays within the Liberal caucus. Of course, the minister 
sidestepped the main questions. He did not talk about the debt, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="833"> 833 </A></B>
<P>
which  continues to grow, or the deficit, which is slowly shrinking, 
but only because of the surpluses in the unemployment insurance 
fund.
<P>
	He mentioned a few figures, paltry in the context of billion 
dollar budgets, for job creation. In other words, there is almost 
nothing. He spoke about students but it was only a diversion.
<P>
	Coming back to the minister's primary role, he is insinuating in 
this House that those who oppose the reform come mainly from 
organized groups, people who earn their living at the expense of the 
least fortunate making them aware of things.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	I would like to draw to his attention something that was sent to 
me by teachers who do not work on a regular basis, who do not 
have regular jobs-this is why teaching is called a precarious 
profession. They sent me a little postcard, just to tell me that this 
reform is inequitable, unfair and ineffective. Because they can be 
classified as seasonal workers, they are asking for the pure and 
simple withdrawal of Bill C-12.
<P>
	I therefore have a question for the minister. Does he plan to 
withdraw this bill? Do his plans include Quebec receiving the 
transfer of powers and money due it so that it can look after its own 
manpower and unemployment insurance?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Chicoutimi raised 
several questions. As far as the debt and the deficit are concerned, 
this is a mammoth, long term undertaking. We are familiar with the 
problem that exists in Canada, one that Quebec will also recognize, 
judging by what the Government of Quebec has had to say recently. 
This is a problem all governments in the country have to deal with.
<P>
	As for what I had to say about those who organize 
demonstrations, I think accuracy is in order here. The French 
language press reported what I said with extreme accuracy. What I 
said is that I understand why people who are worried and nervous 
participate in demonstrations. I understand why they express their 
concerns and seek change. This is why we have said, ever since the 
month of December, that we would be proposing changes to bill 
C-12.
<P>
	What bothers me somewhat is the presence of professional 
agitators in communities where they would normally rarely, if ever, 
be seen, people who do this for a living year round and earn very 
high salaries. They travel around to exploit people who have 
serious and legitimate grievances.
<P>
	This is how I see it, and I have never been embarrassed to call a 
spade a spade. I must say, in all frankness, that the professional 
agitators who came into my riding did not spare me with their 
comments either. They said exactly what they thought of me. We 
will exchange views  but, at the end of the day, I hope that we will 
have managed to find solutions for those affected by the changes.
<P>
	I find this still hard to understand, because when I spoke just 
now about job creation I mentioned two funds totalling $1.1 
billion. As for the summer jobs, which are described as window 
dressing, the fund has gone up from last year's $60 million to $120 
million yearly, only for the program to create jobs for 
post-secondary students.
<P>
	If, for Bloc members and for my hon. friend from Chicoutimi, 
$120 million this summer is merely window dressing, there are 
plenty of young people across this country who would like to have 
their windows dressed in this way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister in his speech gave an open challenge to members to point 
out and compare the fiscal situation of Canada to other G-7 
countries. I will do that.
<P>
	Canada's debt to GDP ratio is the second worst of the G-7, 
second only to Italy, yet this government is continuing to add to 
that debt every year into the foreseeable future. There is no 
deadline set by the government to stop adding to the debt. This ever 
increasing debt is the biggest threat to health care and to other 
important programs in Canada. In this government's first budget it 
added over $10 billion in interest payments just to service the debt 
yet the debt continues to go up. I do not understand how the 
minister can sound so smug about the government's progress to 
date.
<P>
	When will the government stop adding to the debt and to the ever 
increasing interest payments on the debt?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I appeared to be smug about any of 
our accomplishments I want to dissipate any notion of that kind 
because I think it has been a mighty struggle. I make no bones 
about it. I have said it in this place and in many other places that 
had one of my friends, the predecessor to the present Minister of 
Finance, been given the opportunity to do what he wanted to do in 
1985 and 1986, I think Mr. Wilson would have been able to arrange 
the affairs of this country in such a way fiscally at least that we 
would be much better off today.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	That is why I complimented my colleague, the Minister of 
Finance, and the Prime Minister for backing him. We have begun 
the process of going from a situation where the deficit to GDP ratio 
was 7 per cent and we have got it down now to 3 per cent. The 
minister has made an undertaking to go to 2 per cent. I know it is 
not as fast as my hon. friend would like to see it move. At least 
after many years with various stripes of government going in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="834"> 834 </A></B>
<P>
wrong direction, I hope that my hon. colleague would  at least 
respect the fact that over the last couple of years the current 
Minister of Finance has been moving toward balancing the budget.
<P>
	Besides that an interesting part of all of this is when we get to the 
cashflow situation which allows us to eliminate borrowing. In other 
words we will be able to operate on a current account with enough 
cashflow to be able to pay for our day to day needs.
<P>
	There are a number of indicators out there. I understand how 
frustrating it must be for people who would like to have an instant 
solution to a very longstanding problem. We will continue to do the 
best we can to get a very difficult deficit situation under control. As 
Canadians who understand this recognize, we cannot start to do 
anything about the debt until we have cleaned up the deficit. We are 
on the way to doing that. I do share the view of the hon. member 
that we should get to balanced books and begin to pay down the 
debt as soon as we possibly can.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to thank the hon. 
Minister of Human Resources Development and the four members 
from the opposition benches who participated in this exchange. I 
thank you all for your co-operation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Lethbridge.
<P>
	I am pleased to be able to speak to the budget today. I was 
pleased to be able to listen to the speech of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. He is a very practised speaker and is quite 
impressive. Any Canadian listening to the minister would say: ``We 
are in good shape. Look at how well off we are compared to other 
countries''. The big problem is that the minister, as pointed out by 
my colleague's question, did not mention the fact that all of this 
goodness we are receiving is based in good part on the fact that we 
are borrowing money to be able to produce all these services. That 
is not the worst of it. We know that our debt is approaching a 
tremendous figure of over $580 billion.
<P>
	The minister correctly says that the government is trying to 
tackle the deficit. The government is making some progress on it, I 
will concede that. However the progress is insufficient when we 
consider the size of the deficit and realize how much deeper in debt 
the country is going and that all the services being provided are 
based on the debt and deficit situation.
<P>
	As a result of the prorogation of Parliament in February, I had 
the opportunity to consult with my constituents for some time on 
this topic. While in my riding of Nanaimo-Cowichan I received a 
good number of letters and phone calls on the subject. I was also 
able to conduct a public opinion survey on the budget.
<P>
	Constituents and business persons alike took the time to share 
their thoughts with me as to what the budget  should offer 
Canadians. There was pretty much a consensus of the message 
people wanted conveyed to the Prime Minister and the finance 
minister. That message was a very simple and sincere one: Get 
government off their backs and out of their pockets.
<P>
	Unfortunately the budget put forward by the finance minister is 
in many opinions including mine, an abject failure. It is so much so 
that if I had to assign it a letter grade, I would be unable to do so as 
the alphabet just is not long enough.
<P>
	I will criticize the latest Liberal budget from the perspective of 
an ordinary taxpaying Canadian. I am not doing this because I 
believe it will benefit the Liberal members across the way who I 
think have lost touch with the voters. Instead I would like to convey 
to the House at a personal level how the budget fails Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	A responsible businessman in my riding did some work for me. 
After he had finished he phoned me and a long conversation ensued 
wherein he told me his problems. I am going to concentrate his 
problems on the federal side, but they are shared equally by the 
provincial government in British Columbia and by the municipal 
government.
<P>
	This businessman is an honest, sincere, practical fellow. He 
obeys all the rules. He obtains all the permits. The people he 
employs are properly qualified trades people. However, obeying 
the rules is getting him into trouble. Several years ago he had 21 
employees. He dropped to 11 employees. Right now he has five 
employees. He told me he might have to sell off one-half of his 
business and go into business by himself. Why is this? He fills in 
all the returns. He obtains the permits. His employees are educated. 
He pays his taxes, including the GST.
<P>
	The problem is that other businessmen do not obey all of the 
rules. All of the rules and all of the taxes are so high and so 
complex that instead of open business being conducted, there is an 
underground economy and fly by nights can take advantage of the 
situation. They do the job for cash and therefore do not pay the 
GST. They undercut the responsible businessman who is playing by 
all the rules. It is unfortunate.
<P>
	Of course, it shows the effect of the GST. It shows the effect of 
all taxation. It shows the effect of the bureaucracy which is all over 
the businessman. He does not have any choice but to shrink his 
business and watch in vain as business goes to fly by night 
operators. That is a shame.
<P>
	A great deal has been made in media reports especially by the 
CBC that the deficit has been tamed. Nothing could be further from 
the truth. The callous way in which the media have chosen to 
ignore the fact that the government will allow the debt to increase 
to some $600 billion in a year or two is absolutely shameful.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="835"> 835 </A></B>
<P>
	If there was ever any question that the CBC had abandoned its 
commitment to journalistic integrity, its coverage of the Liberal 
budget ended whatever doubt may have existed in the minds of 
many Canadians. No doubt owing to the gratitude the CBC must 
feel for being spared new cuts in the budget, the Liberals have 
effectively bought themselves a powerful lobbying machine and 
cheerleader.
<P>
	In relation to the budget, personal examples of how Canadians 
will be affected by its contents best serve to illustrate the 
government's fiscal shortcomings. I have in my hand a copy of the 
T1 general tax form which every Canadian will be filling out in 
coming months. The form at line 437 asks for the total of all taxes 
deducted, or the amount of money the federal government really 
takes out of our pockets.
<P>
	Approximately 40 per cent of whatever amount a Canadian 
places on that line will go toward interest payments on the total 
federal debt. Roughly 40 per cent of what we pay in taxes is going 
to service the debt. Think of all the things that could be bought with 
that 40 per cent. Translated, if a person is making $30,000 a year, 
the amount entered on line 437 would be around $5,000. Out of that 
$5,000 approximately $2,000 goes toward interest payment on the 
debt.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	That money is not going toward medicare obviously. It is not 
money that is going to any other social spending, such as education 
or what have you. It is not even money that the person filing the 
return can use for his or her own personal enjoyment. This money 
is spent on servicing the debt and represents the lost opportunities 
of every Canadian who pays taxes in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> That is shameful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> It is shameful. The phrase economists use is 
opportunity cost. Most Canadians reflecting on it would call it a 
damnable shame.
<P>
	The truly sad thing is that unless the budget is balanced, we 
could eventually spend 50 cents or more of every tax dollar on debt 
interest. Think of that one. We are still heading in that direction. As 
the accumulated debt grows so does the amount of interest 
Canadians must pay to service that debt.
<P>
	In closing, I urge my colleagues to vote against the government's 
budget for 1996. Beyond that, I say through you, Mr. Speaker, to all 
Canadians: When filing your income tax return this year, and 
people will be doing that in the next six weeks, do not forget to note 
how much of your hard earned money the Liberal government is 
going to spend on servicing the debt and the next time you are at 
the polls, vote against the Liberal government's destructive fiscal 
policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought I heard the hon. member say 
that he could not give this budget a letter grade because it was so 
bad.
<P>
	Members opposite often cite the Fraser Institute, but on this 
occasion, not a word. Michael Walker said: ``In regarding the 
government's latest budget as boring, commentators have missed 
some of the most aggressive fiscal action in the country's history. 
Far from being a bore, this budget was a turning point in Canadian 
fiscal history. We may well chart a dramatic turn in our fortunes to 
March 1996''.
<P>
	Would the hon. member like to comment? It is not that Mr. 
Walker has had a conversion on the road to Damascus; he has read 
the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to defend what Michael 
Walker of the Fraser Institute said. What I would like to do is read 
through his entire statement and pull out the parts the member 
opposite is not quoting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the member's comments. I want to address 
the issue about the national debt, some $550 billion. This is a very 
large amount which scares many Canadians. It represents an 
amount that has been accumulated over the last 25 years. Some 
$350 billion has been accumulated in terms of accumulated deficit. 
The balance is compounded interest.
<P>
	One of the things members do not ever talk about is the rest of 
the balance sheet of the Government of Canada. Since the previous 
questioner was talking about the Fraser Institute, let me share with 
members what the Fraser Institute had to say about the assets of 
Canada. It said that the value of Canada, excluding the land value, 
was some $3 trillion.
<P>
	If all the assets, the purchases, the goods that Canada owns 
excluding the land, were to be put on the balance sheet, those $3 
trillion worth of assets would be there along with the debt. It is like 
a mortgage. It is a mortgage that has to be paid down. It is a 
mortgage that will be paid down, but it will not be paid down on the 
backs of the poor, the disadvantaged and the seniors as the Reform 
Party has been advocating all along.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	I will put it simply for the member. If he is like other Canadians 
he probably bought a house and has a mortgage. Does the member 
think the mortgage interest he pays is just throwing money away or 
is he investing in real assets which are to the benefit of him and his 
family for the rest of their lives?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not grace the debate by doing a 
comparison such as is being offered here. I would like to do a 
couple of things in addressing the words I have just heard.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="836"> 836 </A></B>
<P>
	First, I will correct the false statement that the Reform would 
do debt correction on the backs of seniors and such. This is so 
much hooey and we keep hearing it from the other benches. I quite 
resent it.
<P>
	The other statement made by the hon. member had to do with 
Canada's worth. Implicit in this statement of so many trillion 
dollars of worth is that we can afford to keep on adding to the debt. 
When we consider the debt servicing charges alone account for $40 
billion and they are is going to be increasing in time while the 
Liberal government is in power to $50 billion a year, that is a 
shocking figure. Think of all of the services we could buy for that 
$40 billion or $50 billion.
<P>
	We all believe in the worth of Canada. Yes we can prove it in our 
infrastructure et cetera. However, to say that therefore we can 
continue to go into debt, because we have not anywhere near 
accomplished the possible debtload here, is a specious argument at 
best.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to 
have the opportunity to participate in the budget debate.
<P>
	In my 10 minutes I will make three points. First, I will talk about 
the impact Reform has had on the government's fiscal agenda. 
Second, I will illustrate the impact by comparing the taxpayers 
budget which is talked about in this House to the Liberal 
government's actions and what has happened. Third, I will look at 
what lies ahead.
<P>
	The first thing to look at is the dramatic change in the direction 
of the Liberal government since coming to power in 1993 and the 
role of the Reform Party in influencing the direction of that 
government. Let me explain.
<P>
	In the 1993 campaign the Reform Party warned that job creation 
would be weak until the deficit was eliminated and taxes were 
lowered. We argued that the country's poor economic performance 
was directly related to its poor economic fundamentals. Our 
prescription was very straightforward and quite logical: eliminate 
the deficit, pay down the debt and lower the taxes. On the other 
hand, the Liberals told Canadians that the deficit and interest rates 
were high because the economy was so weak. The economy was 
weak because the government was not creating enough jobs.
<P>
	What does that translate into? The deficit was not the problem. 
The economic fundamentals were not the problem. Government 
cutbacks were the problem. All that was needed was for some good 
old-fashioned Liberal government to come along and prime the 
fiscal pump. The jobs would start flowing, the economy would start 
growing and the deficit would go away.
<P>
	The Liberals followed through with that pump priming when 
they came to power. What did we have in February 1994? They 
spent $2 billion of borrowed money, asked the municipalities and 
asked the provinces  to borrow another $4 billion, to build things 
like boccie courts in Toronto and canoe museums in Shawinigan. 
They raised a few taxes, trimmed a little spending and waited for 
the jobs to roll in. But the jobs did not roll in. In fact they slowed to 
a trickle. Interest rates did not come down, they went up. Bluntly 
the Liberals' plan did not work.
<P>
	Being the pragmatists that they are, the Liberals looked around 
to see what other solutions were before them. The option there was 
the message being preached and talked about by the Reform Party 
in 1993, a message of spending reduction, deficit reduction and 
fiscal restraint. The about face which followed is unprecedented in 
the history of Canadian politics.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Starting with last year's budget the Liberals have transformed 
themselves from traditional Keynesian pump primers to orthodox 
fiscal conservatives which is quite a transition in Canada. In the 
wake of this conversion the new Liberal gospel which we heard 
from the lips of our Minister of Finance not too long ago reads as 
follows: First, governments no longer create jobs, the private sector 
does. What a realization. Second, spending no longer stimulates the 
economy, lower interest rates do. Third, deficits no longer keep the 
economy afloat, they sink it. Most important, it was said by the 
finance minister that job creation is dependent on low taxes, low 
deficits and low interest rates rather than the other way around. 
What a conversion.
<P>
	If asked to comment on this transformation I would make two 
observations. First, it is good. The change is good. Second, the 
Reform Party of Canada impacted and got through to the 
government to change the circumstances, which is a bonus in itself.
<P>
	Actions speak louder than words so let us look at the Liberals' 
budget to see how far they have come.
<P>
	Last year my party estimated that to balance the budget by 1998 
without increasing taxes, spending would have to be reduced by 
some $25 billion. How have the Liberals done? To date they have 
proposed spending reductions of $15 billion. In other words, they 
are 60 per cent of the way there. They have also raised taxes which 
has narrowed the gap somewhat. They have promised to continue 
their work which means we are conceivably on the track to a 
balanced budget sometime around the year 2001 which is also 
good.
<P>
	To break it down further, the taxpayers budget recommended 
reducing departmental spending by $10 billion. The Liberals have 
now done that. They reduced it by $10 billion and are counting and 
it seems to increase.
<P>
	The taxpayers budget recommended reducing transfers to 
provinces by 24 per cent. Despite increasing equalization payments 
spending under the Liberals has been reduced by more than 21 per 
cent. Health, education and welfare have been cut far deeper.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="837"> 837 </A></B>
<P>
	The taxpayers budget recommended downsizing the UI program 
by some $3.4 billion. With the latest UI proposals, the government 
will surpass that goal.
<P>
	As we can see, progress has been made and for that I applaud the 
government. I also applaud my own colleagues, for these numbers 
make it clear that Reformers have had a significant impact on the 
direction of the Liberal government. However, much more can be 
done.
<P>
	For example, Quebec is the fourth richest province in Canada yet 
it is the largest beneficiary of equalization dollars. By putting a 
priority on the poorest provinces we can save another $3 billion 
annually. Eliminating all subsidies to businesses would save at 
least another $2 billion a year. I could go on. The federal 
government today is closer to fiscal stability than at any other point 
in 15 years. I certainly applaud the government for that direction.
<P>
	The major criticism I and my colleagues have is that in dealing 
with the deficit the Liberals have not moved quickly enough. This 
is not being picky. The Liberals' inaction carries a cost which 
comes in the form of interest payments on the debt. To illustrate, by 
1997-98 with the latest Liberal budget we will be $42 billion 
further in debt than we would have been if the Liberals had 
followed the taxpayers budget. By my calculation the interest cost 
price tag associated with this additional debt is an accumulated 
$5.3 billion over the first three years alone.
<P>
	Sadly, this has forced the Liberals to do the one thing they sought 
most to avoid: to make deeper cuts to the programs Canadians 
value most. Let us look at that. My hon. colleague commented on it 
a few moments ago.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	The taxpayers budget called for health care reductions of just 
$800 million. The Liberal cuts so far are $3.4 billion and counting. 
Compare that. The taxpayers budget asked to reduce funding for 
education by only $200 million. The Liberals have now cut seven 
times that amount.
<P>
	Third, going even further back to the 1993 election, we proposed 
to limit old age security payments to those earning less than 
$54,000. The Liberals now plan to place the threshold at $45,000. 
Who is slash and burn and who is really cutting? I think that has to 
be laid on the table so that people know about it.
<P>
	These are the costs associated with what the finance minister 
likes to call a moderate deficit reduction pace, even faster than the 
Reform Party in some of the social areas.
<P>
	However, as I stated earlier, the end is now within sight. While 
we may differ on the pace of our efforts, members of all parties 
realize the importance of building on what progress has been made.
<P>
	What is the end result? What are the fruits of our efforts? They 
are many. Once our fiscal problems are behind us we can focus on 
new, more pleasant decisions. Instead of finding new areas to cut, 
we can debate the matter of lower taxes. We can decide how to pay 
down our debt. We can opt to bolster health care and pensions if 
that is what Canadians want to do. Balancing the budget will also 
result in more permanent lower interest rates. As the finance 
minister points out, rates have come down already but we expect 
that to continue.
<P>
	This brings us the real rewards. Tax breaks mean Canadians will 
have more in their pockets at the end of the day. Lower interest 
rates mean more Canadians can afford a car. A healthy economy 
means more Canadians will have the confidence and ability to buy 
a home. In short, we will all see a real and perceptible rise in our 
standard of living. This will bring about the very thing the Liberals 
promised three years ago but could not deliver: a healthy economy, 
a positive growth climate and jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
think I have ever heard such a strange argument. As I understand it, 
the argument is that the Liberal Party has done so well, and we are 
accepting that the Liberal Party has done so well over the last three 
years in its governance, that we are somehow responsible.
<P>
	All I have heard over the last three years from the party opposite 
is what a disaster the government has undertaken against the people 
of Canada. Therefore it is very interesting that today the Reform 
Party seems to be turning the course in recognizing that the Liberal 
Party has done the things it said it would do.
<P>
	In the red book we stated we would bring the deficit down to 3 
per cent of GDP. That was months before we even heard about the 
Reform Party in the House. The reality is the government is on 
track with that.
<P>
	It may be that all of the things the member is applauding would 
have happened even if those seats over there were not occupied. 
The reality is we are on our agenda. Six hundred thousand new jobs 
have been created in this period of time. The debt to GDP ratio, 
which everybody seems to be ignoring, for the 1996-97 period will 
be 75 per cent. It is nothing to be proud of but in the 1997-98 fiscal 
period it will be 94 per cent. That is the turning of the course of this 
deficit which the government has basically brought all by itself, not 
by the urging of Reform members.
<P>
	I see that Mr. Forbes in the United States has fallen out of favour 
on his flat tax but it seems to me Reformers are continuing on in 
this vein. One of the speakers mentioned his concern for small 
business. Would the member acknowledge that a flat tax would do 
away with the current low rate of tax for small and medium size 
business?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="838"> 838 </A></B>
<P>
	Would it not also tax interest of the banks, the very interest 
transfer payments he talked about being the money the poor 
taxpayer was paying for interest on the national debt where the 
recipient of that would not pay tax on it under the Reform Party's 
flat tax agenda?
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a member of the 
Reform Party, as a party we want to be fair. When a government 
makes progress in a certain direction we should applaud it.
<P>
	The government member wants to deny the idea came from the 
Reform Party. I think he would have to admit that the Reform Party 
is the group that put pressure on the Minister of Finance in terms of 
balancing the budget.
<P>
	During our first term here our leader asked time after time in 
question period when the government would balance the budget. I 
asked it as the finance critic. Across Canada the public and the 
business community asked the question of the finance minister. 
The financial houses which look at Canada's credit rating asked it 
of the finance minister. There was tremendous pressure from a lot 
of sources to be fiscally conservative and deal with the deficit.
<P>
	In the last fiscal budget the finance minister responded and went 
much further. He said his Liberal caucus members took some two 
or three months to move over and finally thought they would take 
the risk on more deficit and expenditure reduction. What was the 
big result? The Minister of Finance set up a bank of telephones 
expecting Canadians to jump all over them and tromp them with 
their boots because they had reduced expenditures and tried to deal 
with the deficit. The telephones were dead. Nobody phoned 
because it was the right policy. It was what the Reform Party had 
been saying for months, even two or three years before we came 
here; cut expenditures, reduce the deficit and there will be all the 
results I mentioned in my speech.
<P>
	Now with regard to the question of flat tax, the Reform Party 
wants a tax that is fair for all Canadians. I think we all want that. 
There are three or four models of flat tax. One model is the pure flat 
tax, the one model the hon. member was referencing, which deals 
with interest, charitable donations in a variety of ways. The Reform 
Party is taking those models to Canadians and asking: ``Which 
option would work for you as a Canadian? Which one would help 
small and large businesses and the individual taxpayer in the best 
way?'' That is how we are handling it, by taking it to the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I say respectfully to all members I am flat 
out of time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Cooperation, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this afternoon I 
want to talk about the future  for Canada made possible by this 
budget. My comments are based on two statements.
<P>
	The first one comes at the end of the finance minister's budget 
speech, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We must set great national challenges, not small ones because it is only by 
reaching as high as we are able that we will discover how far we can go.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Why can we not decide together that ten years hence, Canada will be regarded 
as the world leader in the new industries of the new economy, in bio-technology, 
in environmental technology, in the cultural industries of the multi-channel 
universe? Why not decide together that ten years hence increasing child poverty 
rates will be a thing of the past, that illiteracy will be erased from our 
communities and that when it comes to international tests, our students will not 
simply do fine, but in fact be the very finest?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In that statement, the minister talks about national challenges, 
about challenges facing all of Canada. The second statement comes 
from the Prime Minister's presentation on the throne speech, and I 
quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canadians were used to seeing governments compete, first ministers bicker, 
but with Team Canada they saw us working together. They liked what they saw 
and they want to see more it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We can and must prove to Canadians that we, federal and provincial 
governments and the private sector, do not need to leave Canada in order to 
work together. Team Canada worked well in Beijing, Bombay and Buenos Aires 
but it can work as well in Burnaby, Brampton or Bromont. We should put the 
same Team Canada spirit to work here at home creating jobs in a true national 
partnership.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Here is one approach, one way of meeting the national 
challenges the Minister of Finance was talking about. Today, I am 
proposing a blend of these two great ideas, combining national 
challenges with a Team Canada approach. I am putting forward an 
action plan to make ten blueprints for Canadian society a reality 
within ten years. Ten days ago, on March 2, we held in my riding a 
symposium on the theme of blueprints for Canadian society in a 
renewed Canada. What it was not is a constituent assembly. There 
was no talk of centralization, decentralization, new distribution of 
powers within the country, Brussels or subsidiarity.
<P>
	The partitioning of Quebec was not discussed either. There was 
no plan A, B, C, D or X. All we talked about was the raison d'être 
of a country. There were discussions about friendly association 
across the country and about a real country called Canada.
<P>
	What is a blueprint for Canadian society? First of all, it requires 
a partnership involving the federal government, the provincial 
governments, the municipal governments, the private sector, the 
volunteer sector, the academic sector, the labour movement, and so 
on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="839"> 839 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadian history is filled with examples of such plans. The 
economic situation during the second world war is but one such 
example. The construction of our railroads, of the Trans-Canada 
highway and pipelines, and of the  St. Lawrence seaway are more 
examples. We could even add the development of our national 
health care system.
<P>
	What should our new blueprints for Canadian society be? The 
Minister of Finance mentioned a few; here are a few more. The 
participants in the March 2 seminar looked at three examples: one 
in the environmental industry, based on the technology developed 
by Ballard Power Systems, in Vancouver; one dealing with how to 
better protect and educate our children; and one concerning the 
information highway.
<P>
	The methodology used was similar in each case. First, what is 
the goal, the vision, the mandate? Second, what is the theory 
supporting this vision and why choose this project as opposed to 
another one? Third, what resources are available at every 
level-federal, provincial, private sector, etc.-to fulfil the 
mandate? Fourth, how could we join our individual efforts to 
achieve our common goal?
<P>
	How can we create that famous Team Canada at home? Let me 
give you an example. Everyone, and politicians in particular, talks 
about the need to protect our children. However, this is often mere 
rhetoric. Yet, we all know that positive support to young children 
until they reach the age of four or five is absolutely essential for 
their emotional, social and intellectual development. Headstart 
programs are well worth the initial investment.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	We have all the necessary resources to provide our children with 
the support they need to achieve their full potential. The Canadian 
Institute for Advanced Research on Human Development gathers 
researchers from across Canada, including a very important player 
in Montreal, the team of Richard Tremblay and Marc Renaud.
<P>
	There are also federal and provincial programs. As well, there 
are community based projects everywhere in Canada. Yet, as a 
country, we have not succeeded in consolidating all these 
initiatives in a Canadian blueprint for society.
<P>
	A country exists to face common challenges. This is why, in the 
coming decade, we need to have at least ten Canadian blueprints 
for society, if we are to build a new Canada. People do not belong 
to a country only for reasons of fear or money. They do so because 
they are willing to work together to create a better country.
<P>
	The Order of Canada motto, now the country's motto, reads: 
<I>Desiderantes Meliorem Patriam</I>. They want a better homeland, like 
all of us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
colleague has given a wonderful speech, but in practical terms I do 
not see what these national challenges can do for us. It is all very 
lovely, but, practically speaking, this is not the answer.
<P>
	Furthermore, since coming to power, this government has 
focussed almost exclusively on budget expenditures in its fight 
against the deficit. This leaves the less fortunate, seniors and 
students footing the bill.
<P>
	I would ask my hon. colleague two questions. National 
challenges cost money and in order to have money we must create 
jobs. Regarding the $5 billion surplus in the unemployment 
insurance fund, does he think we should use this money purely for 
the creation of jobs and not to reduce the deficit? That is my first 
question.
<P>
	This is the second. Since, at some point, we also have to take 
another look at the tax system, would it not be wise to ask a 
parliamentary committee to examine this whole issue? I think that 
that is where we must begin, by creating jobs first and then looking 
at the tax system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godfrey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would rather address my hon. 
colleague's opening remarks, in which he congratulates me on my 
speech, but he is very suspicious, very sceptical, very cynical even. 
I would simply like to talk about a fine example of a national 
blueprint for society in which Quebec has a very keen interest.
<P>
	When I was chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, I 
was asked to create a sub-committee to look at the defence 
industries and their conversion in Quebec. This is an example of an 
industry based in Quebec that depends enormously on the Canadian 
infrastructure.
<P>
	At the meeting I mentioned a moment ago, I made a proposition 
concerning this technology, which I referred to in my speech, to 
create an urban bus system using a type of electrochemical cell, 
namely the Ballard system. This is a company that is creating a 
technology but has no partner in Quebec. And then there is 
Bombardier, a Quebec company specializing in aerospace and mass 
transit. Why not form an alliance between this company in British 
Columbia and the company in Quebec? That would be a form of 
partnership. That would be a national project in everyone's interest, 
because it would also entail the conversion of a defence industry. It 
would mean taking an existing asset, Bombardier, and converting it 
to environmental technology. That is why we must get involved in 
this sort of national project.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the debate on 
the 1996 budget.
<P>
	A few weeks ago the government presented its blueprint for the 
future. The throne speech outlined the many areas the government 
said it would address in this session of Parliament.
<P>
	I was proud of the contents of the throne speech. It was forward 
looking while addressing the immediate needs of our great country. 
I am equally pleased with the  budget. It provides that the throne 
speech was not simply a feel good document as some members 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="840"> 840 </A></B>
<P>
opposite had labelled it. The contents of the 1996 budget proved 
conclusively that the throne speech is what it intended to be, a true 
working document.
<P>
	The budget provides concrete actions for many ideals set out in 
the throne speech, especially on the jobs and growth front. It is that 
area on which I should like to concentrate today.
<P>
	Since being elected in 1993 job creation and economic growth 
have always been top priorities. While the government has the 
ability to create direct jobs for Canadians as it did in the successful 
$6 billion infrastructure program, the true role of government is to 
provide the private sector with a framework for growth.
<P>
	A healthy economic climate is the key to the creation of quality, 
long term employment. In our three years in office we have met 
with a large measure of success in this area. Interest rates have 
declined by 3 percentage points in the past year. Inflation is at its 
lowest in 30 years. Canada's economy is more competitive than 
ever. More than half a million private sector jobs have been created 
since we took office. Since November alone 123,000 such jobs 
were created.
<P>
	Due to successive budgets that attack spending we have once 
again been able to hold the line on taxes. There have been no 
personal tax increases in the past three years.
<P>
	Combined, these facts paint a future that is bright for all 
Canadians who must not be content to sit back and admire the 
progress that has been achieved. More work remains to be done on 
the job front.
<P>
	In a world where fiscal resources are increasingly scarce, our 
governments must now make strategic choices about where they 
want to spend their money. That is why the government has chosen 
to focus on three areas which are keys to our future prosperity: jobs 
for youth, technology investment and encouragement, and trade.
<P>
	I could go on at some length about the important role young 
Canadians will play in our nation's future but that is a speech in 
itself. It is one that contains fundamental truths that all Canadians 
share. We must provide our younger generation with the 
opportunities necessary to succeed.
<P>
	Times have changed for young Canadians. The rapid changes 
brought about by the new realities in the global marketplace have 
affected youth. When I was a young man, a high school education 
was all that one needed to have success in the job market. Today 
post-secondary education is only the first step in the lifelong 
exercise of learning.
<P>
	The message to stay in school has never been more important. 
That is why our youth need assistance more than ever before. The 
federal budget provides that help.  The budget provides an 
additional $165 million over three years to help students with the 
increased cost of education. Education tax credits will be increased 
and the limits on the transfer of tuition and education credits raised.
<P>
	The budget will also increase the limits and contributions to 
registered education savings plans. Broadening the eligibility for 
child care expense allowance will help more parents undertake 
education or retraining.
<P>
	An additional $315 million will be provided over three years to 
create new youth employment opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Funding will be doubled for summer student jobs. The 
government will also work toward a Team Canada style partnership 
between business and governments to create entry level jobs for 
youth. These investments in our youth will pay large dividends in 
the future.
<P>
	Let me turn to technology, the second area of the jobs and growth 
agenda. The budget concentrates on technology as our way in the 
future. Canada has been a world leader in the growth area of 
technology. The jobs of tomorrow are in the high tech field and 
Canada's future depends on our ability to provide continued 
leadership in these areas. The budget outlined technology 
partnerships to encourage the development of the environmental 
technologies, advanced manufacturing and materials, as well as 
biotechnology. It will also help maintain jobs in the aerospace 
sector which is subject to heavily subsidized foreign competition.
<P>
	Additional funding will be provided to the Business 
Development Bank to provide loans to knowledge based exporting 
and growth businesses. We will accelerate our efforts to bring the 
benefits of information technology, especially the much talked 
about information highway, to the entire country. In particular, we 
want to connect rural areas-and there are many in my riding of 
Perth-Wellington-Waterloo-to a program in which 2,000 
computer students will connect 50,000 small businesses to the 
Internet. That is also part of the government's plan. Combined, 
these efforts will allow Canada to maintain its role as a world 
leader in the burgeoning field of technology.
<P>
	The third job and growth field that the budget addresses is trade. 
The idea is not how to avoid competition but how to get into the 
game. In this area I am happy to say that we have been very 
successful. Month after month Statistics Canada is reporting 
substantial increases in our exports. In the first nine months of 
1995 Canada's merchandise exports grew by over 20 per cent and 
its trade surplus by a dramatic 63 per cent over 1994.
<P>
	Adding to the good news is the fact that this rapid growth is 
diversified. The good news does not stop there. This phenomenon 
is taking place in all the world's major  markets. To ensure that this 
success story continues, the Export Development Corporation will 
receive $50 million in new equity capital for further innovation 
types of export funding. Other areas of export finance will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="841"> 841 </A></B>
<P>
increased and a review of business taxes will be undertaken with 
the goal of promoting jobs and growth.
<P>
	We have lived up to the promises outlined in our jobs and growth 
agenda. I have only provided a brief overview of some of the 
changes put forth in the 1996 budget. I could go into some detail 
about other commitments that have been kept. For instance, we will 
easily hit the 3 per cent of GDP deficit target this year and have 
outlined an even more ambitious 2 per cent for next year.
<P>
	The budget is also full of other good news stories such as 
reassurances of stability in our social programs and enhanced 
RRSP regulations. What is most important to me is our efforts on 
the prosperity front, our investments in youth, technology and trade 
to ensure that the Canadian economy has the ability to adapt and 
grow in the face of future changes.
<P>
	We were elected on a jobs and growth commitment and we again 
spell that agenda out in the throne speech. The budget is just 
another example of our government living up to its promises.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Québec. I rise to take part in 
the debate and in the analysis of the budget brought down by the 
government on March 6. My comments will point to the positive 
aspects of it, but will also cover its negative side.
<P>
	We all know that the role of the opposition is not always easy, 
but it is very effective, because all too often, the government 
mentions a few positive points, but innocently forgets to mention 
the negative ones.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I will also speak to the amendment proposed by my colleague, 
the member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, which summarizes what 
I have to say very well. It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``the budget statement by the Minister of Finance be rejected by this House 
because:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>it proposes no real job creation initiatives and does not reduce government 
spending, most notably the approximately $50 million appropriated annually 
to the Senate;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>it uses the Unemployment Insurance Fund surplus to reduce the budget deficit 
and reduces social transfers to the provinces;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>it undermines labour sponsored venture capital funds, such as the FTQ and CSN 
funds; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>it does not propose a transparent process for achieving genuine reform of 
corporate taxation, or an unequivocal determination to undertake such reform;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>it undermines the provinces' fiscal autonomy;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>it eliminates subsidies to dairy producers without offering them adequate 
financial compensation;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>it jeopardizes women's financial independence by adopting household income 
as the basis for determining seniors' benefits''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Whether it is a government, corporate or family budget, a budget 
acts as a mirror. It helps us evaluate revenues and expenses, 
identify management strengths and weaknesses and plan for the 
future. In the present budget, I see no plan for the future. It is the 
status quo in terms of management and excess in terms of 
expenditures.
<P>
	I divide the budget into two parts: short and long term actions. In 
the short term, there is mention of deficit reduction and the absence 
of taxes-I consider these positive. The negative aspect is the 
dumping of federal expenditures onto the provinces through the 
reduction in transfers to the provinces. It involves the taking over 
of the unemployment insurance fund. When we need so much 
money for job creation, when employers and employees alone are 
paying into the fund, the government simply seizes the fund to pay 
down its deficit.
<P>
	Revenues are naturally on the rise because of a certain economic 
upturn and cuts in the public service.
<P>
	As far as taxes are concerned, we have been told there will be no 
increase. Here again, we tend to see this as really positive. 
However, the down side is that no one is mentioning the cuts in 
goods and services, which amount to several millions of dollars in 
revenues. Take, for example, support payments in single parent 
families, which will bring in between $300 and $400 million.
<P>
	There is also the reduction from 20 per cent to 15 per cent in the 
exemption in risk capital investment funds. There are the RRSPs, 
the seniors' pensions, and we could go on at length naming 
revenue-providing goods and services that have been cut.
<P>
	Earlier, the minister spoke of the $60 million allocated to 
students, but failed to mention the cuts of some $400 million in 
post-secondary transfers. We can see that it is simply a matter of 
shifting funds about.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	We are told that there are no tax increases. However, a cut here 
or a reallocation of funds there is often equivalent to much more 
than a tax increase. Long term measures announced in the budget 
include the creation of a securities commission, a revenue 
commission, a health research commission and a SchoolNet 
program.
<P>
	All these measures seem very positive at first glance, but they 
forgot to mention that these are primarily provincial 
responsibilities and, above all, that they will lead to overlap, waste 
and absolute spending powers without provincial authorization. 
What is even more serious is that in 1997-98, the debt will reach 
$600 billion, $50 billion of which is interest, and the debt is  due to 
this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="842"> 842 </A></B>
<P>
overlap, this waste and this absolute spending power of the federal 
government.
<P>
	Earlier, the member opposite told us that there was no problem, 
that it is a capital asset, that it is comparable to someone buying a 
house. I do not see much of a long term capital asset in this overlap 
and waste.
<P>
	Imagine, $50 billion. If one could, tomorrow morning, have $50 
billion to invest in jobs creation, there would probably be a 
shortage of workers in Canada. A mere $6 billion was made 
available for the infrastructure program and several thousand jobs 
were created. These $6 billion will have to be repaid. The interest 
on this amount is paid out of revenues, in hard cash. So if every 
year we had $50 billion to invest in job creation, there would not be 
enough workers left in Canada.
<P>
	Unfortunately I believe that the message sent by Quebec the day 
of the referendum, on October 30, has not been understood by 
Canada and instead of withdrawing from provincial jurisdictions, 
instead of decentralizing and stopping wasting money, the 
government is going in for even more duplication, in particular 
with such things as the securities commission, the revenue 
commission, the health research commission and the Internet for 
every school.
<P>
	Regarding Internet, the matter was raised in California during 
the last weekend. Internet will be installed in every school but it 
will be done by way of general mutual co-operation. Now, I am 
convinced that here the installation of Internet, which the 
government wants to have in every school in Canada, will require a 
huge organization. People will travel from coast to coast to make 
sure standards are enforced and that the program functions well. 
We will need more than the $800 million usually spent each year on 
government travel.
<P>
	In a nutshell, I see nothing there for employment, debt reduction, 
taxation or Montreal. Yet, economic raiding has done much harm to 
Montreal. I could give as examples the construction of the seaway 
versus the port of Montreal, the Borden commission on the 
petrochemical industry in eastern Canada, the construction of 
Mirabel versus the shift in air transportation towards Toronto, and 
many other examples. In other words, I will conclude by saying 
that the raison d'être of the Bloc Quebecois, which is the 
sovereignty of Quebec, makes more and more sense.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming with 
questions and comments, it is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for 
Regina-Lumsden-Corporate downsizing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member raised the issue of the government's using the UI fund 
to move toward a balanced budget or reduce the deficit. Had the 
member been in the House earlier this day he would have heard the 
Minister of Human Resources Development explain that it was just 
this past December that the UI fund actually moved into a surplus 
position. That is because of the significant deficit that was 
accumulated during the last recession. The member might want to 
check those facts again.
<P>
	He also talked about the infrastructure program and indicated 
that $6 billion was simply spent. He elaborated that this is really 
not a very good use of the government's money. However, the 
member did not comment on the savings Canadian taxpayers have 
achieved by not having to pay UI out to those people who are 
working on infrastructure projects.
<P>
	He did not comment on the fact these people are paying income 
tax and contributing to the payroll taxes which ensure we have a 
secure system. There is also a ripple effect of those programs 
throughout the economy. Clearly the infrastructure program had a 
tremendous impact on jobs, which is really the issue I wanted to 
raise with the member.
<P>
	He will know that on March 8 Statistics Canada reported that 
44,000 new jobs were created in February following the creation of 
44,000 jobs in January and 49,000 jobs in December of 1995. That 
is a total of 137,000 new jobs created in the last three months alone, 
some 82,000 being full time. Even better, that means more than 
600,000 new jobs have been created by the government since it 
took office in November 1993.
<P>
	Does the member not really believe that even Quebec has 
benefited from the responsible fiscal management of the 
government?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for his question. Perhaps I was not here earlier today, but 
I think that the member did not follow or understand properly what 
I said concerning the infrastructure program. I did not say that the 
infrastructure program was not a good thing, I did not say it did not 
create job, what I said is that if that program created only 44,000 
jobs, according to the member, with a $6 billion investment, I 
believe the $50 billion now spent on the interest on the debt would 
create a lot more of them. The difference is that these $50 billion 
that could now be invested in job creation would not have to be 
reimbursed. The $6 billion spent on the infrastructure program 
must be reimbursed. Some municipalities got in debt to do this 
work and will have to pay back what they borrowed.
<P>
	That is what I was thinking when I said that, had we not 
accumulated such a debt through so much waste and  duplication, 
had we simply respected the principle agreed upon in 1867 by the 
Fathers of Confederation, that is one level of government in charge 
of national and international activities leaving management of 
provincial activities to the provinces, we would not be in such a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="843"> 843 </A></B>
<P>
predicament now. At present, we are in gridlock. We spent $10 
billion on national symbols that are now resold for next to nothing.
<P>
	That is the simple explanation, in my estimation. The $50 billion 
would have enabled us to create so many jobs, but now that amount 
is a burden instead, generating the unemployment we now 
experience.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
take part in this debate on the last budget to show its impact on the 
lives of my fellow citizens, especially those in my riding.
<P>
	Because it seemed like a very nice budget that did not impose 
any new taxes or because tobacco, gas and alcohol prices did not go 
up, some people might feel that it evens out the score, that it is not 
worth arguing about.
<P>
	That is why I decided to shed light on this budget's hidden 
impact on family life. To that end, I will use the example of a 
fictitious family of five people, which could be called the 
Lemay-Dumas or the Jobin-Duguay family. It includes the mother, 
the father, their two children and a grandmother.
<P>
	The mother, Mrs. Lemay, is currently unemployed after losing 
her part time job as a nurse's aide in a home for seniors. The father, 
Mr. Dumas, works for a community organization and earns 
$32,000 a year. The older daughter, Martine, is in her last year of 
college and hopes to be accepted in the maths program at Laval 
University next year. She works part-time as a waitress in a 
restaurant. As for the son, Maxime, he is in his last year of high 
school and has not yet started to earn money. The grandmother is 
retired and has been a widow for three years. She lives on the 
second floor of the house belonging to her son and daughter-in-law. 
After the birth of her first child, the grandmother never went back 
to the labour force.
<P>
	I would like to explain how the federal government's budget cuts 
will affect these five people, how they will threaten and, as a result, 
lower their quality of life.
<P>
	To that end, I will go quickly over the cuts to the Canada social 
transfer, which were widely condemned by the Bloc Quebecois 
because these cuts and the resulting shortfall in social programs 
financing will threaten and automatically alter the lives of the 
people in this family.
<P>
	It is quite simple. The Quebec government will receive less 
money from the federal government. There is talk of $1.2 billion 
for the year 1996-97, which means $4 billion over four years. The 
people in Quebec will receive less but continue to pay the same 
amount in taxes. This will  not change the tax rate. So, Mr. Dumas 
will pay his share to Ottawa, but his provincial government will not 
get back from Ottawa as much as it used to in terms of transfers.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec will have no choice. Since it will be 
receiving a smaller percentage of the taxes paid to Ottawa by its 
taxpayers, it will have to cut its expenditures. That is plain and 
simple.
<P>
	In what areas will the Quebec government spend most of its 
revenue? It will be up to the Quebec government to decide. Will it 
be health, education, social assistance? The responsibility will have 
shifted from one level of government onto the other-in fact, 
several government members plan to take advantage of this 
situation to score political points, praising the benefits of the 
federal system and contending that only the federal government 
can provide an efficient social safety net.
<P>
	The government has come up with a novel idea: the social union; 
at the same time, and the President of the Treasury Board himself 
boasted about it in this House: ``We are going to wait for the 
Quebec government to make cuts, and then we will brag about how 
the federal government, which is committed to providing all 
Canadians, including Quebecers, with a social safety net, will go 
about it.''
<P>
	Chances are that the family in question will be directly affected. 
Martine, the young student, will have to pay higher tuition fees at 
the university because of the social transfer transferring less to 
Quebec. With these higher fees, her income as a waitress will no 
longer be enough, and she will have to forget about pursuing her 
education or work longer before being able to register.
<P>
	Chances are also that Mrs. Dumas will have to pay out of her 
pension benefits a portion of the cost of her medication, because 
that too is what the Canada social transfer is about.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Should she need to be hospitalized, or to have a nurse come from 
the local community service centre, at this point, it is hard to know 
the impact, since the Quebec government has not yet announced 
where it will make cuts, but some cuts will definitely be made. The 
government is no different than a family. If its revenues go down, 
so must its spending. This is why the Bloc Quebecois so strongly 
condemned federal cuts in transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	What would the grandmother, Mrs. Dumas, Martine, Mrs. 
Lemay or Mr. Dumas do if they were asked to choose between 
these new constraints imposed on them and a increased tax on 
profits made by banks? Considering that, for the first quarter alone 
of the current fiscal year, the five major Canadian banks made 
profits of $1.47 billion, and considering that if the trend persists, 
these banks will exceed their record profits of $4.9 billion in 1995, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="844"> 844 </A></B>
<P>
do these people wonder, like us,  whether the banks could 
contribute a little more to the effort to put our fiscal house in order?
<P>
	Do the members of that family approve of the federal 
government tolerating such huge profits, while forcing the 
provinces to cut programs such as education, health and social 
assistance? No, they do not approve. I am convinced that they do 
not approve, and neither does the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Let us now talk about old age pensions. Mrs. Dumas does not 
have to worry about her pension, since she is already receiving it. 
She does, however, and deservedly so, worry about her son and her 
daughter-in-law's future. She realizes that the federal government 
is doing a great injustice, particularly to her daughter-in-law. 
Indeed, Mrs. Lemay, who contributed to the plan for years when 
she was working, and who will continue to do so as soon as she 
finds another job, could see her pension affected, since it will be 
based on her income combined with that of her spouse.
<P>
	Years of efforts to ensure that women would gain financial 
autonomy have been annihilated by this new measure. There is a 
strong possibility that Mrs. Lemay will get less than she would 
have under the old system.
<P>
	Moreover, Mrs. Dumas realizes that her son's family is far from 
being rich and that its members had to give up small luxuries. She 
also finds it unfair that they are forced to contribute to a pension 
fund, which reduces their disposable income, without knowing 
whether they will be able to benefit from it later on.
<P>
	Now let us take a brief look at student employment programs. 
Our student Martine is worried. She has heard about an increase in 
federal budgets for student jobs. However, one of her friends has 
explained to her that the money would go directly to employers 
hiring students.
<P>
	Martine is well aware that her employer has no trouble finding 
employees and that he does not need any more bureaucratic red 
tape. She tells herself that it must be the same in most places and 
that she therefore stands very little chance of finding another, better 
paying job to cover the probable increase in tuition fees.
<P>
	Mrs. Lemay is also worried about unemployment insurance 
reform. She has heard talk about demonstrations to protest the 
reform and has gone to her union for information. They have told 
her that she would indeed be penalized.
<P>
	Mrs. Lemay and her husband had agreed that she would look 
after the children full time until both were in high school. This has 
meant that Mrs. Lemay has fallen considerably behind in her field 
and been unable to find a full time job. She wonders why the 
federal government is not proposing any measures that would 
create jobs. All she wants is a job, and she will take care of the rest. 
Jobs are not a dime a dozen and I do not think that there are any job 
creation measures in the budget.
<P>
	There are 21,500 families like this one in my riding. There are 
16,000 senior citizens. There are also 6,000 people currently 
unemployed. When you explain to these families and these 
individuals why the Martin budget is not as nice as it seems, they 
are of the opinion that the government has definitely not done its 
homework. They think that we should call this government to order 
and propose alternative measures. People will see through this 
budget. They know that it does not create jobs and that it is not fair 
to Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
intently to the hon. member's speech.
<P>
	I hear a lot of members talk about deficits and debts in this 
venue. The reality is deficits represent unpaid taxes. It is not a 
simple matter of saying we will reduce spending today or that we 
will increase taxes. The bottom line is we have not paid all of our 
taxes from prior years.
<P>
	In reality a lot of that spending occurred within the province of 
Quebec. It is no different than other parts of the country. There are 
bills which we have not paid. That is what deficits are all about.
<P>
	It is not a simple matter of comparing the reduction in spending 
on certain programs today; we have to look at the reality of the 
past.
<P>
	I was interested in the hon. member's discussion of the Dumas 
family. She did not mention a number of issues which would have 
had an impact on that family: possibly child tax credits, which have 
been increased, and that we have increased the cash flow to that 
family. That we are fighting the deficit as judiciously as we are has 
reduced interest rates significantly.
<P>
	The Dumas family, I suspect, also has a mortgage on its house. 
The next time it remortgages its house it will find out its monthly 
payments have been reduced and its cash flow has been improved.
<P>
	The summer youth employment program is not only private 
sector employers, it is governments as well. It is the municipalities 
and the not for profit sectors which exist within the province. That 
adds a benefit to the community by employing youth and also adds 
a benefit to the communities in which they serve.
<P>
	These are other areas in which the federal government has 
created a linkage with youth in giving them experience which they 
can put on their resume when seeking future employment.
<P>
	The facts are clear that in the last two and a half years the 
economy has created over 600,000 new jobs, many of which are in 
the province of Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="845"> 845 </A></B>
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would like to address some of the 
real impacts the budget has had which will make the Dumas 
family a lot better off than it was a year ago.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon: </B>Mr. Speaker, now I have heard everything in this 
House. When it is said that the deficit is due to unpaid taxes, this is 
not showing responsibility. It is irresponsible. Come on, now. Does 
that mean that the taxpayers have not paid enough taxes? What 
does that mean? What lies behind those words? I think that the 
government was unable to raise taxes this year because it knows 
very well that taxpayers have been taxed as much as they can bear. 
There have been no additional taxes, so I think the hon. member's 
remarks are not very realistic.
<P>
	When a member speaks of giving funding to enable students to 
find jobs, the funding goes to businesses and the latter are the ones 
who are going to profit. There is one thing that I would like to say: 
behind all this, the budget is two faced. Let me tell you what cuts 
students have had to face. There was a $26 million cut in summer 
employment programs two years ago. Funding was reduced to $60 
million and now that is being doubled to $120 million, but still $26 
million were cut. There are cuts to the provinces for health, 
education, social assistance, to the tune of $4 billion. So who are 
the fall guys? The students, because the provinces will be obliged 
to make cuts in educational programs. They are making the worst 
cuts ever in 1996-97, $150 million at the post-secondary level. 
With such cuts, I do not think the results will be all that fabulous. It 
is kind of cynical, to help students so that they may shoulder a 
greater burden.
<P>
	To my mind, these are inefficient and ineffective measures. 
Students, moreover, do not seem to be all that grateful for the 
pittance contributed to allow them to find summer jobs. And not all 
students will be the chosen ones who will find jobs. We know very 
well that it is a very competitive atmosphere and that businesses 
will take the cream of the crop. Students are not all that thrilled 
with this pittance. Because funding to education is being cut, their 
tuition fees will end up being raised.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
the opportunity to enter the budget debate and I congratulate the 
minister for the progress he has made in getting the deficit under 
control.
<P>
	I support the approach of the minister in setting short term 
targets and meeting them with a gradual, well executed plan. It is 
clear that the approach has increased confidence in the economy.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada, the unemployment rate decreased from 
December 1994 to December 1995 from 14.1 per  cent to 12.3 per 
cent. Domestic exports from January to October 1995 over the 
same period in 1994 have increased by 18.8 per cent. 
Manufacturing shipments have increased by 11.6 per cent.
<P>
	In P.E.I., tourist data show that total visitor spending increased 
from $121.5 million in 1993 to $177.9 million in 1995. That is a 
clear indication of a healthier economy because most of the visitor 
spending statistics show the spending came from Canadian visitors 
in the main.
<P>
	No doubt that is due to the better economy brought on by the 
successive budgets of the Minister of Finance. People want to come 
to see the beauty and the wonderful hospitality of Prince Edward 
Island. I encourage members in the House to come and see for 
themselves. Because of the improving economy and because we 
have a provincial Liberal government in Prince Edward Island, that 
province last week announced its second surplus budget. Certainly 
the Minister of Finance in Prince Edward Island should be 
congratulated for his performance.
<P>
	Quite a number of my colleagues have talked about major 
advancements in the budget to address the needs of people. 
Measures are targeted at youth employment. We certainly welcome 
that endeavour. The increase in the working income supplement is 
a major move forward which I support, as I do securing seniors' 
pensions into the future.
<P>
	In all our budget measures, finding the balance is always 
difficult. Since I came to this place, I have tended to lay out the 
facts, the good and the difficult. I intend to do so again today.
<P>
	We must recognize the impact the federal budget will have on 
rural Canada and the economic activity on which rural 
communities are based, especially when the budget is combined 
with previous budgets.
<P>
	We have to be cautious when looking at investing in the new 
technologies. It is the natural resource industries: agriculture, 
fishing, mining and forestry that have been the mainstay of the 
country over the years and will continue to be the mainstay into the 
future. In our quest to expand into the new service and technology 
areas, we should not draw too far from those basic natural resource 
areas that have built this country to what it is today.
<P>
	This is my key point today. The government must recognize the 
necessity to continue to pursue its initiatives of deficit and debt 
reduction but with a key proviso that if the initiatives currently 
under way begin to have a negative impact specifically on the 
economic well-being of rural Canada, the federal government will 
be prepared to respond quickly, adjusting those policies should 
they have a negative impact.
<P>
	I ask specifically that the government monitor the impact on 
rural Canada and be prepared to address negative impacts should 
they occur. Rural Canada has done more than its fair share in 
meeting our deficit  needs. These have included transport policy 
changes, cost recovery and marine policy, cost recovery in 
Agriculture Canada, reduction of subsidy programs in the farm 
community. In the main and from what I hear from rural 
Canadians, they are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="846"> 846 </A></B>
<P>
willing to accept the new responsibilities and shoulder on. But 
should the burden become excessive, I expect the government to be 
there to back them up.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I view the throne speech in part as being that kind of 
commitment. The throne speech said in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Government is committed to the economic renewal of rural Canada. The 
Government will address the problems facing rural Canadians in a way that is 
tailored to their needs. Rural Canada is rich in natural and human resources and 
faces different challenges than urban areas. The Government will move forward 
in the coming session to make sure that all Canadians benefit from economic 
prosperity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let me take a moment to outline one of the areas that is the 
foundation of wealth in the country, the agriculture sector. 
Agriculture accounts for 8 per cent of Canada's gross domestic 
product. It accounts for 15 per cent of Canada's total employment, 
1.8 million jobs. In 1995 agriculture products accounted for $17.3 
billion of exports, a 30 per cent increase over two years.
<P>
	As I have already mentioned, we have to be careful not to 
undermine the goose that laid the golden egg, the agriculture 
sector. Over the past couple of years it has absorbed some hits and 
has lost programs.
<P>
	I do not mind admitting that I am a little worried about the new 
and increasing use of user fees throughout the agriculture and 
supporting sectors that add to costs. In fact, in agriculture and 
agri-food alone we could face, I believe, 42 such user fees. One in 
and of itself is not a problem but the domino or multiplier effect 
could be serious and we need to monitor it to ensure that does not 
happen.
<P>
	Another point I would like to make about user fees is that not 
only does the government have to monitor and control its deficit, it 
also has to keep in mind that other trading countries, our 
competitors, do the same thing and cut back on their subsidy 
programs and increase the costs to their agriculture sector. We do 
not want to find ourselves in a position of undermining the 
competitiveness of our producing sector in our gusto for deficit 
reduction.
<P>
	There are all kinds of examples where the government, differing 
from previous governments, has responded to unexpected and 
serious happenings. For example, the recommendations with 
respect to the feed freight assistance has enabled the federal 
government to change the timeframe within which compensation is 
to be provided from the initial 10 to 3 years. That was a change 
recognizing the concerns of farmers.
<P>
	The effort to sell the government owned hopper cars to the 
railways at a discount of 75 per cent of market value with farmers 
picking up the remaining 25 per cent through increased freight 
charges has been delayed, allowing a producer based coalition to 
come forward with an alternative financing arrangement in which 
maybe producers could take control of those cars. Those are good, 
positive moves.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Atlantic region in particular has long faced 
unique challenges in its economic development. One key role the 
federal government has performed is to assist those provinces and 
the region through the sharing of national resources and wealth. 
This has been the hallmark of the Canadian federation.
<P>
	It will be important that where financial transfers are being 
reduced over the next number of years that the federal government 
ensure that essential services are maintained. Should there be 
problems those changes should be monitored and the government 
be prepared to meet the challenges to assist the producers and the 
communities should they find themselves in unexpected need.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again 
they are skirting the real problems and avoiding the main issues, 
such as the ever growing debt and the deficit, which is being 
reduced on the backs of the disadvantaged and the unemployed, 
with the surplus in the unemployment fund going to reduce the 
deficit.
<P>
	They also forget to tell us that the budget contains no provision 
for trimming government machinery. They neglect to tell us that 
there is nothing to eliminate overlap or to show us how the 
government intends to really decentralize. There is no mention 
either of this government taking steps to recover the $6 billion in 
taxes owed by various companies and individuals.
<P>
	They also do not say that what is currently being put into the pot 
allegedly for job creation is simply money from elsewhere. There 
is nothing in the budget for research and development or for job 
creation in this area. Our universities and our researchers are 
reduced to zero at this point.
<P>
	Therefore, in actual fact, the problem itself, the real problem, is 
that this budget contains no provision for job creation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am surprised at the remarks by the 
hon. member. It makes one wonder if he has even read the budget.
<P>
	The facts are that we have been moving forward in step while 
reducing the deficit. We have not been reducing the deficit on the 
backs of people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="847"> 847 </A></B>
<P>
	It is very important that there is a surplus in the UI fund. The 
last thing we want is what previous governments have done and 
not build up a surplus in the EI fund. When you are in a recession 
you have to increase premiums in order to cover the 
unemployment insurance benefit payments and as a result you 
start to kill the economy. It is very important to build up a surplus 
in the EI fund.
<P>
	The hon. member says the government is not creating jobs. The 
most tremendous potential of the country is its youth. The budget 
has set aside funding for increased summer employment of youth. 
It looks at measures for training. It looks at new technologies. It 
sets up a new agency to try to increase spending in those areas 
where youth will be gaining jobs in the future. It is trying to build 
on that potential so that Canada has a sound economy in the future. 
I would suggest that the member re-read the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I always enjoy hearing the hon. member for Malpeque 
stand up for farmers. Is he one of those taxpayers that has not paid 
his share of taxes in the past so that we have this huge debt and 
deficit.
<P>
	The hon. member is fighting for the livestock producers getting 
better feed freight assistance programs. Does he feel it is fair that 
livestock producers in western Canada get absolutely nothing out 
of the WGTA payout because they are suffering just as his livestock 
producers are?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, that was quite a long winded question.
<P>
	We are trying to find a better balance in the budget by having a 
fairer taxation policy and that shows throughout the budget papers.
<P>
	I always enjoy the member's questions concerning the 
agricultural area. As I mentioned, because of concerns the member 
and some of his constituents raised, we have moved to address the 
concerns of the Crow benefit payout. We moved up the time frame 
it would be paid out so that producers would have the capital up 
front to do what they have always wanted to do in western Canada: 
get into a more diversified economy.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	The bill also increases the ability of the livestock sector and 
makes it more competitive because there is cheaper grain as a 
result of the transportation changes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to have an opportunity to speak 
to the government's most recent budget which has established the 
right combination of measures to help move the country forward.
<P>
	The budget deals with the Canadian deficit, as it needs to do. It 
deals with the issue of jobs, which is also a priority today. It also 
deals with the least advantaged in Canadian society and the 
obligation and need of government to help those people.
<P>
	It does it in a way that understands government has two 
responsibilities. The first one is a fiscal responsibility. As a 
government we have a need to ensure that the expenditures we 
undertake are prudent, that we get value for every dollar we spend, 
and that we make sure Canadian taxpayers are getting full value for 
the money they are paying into the federal government.
<P>
	Our responsibility as a government goes far beyond fiscal 
responsibility. It is more than just a matter of maintaining the 
books. It is more than just a matter of a balance sheet or an income 
statement. As a government we also have a social responsibility. 
We have a responsibility as a government to individual Canadians.
<P>
	For the last 50 years we have historically agreed that we will not 
allow Canadians to fall below a certain level. As Canadians we 
collectively agree that when an individual goes to a hospital the 
first question asked should be what is wrong and not how much 
money does he have. We also agree to ensure that people have 
shelter and will not starve. We must have a social safety net, and 
government has that responsibility.
<P>
	When we look at the budget it is important to recognize that we 
have achieved our mandate or our objective of fulfilling both those 
responsibilities.
<P>
	I will talk a bit about fiscal responsibility. The government has 
done a good job in the three budgets it has brought forward in 
dealing with the Canadian deficit. During the campaign we 
promised to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP and we will be 
achieving that. Beyond that we have set a new objective of 2 per 
cent of GDP.
<P>
	It is difficult to get one's mind around percentages. It is even 
better to look at some numbers. When the two-year planning phase 
announced by the minister in his recent budget is completed, the 
deficit in Canada will have been reduced by $25 billion. No 
government in the country has done a better job in reducing 
expenditures or in deficit reduction than we have done as a federal 
government.
<P>
	Even more important in terms of fiscal responsibility, our 
borrowing as a nation and as a federal government in the upcoming 
year will be reduced to $13 billion and in the year following to only 
$6 billion. That is the best record in the country in 30 years and the 
best among the G-7 as a percentage of GDP. We are doing a good 
job in ensuring the borrowings of the federal government are being 
reduced dramatically.
<P>
	We have gone from program spending being about 16 per cent of 
our gross domestic product to where it will be reduced by about 12 
per cent when this budgetary cycle is completed. That also 
represents significant progress. It is the best we have done in the 
nation since the second world war.

<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	There are things far beyond deficit control that governments 
need to deal with. One important objective is the need to create 
jobs. As a government we are doing a good job in that regard. We 
are ensuring that an environment exists within the country which 
allows jobs to be created. We are doing it in part because we are 
getting the economic fundamentals right.
<P>
	Inflation in the country is at the lowest sustained level it has been 
in 30 years. That is a strong economic fundamental. Interest rates 
in the country have dropped by three points in the last year, another 
strong fundamental.
<P>
	As I mentioned a moment ago, government's borrowings are 
being substantially reduced. This means the private sector is not 
being crowded out of the capital market and is being allowed 
investment opportunities to create jobs. We are getting the 
fundamentals rights. We are allowing for an environment to be 
created in the country in which job creation can occur.
<P>
	As many of my colleagues have pointed out today during the 
debate, job creation has been occurring in the country. In the last 
three months Statistics Canada has reported almost 125,000 to 
130,000 new jobs or in excess of 600,000 new jobs since the 
government came to office.
<P>
	Despite getting the fundamentals right, which is important and 
represents real progress, our government also understands the 
necessity for government to target specific areas in which to do 
specific work. That is why we see new initiatives announced in the 
budget which deal with youth unemployment. Our government 
realizes this is a particular area of concern and we are acting in that 
respect.
<P>
	The government also understands that there are areas where we 
can have the most impact on job creation. We have seen some 
initiatives undertaken by the government which will help see that 
happen. The establishment by Industry Canada of a technology 
fund that will start off at $150 million and grow to $250 million is 
important. It is a growth area of the economy where jobs can occur 
and we need to support it.
<P>
	We are a country of exporters. We need to have more small 
businesses involved in it. Much of our exporting is done by the 
largest corporations. We need to move that down the scale so that 
our small businesses are taking part in export development. I was 
pleased to see our investment of another $50 million in the Export 
Development Corporation.
<P>
	On the high tech side $50 million has been invested in the 
Business Development Bank of Canada so that it will be able to 
provide the necessary capital to firms dealing in the high tech 
sector. This is an example of the government understanding that in 
addition to the fundamentals we have done a good job in getting 
right  there is a need for us to operate in specific sectors to help 
stimulate job creation.
<P>
	The third area I mentioned when I started my speech was the 
need to help the least advantaged in society. There is a need. 
Whether it is helping the least advantaged areas in society 
geographically-and we do that through our transfer program, our 
equalization payments-or whether it is that we have increased the 
child tax benefits for 700,000 low income families, we understand 
the need to help the least advantaged in society.
<P>
	In summary, the government understands that the way to deal 
with the Canadian economy, the way to create a budget and present 
a budget, is to have an approach that takes in several components 
and not to fixate on one simple part of it. That is why we have dealt 
with the deficit. That is why we have dealt with jobs. That is why 
we have dealt with helping the least advantaged in society.
<P>
	I close by reiterating that the government understands it has a 
dual responsibility in governing the nation. It understands fiscal 
responsibility but it also understands it has a social responsibility 
to individual Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I will 
make a comment and then I will ask a question. The hon. member 
who just made his speech took an awful lot of credit for the recent 
statistics he quoted on how much the interest rates have gone down, 
on how employment is higher and on recent changes as if the 
government caused all of them and should take credit for them.
<P>
	I am glad he is taking the credit. When the economic 
fundamentals change, when interest rates go up as they will and as 
they are already starting to do, when unemployment does not get 
solved by cash injections from governments, and when the Liberals 
get tired of trying to blame the private sector for the jobs they 
promised to create but cannot create, I wonder whom he will 
blame.
<P>
	The member said that the government has the fundamentals 
right. A few members over there have accounting and tax 
backgrounds. I wish they had a little more influence over the 
finance minister. They stand to tell Canadians that the back of the 
deficit has been broken and that the balance sheet of the nation is in 
order. They are distorting some facts to a degree that the elastic 
band will almost snap.
<P>
	Does he understand the difference between a government 
coming in with a huge debt and adding $112 billion to the debt 
when exiting? Is that getting it right? Does he understand leaving a 
$17 billion deficit and committing the country to spending more 
than what it brings in as it did when it first started? Does he 
understand 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="849"> 849 </A></B>
<P>
when a government has a balanced budget  over its mandate? Does 
he understand the difference between what this party represents in 
terms of a balanced budget and what the government side 
represents in its continued support of deficit spending?
<P>
	The difference is the size of the debt and how much the 
government adds to the debt. According to the finance minister's 
own numbers, the government will have added close to $113 billion 
to the debt when it leaves. With our numbers it would have been 
half of that; it would have been $60 billion. The difference is $61 
billion. The interest cost to service that additional debt is what it is 
all about. Those are the fundamentals. Does the member 
understand that difference in the fundamentals?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer both the 
observation of the member and his question.
<P>
	As to his observation, I have no doubt that if the fundamentals 
were not right he would be very critical of the government. When 
the fundamentals are right because of positive government action I 
will say so. Our government has done a good job. It has made good 
progress in making the fundamentals right.
<P>
	As to adding to the debt, I am glad the member admitted in his 
presentation that his party would have added $61 billion to the 
debt.
<P>
	I will go back to my career in the financial services industry 
before I took this job to give an analogy of what we are talking 
about. Most of us have found ourselves in a position where we may 
have overspent. We may have bought a house that was a little too 
big or had a mortgage that was a little higher than it should be. 
Perhaps we bought a vehicle on the spur of the moment because of 
its accessories, making the debt for our car a little higher. Perhaps 
we ran the plastic up on the last trip or whatever and we find 
ourselves owing more than we should.
<P>
	As somebody who dealt with consumer loans I often had 
individuals come to me who had found themselves in that situation. 
Our country is essentially in the situation today where we find that 
we have overspent and we have a large debt. If we took the 
philosophy of the third party in our dealings with such individuals, 
we could simply say that is too bad, that they have to pay back all 
the debt in one year and the fact they will not have enough money 
to feed their families or clothe their children is irrelevant.
<P>
	Or, we could do what is generally done in the industry. We could 
arrange a debt consolidation loan where the need to eliminate that 
debt is recognized and the fact that while it is being eliminated food 
for the family and clothes for the children have to be provided. 
Therefore we would arrange for the payments to be over a 
reasonable period of time.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	In my speech I pointed out that we take a balanced approach as a 
government. However, here we have a  party fixated on one aspect 
of our responsibility. It does not recognize the social responsibility 
which the government has to Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the finance 
minister's budget seeks essentially to reduce the deficit and 
succeeds in doing so through a series of measures with which I 
disagree. I will express this disagreement to my colleague, who 
may respond.
<P>
	First of all, operating expenditures are being cut. But, for every 
$1 reduction in operating expenditures, one dollar will be cut from 
transfer payments to the provinces and another one taken from the 
UI fund. This is a strange combination. This combination requires 
employers and employees to pay a special tax amounting to almost 
30 per cent of their UI contributions to help reduce the deficit.
<P>
	By cutting transfers to the provinces the federal government has 
decided that it is in a better position to spend this money than the 
provinces themselves. Finally, when it cuts its operating 
expenditures by only one dollar, that is to say, by another third, it is 
not listening to the auditor general, who said among other things 
last year that the defence budget could be cut by as much as $1 
billion without any noticeable effects because it was sheer waste. 
Well, only $600 million was cut, which leaves $400 million. 
Meanwhile, students are being penalized as transfer payments for 
post-secondary education have been cut by $150 million. And, to 
top it all, because the government has set aside $600 million to 
create summer jobs, it is expecting students to be grateful. These 
are the facts. This is what it says in the budget. I totally disagree 
and await the explanations of my colleague across the way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the budget we will ensure that all 
parts of society according to their needs will contribute to reducing 
the deficit and no one part of the country or no one part of society 
will be totally spared.
<P>
	I disagree with his figures. Our expenditure cuts will amount to 
19 per cent of government programming. It is less than half of that 
amount in terms of transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	In terms of building up a surplus in the UI fund, the hon. member 
opposite would be the first person to criticize the government 
during a recession if it were required to increase UI rates. Members 
opposite would be yelling at us that we were increasing UI rates 
during a recession at a time when we should not be taking money 
out of the hands of workers and the businesses which create jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="850"> 850 </A></B>
<P>
	Having a UI surplus during periods of economic growth makes 
eminent good sense so that we do not have  to take money out of the 
economy during a recessionary period. It makes good economic 
sense. It should have been done by previous governments. This 
government is doing it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to debate this, the third attempt by the 
federal Minister of Finance and his lackluster government to get it 
right.
<P>
	It is my duty to report, and I regret to inform the government, 
that it still did not get it right. For the 27th year in a row federal 
revenues and expenditures are not balanced.
<P>
	The weariness of the debt and the hopeless treadmill of lack of 
resolve by the government continue. It is a sad commentary that 
debt continues to grow and accumulate, which over the 
government's term will add more than $112 billion to the debt load.
<P>
	It is a sad commentary. This government generated debt will 
place the average Canadian in a position of financial hopelessness, 
unable to get ahead and forced to survive with a current personal 
debt load equivalent to 95 per cent of their annual personal 
disposable income. In 1982 that number was 62 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	With no tax relief in the foreseeable future, the Minister of 
Finance counters by saying there are no tax increases. How does he 
explain why gasoline taxes jumped half a cent per litre in Ottawa 
less than a week after his budget theatrics on Wednesday? What 
does he have to say to shell shocked taxpayers who last week faced 
one-half to three-quarter per cent increased rates for mortgages?
<P>
	The minister knows full well that for every 1 per cent increase in 
these rates, 100,000 perspective first home buyers are removed 
from the list of potential purchasers. So much for the new tax. The 
cost of living takes care of all of that.
<P>
	Two of the constraints in life are death and taxes. They are 
inevitable and therefore we suffer in quiet desperation and 
resignation. One of the elements of this cliche that makes life on 
this treadmill bearable is the mistaken belief that all Canadians will 
share equally in this tax burden; the element of fairness. More and 
more Canadians are catching on to the cruel myth, and it would be 
remiss of me not to further dispel the hoax of equity.
<P>
	Allow me to focus my comments for a moment on departmental 
spending, specifically the department of Indian affairs, otherwise 
known as the money vacuum. Let us start at the beginning.
<P>
	In 1976-76 total departmental spending for the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development was $587 million. Today 
that number is $4.2 billion for about 573,000 status Indians, those  
registered under the Indian Act, about 2 per cent of Canada's 
population.
<P>
	The sadness in this profligate sinkhole of spending is the 
continued misery and sense of hopelessness wherein so many of 
our native people continue to live. Despite the spending restraint 
placed on all other government departments, the department of 
Indian affairs spending to 1998-99 will grow a cumulative 12.7 per 
cent compared with a decline of 24.4 per cent in other departments.
<P>
	This will be the only federal department in which spending in 
1998-99 will be higher than in 1994-95. It is a history of misguided 
priorities where the current minister feels that maintaining this 
native dependency on the federal treasury will deliver these people 
to self-sufficiency, dignity and a stable future. It is a denial and a 
cruel manipulation of these people that is demeaning and 
paternalistic; keeping his charge in poverty paralysis, fed and warm 
but never to let them break the surly bonds of welfare and 
dependency unless they are the elites at the minister's trough.
<P>
	Furthermore, it is a cruel, unfair hoax on the Canadian taxpayer 
because despite all the federal largesse and misguided paternalism, 
those status Indians who live on reserves do not pay income, 
property or sales taxes on purchases delivered to the reserves.
<P>
	Section 87 is surely an outdated, out of step section of the Indian 
Act which protects and maintains this counterproductive 
exemption. Total government spending for Indians for all 
departments runs $7 billion, excluding the taxation exemption or 
foregone revenue.
<P>
	If this is working, why are 43 per cent of on reserve natives on 
welfare? There are certainly some people getting bloated on the 
morass of spending. One place is the Hull bunker of DIAND which 
houses 3,400 of these bureaucrats.
<P>
	Accompanying these public servants are consultants, 
negotiators, lawyers and advisors, all taking a piece of the $7 
billion in action and keeping the myth and their club memberships 
alive. It is an Indian industry that has made some cling-ons very 
rich.
<P>
	I have in my possession billings to an Indian band by one Ottawa 
lawyer of $300,000 per year for the client, a band of 250 adults, the 
majority of whom live in poverty, fear, violence and abuse. This is 
the $7 billion legacy. It is a system rife with avarice where a federal 
royal commission on aboriginal people, instituted in 1991 and 
originally budgeted for $20 million, is now highjacked by the 
politically predictable Indian industry. The commission is well 
overdue and running a tab currently of $60 million, the most 
expensive royal commission ever done. It has employed seven 
commissioners, 150 staffers and more than 500 consultants.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="851"> 851 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	One of the commission's interim reports dealt with 
extinguishment. The minister was not content with the results of 
this $60 million enterprise and so he commissioned another 
independent fact finder to hold 65 sessions across the country at a 
cost of $500,000. Money for these kinds of exercises is no object 
for this minister. This keeps the $7 billion budget intact and makes 
some lawyers and some consultants very wealthy.
<P>
	When you raise the issue of native taxation, as I did on March 11 
in the House, you do so at your peril from an overly sensitive 
minister who resorts to bluster rather than explanation. When you 
have misled Canadians on the issue of taxation surrounding the 
Nisga'a settlement I guess bluster is the only way out of this 
misrepresentation of facts.
<P>
	Anyone reading the Nisga'a agreement can come to only one 
inescapable conclusion: the Nisga'a will have constitutionally 
entrenched tax exemption.
<P>
	I have painted a bleak picture. There are some ways out of this 
mess. A good place to start can be found in the Reform Party 
aboriginal policy document. Look for the word accountability. Our 
policy report calls for the auditor general to have full authority to 
review Indian management of federal funds. Legal proceedings can 
be recommended at the auditor general's discretion when he or she 
feels there is a problem.
<P>
	We also call for the chief electoral officer of Elections Canada to 
have full authority to examine Indian election procedures. For too 
long many band councils have maintained a top down repressive 
regime. The band council system makes the chief and council more 
responsible to the minister and the department than it does to their 
very own membership. On every occasion I have been involved 
where an individual has appealed to the department, the department 
has supported the chief and council rather than the individual.
<P>
	On this issue how can we ever expect any kind of accountability 
when spending on aboriginal affairs is diffused among 11 federal 
departments? It is an accountability nightmare surely meant to 
obfuscate and confuse-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The time has expired. Comments or questions.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to add some comments and observations for Canadians 
following this debate on the latest federal budget.
<P>
	I think the question Canadians are asking and to which they are 
getting a variety of answers is whether this a good budget for 
Canada. Some people say yes, some people say no.
<P>
	I would like to address that question and give some observations 
I hope will be of some assistance as we  evaluate, as Canadians, 
whether this is the way we want our finances managed. The budget 
was summed up in a newspaper headline that I read the day after its 
presentation. It read: ``Canadians left sitting on a ticking time 
bomb''. The time bomb is the debt. Canadians owe a mortgage on 
the country of over $600 billion.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Most of us do not compute in terms of billions of dollars. It 
would be helpful if we talked a bit about how much $1 billion is. 
Canadians might want to be aware that $1 billion is so big that if 
one spent $1,000 every day since the birth of Christ one would not 
yet have spent $1 billion.
<P>
	If you made $1 per second, Mr. Speaker-and I know some 
people think you do but I know it is not so-you would be a 
millionaire in just 11 days and it would take 33 years to become a 
billionaire.
<P>
	A billion dollars is a great deal of money. Yet the government 
has borrowed or put us in the hole for another hundred billion 
dollars in the very short time it has been in charge of our fiscal 
affairs, a hundred billion dollars that we have to pay interest on 
every year, a hundred billion dollars that we will have to pay back 
some day, a hundred billion dollars added to the mortgage on the 
future of our children and our grandchildren. In my mind it is a 
very big burden for Canadians to be saddled with.
<P>
	The government likes to talk about having cut the amount of 
money it has been borrowing. Yet it is interesting to note that its 
total spending has been cut a minuscule 1.8 per cent over the time 
of its stewardship.
<P>
	The interest we have to pay on our debt has risen considerably 
from $38 billion when the government took office to a forecasted 
$48 billion next year. That is another $10 billion that we have to 
pay to our lenders. It is $10 billion that we cannot put into an ailing 
health care system. It is $10 billion that we cannot use to educate 
our young people so that we can be internationally competitive. It 
is $10 billion that we have to take away from job creators. It is $10 
billion more that we have to pay, pull out of our jeans, than we did 
before to service the country's staggering debt. We have one of the 
highest debt to production ratios in the industrialized world.
<P>
	What does that mean? The simple reality is that we will need not 
less but more money for services in coming years. In 20 years time 
people like me, baby boomers of whom there are a great number, 
will be retiring. They will be demanding the pensions they have 
been promised and have been paying into. They will be demanding 
and needing extra health care and other senior services. The 
demand for these things will increase dramatically within the next 
20 years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="852"> 852 </A></B>
<P>
	The only way to prepare for it is to run surpluses now and 
reduce the debt as quickly as possible so that the government has 
the flexibility to meet the needs of the future crowd of seniors 
who will soon be retiring. This is not happening. In fact our debt 
load is increasing by $24 billion of the billions of dollars I was 
talking about earlier. It is a lot of money to borrow, to go in the 
hole in one short year.
<P>
	The younger generations will be saddled with an unprecedented 
burden. Not only will they have to pay for health care programs, 
putting something away for retirement, educating their children, 
helping those who are disadvantaged and needy and supporting the 
activities of government. They will also have to pay a staggering 
amount of money every year on the billions of dollars the 
government has so cavalierly borrowed and spent, the $24 billion 
this year. The finance minister is borrowing and spending about 
what we take in and the younger generations will be saddled with 
that.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	A paper released earlier this month by the Institute for Research 
on Public Policy in Montreal showed that under the fiscal policy of 
the finance minister a baby born today will pay $131,000 more in 
taxes than he receives in benefits from the government over his 
lifetime.
<P>
	For the first time the government made no prediction in the 
budget about the unemployment rate. One is led to conclude the 
government must feel pretty negative about the job situation to 
have had to take job projection numbers out of its budget.
<P>
	Much has been made of the fact there are no tax rate increases in 
the budget although the government will take in more tax money 
this year than it did last year. One citizen observed: ``I cannot pay 
the taxes I have already paid so no new taxes does not mean much 
to me. I need a job''.
<P>
	High taxes and payments to lenders as a result of the wild 
borrowing that has taken place over the last 30 years are doing two 
things to the economy. First it is destroying job opportunities. 
When job creators have to pay a large amount of their incomes to 
government they are unable to use the money to create jobs, to 
expand their businesses and to take advantage of export 
opportunities. High taxes and payments to lenders are also eroding 
our social services. We see evidence of that every day. We also see 
evidence of the concerns of citizens in that regard.
<P>
	In the last two and a half years the Liberal government has 
increased the tax take from Canadians by $8.8 billion. 
Notwithstanding this enormous tax increase a balanced budget is 
still nowhere in sight.
<P>
	On one hand the finance minister expects Canadians to take 
more personal action to plan and save for their retirement. On the 
other hand he makes taking such  action more and more costly for 
Canadians. They can now only hold RRSP moneys until age 69 and 
RRSP management fees can no longer be deducted.
<P>
	The finance minister has continued to freeze the contribution 
limit on RRSPs to $13,500 a year even though it was promised to 
be raised in 1995 to a level that would allow a reasonable rate of 
retirement income. Worst of all, there is no target or plan to get to a 
surplus position which would allow tax reductions, a systematic 
debt pay down and flexibility in our important social programs.
<P>
	We have some real concerns about the budget. I would answer 
the question on whether the budget is good for Canadians with a 
resounding no. I urge the government to set realistic targets as 
quickly as possible to eliminate the deficit, to quit borrowing 
money, to quit spending more than we take in, to get to a surplus 
position, and to protect the social programs that we need and the 
economic future of the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I found 
the member's comments very interesting and noted them. I have 
been talking with people in my riding of Halifax East since the 
budget was presented and the comments I have been hearing about 
it have been very positive.
<P>
	People seem to be very pleased about many aspects of the budget 
including the measures which deal with child poverty, in particular 
the working income supplements increase over the next three years 
from $500 to $1,000 a year. It will help low income working 
families take care of their children. It is a very important measure.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	I found it interesting that members suggest we need to run a 
surplus. I understand the idea; it would be nice if we could run 
surpluses overnight and cut the deficit to zero and beyond right 
away. However that does not take into account the economic reality 
of our country or the impact that would have on individual people 
across the country.
<P>
	To say we will do that without, as the Reform Party promised, 
bringing forth its own version of what it will do and how it will 
achieve those goals seems irresponsible.
<P>
	Why is it that the Reform Party did not, as promised, bring 
forward its own proposed budget this year before the budget was 
brought down to say what it would do? What would that party cut? 
It is saying that it would cut far more than the government has cut 
so far, that far more would be required to be cut from the federal 
budget to reach a surplus.
<P>
	What fees would the Reform party increase? What programs 
would it cut far more than has been cut already? Would it cut health 
care? Would it increase the cuts in transfers to the provinces? What 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="853"> 853 </A></B>
<P>
other areas  would it cut? It is not telling us about those things 
which are so important to know and I look forward to hearing.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure why the hon. 
member is begging for a budget from the Reform Party since he 
obviously has not read the first one.
<P>
	The taxpayers' budget we placed before the Liberals for their 
consideration would have cut health, post-secondary education and 
welfare by $3.5 billion and in three years that would have put us in 
a surplus position.
<P>
	What have the Liberals done? Have they cut $3.5 billion from 
health, post-secondary education and welfare? Yes, they have cut 
$3.5 billion from those areas. In fact they have cut $6.3 billion 
from those areas and we are still not in a surplus position.
<P>
	I urge the hon. member to look at the budget we put forward. 
With far less draconian measures we would at least get some 
results, which is more than we can say for the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, very 
simply the issue of RRSPs is a very good example of the difference 
between the thinking of the Reform Party and the thinking of the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about increases in taxes as a result of 
changes such as reducing the age at which one can make a 
contribution from 71 to 69. At that point we are not talking about 
providing retirement income; we are talking about sheltering 
wealth for those who have the means to shelter wealth.
<P>
	She was concerned about massive management fees no longer 
being deductible for tax purposes. However she did not mention 
that they would be payable out of the RRSP itself and would not 
impact the taxpayer.
<P>
	She lamented that we did not increase the $13,500 limit. Those 
people who can afford to put away $13,500 would have to make 
$75,000 a year.
<P>
	The hon. member has been critical of changes which affect the 
most wealthy Canadians, but she failed to recognize that one of the 
important changes included in the budget was the elimination of 
the seven-year limitation on the carry forward of unused balances 
of RRSPs. This means ordinary young Canadians who are 
struggling from paycheque to paycheque will have an opportunity 
in the future to make up those years in which they could not make a 
contribution.
<P>
	The difference between the Reform Party and the Liberal Party is 
that the Reform Party is advocating on behalf of the most wealthy 
Canadians and the Liberal Party is advocating on behalf of ordinary 
Canadians who are living from paycheque to paycheque.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know Liberals opposite would 
like to characterize their budget as being tough on the wealthy. 
However I point out a couple of matters the hon. member might 
want to keep in mind.
<P>
	The 40 per cent of people who invest in RRSPs make less than 
$30,000 a year. People are very worried about their retirement 
future. They are starting to put away money in RRSPs in order to 
protect themselves. Yet this government is making it more difficult 
for them to do that.
<P>
	The level at which a person has to save in order to have a 
reasonable retirement income has been pegged at $15,500 but the 
government will only allow people to save $13,500. Even if the 
wealthy need a reasonable amount to live on when retired. This 
government is telling seniors on one hand that if they are wealthy, 
they should not expect anything from the government but on the 
other hand they will not be allowed to save a reasonable amount in 
order to compensate for that. Wealthy people have to live too.
<P>
	People have to have enough for a reasonable retirement income, 
particularly with services being eroded by the debt the government 
is running up. We cannot have it both ways. There will not be the 
wealthy at all. Wealthy will just be a memory of Liberal rhetoric. 
There will only be very poor, very needy and very unhappy retired 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, it being 6.15 p.m., it is my duty to 
interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question 
necessary to dispose of the subamendment now before the House. 
The question is on the subamendment. Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the subamendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the subamendment will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Call in the members.

<HR><B><A NAME="859"> 859 </A></B><P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CORPORATEDOWNSIZING">CORPORATE DOWNSIZING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
a speech on February 28 in the House of Commons the Prime 
Minister said that corporations in Canada ``have a responsibility to 
eliminate the human deficit of unemployment. No true balance 
sheet can ignore the heavy and growing cost of chronic 
unemployment. It is wrong. It is wrong on a human level. It is 
wrong on an economic level. It is wrong on a commercial level. It 
is wrong on a moral level''.
<P>
	The question to the Minister of Finance on March 5 was to 
suggest that Hollinger Incorporated ignored the Prime Minister's 
challenge in the private sector to help create jobs. It was a slap in 
the face because two days after Hollinger Incorporated took 
ownership of the Regina <I>Leader-Post</I>, the Saskatoon <I>Star-Phoenix</I> 
and the Yorkton <I>Enterprise</I>, 182 employees were terminated. 
Twenty-five per cent of the staff is gone because, in the words of a 
Hollinger representative, these newspapers made profits but not 
enough profits.
<P>
	The owner of Hollinger Incorporated, Mr. Conrad Black, has 
shown a clear lack of corporate citizenship. He is flagrantly 
ignoring the challenge of the Prime Minister because he does not 
care if he creates a human deficit, in the Prime Minister's words. 
He is only interested in the bottom line. However, by ignoring the 
human factor in his profit chasing, Mr. Black is not fooling the 
people of Saskatchewan or his employees; he is only fooling 
himself.
<P>
	Putting more people out of work hurts the whole economy. It 
means fewer consumers with purchasing  power to buy goods and 
services. No company lives in a glass bubble. Businesses are 
interdependent and when we put people out of work the whole 
business community feels the repercussions and in some cases the 
whole country suffers.
<P>
	The Liberals were elected on a promise of jobs, jobs, jobs but 
delivered nothing but talk, talk, talk and fewer jobs. It is not only 
Hollinger Incorporation but many other profitable corporations that 
made substantial profits yet terminated jobs. They terminated 
employees as a reward for their efforts in making these profits.
<P>
	Bell Canada made a profit of $502 million yet had 3,100 fewer 
jobs as a result of that. General Motors had $1.39 billion in profits 
yet laid off 2,500 employees. Imperial Oil had a record profit of 
$514 million and 452 fewer jobs. The Bank of Montreal made $986 
million with 1,428 fewer employees.
<P>
	What these statistics show is a lack of corporate responsibility in 
a country which provides them with these profits as well as various 
tax support from our treasury.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	Should Canada continue to provide these profitable corporations 
that downsize tax breaks when they lack a sense of corporate 
responsibility to create jobs? More and more Canadians think not. 
More and more Canadians think corporate tax breaks should only 
be provided to those companies that treat their community and 
their employees with dignity. Canadians want tax breaks only for 
the corporate responsible corporations and tax breaks should only 
be provided to those who would support a Canadian code of 
corporate citizenship.
<P>
	What did the Liberals do in response to these large, profitable 
corporations? The Liberals responded with a very small youth 
employment program to hire the kids of the parents who lost their 
jobs at minimum wage. Fire the parents and hire the kids at reduced 
wages. That is the Liberal approach to employment. Under the 
Liberals, economic development has become an oxymoron.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the 
Minister of Finance to respond to the question of the member for 
Regina-Lumsden.
<P>
	The government's number one priority has always been, is and 
will remain job creation. A key part of this commitment is ensuring 
that the corporate tax system contributes to job creation. Many 
steps have been taken.
<P>
	The government has eliminated a whole range of what the 
member opposite would call tax breaks. They are too numerous to 
mention. Last year, as the member knows, it took significant steps 
to reduce business subsidies which were continued in this budget as 
well.
<P>
	A number of incentives have been kept in place. They have been 
studied extensively and have been judged  useful for job creation, 
for instance, the small business tax rate. I do not think the member 
opposite would argue that it was not useful in encouraging job 
creation in the small business sector. There are also vital measures 
to encourage research and development. I do not think any member 
<P>

<B><A NAME="860"> 860 </A></B>
<P>
of the House would argue with the importance of research and 
development to the creation of long term and important jobs.
<P>
	To ensure that corporations contribute to deficit reduction and do 
their fair share, steps have been taken with regard to the large 
corporation tax rate. Furthermore, the temporary surtax on banks 
which was instituted in last year's budget is continued further in 
this year's budget.
<P>
	Finally, in this year's budget a technical committee was created 
to look at other ways in which the tax system can contribute to job 
creation. Their report will be made public after consultations some 
months hence. We all look forward to seeing the committee's 
recommendations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleagues, pursuant to the order 
made earlier today, the motion to adjourn the House is deemed to 
have been withdrawn.

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved 
that Bill C-10, an act to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal 
year beginning on April 1, 1996, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if you were to seek it, I believe you 
would find unanimous consent for me to split my 40-minute 
speaking time with the hon. member for Mississauga South.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the hon. 
member to split his time with the hon. member for Mississauga 
South?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, it has happened on numerous 
occasions and if it is not acceptable to members opposite that is 
fine. I will just speak very slowly for 40 minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am reminded, as always, by the helpful 
gentlemen and ladies of the table that you do not need unanimous 
consent to split your time. Under our standing orders one can do 
that.
<P>
	Therefore, I take it the member wishes to indicate that he will be 
splitting his time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> I am sure members opposite are very pleased 
that they will not have to endure me for 40 minutes. I will be 
splitting my time with the hon. member for Mississauga South.
<P>
<B>(1920 )</B>
<P>
	I welcome this opportunity to speak on second reading of Bill 
C-10, the borrowing authority bill. As in previous years, the 
amount of borrowing authority requested in the bill is directly 
connected to the financial requirements set out in the federal 
budget. The information required to deal with the financial aspects 
of the bill is also contained in the budget plan.
<P>
	I urge the House to approve this legislation as soon as possible. 
Our goal is to have new borrowing authority in place on April 1, the 
beginning of the government's new fiscal year. This will ensure 
continued regular financing operations for the government.
<P>
	All borrowing authority granted by last year's Borrowing 
Authority Act, including the $3 billion non-lapsing amount, will be 
depleted by the middle of April. If this legislation is not in effect on 
time, it means that the government's funding requirements would 
have to be met by using section 47 of the Financial Administration 
Act.
<P>
	Section 47 restricts the borrowing to short term funds. Having to 
resort to these could be costly to the government and Canadian 
taxpayers and would expose the government to the additional 
interest rate risk implied by increased short term funding. That is 
why it is critical that borrowing authority be secured.
<P>
	I intend to highlight the specifics of the legislation before us. 
First, since this is legislation authorizing the government to borrow 
money, it is clearly appropriate to review our fiscal philosophy, 
what we do with the funds the taxpayers provide and borrowers 
lend to us.
<P>
	The message has been driven home again and again in the 
finance minister's budget speech and in the debate that followed. 
These messages are worth repeating because no one should doubt 
our commitment.
<P>
	The 1996 budget plan consolidates and extends the actions set 
out in the 1994 and 1995 budgets. Together, they implement a 
comprehensive strategy that is determined, measured and 
responsible.
<P>
	It is determined because we are not letting up. As the Minister of 
Finance emphasized: ``The attack on the deficit is irrevocable and 
irreversible. We will balance the books. Furthermore, we will put 
the debt to GDP ratio on a constant downward track year after year 
after year''.
<P>
	It is measured because our fiscal action plan is designed not as a 
quick fix, but structured to achieve long term, permanent progress.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="861"> 861 </A></B>
<P>
	It is responsible because it is a strategy that involves carefully 
weighing the needs of our economy and society and equally 
carefully designing the policy options to meet those needs.
<P>
	The majority of Canadians do not want the slash and burn 
approach that ignores economic consequences and abandons the 
vulnerable. They do not want Gingrich style grandstanding. They 
want an approach that is fair and balanced. Just as important, it is 
the balanced approach that is the best way to keep Canadians 
onside for deficit reduction efforts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I need not elaborate on the basis for our decision to take strong 
and disciplined action for Canada. High deficits and a high public 
debt have raised interest rates, undermined confidence, swallowed 
up domestic savings and made Canada's international debt soar.
<P>
	With our first two budgets, we have put in place a rock-solid 
fiscal base. These two budgets instituted the most drastic spending 
cuts since the war, structural cuts spread over the entire medium 
term planning period. But this base entails much more yet. It means 
setting deficit reduction targets over two years, using conservative 
economic assumptions and building large contingency reserves 
against unforeseen economic fluctuations.
<P>
	These measures ensure that our deficit reduction targets for 
1995-96 and 1996-97, to bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of the 
GDP, will be met in spite of the fact that the GDP did not grow as 
much as originally forecast. One of the factors that made this 
possible is the sharper than anticipated drop in interests rates, 
which counteracted the effects of slower growth on the deficit.

<P>
	The measures in the 1996 budget consolidate and extend those in 
the first two budgets and further contribute to our economic and 
financial objectives. We have maintained our focus on reducing 
program spending because the deficit is a problem created by 
government. The solution, therefore, should focus on cutting in our 
own backyard. In the 1994 and 1995 budgets there were no 
increases in personal income tax rates. In the 1996 budget there 
were no tax rate increases at all.
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	There is another way to underscore this point. Of the cumulative 
fiscal actions taken from 1994-95 to 1998-99, a full 87 per cent 
have been expenditure savings. Expenditure cuts in the 1996 
budget amounted to $1.9 billion in 1998-99 and build on the 
reductions of the two previous budgets to keep program spending 
on a downward track.
<P>
	Together, the three budgets and the employment insurance 
reform will contribute $26.1 billion in savings for 1997-98. This 
will ensure we hit our new deficit target  to keep the federal 
shortfall to just 2 per cent of GDP in 1997-98. Our combined 
budget plans will deliver a further $28.9 billion in savings in 
1998-99. This means the deficit will continue to drop and our debt 
to GDP ratio will fall.
<P>
	There should be no doubt about the dramatic dimensions of this 
action. Program spending, that is everything but interest payments, 
was $120 billion in 1993-94. By 1998-99 we will have cut it to 
$105.5 billion. That is a decline of 14 per cent which means that 
program spending will have declined for six straight years.
<P>
	These are real cuts in actual dollars, not reduction against some 
previously established plan. Relative to the size of the economy, 
program spending will fall to its lowest level since 1949-50. This 
drop in actual program spending is unprecedented in Canadian 
post-war history and virtually unprecedented internationally. Most 
other countries are merely trying to slow the growth of their 
spending.
<P>
	There is another milestone I want to mention. Through such 
deficit action the federal debt to GDP ratio will fall 1.1 percentage 
points in 1997-98. That will be the first significant decline since 
1974-75. It means the national income will finally be growing 
faster than financial obligations, putting us in a better position to 
manage.
<P>
	There is one final fiscal measure I want to discuss which is 
financial requirements. In other words, how much new borrowing 
the government will be doing on financial markets. This is the basis 
by which most other countries, including the United States, the 
U.K., Germany, France and Italy, measure deficits.
<P>
	In 1993-94 federal financial requirements stood at $30 billion or 
4.2 per cent of GDP. By 1997-98 they will have dropped to $6 
billion, just 0.7 per cent of the GDP. Relative to the size of the 
economy, that is the lowest level in almost 30 years. On that basis, 
we will likely have the lowest fiscal shortfall of any G-7 central 
government.
<P>
	There is one thing we must all understand. Budget forecasts are 
just that, forecasts, estimates. That is because these things deal 
with the future and factors that can only be assumed such as 
economic growth and interest rates. That is why one of the budget 
plan foundations is to apply economic assumptions that are more 
cautious than those of the private sector. For example, projections 
for 1997 are based on interest rates 80 bases points higher than the 
average of private sector forecasts.
<P>
	This is not a gimmick to deliver easy to reach targets. It is a 
discipline embraced because Canadians are tired of governments 
that emphasize wishful forecasts and then miss those targets again 
and again. We have been setting rolling targets that we have been 
achieving again and again, and will continue to meet.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="862"> 862 </A></B>
<P>
	Of course there were always excuses for the missed targets in 
the past, but governments are judged on their performance not 
their promises. That is why we built in a prudence factor to buffer 
us against the sort of events on which excuses are too often based.
<P>
	Let me emphasize a corollary point. If economic developments 
are either as assumed or more favourable than assumed, the deficit 
will be even lower than our 2 per cent of GDP target in 1997-98. 
Any portion of the contingency reserve that is not needed will be 
applied directly to deficit reduction.
<P>
	I want to turn to the legislation before us, but before I do let me 
just put Canada's fiscal progress again in an international context, 
specifically comparing it to the United States, our largest trading 
partner and the most meaningful comparison. The Canadian fiscal 
situation can be compared by contrasting our financial 
requirements with the U.S. deficit on a unified budget basis.
<P>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
	Canadian federal deficits relative to GDP have been larger than 
U.S. government deficits in recent years. However, with the fiscal 
measures in 1994 and 1995 in those budgets combined with our 
latest plans this performance will be reversed.
<P>
	For 1996-97 the comparable Canadian deficit is projected to fall 
to 1.7 per cent of GDP while the U.S. deficit will remain stable at 
2.1 per cent. The difference between the two ratios should widen in 
1997-98, exceeding a full percentage point in Canada's favour.
<P>
	The main factor behind this shift is program spending. Between 
1994-95 and 1997-98 Canada's federal program spending is set to 
decline by 3.2 percentage points of GDP compared with only 0.8 
percentage points in the U.S.
<P>
	Federal program spending in 1997-98 should represent just 12.6 
per cent of GDP compared with to 16.8 per cent in the United 
States. That is an incredible change. As I mentioned earlier, this 
spending will fall even further in 1998-99 to 12 per cent of the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	Let me now turn to Bill C-10. Like the borrowing authority bill 
for last year, this bill contains three basic elements: authority to 
cover financial requirements for 1996-97, exchange fund account 
revenues, and a non-lapsing amount. In total the government is 
requesting authority to borrow $18.7 billion for the 1996-97 fiscal 
year.
<P>
	Let me touch briefly on the main provisions of the bill. First, 
there is the provision for $13.7 billion of authority to cover our 
anticipated borrowing to meet the net financial requirements set 
out in the new budget.
<P>
	Second, there is the provision to cover $1 billion of exchange 
fund account earnings which give rise to additional Canadian dollar 
borrowing requirements. This  is because these earnings, although 
reported as budgetary revenues, are retained in the exchange fund 
account. They are not available to finance ongoing operations of 
the government.
<P>
	Third, there is a $4 billion non-lapsing amount. This is 
something I want to emphasize because it represents a change from 
previous years. The non-lapsing amount has been $3 billion since 
1986. Our $1 billion increase is a prudent measure which will 
provide the government with the ability to manage foreign 
exchange requirements more effectively in light of increased 
exchange market flows and volatility in recent years.
<P>
	The non-lapsing amount can either be used during the course of 
the year to manage contingencies or be carried forward temporarily 
into the next fiscal year until new borrowing authority is granted. 
In either event it underscores the sort of fiscal and economic 
prudence we believe must be the hallmark of good government in a 
world of accelerating change.
<P>
	There are some minor technical provisions in the bill that more 
clearly link fiscal year borrowing authority with fiscal year 
borrowing requirements.
<P>
	One provision provides that 1996-97 borrowing authority may 
be used only after the 1996-97 fiscal year begins. Another 
provision stipulates that for the purposes of calculating borrowing 
authority usage, the effective date is April 1.
<P>
	If the borrowing authority bill is not passed before the start of the 
new fiscal year the government may continue to use in 1996-97 the 
$3 billion non-lapsing amount provided for in the Borrowing 
Authority Act, 1995-96. However, any use of the non-lapsing 
amount in 1996-97 will be deducted from the basic amount of new 
borrowing authority when the legislation before us is passed. This 
prevents the non-lapsing amount in any year from effectively 
adding to the borrowing authority in the following year.
<P>
	We want the borrowing authority bill passed before the start of 
the new fiscal year to avoid using the non-lapsing amount, which in 
any event would last but a few short weeks. I appreciate the efforts 
of members opposite in expediting the passage of this borrowing 
authority.
<P>
	This bill will cancel all borrowing authority remaining from 
fiscal 1995-96 once it is passed.
<P>
	As further background information, I would like to review the 
government's debt operations in the current fiscal year up to 
mid-February.
<P>
	I hope members are writing this down. I know they have been 
taking careful notes. So far in the fiscal 1995-96 domestic debt 
program the government has issued about $25.3 billion in 
marketable bonds, $1 billion in real return bonds and $224 million 
in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="863"> 863 </A></B>
<P>
CSBs. There were also net redemptions of $5.8 billion in  treasury 
bills. This provides a total of $26.5 billion in net new market debt.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	I report to the House on last fall's CSB campaign. This year the 
government took a first step into the highly competitive RRSP 
market. Last fall for the first time, Canada savings bonds could be 
registered directly in the name of an RRSP. In January the new 
RRSP option was extended to all outstanding series of compound 
interest bonds.
<P>
	The 1995 CSB campaign produced sales of $4.6 billion. After 
counting for redemptions during the year, the net increase in CSBs 
outstanding was $224 million, as I indicated earlier.
<P>
	Regarding foreign currency debt outstanding, Canada bills 
decreased by U.S. $2.8 billion to U.S. $3.7 billion at the end of 
February. These are short term U.S. dollar denominated bills issued 
from time to time in the U.S. market to fund Canada's foreign 
exchange reserves.
<P>
	The government launched two very successful global bond 
issues last year, a U.S. $1.5 billion five-year issue in May and a 
U.S. $1.5 billion 10-year issue in July. The five-year issue gained 
recognition from international financing review as the sovereign 
deal of the year. The proceeds of both issues were added to 
Canada's official exchange reserves.
<P>
	In summary, this bill is straightforward and contains no unusual 
provisions. I urge the House to approve this legislation as quickly 
as possible so that new borrowing authority will be in place at the 
beginning of the new fiscal year and the government's regular 
borrowing program can proceed as the fiscal year begins.
<P>
	As the debate continues we will learn a great deal more about 
this bill. Members will be fully informed about it. May I get a little 
guidance from you, Mr. Speaker, at this point?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am very happy that my colleague asked 
that question. It is the first time we have ever made an error. 
Standing Order 74 says members can divide their time when they 
are the second speaker and not when they are the lead off speaker 
on a bill.
<P>
	Accordingly, the hon. parliamentary secretary cannot divide his 
time. He is entitled to speak for 40 minutes but he does not seem to 
have a 40-minute speech ready in which case the next speaker will 
be the critic for the official opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for providing that 
guidance. We regret the confusion at the front end of this. I happily 
yield the floor to the member opposite. We can continue the debate 
afterward if he needs to speak now rather than later this evening.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Thank 
you, Mr. Speaker-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> I see that Reform members are getting all worked 
up. This is to be expected. For about two weeks now, they have had 
a tendency to get more excited than necessary. Consequently, I am 
not surprised at their behaviour this evening. Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, could you please ask the Reform 
member who sounds like he is braying to stop making that noise?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The evening has only begun.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The evening is just beginning. I hope hon. members will show 
respect for their colleagues, and I expect all of them to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-10, 
which authorizes the Minister of Finance, as of April 1, 1996, to 
raise such amount or amounts, up to $18.7 billion, by way of a loan 
or by the issue and sale of securities of Canada, as may be required 
for public works and general purposes. This more or less defines 
Bill C-10.
<P>
	Given the way this Liberal government has managed public 
finances over the last two and a half years, and given the recent 
budget brought down by the Minister of Finance, it is difficult for 
the official opposition to support with enthusiasm a bill that, in our 
opinion, confirms that the Minister of Finance and the Liberal 
government did a bad job of managing public finances. Yet, on 
behalf of Quebecers and Canadians, the government asks that we 
support this bill.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	Let us take a look only at the last budget, which contained sad 
news for us regarding the debt and the deficit. Indeed, the Minister 
of Finance has already decided that this year, next year and the year 
after, he will not fight to eliminate waste, inefficiencies, 
duplication or, in other words, budgetary expenditures.
<P>
	One need only look at page 14 of the budget where we find the 
direct budget savings for 1996-97 to see that, for the fiscal year 
1996-97, this year's budget provides for savings of 0.0 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="864"> 864 </A></B>
<P>
	Another look and we see that for 1997-98, this budget forecasts 
cuts in government spending of only $200 million. And in two 
years, they are talking about $1.7 billion in savings based on the 
budget brought down by the Minister of Finance just a few weeks 
ago.
<P>
	Taken over three years, we must conclude that the Minister of 
Finance is looking for savings of $1.9 billion. Imagine, $1.9 
billion. That represents seven-tenths of one per cent in cuts per 
year. Seven-tenths of one per cent. Not one per cent, not even one 
per cent, but seven-tenths of one per cent, because we must not 
forget that federal spending is in the neighbourhood of $160 billion 
annually. So, for annual expenditures of $160 billion over the next 
three years, cuts of $1.9 billion mean seven-tenths of one per cent 
of the Minister of Finance's forecast.
<P>
	How, therefore, can we give the okay to a Minister of Finance 
who shows no interest in limiting his spending? He is not interested 
in creating acceptable annual savings. How can we give him the 
okay to borrow, on behalf of Quebecers and Canadians, over $18 
billion on the market?
<P>
	Would that normally be done? Would someone who showed 
himself unable to generate savings, who showed himself unable to 
manage the public purse wisely, be given carte blanche to borrow, 
in our name, $18 billion? No.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance be given authority to borrow $18 
billion on the market, when during two and a half years of Liberal 
management he added over $110 billion to the federal debt, which 
will climb to over $603 billion this year?
<P>
	Would you give the okay to a manager who has squandered 
public funds, who has, deliberately for political ends, not assumed 
his responsibilities with respect to reducing the size of 
government? Would you give him carte blanche to go and borrow, 
in your name, $18 billion on the market? The answer is no.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, would you give him carte blanche? Now I see that 
you are listening very carefully to what I have to say because it 
concerns your pocket book directly, and nobody would borrow, in 
your name, with this kind of track record in managing the public 
purse.
<P>
	Would you give a finance minister carte blanche to borrow $18 
billion, when all he had managed to do in two and a half years of 
managing your finances was to coast along with the growth in the 
economy, eat into the unemployment insurance fund, take 
advantage of the surplus generated by this fund to which the federal 
government has not contributed for several years now? It means 
dumping the deficit on the provinces, as he is doing.
<P>
	Would you give carte blanche to this minister, who has made use 
of everybody except himself, who has put public funding on a 
healthier footing using everything except his own means, his own 
solutions?
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	I would not, and I do not believe Canadians would either. What 
consummate showmen the Liberals have  turned out to be in the 
past two and half years. Each time, they have presented a budget 
which disguised the reality. The last budget is a most impressive 
theatrical production using smoke and mirrors.
<P>
	They tell us: ``We will reduce the deficit by several billion per 
year, not only attaining our objectives for the percentage of the 
deficit compared to the GDP, but surpassing it''. But let us look 
more closely at how they are managing to disguise the truth.
<P>
	If it were not for the cuts I have just referred to, if it were not for 
the cuts, if it were not for the systematic dumping of the deficit 
onto the backs of the provinces, if it were not for the Minister of 
Finance's dipping into the UI fund, if it were not for the economic 
situation of these past two years, which has brought in three to four 
billion in revenues this year, the Minister of Finance would not 
have a $24.5 billion deficit for 1996-97, but a $31 billion dollar 
one.
<P>
	If it were not for the UI cuts, if it were not for the surplus the 
Minister of Finance has helped himself to out of the UI fund, if it 
were not for the systematic dumping of the burden onto the 
provinces, and if it were not for the economic situation, the 
Minister of Finance's deficit for next year would be, not $17 
billion, as he claims, but over $27 billion.
<P>
	In the end, when we look at the real deficit for this year, 
generated through the incompetence of the Minister of Finance, we 
see that little has changed since he became head of the department. 
In fact, if we look at the product of the new revenues arising from 
the state of the economy, from economic growth, if we look at the 
unemployment insurance fund, the minister's favourite fund, were 
it not as well for the shift of his responsibilities onto the provinces, 
the actual deficit, because we have to include the product of the 
economic situation, the actual deficit for 1996-97 would be $35 
billion.
<P>
	It seems to me that is comparable to the deficit at the time the 
Minister of Finance took over the department-it was about $37 
billion or $38 billion. There has been hardly any reduction.
<P>
	Apart from the economic situation and the Minister of Finance's 
tricks, the promised good management of public funds would never 
have materialized. It is all smoke. It is all hokum on the part of the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	He could have cut duplication and overlap. They have long 
harped on that one. We have long harped at the Liberal Party, the 
party in power. We have long raised it with the Reformers as well; 
they prefer to close their minds to anything reasonable.
<P>
	Instead of setting up a committee to study duplication, overlap 
and the doubling of positions in federal and provincial 
governments, the Liberal government, and it added more in the 
speech from the throne, and in the  budget speech, wants to 
interfere 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="865"> 865 </A></B>
<P>
everywhere. Not only is it going to stay in areas it has invaded, 
exclusive provincial jurisdictions, but it is adding more.
<P>
	In the throne speech, it said clearly, and it repeated it in the 
budget for certain aspects there, that it will, with the support of a 
majority of the provinces, continue to invade areas of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction, that it will, for example, set up a Canadian 
securities commission. As if we needed the bureaucracy, the 
inefficiencies and the duplication of the federal government, when 
it has a hard time, with what it has, putting public finances in order 
and making the machinery efficient, so that this huge machine is 
not constantly seized up. It is adding more: a Canadian securities 
commission, when all the provinces operate efficiently in their area 
of jurisdiction.
<P>
	All the provinces have harmonized their actions for years. 
Together the provinces have set up a system called SEDAR, which 
will be operational in a few months and which will eliminate the 
need for ten different issues, or a total of securities issues; a single 
one will suffice. This will be done with efficiency and expertise 
since it has been an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction for 
several years. This is not the case of the government and the 
finance minister, who are making it more cumbersome.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	Not only will they not eliminate duplication and overlapping, but 
they will create more of it. They think Quebecers and Canadians 
love to spend money. Obviously they do not visit their ridings very 
often.
<P>
	They mentioned a national revenue agency, as if we needed to 
add a new administrative structure to the already huge government 
apparatus, which is gobbling up close to $160 billion a year. The 
finance minister's managerial attitude is questionable. We should 
not give a blank cheque such as this to a minister. We should not 
give a blank cheque to a government which is planning to cover the 
country with flags-one million, we are told-but which does 
nothing to put its fiscal house in order.
<P>
	Where is the finance minister dealing with inefficiencies and 
waste? Has anyone ever heard him say, for instance, that there is a 
lot of fat to be cut in the defence department? Has anyone ever 
heard the finance minister or Liberal members condemn the 
squandering of two billion dollars on tanks? Has anyone ever heard 
the finance minister or his fellow citizens, his colleagues in the 
Liberal Party, in stringent budgetary times, and in peace time to 
boot, condemn the purchase of antitank missiles at $15,000 a 
piece? No one, never.
<P>
	When did we ever hear of such shameful expenditures as those 
planned to modernize submarines and buy highly sophisticated 
helicopters in peace time, when our accumulated debt has reached 
$603 billion and the  Minister of Finance is unable to keep this debt 
from growing? Never. When did we ever hear this government talk 
about what is happening in the other House or about the money 
spent on the governor general? Never. It amounts to $50 million a 
year but it never talks about it. It prefers to continue dealing with 
symbols, while the other House remains a haven of patronage, a 
reward for good Liberals-or, in the past, good Tories-who often 
doze off in front of TV cameras.
<P>
	Did we ever witness a commitment to sound management of 
public finances, when the Minister of Finance or the minister of 
revenue was asked to go after the more than $6 billion in unpaid 
taxes owed the federal government? I am not talking about 
controversial matters but about things that are pending because 
they made lateral staff cuts in the federal public service. They cut 
staff, but wall to wall, starting at the bottom because it is easier, 
because the mandarins, the senior officials at the top are in charge 
so they are not likely to offer their own heads on a platter to the 
government.
<P>
	So we get to the point where, at the department of revenue, there 
are not enough real workers to go after unpaid taxes. As a result, in 
the last two years, out of more than $6.3 billion in unpaid taxes, 
only $250 million to $300 million have been collected. Out of $6.3 
billion. This is ridiculous.
<P>
	If there was any reason to believe that they are concerned about 
managing public finances soundly, about making the optimum use 
of resources, about looking for money at the right place and taking 
it from those who have it, we would support Bill C-10. But that is 
not what the Minister of Finance has accustomed us to over the past 
two and a half years. We cannot give him a blank cheque when he is 
asking us to borrow $18.6 billion on the capital markets on my 
behalf and on behalf of my colleagues, of the people of Quebec and 
of the people of Canada.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is slowly starting to smell the coffee. It 
is none too soon; we have been condemning this situation for 
almost three years already. We have been asking him for nearly 
three years to reform the tax system, and the corporate tax system 
in particular, because it is full of holes. As usual, instead of taking 
his responsibilities, the Minister of Finance has decided to set up a 
task force to eventually look at the corporate tax system behind 
closed doors, a task force that would not include any 
parliamentarians-who, I should remind you, are elected by the 
people to account to them-and to prepare a report in which it 
would recommend revising the corporate tax system along such or 
such a line.
<P>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
	This report would be released and we would be expected to do 
our job based on a document that was biased from the start. How 
so? For the reasons we have already explained. As soon as the 
Minister of Finance announced his plans to set up a technical 
committee on  business taxation and made the membership of this 
committee known, we came out against this committee's 
membership. Why? Because the committee is made up of experts 
from various consulting firms, firms advising big corporations on 
how to take advantage of innumerable tax loopholes to avoid 
paying Revenue Canada what they owe.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="866"> 866 </A></B>
<P>
	And we would have been gullible enough to accept not to discuss 
corporate taxation for a year and let these experts look at the issue 
behind close doors and come up with a report saying: ``We 
reviewed the whole corporate tax system and found that there are 
not many problems with it''.
<P>
	Such will be the findings of that technical committee on 
corporate taxation. This is what the minister wants to hear. As we 
said when the budget was brought down, this is tantamount to a 
first class funeral for the work of that committee, and also for a true 
reform of the corporate tax system.
<P>
	We might as well forget about that. That committee of experts 
will include people from firms such as Ernst &amp; Young. These firms 
not only give advice to major corporations on how to avoid paying 
taxes, they also have subsidiaries in countries considered to be tax 
havens, where hundreds of millions go in and out. The result is that 
Canadian businesses that supposedly have to pay a 1.5 or 2.5 per 
cent tax are not taxed by Revenue Canada because their revenues 
have already been taxed in countries considered to be tax havens.
<P>
	And we should have accepted that process? This is making fun of 
us. It is making fun of Canadians and Quebecers. We are no fools. 
The Minister of Finance intends to do with this committee exactly 
what he did with the family trust issue.
<P>
	You remember, last year: ``We are going to comply with the 
demands of the official opposition, we are going to reduce benefits 
linked to family trusts''. We were pleased. But when he said ``in 
1999'' it was like warning the thief a day ahead that the police were 
on the way. I would call it laughable. Now they are up to the same 
thing again.
<P>
	If we were alone in thinking that the Minister of Finance had not 
tackled the real problems in two and a half years, we would say: 
``Maybe we are mistaken''. But when we visit our ridings, 
throughout Quebec, and also outside Quebec, in Canada, and 
people come up and say: ``Keep up the good work, we are very 
disappointed in the Liberal government'', and tell us, often in 
English, in ridings that are Liberal bastions, in ridings often 
coveted by our friends in the Reform Party, but that they will never 
win if they keep on with their rather special attitude of the last two 
weeks, then we begin to tell ourselves that our message is getting 
across.
<P>
	And, although it is not something I am used to doing, I have a fax 
to read-yes, we in the Bloc also get faxes, not  just the Reformers. 
I got a fax last week from a Mrs. Jansen in Regina, in 
Regina-Wascana,the riding of the Minister of Agriculture, which 
reads as follows-please pardon my accent, but I shall try to render 
the spirit and to some extent the content of Mrs. Jansen's faxed 
letter. I would like, incidentally, to thank her for her excellent 
analysis. She wrote as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``This fax is to express my appreciation to you for presenting 
several important issues during your response to the finance
<P>
minister's budget speech. While I recognize that your party, the 
Bloc Quebecois, has specific aspirations, your comments mirror 
the concern of many citizens in Canada. The duplication of services 
and the consequent waste of fiscal resources that might be used by 
the provinces, the lack of sincerity to attend to the tax break given 
to large corporations as indicated by the implementation of the 
secret commission to study this issue, and the $50 million 
apportionment to the anachronistic Senate are symbolic of a system 
that no longer works in the best interests of beleaguered 
taxpayers''.
<P>
<B>(2000)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I continue to quote, since I find this letter extremely interesting. 
Mrs. Jansen continues:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Cuts are not being made to senior bureaucracy but at the level 
of direct service providers to the public. The civil service will soon 
become so top heavy without sufficient support at the bottom that 
the pretence of providing services to the average citizen cannot be 
maintained. I have noted that since the election of the present 
Liberal administration, all programs designed to assist emerging 
and small firms have either been discontinued or dismembered.
<P>
	``The rest of this country is beginning to severely suffer from the 
effects of an administration that does not adhere to the old 
democratic action of government of the people, by the people, for 
the people. Rather recent policies lead us to the conclusion that we 
have a government of the rulers, by the rulers, for the rulers.
<P>
	``As the middle class and small businesses are increasingly 
diminished by taxation and outdated regulations, we may soon find 
ourselves within a feudalistic style of government: the rich and 
powerful at the top, a few disenfranchised workers in the middle, 
and the majority enduring poverty''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When a number of us, in Quebec as in Canada-and I could have 
read other comments from the Maritimes-think that this 
administration has been remiss in its duty, that this administration 
which is today demanding a free rein to go after $18.6 billion on 
our  behalf, when we have reached the point, Quebecers and 
Canadians alike, francophones and anglophones alike, of 
castigating this administration for not shouldering its 
responsibilities, it may be time for this government to be brought 
back in line.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="867"> 867 </A></B>
<P>
	It is perhaps time for all, in Quebec and in Canada, coast to coast 
as they say, to be a little more vocal in our dissatisfaction with an 
administration which has not, in two years and a half, done 
anything more than pretend to Quebecers and to Canadians that 
everything was fine, everything was under control, when from the 
point of view of overall public funding, the exercise has barely 
begun.
<P>
	As for the increasing debt, the Minister of Finance cannot long 
conceal from Canadians that this progression is not contained. For 
this reason, as well as all those I have just enumerated, we in the 
official opposition, on behalf of the people of Quebec and of 
Canada, will refuse to allow this irresponsible Minister of Finance, 
who is not fulfilling his responsibilities, who is not making cuts in 
the proper places, who is not making the desirable reform in 
corporate taxation in the timely manner it requires, to borrow $18.6 
billion on our behalf. I shall be recommending that my Bloc 
Quebecois colleagues vote against this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
respect to the borrowing bill, I rise to simply say I am disappointed 
that this government has to borrow so much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Too much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Too much. Having said that, let me lead into my 
commentary about budgetary process, borrowing process and the 
finances of this country.
<P>
	Mr. Thomas Walkom wrote in the Toronto <I>Star</I>: ``To watch the 
federal Liberals from afar is to marvel. This is a party with no 
memory and no shame. In opposition, sanctimonious, in 
government, hypocritical. It has raised duplicity to a high art''. I 
concur with that quotation and I would like to submit some 
evidence I have dug out myself.
<P>
	No matter that the Prime Minister is on record as saying he was 
firmly committed to universal social programs such as old age 
security, the government ended it by replacing it with a means 
tested program called the seniors benefit in the budget. No matter 
that the Prime Minister promised to scrap NAFTA unless it was 
renegotiated, the Liberals signed it anyway and now they take 
credit for it. No matter that many Liberals promised to abolish, kill, 
get rid of, scrap the GST in order to get elected, even with this third 
budget they have not kept their final promise: replace. We know 
why. They are trying to put the blame with this promise on the 
provinces. Their latest kick is harmonization. Replace is what they 
said; replace is what they should do. Now they  have taken the 
pressure off themselves and have shifted it on to the provinces 
saying that if they do not comply with their proposal it will be the 
provinces' fault.
<P>
<B>(2005)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals are downloading on the provinces just like they did 
with the Canada health and social transfer. They have reduced the 
funding and guess which Parliament gets rocks thrown at it: the 
provincial parliaments, not the federal Parliament. Guess which 
Parliament has to handle most cuts to health, education and 
welfare: not the federal government, the provincial government.
<P>
	No matter that the Liberals promised to protect civil servants and 
then turned around and fired 45,000 people while entrenching a 
multimillion dollar pension plan for themselves.
<P>
	No matter that the Liberals promised jobs, jobs, jobs and now 
that they have failed they are blaming the private sector or the 
business community, which never elected any Liberals; I do not 
think they ran as a party; they never made the promises. 
Nevertheless, the federal government is now saying: Private sector, 
you create the jobs.
<P>
	No matter that this government is spending $4 million more per 
day than it brings in. It claims it has broken the back of the deficit.
<P>
	No matter that this government said no new corporate or 
personal taxes, but through the tightening of some tax preferences 
like deductibility of child support payments, increased revenues in 
the next fiscal year by $100 million and $245 million next year, 
these represent tax increases. This government is truly 
sanctimonious, hypocritical and smacks of duplicity.
<P>
	The finance minister brags about his budget. Let us see what he 
has really done. Let us see how he has handled his first kick at the 
cat. Is the problem the deficit or the debt? Is it one or the other or is 
it both?
<P>
	The deficit is defined in layman terms as that which is spent in 
excess of what is generated in a year. It is an annual amount. It is a 
deficit if the government spends more than what it brings in and it 
is a surplus if the government spends less than what it brings in.
<P>
	The debt is the amount of money that is the accumulated series 
of deficits over a number of years that go all the way back to 
Confederation. Thirty-two years ago our debt was zero. This debt is 
an accumulated amount of deficits since Confederation, but in the 
last 31 years we have managed with the two status quo parties, the 
Conservatives and the Liberals, to inch our way up toward $600 
billion in debt.
<P>
	The government identified the deficit as the problem. This 
finance minister said that the deficit as a percentage of GDP will 
come down to 3 per cent. He set a target.  Not only did he say he set 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="868"> 868 </A></B>
<P>
a target but he is going to beat that target. In this way he is going to 
solve the problem.
<P>
	If we look at the definition of a deficit and the definition of debt, 
is this government solving the problem or is the government adding 
to the problem? The problem is the debt because it keeps growing 
as the deficit, although it is shrinking with this lower target. Is the 
government adding to the problem or is it solving or eliminating 
the problem?
<P>
<B>(2010 )</B>
<P>
	I submit that by using the deficit as a percentage of GDP and 
continually spending more money than what we bring in this 
government is adding to the problem. Yes it can brag all it wants 
that it is a lot less than the previous government and is this not a lot 
better and therefore we can keep spending money over here for this 
program and keep spending over here to subsidize business on that 
program and we can keep wasteful spending up. But it is not 
solving the problem. It is an illusion. It is duplicity. It is 
hypocritical.
<P>
	The government failed to recognize the problem. The problem is 
the debt. The best way to measure the fight against the debt is to 
look at the debt as a percentage of GDP instead of the deficit as a 
percentage of GDP. If the percentage of debt to GDP goes down, we 
are now solving the problem. We are now adding credibility.
<P>
	I know the finance minister is aware of this. I know the finance 
minister knows that is the button this party was going to push. I 
know because in the Standing Committee on Finance I listened to 
all the leading economists talk about this: the fact that this 
government was going too slow in its cuts; the fact that there was 
going to be a bigger price to pay for future generations. That aside, 
what Canada needs and what Canada must have sooner than later is 
a surplus budget and it must stop deficit spending or financing. I 
will come back to the deficit and the debt as a percentage and see 
how this government is attacking it on that basis.
<P>
	The finance minister talks about a plan and setting targets. He 
should identify the right problem and use the correct measurement 
for achieving his target. It is amazing that when we analyse the 
budget we find many facts that contradict the finance minister's 
claim that the balance sheets of this country are in good order. Are 
they in good order? Let us take a look.
<P>
	The government had the privilege of running the country when 
the economy started to come out of a recession. How do I know 
that? The first thing in the budget documents and budget analyses 
of the various years shows that when this government came into 
power revenues were only $116 billion. They go to $135 billion and 
they project to $141 billion in 1997-98, revenues due to the growth 
in the economy, due to the recession starting to be eliminated and 
things improving somewhat. Revenues. This government has had 
the benefit of  revenue increases of $25 billion. I would also submit 
and remind Canadian taxpayers that some of that extra revenue is 
about $3 billion to $5 billion in tax increases the finance minister 
imposed in the two previous budgets.
<P>
	Let us look at program spending which is an objective of the 
Reform Party. When this government came in it showed program 
spending at $120 billion. I am not sure but I seem to recall this 
government wanted to blame the previous government for billions 
of dollars and somehow or other it inflated it. It was the other guys' 
fault. I believe that high number on program spending the 
government uses is a bit inflated. Nevertheless, program spending 
has decreased by $14 billion.
<P>
	That is where the error has been. In the first year of government 
it only cut $2 billion, the next year another $5 billion. Its cutting 
habits have gone too slow. Its cutting habits have not kept up with 
the interest costs. That is what the problem is.
<P>
	Let us look at the interest costs. The public debt charges when 
the government came in in 1993-94 were only $38 billion. That was 
bargain basement. Now the government is projecting $47.8 billion, 
close to $48 billion, a $10 billion increase. What is the purpose of 
all these cuts if it is only going to go to service the interest costs to 
service the debt? That is my case. The debt is the problem, not the 
deficit.
<P>
	Thank God the interest rates are low. Thank God this 
government can stand up and brag about how interest rates are 3 
per cent lower than a year ago, six months ago or whatever. 
Imagine what kind of statement this would be if it were not like 
that.
<P>
<B>(2015 )</B>
<P>
	The interest costs to service the debt are proof that the deficit is 
not the problem, the debt is the problem. The deficit is also the area 
for which the finance minister has been getting lots of compliments 
from certain members of the financial community because the 
deficit is going from $42 billion down to a projected $17 billion. 
During the whole course of the government's mandate it is still 
spending more than it brings in.
<P>
	Yes, it is going down. Yes, it is good he set a target. Yes, it is 
good he is meeting that target, but the target he is setting and the 
measurement of the economy he is using is not solving the 
problem. It is adding to the problem.
<P>
	What happens when we take a look at the revenues that have 
been generated, the cuts in spending, the servicing charges? When 
we add all that up what do we notice? Something very interesting. 
After four years of government management under this finance 
minister, the master of myth, we end up with revenues up $25 
billion and, guess what, the deficit down by $25 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="869"> 869 </A></B>
<P>
	What is left at the end of the day? There is still 17 per cent 
left and the Liberals brag that it is only three per cent or might 
end up being two per cent. Who cares? Are they not missing the 
point? Is it not the point that we need to solve the debt, that we 
have to make a payment somewhere along the line on that debt, 
that we have to have a surplus budget in somewhere in there?
<P>
	That is why we have argued for and pushed all along for a 
balanced budget. That is the advantage of having a government that 
during the course of its mandate makes a commitment to the 
Canadian taxpayers and says: ``Sooner than later we will balance 
this budget. Sooner than later we will get our financial house in 
order so that we sooner than later will break the back of the deficit. 
Sooner or later we will have a good balance sheet for the nation''. 
The way to do that is with a balanced budget, not leaving with a $17 
billion deficit and claiming victory.
<P>
	At the end of four years the government, and let me be accurate 
here, will have added $111.7 billion; almost $112 billion it will 
have added to the debt. It came in here with $508 billion debt and it 
runs the country for four years and just after four years, never mind 
if it wants to take another year at it, it adds $112 billion to the debt 
and says that is good financial management.
<P>
	It says we can play with the future lives of our children and our 
grandchildren, that we can gamble on interest rates staying low, 
that we can gamble on uncertainties in the economy and the global 
that we are all participants in. That stuff is all okay because come 
hell or high water we will meet our targets and we will beat our 
targets and we will keep our feet to the fire.
<P>
	It is all great rhetoric. It is beautiful rhetoric. It is all the right 
buttons to push to convince people when you are trying to fool 
them that you are solving the problem.
<P>
	My speech today is intended to shift the debate to the problem. I 
believe the problem for all economists, for all business people and 
for all taxpayers is the debt. The sooner we shift the debate to the 
debt and look for ways to measure our success against that evil 
monster, the sooner we will start to solve our problems.
<P>
	Let us get to the GDP and using the debt as a measurement of 
economic growth. I am submitting that a truer measurement in 
using projections in how the economy is doing is the debt to GDP 
ratio. If we take the actual numbers, looking at the budget from 
1993-94 when the GDP was $712 billion to a projected $806 billion 
in 1996-97, it shows actual numbers and it shows growth of about 
3.3 per cent.
<P>
	Then we take a look at the debt as a percentage of GDP from the 
government's first year at 71.3 per cent to 72.8 per cent. Did it 
solve the problem in year one or did it add to the problem? Under 
the truer measurement it added to the problem. Even those 
renowned economists  from the Fraser Institute better be taking 
note and paying attention to this.
<P>
<B>(2020)</B>
<P>
	The next year, 1994-95, the GDP went up from 72.8 per cent to 
74.2 per cent. Did the government solve the problem, reduce the 
problem or did it add to the problem? It added to the problem.
<P>
	This year the government is projecting a further increase that is 
smaller. Nevertheless there is another one-half of one per cent 
increase in the debt to GDP ratio. That means the economy is not 
improving. Our financial resources, our financial situation, our net 
worth is not improving; it is diminishing, it is decreasing. Yet 
throughout the past three years all we have heard is how we have 
set our targets, met targets, beat our targets and how everything is 
so wonderful.
<P>
	A colleague of mine mentioned a statistic earlier in the debate. 
An Environics poll asked whether budget goes fast enough, deep 
enough and is it the right way. Roughly 60 per cent to 70 per cent 
said no and yet the government is claiming victory.
<P>
	We arrived at an interesting point in the budget presentation by 
the finance minister. This was where the master of myth started to 
show his best stuff. He projected on the net public debt that two 
years from now, although we have been averaging 3.3 per cent, the 
GDP will grow by 4.3 per cent. He projected a whole per cent more. 
What did he base it on? I do not know. I sat on the Standing 
Committee on Finance where all the leading economists said that 
for the next two years the most we could hope for was 2 per cent to 
2.5 per cent. No, all of a sudden the government can put 4.3 per 
cent out there.
<P>
	Then with the deficit at $17 billion, that number as a percentage, 
the government said we went down to 73.7. Now the government is 
agreeing with us that is the better measurement. It is agreeing with 
us that is a good way of looking at it and two years from now things 
will get better. These are projections.
<P>
	Earlier the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance 
said we may not hit these, these are just projections. That is what 
scares me. It is the uncertainty of meeting these targets that could 
hurt.
<P>
	If the government wants to solve the problem it has to stand up 
and identify the right problem, which is what this party is trying to 
do. We are trying to set the debate on the right issue. The issue is 
the debt and the best way to measure our progress in the fight 
against the debt, that monster, is through the debt as a percentage of 
GDP. We get to see how our economy is growing. We get to see the 
share of that growth, the share of the value we produce annually, 
what we generate in sales, what our debt load is against that. That is 
what tells us whether we have a good credit rating rating.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="870"> 870 </A></B>
<P>
	That is what helps the financial community continue to reinvest 
the money we have to borrow from the foreign market. That is 
what tells the brokers of this country that it has its resources in 
order. That is what will tell the taxpayers there will be a reward 
at the end of the tunnel.
<P>
	After we have a few surplus budgets and we have paid down that 
debt somewhat we do not have to do it; we can carry it. Once we 
have a surplus budget, which includes debt servicing, that is when 
we have a balance sheet in good order.
<P>
	The government will exit having added $112 billion to the debt, 
bringing it to $620 billion from $508 billion. I know I am repeating 
this. I said this earlier. That is the legacy the government is 
bragging about. That is the deeper hole it has dug while it has had 
the privilege and the honour to run the country, to try to do what is 
right for the people of the country. That is what it has really 
contributed.
<P>
	Another day older and deeper in debt, as the old song goes. How 
that represents good sound financial management, how that 
represents breaking the back of this evil monster, this evil problem, 
is beyond me.
<P>
<B>(2025 )</B>
<P>
	We have suggested and argued for a balanced budget in the 
House. To this day not one member, not even the finance minister, 
will give us a date at which we will see a balanced budget. It is just 
promised.
<P>
	It is on a wing and a prayer that the economy will continue to 
grow as it does. That is what they are hoping. Keep interest rates 
down. Sneak in a few tax treatment preference changes. They will 
not call them tax increases. Take away a few more loopholes. They 
will not call them tax increases. Eventually they will get to a 
balanced budget somewhere, whenever. It will be soon because we 
have gone, six, five, four, three, two-but, but, but. It is those buts I 
am worried about.
<P>
	If the government had really listened and had the political will to 
do what had to be done and skipped the argument of whether it 
would be over a three or four-year period, it could have produced a 
balanced budget over a fixed period of time and done it as soon as 
possible in its mandate so that the benefits would reflect in lower 
interest costs, especially considering the size of the debt.
<P>
	We have done the checks and the calculations. The difference 
would have been $62 billion less to the debt. If the government had 
listened to the Reform Party it would not exit with a $620 billion 
debt. It would have exited with a $580 billion debt. Even a Reform 
Party government would have added to the debt, we acknowledge 
that, but only at half the amount. We would have a surplus by the 
end of our mandate.
<P>
	Let us talk about the difference. There would have been $62 
billion less added to the debt. That means, depending on the 
interest rates, $3 billion less in interest payments. That is the 
reward, the advantage. Then the government could have decided 
whether to put that toward programs spending, education, health or 
welfare or apply it to the debt. Pay down the debt. Service the debt 
or reduce taxes and offer tax relief if the economy is strong enough.
<P>
	If the percentage of debt to GDP ratio starts to come down by 1 
per cent to 9 per cent, perhaps 2 per cent per year, there will be 
more flexibility. The government does not have that flexibility. 
This is a very dangerous budget. Liberals are acting as if they have 
succeeded. They are already starting to spend money as though 
they have money to spend. They are already redistributing how 
they are to do social programs when they are in fact looking for 
ways to increase tax revenues. They are looking for ways to 
convince us they have the answers to a very difficult problem.
<P>
	I submit this whole debate on fiscal reform and on what is in the 
best interests of the country lies in identifying the right problems. I 
humbly admit that the government presented a red book in which it 
made a lot of promises. It has broken a lot of those promises. It 
seems it checked to see which way the political wind was blowing 
and that is the direction it took.
<P>
	The Liberals recognized that we agreed with the way a lot of 
people were thinking. Now they have copied and followed some of 
the recommendations we have made. However, it is unfortunate 
they did not do it fast enough. They still have the opportunity to do 
it with one more budget coming up. They could still address the 
waste in government spending. They could still cut about $4 billion 
to $5 billion in spending.
<P>
	I am sorry to say the government will not do it. It is unfortunate 
that this budget is more of the same; feel good, everything is okay, 
do not worry, be happy.
<P>
	The last time the Prime Minister spoke and behaved that way we 
almost lost the nation.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to speak on second reading of Bill C-10, the borrowing authority 
bill.
<P>
	The government is asking this honourable House for $18.7 
billion of borrowing authority for the 1996-97 fiscal year. This 
amount is comprised of the financial requirements stated in the 
budget for 1996-97 of $13.7 billion, exchange fund account 
earnings of $1 billion and a $4 billion non-lapsing amount.
<P>
<B>(2030 )</B>
<P>
	As in previous years, the amount of borrowing authority 
requested in the bill is directly connected to the financial 
requirements set out in the 1996 federal budget. The financial 
aspect of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="871"> 871 </A></B>
<P>
bill is also contained  in the budget plan tabled in the House of 
Commons by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	I urge the House to give unanimous approval of this legislation 
without delay. The Minister of Finance in the budget speech states: 
``Let us act not as special interests but as stewards of the national 
interest, knowing that the destiny of our children is in our hands''.
<P>
	I remind the House that the word economics derives from the 
Greek word meaning household management. The purpose of 
economic life is not simply to gain material satisfaction but to 
support families and the social institutions and identities that 
evolve from families as the fundamental units of human society 
and human actions.
<P>
	Having said this, it should be noted that the 1996 budget does 
just that. It consolidates and extends the actions taken under the 
comprehensive strategy set out in the 1994-95 budget, together to 
help Canadians secure their future, to secure their financial future, 
to secure the future of the social programs, to invest in the future of 
our people, our families, our communities and our country.
<P>
	The 1996 budget is the third mile post in the government's 
journey to securing fiscal stability and a vibrant, dynamic and 
competitive economy for Canadians who must compete in the 
tough global arena. Working together with the 1994-95 budget, this 
budget continues a comprehensive strategy for federal finances that 
is determined, measured and responsible; determined because we 
are not letting up. As the Minister of Finance emphasized, the 
attack on the deficit is irrevocable and irreversible. We will balance 
the books. Furthermore, we will put the debt to GDP ratio on a 
constant downward track year after year after year.
<P>
	It is measured because our fiscal action plan is not 
indiscriminate and mindless but structured to a pace that is 
conducive to efficient adaptation. It is designed not as a quick fix 
but to achieve long term and permanent progress. It is responsible 
because it is a strategy that involves carefully weighing the needs 
of the economy and society and equally carefully designing the 
policy options to meet those needs.
<P>
	Just as important, we are striking the balance necessary to keep 
Canadians onside for our deficit reduction efforts. There remains 
no question about the need for dramatic, disciplined action. High 
public sector deficits and debt have sapped confidence, soaked up 
domestic savings and led to a sharp increase in the country's net 
international indebtedness.
<P>
	Canadians were paying a painful price through the punishing 
pressure that high deficits placed on interest rates. This drains 
consumer and business investment and drives down job creation. 
The lethal combination of high interest rates and deficit borrowing 
also meant that a  growing share of government resources must go 
to interest payments on a growing debt.
<P>
	This year those charges will cost the federal government $47 
billion, money that cannot go to lowering taxes, aiding those in 
need and helping the economy create new jobs.
<P>
	Tackling Canada's fiscal problem is a fundamental component 
for national growth, new jobs and economic security. With the first 
two budgets the government began the process of restoring 
Canada's finances and restoring credibility to the government's 
fiscal policy after years of missed deficit targets.
<P>
	By setting credible two-year rolling deficit targets, by using 
prudent economic assumptions for fiscal planning purposes and by 
establishing substantial contingency reserves to handle the impact 
of unforeseen economic development on the achievement of the 
deficit target, credibility is being restored to the nation's finances.
<P>
<B>(2035 )</B>
<P>
	The first two budgets implemented unprecedented reductions to 
program spending that are structural in nature and extend to the 
medium term planning horizon.
<P>
	With these measures, the 1995-96 and 1996-97 deficit targets, 
bringing the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP, are secure despite 
lower GDP growth than had been originally assumed. Contributing 
to this progress is the fact that interest rates are also significantly 
lower than projected. This has neutralized the adverse affects of 
lower growth on the deficit.
<P>
	The measures in the 1996 budget consolidate and extend those in 
the first two budgets and further contribute to the economic and 
financial objectives. We have maintained our focus on reducing 
program spending because the debt is a problem created by 
government and the solution should focus on cutting in our own 
backyard.
<P>
	There are no tax rate increases in the 1996 budget, not personal 
taxes, not corporate taxes, not excise taxes. Expenditure cuts in the 
1996 budget amount to $1.9 billion in 1998-99 and build on the 
reductions of the two previous budgets to keep program spending 
on a downward track.
<P>
	Here is a point that must be emphasized. Of the cumulative fiscal 
actions we will have taken from 1994-95 to 1998-99, a full 87 per 
cent have been expenditure savings. Together the three budgets will 
contribute $26.1 billion in savings for 1997-98.
<P>
	This action, together with reform of the employment insurance 
program, will ensure we hit the new deficit target to bring the 
deficit down to 2 per cent of GDP. Through budget action, we have 
set a further $28.9 billion in savings for 1998-99. This means that 
the deficit will continue to fall.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="872"> 872 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no question that historic action has been taken. 
Program spending, that is everything but interest payments, will 
have declined six straight years through to 1998-99. Relative to 
the size of the economy, program spending will fall to its lowest 
level since 1949-50.
<P>
	Over the last two and a half years, Canadians have turned to 
governments not to invent jobs but to provide an economic and 
social environment that will encourage the economic growth that 
makes new jobs possible.
<P>
	We are proud of our record to date. Since taking office in 1993, 
unemployment has dropped by two full percentage points and 
about half a million jobs have been created, mostly in the private 
sector and almost exclusively by small and medium size 
enterprises.
<P>
	We realize that there is much work ahead. Unemployment 
remains far too high and there is widespread national worry about 
the job future for young Canadians, older displaced workers and for 
women re-entering the workforce.
<P>
	The government is intent on taking durable, meaningful steps 
forward. Rather than relying on short term direct spending 
programs, this more meaningful approach is being taken. It 
emphasized collaboration with partners and strategic investments 
to steer the forces of economic change toward greater employment.
<P>
	First things first. For the sustained economic growth needed to 
deliver new jobs, we must start by securing Canada's economic 
fundamentals. That means getting the deficit down and keeping it 
down. High persisting deficits go hand in hand with high interest 
rates. High interest rates discourage investment borrowing and 
consumer spending and ultimately discourage jobs.
<P>
	We also need to keep inflation down. Low inflation reduces 
pressure on interest rates and lowers business overhead. Of course, 
keeping the cost of doing business to a minimum will encourage 
investment and make us more competitive abroad.
<P>
	Beyond providing a sound economic framework, the 
government has looked seriously at what more it can and should 
do. Some areas are so important to Canada's future prospects that 
they warrant significantly increased efforts from the federal 
government. Therefore the government has concentrated on youth, 
innovation, technology and trade, which is set out in the budget 
plan.
<P>
<B>(2040 )</B>
<P>
	It also should be noted that financial institutions have a key role 
to play in facilitating the growth of Canadian business. Over the 
past year the banks have made progress in dealing with the 
concerns of small business. However, more needs to be done to 
ensure that financial institutions provide the best possible 
financing for growing export and knowledge based business, and 
for all small and medium size business.
<P>
	Therefore the government will work with business and all 
financial institutions, including the banks and insurance 
companies, to ensure that this progress continues.
<P>
	A temporary tax on large deposit taking institutions, including 
the banks, was introduced in last year's budget and it will be 
extended for a further year. Currently the legislation governing 
financial institutions is being reviewed with a view to improving 
the framework established in 1992. The conclusion is that the 
financial sector has yet to fully adjust to this framework. Therefore 
the present restriction on banks selling insurance will be 
maintained.
<P>
	The present framework for selling insurance through agents and 
brokers will be preserved and the white paper covering this and all 
other aspects regarding financial institutions under review will be 
released in the coming weeks.
<P>
	In conclusion, since I am sharing my time with another member, 
I want to emphasize that this budget is a budget that secures the 
future of all Canadians. It secures their financial-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry the hon. member's time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
finished up by saying that this budget secures a future for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The point to be made is that it secures an indebted future for all 
Canadians because in the life of this government it is going to add 
$100 billion and more to the debt.
<P>
	If you take an 8 per cent interest charge on that amount that 
means $8 billion each and every year from now to practically 
eternity that are going to be paid in extra taxes to service the debt 
being incurred by this government.
<P>
	I want to know how this member thinks debt secures the future 
of Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this budget. I 
maintain my position that it secures the future of all Canadians.
<P>
	It secures the future of seniors and of youth. With respect to the 
growing national debt, I am proud to be a part of this government. 
This is the first government that has addressed the financial and 
economic issues of the country. It has also preserved the social 
programs. It has concerned itself with the poor, with the aged, with 
the needy and with single parents. It has addressed these issues.
<P>
	The Reform Party is concerned about the rich and about 
preserving economic issues, not for the economic concerns of the 
people of Central Nova, the people that need to have these social 
programs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="873"> 873 </A></B>
<P>
and need to know  that they have a Liberal government that will 
protect and preserve them.
<P>
	I am proud of this budget and so are the people in Central Nova.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would remind colleagues that we are 
talking about Bill C-10 which is a borrowing bill. We are not 
talking about the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for reminding hon. members that we are debating Bill 
C-10. I am pleased to participate in the debate on this.
<P>
	Bill C-10 is an act to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal 
year beginning April 1, 1996. Under the borrowing authority act 
the Minister of Finance with the approval of the Governor in 
Council may raise money under the Financial Administration Act 
by way of a loan or by the issue and/or sale of securities of Canada.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister 
of Finance on his outstanding effort, not just with this budget, but 
for the previous two budgets as well.
<P>
<B>(2045 )</B>
<P>
	For the first time in a decade we have a finance minister who not 
only sets objectives but he meets them. As well, he often exceeds 
them. In the platform book we promised to reduce the deficit to 3 
per cent of the GDP by the end of our mandate. We started at 
almost 6 per cent when we took office and at the end of four years it 
will be down to 2 per cent.
<P>
	Those efforts have allowed the Canadian government to restore 
its credibility, credibility not only among those in financial circles 
but among Canadian taxpayers as well. Canadians now feel they 
are getting value for the money they send to Ottawa every year.
<P>
	Not since the 1980s have Canadians been able to see the light at 
the end of the deficit tunnel. We all agree on the need to eliminate 
the deficit. Now that objective can be clearly seen on the horizon. 
When we arrive there we can start paying down the public debt, as 
the spokesman for the Reform was saying in his speech, which 
otherwise would be a burden on our children. I agree with him.
<P>
	Both the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party have been asking 
what is in this budget in job creation. The simple answer is: plenty. 
However, we cannot look at just one budget; we have to look at the 
government's entire program. Interest rates are consistently low 
and have been for quite some time. The spread between Canadian 
and American rates has almost been eliminated. The dollar is stable 
at a level that encourages exports and low interest rates. The deficit 
has been brought under control and on target. These things together 
have set the foundation and financial environment for a solid 
economy capable of creating jobs now and into the future.
<P>
	In the month of February alone, 44,000 jobs were created. There 
are 170,000 more jobs in Canada today than there were in July last 
year. Critics on the other side ignore these significant 
accomplishments and have adopted the attitude of: What have you 
done for me lately?
<P>
	This government does not want to sit on its laurels when it comes 
to job creation for Canadians. In the high tech field the government 
is creating Technology Partnership Canada, a $250 million 
program to facilitate the economic development of new 
technologies, technologies such as environmental management, 
advanced materials and manufacturing processes and the growing 
biotechnology field. As well, Technology Partnership Canada will 
solidify and build on the gains we have made in the aerospace 
sector.
<P>
	We are continuing our efforts to help businesses of all sizes. 
Additional funding will be provided to both the Business 
Development Bank and Export Development Corporation to create 
new opportunities for business.
<P>
	Team Canada trade missions have been an outstanding success. 
The delegations led by the Prime Minister have secured $20 billion 
in contracts and deals for Canadian companies. Ours is an export 
economy and every billion dollars in exports is worth over 11,000 
jobs here in Canada.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development is taking a lead 
in changing the Canadian focus from unemployment to 
employment. We are increasing the earned income tax credit to 
encourage people to re-enter the labour market. Both the 
educational expenses deduction and the transfer of tuition and 
education credits will be increased by 25 per cent. As well, more 
people will be eligible for the child care expenses deduction, 
including high school students. Single people will now be able to 
claim credits currently available to couples. In two years these 
efforts will put almost $300 million into the pockets of Canadians 
and will allow them to meet the challenges of today's job market.
<P>
	For the young people of Canada, the government is working hard 
on employment opportunities. For many years young people were 
told that if they worked hard to get an education there would be a 
better job for them later. The economy has been slow in fulfilling 
that bargain so the federal government is stepping up its efforts. 
The government is doubling its funding for summer job creation 
for students. An additional $315 million over three years will be set 
aside to create employment opportunities for youth.
<P>
	One of the Canada employment offices for youth is usually set 
up each summer in my riding of Parkdale-High Park. I know this 
additional funding will be welcomed by the young people looking 
for jobs this summer.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="874"> 874 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2050 )</B>
<P>
	The Team Canada approach that has been successful overseas 
will be directed at home to co-operate with businesses to create 
entry level jobs for young people.
<P>
	It is easy to see the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois are 
wrong when they say that this budget does nothing about jobs. 
Employment is the number one priority of this government and the 
facts and initiatives speak for themselves. The March 6 budget is 
about more than jobs. It is about promoting fairness and securing 
futures for Canadians.
<P>
	The government has listened to the concerns of parents about the 
taxation of child support payments. Divorces granted after May 1, 
1997 will require that parents who receive support payments will 
not have to pay taxes on that money. The total amount will go to 
support the children. As well, the government will introduce 
changes to the child support guidelines under the Divorce Act to 
ensure equitable support payments.
<P>
	In recent months there has been much talk about how Canada's 
pension system is collapsing. Nothing could be further from the 
truth and the government is acting now to restore confidence. 
Starting in the year 2001, senior citizens will receive a new seniors 
benefit directed to those in need that will combine the old age 
security, the government income supplement, age and pension 
income tax credits. Seventy per cent of all seniors will be as well or 
better off under the new system. Indeed 90 per cent of single senior 
women will benefit under the new seniors benefit. A senior couple 
with outside income totalling $40,000 a year will receive over 
$7,500 in tax free benefits under the new system.
<P>
	In an effort to help all Canadians, particularly younger 
Canadians, the government is eliminating the seven year carry over 
rule on RRSP contributions. In the future Canadians will be able to 
carry forward unused RRSP contributions for life so that young 
people, young families making sacrifices now to pay mortgages 
and educate their children will be able to make up for lost 
contributions in the future. This measure will help people better 
prepare for their retirement.
<P>
	Canada's banking system has benefited greatly over the last 
couple of years enjoying record profits while most Canadians have 
been tightening their belts. The Minister of Finance has indicated 
that the special tax on banks will continue. As well, to maintain the 
present diversity of financial institutions, the government will 
uphold the ban on banks in the direct selling of insurance profits.
<P>
	The budget is about hope and opportunity for the future. 
Measures taken will enable young people to get jobs they have 
been trained to perform. Seniors and those preparing to retire will 
be able to plan with confidence for their future incomes. Canadians 
in all walks of life will feel more secure and hopeful as they see the  
economy progressing forward with jobs and opportunities.
<P>
	Most important, this budget is about trust. In 1993 the people of 
Canada put their trust in the Liberal Party to do things right and to 
get the economy moving again. I believe we have earned that trust 
and we will continue to earn it under the sound leadership of the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In conclusion I invite the government members, the official 
opposition and members of the third party to give speedy passage 
to Bill C-10 so that job creation can continue as promised in the 
budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
asked that we give speedy passage to this bill. I was thinking the 
reason he wanted the speedy passage was so the government could 
raise some more money from the money markets to keep itself in 
business. He may wish to refute that.
<P>
	At election time this government ran on a platform of jobs, jobs, 
jobs. I am sure we all remember that great slogan people voted for: 
jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	The government introduced the infrastructure program in which 
it would use $6 billion of borrowed money in order to put 
Canadians to work. It sounded good. However the President of the 
Treasury Board was before one of the committees I sat on last year. 
I asked him to tell us how many jobs this $6 billion infrastructure 
program had created. He sheepishly said as far as he was aware it 
had created 8,000 permanent jobs. That is $6 billion of borrowed 
money in the taxpayers' name created 8,000 permanent jobs. Those 
are the figures of the President of the Treasury Board. They are not 
my figures.
<P>
<B>(2055)</B>
<P>
	We would have been far better off to put the money in the bank 
and give the interest to the people rather than putting them back to 
work. The interest would have worked out to about three-quarters 
of a million dollars per job created. The program did not work but 
we are now more in debt.
<P>
	Just a couple of weeks ago the Prime Minister rose in the House 
as we all know and he laid a heavy responsibility on the private 
sector by saying: ``It is now up to you to create jobs, jobs, jobs 
because we are a miserable failure at it over on this side of the 
House''.
<P>
	I ask the member: What is this government going to do that will 
really provide meaningful, productive, creative jobs that people 
can be proud of and that they can be sure they will keep for the rest 
of their lives, rather than these temporary make work projects that 
are done on borrowed money?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is clear the hon. member did not read 
what is in the budget. The hon. member did not hear a word of what 
I said. My whole 10 minutes was to  emphasize how we have set the 
environment since we came into power to create jobs, create jobs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="875"> 875 </A></B>
<P>
for young people, create jobs in high technology. He did not hear 
the Minister of Finance. He did not hear me when I said we are 
going to use the Team Canada approach that has been so successful 
internationally in generating $20 billion worth of deals and 
contracts for Canadians. For every billion dollars of exports 
generated 11,000 jobs are created. The hon. member does not seem 
to take that into account at all.
<P>
	The Team Canada approach was used in the infrastructure 
program. The municipalities and the provinces told us what their 
needs were. It is the first time the three levels of government got 
together to meet the needs of the local communities. Each level 
contributed $2 billion. It did create immediate jobs which was the 
intent of that program.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member will first of all read what is in the throne 
speech, read what is in the budget and listen when we are debating 
in this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak tonight to the supply motion. But, as you may well 
understand, this motion would not have been tabled without the 
budget since the amount of money set aside is based on what is in 
the budget. I will therefore establish a very close link between the 
two and talk about this budget, as my hon. colleague did at length.
<P>
	I know that, the day the budget was tabled, many Canadians and 
Quebecers were relieved to learn that there were no tax increases. 
This is quite a normal reaction at first. Nonetheless, for all curious 
but perceptive people who call a spade a spade, this budget 
contains bad news, which were announced last year.
<P>
	Since the bad news was announced last year but included in the 
budget this year-it has even started to bear fruit-the government 
says that there is no bad news since it was announced last year. We 
should find an appropriate adjective to describe this way of 
submitting budgets, because, since taking office in 1993, the 
Liberals have brought down three budgets.
<P>
<B>(2100)</B>
<P>
	In only one budget out of three did the bad news it contained 
materialize in the year in which it was announced. And I must say 
that this first budget, tabled in 1994, was pretty terrible, in that it 
stuck a direct blow at the unemployed, those jobless men and 
women who need the kind of assistance provided through the UI 
program. It struck a direct blow at the people of the Maritime 
provinces in particular, who had voted Liberal full spin, yet finding 
themselves, without having been consulted even for five minutes, 
faced with a budget announcing a $630 million cut in UI benefits 
for Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	That was the first budget, the one containing the bad news for 
that year and years to come, because the big cut, on which the 
government's claims of sound management are based, the bulk is in 
the UI program: $2.4 billion per year to begin with.
<P>
	Then, in 1995, the bad news having already started taking effect, 
more bad news was announced for the following year, this year, in 
the form of additional UI cuts, on top of the Canada social transfer: 
$2.5 billion this year and another $4.5 billion next year.
<P>
	As a result, this year's budget looks pretty good, because the bad 
news, the worst part of it, news that can be the dramatic in some 
cases, was announced earlier. Now, they can rub their hands 
contentedly and say: ``This is a good budget''.
<P>
	We should find an appropriate adjective for a budget which does 
not really say things, a budget which announces now reforms that 
will affect pensions in five years, a budget which merely says that 
things will be done later. Some people think: ``Whew, it will be for 
later''. And since the other measures were announced last year, or 
the year before, some say: ``Things are going well''.
<P>
	This type of management has little to do with transparency, to 
say the least. If one reads this budget without knowing what is said 
in the budgets of the last two years, one cannot see that the bad 
news was announced before and will be implemented this year, 
often in a pretty dramatic way.
<P>
	Can the ordinary citizen figure out what is really going on? It is 
pretty hard to see through this budget. There is a place where he 
will figure it out though. It is in his workplace, assuming he has 
one. There he will realize that this good budget will cost him 
dearly, especially if he is a low or middle income earner.
<P>
	There are some who pay a high price for the feeling of 
satisfaction of our Minister of Finance, who proudly wears a 
carnation on his lapel. I am not referring to businesses or high 
income earners. Not at all. The fact is that those who are paying 
that price should not be the ones affected by such drastic cuts.
<P>
<B>(2105)</B>
<P>
	Take the UI reform for instance. This cut was announced last 
year, so much so that it was already factored in-the government 
was so sure of itself that the House of Commons and everything 
else did not mean a whole lot-so the cuts were factored in the 
budget for 1996-1997. This means an additional cut of at least $800 
million for this year and of $1.9 billion in the years to come. But 
what does that mean, in the years to come? In three years, or four 
years. In fact, it will be in the year 2000. But as soon as next year, 
these cuts will already reach $1.2 billion.
<P>
	What does that mean? Let me repeat this, since, as we all know, 
repetition is the mother of science. Let us take  the maritimes and 
the province of Quebec for example. In the maritimes or Atlantic 
Canada, since 1995, UI benefits have decreased by $630 million 
every year. This is a lot of money for Atlantic Canada, especially 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="876"> 876 </A></B>
<P>
since the unemployment rate is very high in these areas. And 
starting this year, there will be a new cut that will reach, in three 
years time, $944 million a year.
<P>
	For Atlantic Canada, a cut of $944 million distributed among all 
its regions will mean that a lot of people will be affected. It also 
means that these people, who would have had otherwise hundreds 
and thousands of dollars more to spend, will have to do without. 
We are not talking about cuts of $100 a year, or $200 a year, but 
rather cuts totalling hundreds and thousands of dollars every year 
in provinces that can ill afford it. And to pay what? To pay the 
deficit. We finally get to the truth here.
<P>
	This seems like a good budget, where we all wash our hands and 
nobody pays. But it is not true. There are people who pay. Quebec 
got $735 million less in 1994. And now the federal government is 
taking away $640 million more from us. Do not tell me that this 
$1.375 billion cut will have no impact and that ordinary people, 
folks who are not at all well off will not suffer from that.
<P>
	But that is not all. It has an economic impact. You cannot deprive 
an economically weak region of that kind of money without 
weakening its economy even more.
<P>
	Let us get back to the main objective of these deficit related cuts. 
Is it a sound decision to force regions whose economy is already in 
trouble into a situation that will inevitably worsen the general state 
of the economy and increase social spending in these areas? It is 
not a sound decision. I am sorry. The minister, Paul Martin, may be 
proud of himself, but I find this rather tragic. There are people who 
pay, and they pay dearly.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Excuse me, but the member has forgotten 
that it is not allowed to mention the name of a minister.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> The hon. Minister of Finance. It is much nicer 
anyway.
<P>
<B>(2110)</B>
<P>
	Basically, what we need to wonder, as Canadians and as 
Quebecers, is just how, after these budget choices, after all the 
polite and general small talk of the budget, we will face the 
economic and social realities?
<P>
	I must pause here to add the bad news announced last year, 
which will have a dramatic impact on provincial budgets and on the 
most disadvantaged once again, or on the middle class: the 
Canadian social transfer. It will be cut by $2.5 billion, which will 
force the provinces to make painful choices between education, 
welfare and health. These are painful and agonizing choices, which 
will have economic and social consequences.
<P>
	It is not true that this budget contains no problems, that it is a 
good budget, that the government is headed  toward its objectives, 
that everything is fine, that everything is going along well and thus 
the economy will start picking up. It does not strike me as 
appropriate to say such things. Why has unemployment insurance 
been the target of so many attacks? Why? The gist of the 
government's defence was that continuation of social programs 
must be assured. But that cannot be applied to UI. It is a 
self-sustaining plan as it is required to be, and one that is sustaining 
itself admirably well since the first cuts.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, are you aware that, without the additional cuts in 
UI, by the end of 1996 there would be a surplus, an accumulated 
reserve of at least $4.3 billion? So, this reform, which will have 
such serious effects, is being launched despite a reserve of $4.3 
billion and the rock hard certainty that, with the cuts approved in 
1994, next year there will be another surplus of at least $2.4 billion. 
My figures are very conservative.
<P>
	This means, that at the end of next year, there will be an 
accumulated surplus, very conservatively, without the announced 
reform, of at least $7 billion. Is this the program to be cut to bits? It 
is time to call a spade a spade. This so-called reform, counter 
reform of unemployment insurance is aimed simply at reducing, 
very temporarily and very artificially, the deficit or we could say it 
allows the minister to reach many of his objectives, because, let us 
be honest, that is what it is all about.
<P>
	It must be said, however, that this approach to reaching 
objectives is faulty, because, if we sink-and I hope we will 
not-in two years' time into a deep recession, where the number of 
unemployed is such that the accumulated reserve does not meet the 
need, the government will not only not collect any more 
contributions, it will have to borrow. This is not a real response to 
the needs of the fight against the deficit. It is wrong. Unless, and 
this is unthinkable, unless the government decided at the start that, 
after collecting such excessive contributions to unemployment 
insurance, if necessary, rather than borrow, it would further cut 
benefits, this sort of action would be not only inexcusable, it would 
be downright manipulation.
<P>
<B>(2115)</B>
<P>
	If the government really wants to get down to the problem of 
employment and of preparing Canadians and Quebecers for the 
labour market and really wants jobs to be created, I can tell you this 
is not the way to go about it. It looks for shortcuts, simple 
solutions, the easy way out, although perhaps it will not be as easy 
as that, if the truth be told. Perhaps the rallying of forces we have 
seen is an indication of the disillusionment of the people who 
always end up paying. Maybe it will grow.
<P>
	We have not seen a movement such as this for a long time in 
Canada and the hon. members opposite can tell us that the union 
officials and social organizers are professional agitators, but from 
experience I can tell you  something. All the union officials and 
social organizers in the world can organize nothing when people, 
who do not let themselves be manipulated, know that it is not worth 
the trouble. But when people know that it is worth it, that there is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="877"> 877 </A></B>
<P>
something there, they wake up, and you never know where it comes 
from or the proportions it can take.
<P>
	We are talking about the people, and maybe they are angry 
because it makes no sense. There is such a huge gap between the 
conditions in which so many people live and the ease with which it 
is decided to cut here or there without considering the aftermath on 
social and economic productivity. It is possible that people are 
truly angry.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois feels a responsibility to speak out, not 
because it wants people to rise up for nothing, but because it wants 
the people of Canada and of Quebec to have hope.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-10, the Borrowing Authority Act 
1996-97.
<P>
	I am not going to dwell too long on the details. I believe the hon. 
member for St. Paul's, the Parliament Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance, laid out very well the details of the bill.
<P>
	Very briefly, the government is asking for $18.7 billion of 
borrowing authority for the 1996-97 fiscal year. This amount is 
comprised of a financial requirement stated in the budget for 
1996-97 of $13.7 billion, exchange fund account earnings of $1 
billion and $4 billion non-lapsing amount.
<P>
	The major portion of the borrowing requirement comes from the 
budget. Throughout this debate all day long I have sat here and 
listened to members comment on the budget and its relevance to 
the deficit, the national debt and the requirement for borrowing.
<P>
<B>(2120 )</B>
<P>
	This is not subject matter which is only of concern to Canadians. 
I want to quote President Bill Clinton who, just a few weeks ago in 
his state of the union address, made comments such as: ``We have 
opportunities for all who are prepared to work for it''. He said: 
``We have to live within our means. The era of big government is 
over. But we cannot leave our citizens to fend for themselves. We 
need self-reliance and teamwork''. Those words are also applicable 
here in Canada.
<P>
	In November 1995, along with all members of my party, I had an 
opportunity to present to the finance minister our views and 
thoughts on how to approach the fiscal responsibilities of the 
government.
<P>
	I want to read into the record the very first paragraph I wrote to 
the finance minister as I laid out some of the suggestions I had for 
him in this 10-page document. I  stated: ``Whether one talks about 
business or government affairs, the degree of stability shown and 
the level of confidence earned are critical factors to success. The 
public has responded positively to our government because we 
have demonstrated fiscal responsibility. Through our consultative 
approach, the electorate better understands our fiscal situation and 
the reasons for spending cuts and the reallocation of resources''.
<P>
	``We have also provided credible leadership, set overall fiscal 
targets that were realistic and achievable and, most importantly, we 
met those targets. We believe that these achievements have helped 
to promote the essential elements of stability and confidence that 
our future success depends on, continuing to reflect those elements 
in our policy initiatives''.
<P>
	The minister listened to the input of the House and of all 
Canadians because the members of this House reflect and respond, 
in our committees and in our communications with each other, the 
feelings of all Canadians.
<P>
	Reflecting on President Clinton's comments about not allowing 
our citizens to fend for themselves shows the essential difference 
between the approach advocated by the Reform Party and the 
approach of the government. The government has said it has to get 
its fiscal house in order but it is going to do it in a way that does not 
leave tragedy in its wake.
<P>
	Program spending for the government in the 1993-94 year, 
which was the fiscal year ending just after the last election, was 
$120 billion. When taken with revenues and other public debt 
charges, the deficit for that year was some $42 billion, a very large 
number. It is not a deficit that anyone in this place believes could 
be eliminated simply by doing something different, flipping a 
switch and making it happen. It cannot happen that way. It 
represented 6 per cent of the GDP of this country.
<P>
	In his first budget the finance minister undertook to reduce that 
deficit to 5 per cent of GDP, 4 per cent in the subsequent year, 3 per 
cent for the year ending March 31, 1997 and in recent addresses has 
indicated that he will bring it down to 2 per cent of GDP by the 
1997-98 year.
<P>
	There is no question about the direction that the finance minister 
is going and why he has asked Canadians to look at the essential 
elements of what Canada must do to balance its budget, which is 
what all of us want to do. I should not just stop at balancing the 
budget, it is also to start creating a surplus in a way which will 
allow us to start paying down the national debt.
<P>
	The national debt is somewhat over $550 billion.
<P>
<B>(2125 )</B>
<P>
	It did not exist some 25 to 30 years ago. Over these last 25 to 30 
years Canadians have taken out of the system something like $350 
billion more in goods and services  than have been paid for. The 
additional amount of the national debt is the compound interest that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="878"> 878 </A></B>
<P>
has been accumulating. It is a problem to be dealt with. We have to 
deal with the deficit first. The deficit has been dealt with: 6 per 
cent, 5 per cent, 4 per cent, 3 per cent, 2 per cent of GDP by the 
1997-98 year. We will have a balanced budget. We will be in a 
position to tell the Canadian people that a balanced budget has been 
achieved.
<P>
	We will start addressing the debt which was the recommendation 
of the auditor general. We have to get past balancing the budget. 
We have to start looking at that debt. We have to reduce it to a 
sustainable level. The House will have to deal with that issue.
<P>
	I could spend the rest of my time talking about each and every 
one of the budget elements and about how important it is to the 
achievement of meeting those targets that the finance minister has 
met. It is just as significant to have on the record what others have 
said. It is one thing to pat ourselves on the back, but let us see what 
others have to say about the finance minister's input.
<P>
	Mr. Bill Good of B.C., a radio host on CTV Sunday Edition on 
March 10 said: ``What the finance minister has done is he has 
gathered a considerable amount of credibility by hitting the targets 
he has said he was going to do''.
<P>
	Dalton Camp said of media reports: ``Almost everybody liked 
the budget. The strongest defence of the finance minister's fiscal 
policies was uttered on budget night when the Reform Party leader 
simply was at a loss for words, saying nothing''.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the hon. member intending to use the 
rest of his time to read press reports which most of us have read?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> I have only one more.
<P>
	The final one is from Jeffrey Simpson who said: ``If the federal 
government 10 years ago had introduced budgets like the last two, 
including yesterday's-The fight against the deficit-debt has been 
waged, thus far successfully, without major tax increases, to which 
Canadians have become politically resistant. It has instead being 
fought where it belonged-in the government's own spending and 
in transfers to the provinces''.
<P>
	These comments, along with others, are from people who 
actually follow this place and understand the government's 
approach to the question of the debt and the deficit and its need to 
borrow to finance that, which is the purpose of Bill C-10.
<P>
	As I indicated in the letter that I wrote to the finance minister, the 
stability and the confidence demonstrated by the government are 
extremely important.
<P>
	In one of the first speeches that the finance minister gave in the 
House, he included in his statement: ``Good social policy makes 
good fiscal policy and good fiscal policy makes good social 
policy''.
<P>
	I listened today to the speech of the member for St. Albert who 
was talking earlier about the infrastructure program. He was 
talking about spending $6 billion. This money was borrowed 
pursuant to a borrowing act similar to the one we are talking about 
tonight. He tried to explain to us how that really was not an 
appropriate expenditure.
<P>
	What he did not talk about was that the $6 billion, which was a 
contribution to all Canadians right across the country based on 
population, also had contributions from other levels of government 
that matched those moneys. Jobs were created, real jobs for people 
who were probably on unemployment insurance, people who were 
looking and desperately wanted the dignity of a job. They got it. 
Those jobs were created.
<P>
	Because of that program people got off UI, they got off welfare. 
They started paying their fair share of taxes. They had the dignity 
of a job. I do not know how the member concludes that giving 
people jobs is not a good thing for us to be doing.
<P>
	I listened also today to the member for Calgary North who 
started to argue what a terrible thing it was that RRSP limits were 
not increased from $13,500 up to $15,500.
<P>
<B>(2130 )</B>
<P>
	Members probably know that to be able to contribute to an RRSP 
of $13,500 one would have to make $75,000 per year and much 
more to contribute $15,500. In most of her speech the member 
argued what an awful thing it was because we did not give a further 
tax break to the top 2 per cent income earners in Canada. This is 
unbelievable. Average Canadians are living from pay cheque to pay 
cheque, never mind contributing to RRSPs.
<P>
	President Clinton said we have to balance the needs of the 
citizens and balance the budget. It must be done in an honourable 
way, not on the backs of the poor, the disabled and the aged, which 
is what I hear from the Reform Party. This is the kind of thing that 
defines the differences of the philosophies of members of the 
House.
<P>
	One member is arguing on behalf of the top 2 per cent of income 
earners in Canada. I say that when the budget includes things such 
as eliminating the seven-year limitation on the carry forward of 
unused RRSP amounts, it is a positive step because it makes sure 
young Canadians who are just starting out and who do not have the 
cash to put into RRSPs will be able to make it up later on in their 
lives once they get a little cash in the bank.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="879"> 879 </A></B>
<P>
	I also heard the member for Lethbridge argue the Reform Party 
budget would have chopped health care less than the Liberals. It 
would have chopped post secondary transfers less than the 
Liberals and also that cuts to seniors would have been less than 
those of the Liberals. He also said Reformers would lower the 
deficit and start paying down the debt.
<P>
	I did not get the chance to ask the member a question. How can 
Reformers do less cutting of spending than we did and still have a 
lower deficit? They did not answer the question. It cannot be both 
ways. These are contradictions.
<P>
	The member for Nanaimo-Cowichan stood in the House and 
made the argument that we are not creating jobs and that jobs are 
the problem. I looked at the report which came out from Statistics 
Canada, March 8: 44,000 new jobs were created in February, 
following the creation of 44,000 jobs in January and 49,000 jobs in 
December 1995, for a total of 137,000 new jobs created in the last 
three months, 82,000 of which were full time jobs. That means that 
more than 600,000 new jobs have been created since the 
government took office in 1993.
<P>
	Is that enough? No, not for a moment. There are still a million 
Canadians who want work. There are still young people looking for 
work. I have a son who is graduating from university at the end of 
this semester and he will be looking for a job. He wants the dignity 
of a first job. Unemployed young people, 25 per cent, want the 
dignity of a first job just like we had. We have to work harder to 
make sure they get it.
<P>
	I mentioned that good social policy makes good fiscal policy. It 
made me think about an element in the budget, child support 
payments and their taxability. I quote again some points the 
president of the United States raised in his state of the union 
address a few weeks ago: ``We must cherish our children and 
strengthen our families. We must take responsibility for our 
children. It is hard to be a parent, but it is even harder to be a child. 
All strong families begin with taking responsibility for our 
children. Families are the foundation of our country's life. Strong 
families mean a strong country''.
<P>
	He said all those things and the word family was repeated over 
and over. I thought about the words of the Finance Minister that 
good social policy means good fiscal policy and about the taxation 
of child support payments. I thought we have a tragedy here. We 
are upset and spending our energies debating who should pay the 
taxes on child support payments and we forgot that the family was 
eroding. We forgot about this being the result of two people who 
decided for one reason or another they were better off apart even 
when there were children involved.
<P>
<B>(2135)</B>
<P>
	How could this be that we are arguing tax dollars when it is the 
children there? How can we be arguing this  when we know that 
family breakdown is a result of spousal abuse, economic and 
financial abuse and all these things? How is it we are arguing about 
the taxability of things?
<P>
	The lady who argued this case in front of the Supreme Court, 
Suzanne Thibaudeau, made a very passionate plea. Here is a person 
who was paying less tax apart from her husband than they were 
paying when they were together.
<P>
	Why is it that they are better off from a tax standpoint being 
apart than being together when we know that the family is the 
foundation of our society? The change was made to the taxability 
of the child support payment back to the husband and not to the 
wife. It simply puts couples who separated on the same footing as 
families have always been. That is the success in the budget move.
<P>
	It is not a change in the taxability. It is a change that puts 
separated couples on the same basis as the family. It is amazing. I 
support the principle included in the budget but for a totally 
different reason. The family is the fundamental asset that we have 
in society.
<P>
	If the family were cared for, if the family were honoured and 
cherished, if working in the family home and caring for our 
children were an honoured profession again, if spousal abuse were 
treated the way it should be in society where the costs of all the 
aggravation of spousal abuse in society were totally eliminated, the 
deficit would be gone. If the family were strong, the deficit would 
be gone.
<P>
	That is the message that has to get out. It slowly came out in the 
state of the union address. It will slowly come out in the debate on 
the budget, on the borrowing bill and in the throne speech. It will 
slowly come out if the people in the House have the guts to stand up 
and speak up on behalf of the family. It is the family that will make 
it. If a strong family exists in Canada, Canada will be as strong as it 
can be. I wish I could spend the rest of my time talking about the 
family. Most of my work has been related to family issues and to 
taxation of the family.
<P>
	The issue we are talking about, balancing the budget, has to do 
with getting right back to what I wrote to the finance minister in the 
very first place, stability and confidence. It is saying and showing 
by one's actions as well as with words that one cares about the 
country, that one cares about fundamental principles, dammit, 
including family values. Those have to be there. They are not 
strong enough. I will continue to speak out on behalf of the family. 
I will continue to fight for tax fairness and equity within our 
system.
<P>
	We have opportunities before us and I hope all members will 
look for those opportunities so we can one day, very soon I hope, 
announce that not only do we have a balanced budget but that we 
will start paying down that awful national debt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with the member for  Capilano-Howe Sound. It 
is not too often that I start a speech with a compliment to a member 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="880"> 880 </A></B>
<P>
from the opposite side but I would like to echo the closing remarks 
of the member for Mississauga South. He said if the family were 
strong, the deficit would be gone. I believe the sincerity of his 
comments and I go on record as echoing the same.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Permit me to apologize to the hon. 
member for Mississauga South on the record for interrupting his 
intervention. It was a result of sitting here for about seven and a 
half hours today. The Chair had no right to interrupt when he was 
speaking. I apologize to him.
<P>
<B>(2140 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are talking about Bill C-10, an 
affront to Canadians. It is a very short bill. It is only about one page 
long but it has a very long tail on it.
<P>
	I was reading in the Edmonton <I>Journal</I> a few days ago that this 
weekend there will be a comet coming into our view. We will be 
able to see something very small in the universe with a very long 
tail. I thought it quite appropriate that it would show up this 
weekend since here we are talking about a very short bill with a 
very long tail. We will be paying for this for years, decades and so 
on. We will pass it on to our grandchildren.
<P>
	Clause 2(1) states the Minister of Finance may raise money by 
way of loan or by the issue and sale of securities of Canada in such 
amounts not exceeding $18.7 billion. That is $18.7 billion the 
Minister of Finance will hang around the necks of Canadians in the 
next 12 months. If that falls under his realm of good government I 
do not know why I am standing here and I do not know why he is 
standing there trying to tell Canadians this is good for us. It is not.
<P>
	Eighteen billion, seven hundred million dollars of new 
borrowing dumped on the backs of the hundreds of billions of 
dollars that we already owe is an affront and has to stop. That is 
why the Reform Party members said let us get the job done and let 
us get it done now.
<P>
	One of the previous speakers talked about the reallocation of 
resources and how good this was. The Minister of Finance is 
reallocating resources because he is cutting programs to the poor, 
he is cutting programs to the needy, he is cutting programs to 
families and he is transferring that money to the rich bankers and 
the wealthy people from around the world who now enjoy the 
greatest, richest and largest transfer program in the history of 
Canada.
<P>
	According to the Minister of Finance's projections when he took 
office in 1993 it was consuming $38 billion of Canadians' hard 
earned taxes paid. By the time he goes back to the people in 
1997-98 that program will have grown to $49 billion, the largest 
and most expensive statutory program in the history of the  country. 
It benefits no one but the rich at the expense of the poor.
<P>
	That is why the Reform Party is very concerned about the deficit. 
That is why the Reform Party said the deficit has to be eliminated. 
The growth of this program has to be stopped now. We in the 
Reform Party are concerned that we have money available to help 
those who need it, not those who want to take it from us.
<P>
	That is the fundamental difference between Reform and those 
people on the other side who say let us ease this thing down gently 
so nobody gets their nose out of joint. That is not what it is about. It 
is about ensuring we can afford what is needed.
<P>
	I hope the Minister of Finance and the people who support him 
on that side of the House realize the clock is ticking and the longer 
it ticks, the greater the chances he will run off the rails and the job 
will never get done. I could go on at considerable length.
<P>
	I am also very disappointed that the Minister of Finance stands 
in the House and tells us about how he is meeting his targets, how 
wonderful the Liberal government is, how we should have 
confidence in the government and in what it is doing. Let us look at 
what it is doing.
<P>
	Did anyone see the reference to Nav Canada in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> today? Nav Canada is this new not for profit monopoly the 
government is creating to run our air navigation services. I have a 
little problem with the monopoly but let us leave that aside for the 
moment.
<P>
<B>(2145)</B>
<P>
	The government is going to force Nav Canada to go out into the 
money markets to borrow $3 billion to buy these assets to pay for 
some kind of $1.5 billion profit the government is going to make as 
it sells these assets and turfs them over to this new not for profit 
monopoly called Nav Canada. The government is going to end up 
with a $3 billion windfall from the sale of assets that belong to the 
people of Canada paid for with taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Did the Minister of Finance tell us: ``Oh by the way, while I meet 
my deficit projections it is because of the windfall profits that I 
forced them to go out, borrow the money and give it to me''? Did 
he tell us that? No.
<P>
	What about the fact that he has changed the rules in the 
collection of UI premiums to force people with large incomes to 
pay all the premiums in the first few months rather than spreading 
it out over 12 months? This forces them to pay sooner which means 
the government gets its money in this year instead of next year, and 
generates a $500 million windfall. Did he tell us that? No.
<P>
	Did he tell us that when he got rid of the $2 bill and introduced a 
$2 coin which falls apart that through this whole concept called 
seigniorage the government is going  to get a windfall profit of 
$500 million this year? Did he tell us that? No.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="881"> 881 </A></B>
<P>
	Did he tell us that while he is not increasing income taxes at all 
and has not for quite some time that people who are 69 and 70 years 
of age can no longer get a tax deduction for contributing to their 
RRSPs? They are now going to start paying taxes on the annuity as 
they start withdrawing from their RRSPs because he has changed 
the rules which force them to do that. No, he did not tell us.
<P>
	Did he tell us that he is going to change the rules in child support 
to collect another $240 million out of the pockets of the people who 
in many cases need every penny they can to provide for the kids 
because there are two homes involved? In doing so a whole new 
business for the lawyers is going to be created so that money goes 
into the pockets of the lawyers rather than to feed the kids. Did he 
tell us that? No. It goes on and on.
<P>
	He has forced small business proprietorships to go through 
endless hoops and expensive accounting bills in order for him to 
suck the money out of their pockets by changing their fiscal year 
end from whatever it was to December 31. He can collect his 
money faster and they have to scrape it out of somewhere, he does 
not care where, so that he can get a windfall bonus by squeezing it 
out of the people who are trying to create jobs. And he boasts about 
not increasing taxes.
<P>
	He extended the surtax on banks so he will collect another $40 
billion next year even though that was supposed to pay the way and 
he tells us he did not increase taxes. Smoke and mirrors, deception 
at every turn. The Canadian people are being led down the garden 
path.
<P>
	The government talks about waste and the Minister of Finance 
talks about it explicitly twice in the budget speech. He was going to 
wring waste out of the system in order to ensure the taxpayers' 
money is well spent.
<P>
	I read an article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> today about Nav Canada. 
We have about 6,000 civil servants who are going to ``lose their 
jobs'' with the government. The following morning they will have 
a new job, which is the old job, working for a new employer which 
is this not for profit monopoly set up by the government. This new 
job, which is exactly the same as the old job, and they did not 
notice except the name on the paycheque is different.
<P>
	These civil servants are going to share in a $200 million bonus. 
They get their severance pay because they are being laid off from 
their government job and they will be transferred in an off balance 
sheet situation.
<P>
<B>(2150 )</B>
<P>
	The government can collect its $3 billion windfall profit. It is 
going to cost the taxpayers, people who are looking for jobs, people 
who are trying to keep their jobs and people who are not sure they 
are going to have a job  next year, $200 million in severance pay for 
people who are not even going to be out of work one single day. It 
goes on and on. It is a shame and it is disgraceful.
<P>
	I have one final point. I rather hate to bring this up but I do have 
to raise child care and child support. The government is now going 
to legislate child care and child support. I really appreciate the 
heartfelt sincerity of the member from Mississauga. Why for 
example in Alberta, does a parent with three children, who makes 
$38,000 going to have to pay $750? Parents in every province will 
have to pay over $700, yet in the province of Quebec and only in 
the province Quebec it drops below $700 all the way down to $640. 
Why the exception for that province?
<P>
	There are many other things I would like to get on the record but 
my time is up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not sure how much I look forward to speaking for 10 
minutes on this subject since I have been here since eight o'clock 
this morning and it is now the 14th hour of my rather full day. 
Nevertheless, Bill C-10, the borrowing authority bill is a rather 
important bill or it should be an important bill.
<P>
	For a long time I remember in the United States there used to be 
the need for the government to go to Congress every year to acquire 
permission to increase the debt limit. This bill focused the 
discussion on issues about spending and deficits which were very 
salutary.
<P>
	I wish in the parliamentary system we had an opportunity to 
focus our discussion on what these deficits do to our children and 
grandchildren who are not represented here because they cannot 
vote. I know this is a cynical point of view, but I believe if they 
really were in our minds when we voted for these kinds of increases 
in deficits, these appropriations to spend more and add more to the 
debt, we would not do it if we remembered what we are doing to 
our children and grandchildren.
<P>
	Unfortunately we have a system here where all the conclusions 
are pretty well pre-ordained. What we have is a lot of talk. Let me 
add to this talk on a subject that is of great concern to me.
<P>
	Today several members opposite spoke about an article written 
by my good friend and colleague, Dr. Mike Walker, an economist 
and director of the Fraser Institute. He published an article in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> last Thursday. The title is ``Budget out-Kleins 
Klein-Another Perspective''. In this short editorial, Dr. Walker 
indicated his enthusiastic support for the budget that was brought 
down last week and which at this moment is being debated in the 
context of the need for more borrowing to which it gives rise.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="882"> 882 </A></B>
<P>
	The editorial bases its enthusiasm for the budget on something 
very interesting, an index which the Fraser Institute has called the 
Klein index. It is alleged to be an objective assessment of the fiscal 
restriction imposed by a  certain budget. As Mr. Walker indicates, 
he believes this takes subjective judgment out of the debate. I am 
really puzzled by this. Dr. Walker in co-authorship with Robert 
Richardson in the February issue of <I>Fraser Forum</I>, a monthly 
publication of the highly respected institute, with circulation in the 
thousands, has published a paper entitled ``How to Balance the 
Federal Budget and Keep Canada together''. Mr. Walker suggests 
cuts in program spending. This is money spent on everything other 
than the debt and excluding social transfers to individuals and 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(2155)</B>
<P>
	Dr. Walker enthusiastically endorsed the need for further cuts. 
He would have doubled according to these proposals the cuts to 
program spending of $6.9 billion enacted by the Minister of 
Finance last year. He would have added $6.3 billion in order to 
achieve the targets he thought were necessary.
<P>
	I will give in a moment his summary of why he liked and why he 
suggested this budget. He gives here a long table on how he would 
find the extra $13 billion. For the department of agriculture he 
suggested an additional cut of $600 million out of a budget of $1.2 
billion, and so on.
<P>
	The second element of his budget proposal which was very 
important suggested an increased clawback of all social transfers to 
individuals and families. His emphasis was on families, social 
transfers in the form of UI, OAS and CPP together. He gave a 
schedule on how he would have done that and he suggested that 
another $8 billion should have been taken out of this program.
<P>
	Why did Dr. Walker and his co-author suggest this would be 
necessary? It would bring about in two years an elimination of the 
deficit, and a surplus would begin.
<P>
	He concludes the article with the following paragraph: ``By 
balancing its budget within the next two years and beginning to 
reduce the national debt, the federal government can restore the 
confidence of most Canadians in the financial, economic and 
political viability of one Canada for all Canadians into the 21st 
century''.
<P>
	This of course has been the platform of the Reform Party since 
its election campaign, reinforced in the taxpayers budget published 
last year.
<P>
	The Liberal budget did nothing Dr. Walker proposed two months 
earlier. There were no further cuts. There was no dealing with the 
problem of social program spending to high income families.
<P>
	It is a very puzzling phenomenon to me. How can a man within a 
couple of weeks change his mind? On the one hand he would have 
predicted that if this budget did nothing of what he recommended, 
it would have been a failure. He then turns around on the basis of an 
objective index and would say this is a wonderful budget.
<P>
	I can see only two explanations. One is that, as he said, this is an 
objective index. Maybe he was not objective when he wrote the 
first budget, when he made his budget proposal. I do not believe 
that. I have co-authored several books with Dr. Walker. The last 
one has been published in Chinese.
<P>
	The only other alternative I have as an explanation is that there is 
a serious flaw in the design of the so-called objective index. I 
believe what is missing is any kind of weight given to the speed 
with which a fiscal restraint is enacted. I believe that is a fatal flaw.
<P>
	I look forward to talking to Dr. Walker on the telephone in order 
to clear up this puzzle. I can assure him he has given enormous 
support to the Liberals, all of whom rave on all the time about how 
this conservative leader of the economics profession in Canada has 
seen the light and swung around. It is a total puzzle to me. I tried to 
explain it. Maybe I will have more news tomorrow.
<P>
