	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to present petitions on behalf of several 
hundred residents of Newfoundland. The signatories of these 
petitions come from my riding of Burin-St. George's as well as 
from the riding of my colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans and the member for Gander-Grand Falls.
<P>
	The petitions salute the importance of the mining industry as 
the mainstay of employment in more than 150 communities 
across the country and as an important contributor to Canada's 
gross domestic product and exports.
<P>
	The petitioners call on Parliament to take action that will 
increase employment in the mining sector, promote exploration, 
rebuild Canada's mineral reserves, sustain mining communities 
and keep mining in Canada.
<P>
	I have much pleasure in presenting these petitions and in 
giving them my full support.

Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today, both on the 
same subject. I would like to add that there are a growing 
number of Canadians who continue to be concerned about the 
proposition of more gun legislation in this country.
<P>
	These petitioners call to the attention of the House that 
current legislation allows law-abiding citizens of Canada to 
own firearms and that current legislation regulates the 
acquisition and possession of firearms through a complex, 
expensive and rigorous regulatory scheme. In the vast majority 
of serious crimes in which firearms were involved those 
firearms were illegally acquired or were illegally possessed.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners call on this House of Parliament 
assembled to oppose further legislation for firearms acquisition 
and possession and to provide strict guidelines and mandatory 
sentences for the use or possession of a firearm in the 
commission of a violent crime. I concur with my petitioners.

	The petitioners point out that the present Prime Minister in a 
letter dated August 1993 to Rural Dignity of Canada stated that 
the Liberal party had ``vigorously spoken out against Canada 
Post's plans to close or convert existing post offices and that the 
Liberal Party viewed the closure and the conversion as a 
deterioration of services to the public resulting in poorer 
service, lower wages for employees and greater difficulty in 
guaranteeing the security of the mail''.

	The petitioners ask that a full corporate post office be 
reinstated in the town of Balgonie which is a growing and 
progressive community, and they want a full time postmaster.

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (for the Minister of Human 
Resources Development)</B> moved that Bill C-54, an act to 
amend the Old Age Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the 
Children's Special Allowances Act and the Unemployment 
Insurance Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my very great honour to rise in the House today to 
speak in support of Bill C-54, whose amendments which will 
assist over 3.5 million Canadian seniors, in particular the 1.4 
million seniors currently receiving the spouse's allowance or 
the guaranteed income supplement.
<P>
	The proposed amendments will enable these seniors, the 
majority of whom are women, to receive the benefits to which 
they are entitled with a minimum of red tape.
<P>
	I am particularly pleased to speak on behalf of this bill 
because so many of its amendments display a unifying theme, 
namely establishing effective and efficient government and 
providing better service to the public while at the same time 
controlling costs.
<P>
	This bill is a demonstration of our continuing commitment to 
both current and future seniors. It follows improvements to 
telephone service made earlier this year.
<P>
	Members may recall that in February the Minister of Human 
Resources Development responded to public concerns raised by 
the Auditor General by ordering immediate action to ensure 
pensioners were able to get answers to questions about their 
benefits. These changes which involve the training of up to 200 
additional client service officers and a $3 million investment to 
expand and upgrade existing telephone equipment has certainly 
been very effective.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6945"> 6945 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	In fact since May over 65,000 calls have been answered from 
clients in Ontario and New Brunswick alone. These clients 
would have had their calls go unanswered had the changes not 
been made.
<P>
	The amendments we are introducing today will move us a few 
more steps down the road toward the administrative 
effectiveness and excellent client service which we all seek. 
They will also make it easier for you as members of Parliament 
to represent constituents in their dealings with the department.
<P>
	I want to speak a bit about the reform of income security 
programs. The government is committed to providing 
Canadians with a more streamlined and efficient system. This is 
especially true in Human Resources Development Canada 
where this is not just some philosophical notion but rather a 
daily commitment to the clients who use the numerous 
employment, training, social development and income security 
programs which the department administers.
<P>
	The redesign of our income security programs encompassing 
the old age security program and the Canada pension plan is a 
concrete example of this commitment. This project will vastly 
improve the efficiency and quality of service to Canada's 
seniors and pensioners. However, redesign is not something that 
happens overnight but it is indeed a continual process.
<P>
	Fortunately there are changes which can be made right away 
and these are contained in the bill before the House. These 
include an alternative to the annual application process for 
income tested benefits under the old age security program; 
streamlined appeals process and procedures to expedite the 
hearing of appeals; one year retroactivity under the Canada 
pension plan for retirement pensions payable after age 65; the 
authority to forgive overpayments resulting from administrative 
error or erroneous advice; and a number of technical 
amendments which collectively enable the government to offer 
better service to seniors in a more efficient manner. Also in the 
bill is found changes to guaranteed income supplement and 
spouses allowance.
<P>
	One amendment of the bill is of special significance to low 
income elderly Canadians, a disproportionate number of whom 
are single women. Under the Old Age Security Act a basic 
pension is provided to all those persons over the age of 65 who 
have met the residency period established in the act.
<P>
	The basic pension is the foundation of the old age security 
program. In addition this program provides income tested 
benefits such as GIS and SPA. These two programs ensure that 
recipients have a guaranteed minimum income on which to live.
<P>
	The amount of GIS or SPA an individual receives during the 
fiscal year is based for the most part on income in the previous 
calendar year. To obtain this information we have always 
required that our clients file a statement of income each and 
every year. The  experience of experts in this area is that this can 
be an onerous and even frightening experience for many seniors.
<P>
	I recently received a letter from a volunteer agency composed 
of seniors whose mandate is to ensure that other seniors are 
aware and able to take advantage of the services and benefits 
available to them. This group was asking if any alternatives to 
the current application/reapplication process had ever been 
considered. This question obviously flowed from its experience 
in dealing with problems caused by the current system. The 
woman who wrote on behalf of the group pointed out two 
significant areas of concern which these volunteers had 
encountered.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	To begin with, renewal applications are sent out each January 
and must be returned by the month of March. This allows the 
new benefit amounts to be calculated in time for the April 
cheque.
<P>
	The woman who wrote on behalf of the volunteer group 
pointed out that some of the older recipients in her province 
worry about being late in reapplying, so much so that many 
complete it as soon as it arrives in January. The problem is that 
people with some other source of income have not received their 
information slips by the end of January. As a result, these 
pensioners guess at what their income was in the previous year.
<P>
	However, if they guess wrong it means that they either receive 
an underpayment or an overpayment on their April cheque. In 
the case of an underpayment, they may not receive sufficient 
money to live. In the case of an overpayment, recipients could 
end up having to pay money back to the government. As well, 
some recipients set this form aside for safekeeping in 
recognition of its importance and then forget to submit it when 
they receive their information slip.
<P>
	Sadly, it is no longer possible for staff to contact those seniors 
who have not returned their forms by a certain date, since we 
now have more than one million supplement clients to serve 
each year. In any case, failure to file this form means that 
pensioners' old age security cheques in April would contain 
only the basic pension amount. At its worst, this could mean 
receiving roughly $388 instead of $848, a 54 per cent drop in 
income.
<P>
	For someone relying on an income tested benefit to make ends 
meet, this is of course a devastating experience. At that point 
they need special help to get their forms completed and a cheque 
issued as fast as possible. This, of course, adds to administrative 
costs.
<P>
	I am not saying that all pensioners, or even the majority of 
pensioners, have difficulty with the renewal process. However, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6946"> 6946 </A></B>
<P>
the fact is that there is a problem for some which is reason 
enough for this government to find alternatives.
<P>
	An amendment to the Old Age Security Act contained in the 
bill would go a long way to alleviating these very real problems 
facing very real people. The amendment would give the 
Minister of Human Resources Development the authority to 
waive the requirement for an individual to reapply each year.
<P>
	It will be some time before we are able to use this waiver 
extensively. However, some of the cases where this waiver could 
be used either immediately or in the very near future include the 
following: Pensioners whose income does not change from year 
to year, a situation common among more elderly seniors; 
pensioners whose only other source of income is the Canada 
pension plan, which means that my department already has the 
income information necessary to calculate the income tested 
benefits under the old age security program; and, pensioners 
who have already filed their income tax returns by the end of 
March.
<P>
	For this group, the income information could be obtained 
directly from Revenue Canada. Obtaining information directly 
from Revenue Canada would do more than provide an improved 
client service. It would also reduce a great deal of duplication 
both for seniors and for the government. Seniors would no 
longer have to provide what is effectively the same information 
to two government departments. In turn, the role of the 
Department of Human Resources Development plays in the 
renewal process would become more efficient because it would 
get the correct information from Revenue Canada about an 
individual's income from the first.
<P>
	This means that the underpayments and overpayments on 
many accounts would be eliminated. Efficiencies such as this 
would go a long way to streamlining service to the public, while 
at the same time reducing government expenditures. As well, 
there would be a reduction in the paper burden imposed on those 
who are least able to cope with it.
<P>
	Other amendments in the bill would also have significant 
benefits for pensioners. The OAS appeal process is yet another 
example. It involves changes to the old age security appeal 
process. Currently any client dissatisfied with the decision 
under the OAS act may ask for a reconsideration which is an 
internal review of their file or the client can go directly to a 
review tribunal which is made up of three members, a 
representative of the client, a representative of the minister and 
a chair who is agreed by the other two.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	There are a number of problems with this process which I feel 
the amendments will go a long way to alleviate. First we are 
proposing that the reconsideration stage be mandatory for all 
appeals, so that clients would be assured of a speedy review of 
their case to ensure that the decision they originally received 
was in fact the correct one.
<P>
	Experience has shown that reconsideration is the fastest way 
to change the original decision, especially if an error occurred or 
if there was simply something lacking in the documentation 
submitted the first time around. This happens when clients bring 
forward new information that was not available when the 
original decision was made.
<P>
	Second, we are proposing to have all OAS review tribunals 
heard by the review tribunals correctly in place under the 
Canada pension plan. As I am sure hon. members can appreciate, 
it is often very difficult to find three volunteers who are all able 
to be at the same place at the same time, during business hours, 
particularly in remote locations. In fact there are currently 
appeals under the OAS program that have been waiting to be 
heard for more than two years.
<P>
	By contrast the Canada pension plan review tribunals in place 
since 1992 are proving very efficient. These tribunals are 
composed of three members chosen from a panel appointed for 
just this purpose. As a result we have a significant number of 
people who are committed to be available to take part in the 
appeal process in all parts of this very large country.
<P>
	As well, because members hear a number of appeals during 
their tenure, they develop a very good working knowledge of the 
program on which they are being asked to adjudicate.
<P>
	On the issue of war crimes, we are also proposing 
amendments which complement Canada's commitment to the 
international community in its efforts to bring to justice persons 
suspected of war crimes or crimes against humanity.
<P>
	To further the important work of the Solicitor General, the 
department is proposing amendments to the information 
disclosure provision of the Canada pension plan, the Old Age 
Security Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act by allowing 
the commissioner of the RCMP, the Minister of Justice and 
Attorney General of Canada access to information controlled by 
our department.
<P>
	Canada is strengthening its ability to be a meaningful partner 
in this effort. I assure hon. members that this access will be 
strictly controlled and will be restricted to actions conducted by 
Canada in Canada.
<P>
	On the information exchanges with veterans affairs, other 
changes to the information provisions contained in the Canada 
pension plan and Old Age Security Act will follow for expanded 
information exchanges in veterans affairs. Even though many of 
our clients are the same our ability to communicate with each 
other has been very limited.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6947"> 6947 </A></B>
<P>
	In this time of economic restraint it is important that we 
govern as efficiently as possible. It is also important that people 
will receive their correct entitlements under various 
government programs. Better communications with veterans 
affairs will meet both of these objectives.
<P>
	On the issue of pensioner activity I now want to outline a 
significant amendment to the Canada pension plan contained in 
the bill, significant because of why it is being made; that is, the 
introduction of a 12-month retroactivity period for Canada 
pension plan retirement applications by persons over the age of 
65.
<P>
	In 1987 with the introduction of flexible retirement under the 
CPP it became possible to receive an actuarially adjusted 
retirement pension from age 60 to age 70. The amount of an 
individual's benefit is based in part on the age at which the 
pension begins. Specifically the benefit is reduced by .5 per cent 
for each month an applicant is under age 65 or increased by .5 
per cent for each month the applicant is over the age of 65.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	To complement this change, it was felt that there was no 
further need for retroactive retirement pensions prior to age 70. 
If someone delayed applying for retirement pension past age 65, 
their benefit would be adjusted to reflect this fact.
<P>
	However, in the ensuing seven years, there have been some 
complaints from people over the age of 65 who state that they 
would rather have had the option of receiving up to 12 months of 
retroactive benefits. This would be in lieu of the increase of up 
to 6 per cent in their monthly entitlement that a delay of 12 
months represents.
<P>
	This change is not significant if we look at the number of 
people who have requested it. However, ask any one of the 
individuals who wants to choose the retroactivity option and 
they will tell you how significant it is to them.
<P>
	Usually they have delayed a few months in applying after 
their 65th birthday and they really cannot understand why they 
cannot get benefits back to that time. Frankly, neither can I. It is 
not a matter of costs since the extra months of payments are 
balanced by actual adjustments.
<P>
	Another significant change proposed by this legislation 
relates to overpayments which occasionally occur under the Old 
Age Security Act. When overpayment was solely the result of an 
administrative error the Minister of Human Resources 
Development under this legislation would have the authority to 
give such an overpayment. This mirrors a provision that 
currently exists under the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	Today I have outlined the major changes the government is 
proposing to OAS and CPP legislation. However there are 
several other technical amendments that will also help us better 
serve pensioners.
<P>
	In conclusion, these amendments taken together will result in 
improved service to our clients, reduce administrative costs and 
significantly reduce duplication and paper burden both to our 
clients and to the government departments involved.
<P>
	The amendments contained in this bill represent one more 
step in this government's commitment to providing Canadians 
with the excellent government services they deserve while at the 
same time reducing costs as much as possible.
<P>
	Finally, the amendments in this bill will go a long way toward 
helping making life a little easier for our seniors who have after 
all made such a tremendous contribution to the building of this 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-54, an Act to amend the Old Age Security Act, 
the Canada Pension Plan, the Children's Allowances Act and the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, was tabled on October 7 by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The proposed amendments to the Old Age Security Program 
and the Canada Pension Plan will provide for certain 
improvements that will benefit senior citizens, but the bill's lack 
of clarity is certainly no guarantee that senior citizens will have 
an adequate level of financial security. The bill may even reduce 
the incomes of some seniors.
<P>
	As the critic for seniors' issues, it is my duty to ensure that the 
social security review does not become an exercise in making 
cuts in all programs designed to protect the neediest in our 
society, especially senior citizens.
<P>
	Most senior citizens have modest incomes. According to a 
report by the National Advisory Council on Aging, disposable 
incomes of senior citizens were as follows: the incomes of 
families headed by seniors were 68 to 80 per cent of the incomes 
of other Canadian families, depending on the income measure 
used and the Canadian region concerned. In 1989, for instance, 
the average income of families headed by seniors was only 
$37,462 or 72 per cent of the incomes of families where the head 
of the family was under 65.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	In 1989, the average income of single persons aged 65 or over 
was $16,316, while the average income of single persons under 
65 was $23,080. A single person is an individual who lives alone 
or in a household where the person is not related to other 
members of the household. Single persons, irrespective of their 
age, tend to have relatively low incomes. Consequently, if we 
consider single persons as a group, the gap between senior 
citizens and the rest of the population is not as wide as it is 
between families, but it is still substantial.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6948"> 6948 </A></B>
<P>
	Responsibility for seniors is shared by two departments, 
Human Resources Development and Health, with the Seniors 
Secretariat, which is responsible for giving seniors the 
information they need on federal programs and services, while 
providing liaison with the federal and provincial departments 
responsible for programs for senior citizens. Why not have a 
minister responsible for senior citizens, like the previous 
government? I asked this question at the very beginning of my 
term as a member of this House.
<P>
	In addition, the National Advisory Council on Aging advises 
the Minister of Health on the quality of life of senior citizens, 
either at the request of the minister or on its own initiative. The 
council's role consists in disseminating information and 
publishing reports, for instance. The federal government assists 
senior citizens mainly through two programs: Old Age Security 
and the Canada Pension Plan, and a number of tax measures.
<P>
	The purpose of the OAS program is to provide seniors with a 
decent level of income. The program includes three kinds of 
benefits under the Old Age Security Act. The basic old age 
security pensions provide seniors with the basis for a decent 
level of income. Pensions are paid to all Canadians and 
Quebecers 65 years of age and over who meet residence 
requirements. They are taxable and subject to partial or full 
clawback in the case of seniors with high incomes.
<P>
	The guaranteed income supplement ensures a minimum level 
of income to old age security pensioners. Benefits are paid to old 
age security pensioners who have a low or modest income. The 
amount of benefits is established through an assessment of 
annual income, generally based on the individual's income for 
the previous year areported for tax purposes.
<P>
	The spouses's allowance helps married, retired and 
low-income couples who receive only one old age security 
pension or guaranteed income supplement, as well as 
low-income widows and widowers, aged 60 to 64, who meet the 
old age security requirements in terms of residency. Benefits are 
determined through an income assessment similar to the one 
applicable to the guaranteed income supplement. The Canada 
Pension Plan is a mandatory and contributive social insurance 
program designed to protect Canadian workers and their 
families against a loss of income due to death, disability or 
retirement.
<P>
	Retirement pension benefits are equal to 25 per cent of the 
pensionable earnings of the contributor, with this average being 
established for the net qualifying period. These benefits will 
help about 2 million pensioners each month, for a volume of 
transactions of $9.6 billion in 1993-94. Survivor's benefits 
consist of a monthly benefit paid to surviving spouses of 
deceased contributors, an overall benefit paid to the succession 
and orphan benefits paid each month to children of deceased 
contributors. Benefits paid to surviving spouses are reduced if 
spouses are aged 35 to 45, are not invalid or have no children.  
Disability payments are made monthly to contributors who have 
not yet reached 65 years old and have a chronic and serious 
disability and to their dependent children who are 18 years old 
or less or 18 to 25 if they are full time students. In 1993-94, 
approximately $2.5 billion will be paid to 325,000 recipients 
every month.

	Bill C-54 highlights contain, among other things, two 
specific amendments which will have a positive impact on the 
programs for the elderly and the amendments are the following.
<P>
	Spouse's allowances automatically become old age security 
benefits when the recipients reach 65 years old. The guaranteed 
income supplement and spouse's allowances will be paid even 
when applications are late. The intent of the proposal is to 
amend the Old Age Security Act in order for the minister to be 
able to exempt some recipients from filing an annual application 
for the renewal of the guaranteed income supplement and 
spouse's allowances.
<P>
	However, the Bloc Quebecois cannot support Bill C-54's 
provisions which change access to some information, since the 
government wants to increase the number of departments, 
agencies and persons given access to personal information used 
in the administration of the acts amended by this bill.
<P>
	According to the legislation as it stands now, the agencies 
having access to information are the departments of National 
Revenue, Finance and Supply and Services, the Employment 
and Immigration Commission, Statistics Canada and any 
provincial authorities administering an assistance program. 
These agencies do have access providing the information deals 
only with the status of recipients or the amount of the benefits or 
where disclosure of information is required for the purposes of 
administering the act.
<P>
	We must be careful when gathering personal information on 
elderly people, because this can be used for other purposes. We 
must protect them from possible abuse. The government has not 
demonstrated that privileged information disclosure was 
required and essential. The government must always be 
accountable to elderly people by showing that the gathering of 
such information is not abusive.
<P>
	Governments are encroaching more and more on the private 
lives of people, as we saw recently in the Grant Bristow case. 
Furthermore, the Bloc Quebecois does not accept the clauses 
providing for sanctions in case of illegal communication 
because they do not go far enough.
<P>
	Also the bill's clauses relating to information add the 
following agencies to the list of those who can have access to 
that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6949"> 6949 </A></B>
<P>
information, namely Canada Post, Correctional Services of 
Canada, the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police, the Department of Justice and the Attorney General and 
even federal MPs and any other person designated by the 
minister as a health professional.
<P>
	Some information will be made available to a greater number 
of departments. It is important to note that Correctional Services 
of Canada will have access to information on pensioner inmates 
in order to force them to pay back part of the costs of their 
detention.
<P>
	The Department of Justice as well as the Commissioner of the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police will have access to obtain 
information that could help them catch war criminals. Of 
course, this is aimed at Nazis who migrated to Canada after the 
last World War, among others. It is not explained why it is 
necessary to include any other person designated as a health 
professional by the minister. It is also mentioned that it would be 
useful to include Canada Post since that agency could, by using 
new techniques, help speed up the processing of pensioners' 
cheques.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Another important point in Bill C-54 has to do with the 
government's plan to save money. From now on, clients who 
apply late for their pension will be able to receive up to one 
year's retroactive payment of benefits. In the case of Old Age 
Security, this is a reduction from five years to one year. For the 
Canada Pension Plan, this kind of situation is dealt with through 
actuarial adjustments.
<P>
	This provision will come into force on April 1st, 1995. 
However, pensioners who owe money to the OAS plan will have 
their debt forgiven if it is the result of an administrative error or 
erroneous advice on the part of a departmental official.
<P>
	The maximum deadline for the recovery of OAS 
overpayments will be eliminated. This way, the government will 
be able to get back between one and two million dollars.
<P>
	Moreover, the minister may stay payment of benefits pending 
an appel or a judicial review, thus depriving beneficiaries of 
money they need since it is often their only source of income.
<P>
	The Old Age Security pension and the guaranteed income 
supplement are paid to 72 per cent of women pensioners and 50 
per cent of men. Only 5 per cent of senior citizens have incomes 
above $50,000. Their life expectancy has improved and we must 
ensure that these senior citizens lead a full and satisfying life 
during these extra years.
<P>
	By putting more stringent conditions on programs for senior 
citizens, the government is merely cutting the income of these 
people. The government is saying that the retroactive period has 
been shortened from five years to one year, to make the OAS 
program consistent with that of the Canada Pension Plan.
<P>
	According to the present legislation, the government can go 
back a maximum of two years. Abolishing this provision would 
save the government between one and two million dollars. 
Given that people are protected from possible errors by civil 
servants, they would not have to refund any excess payment in 
such a case. The minister should tell us where he is going to take 
that money.
<P>
	In the event of an appeal, the minister will be authorized to 
delay payment. Yet, the government itself recognizes that a 
large percentage of pensioners have no other incomes.
<P>
	Let us not forget that the federal government has decided to 
reduce the tax credit given to senior citizens. At the present 
time, all taxpayers 65 and over can claim a tax credit equivalent 
to 17 per cent of $3,482 at the federal level, and 20 per cent of 
$2,200 in Quebec. This tax credit is non-refundable, that is to 
say, taxpayers can use it to reduce the tax they owe, but they 
cannot ask for a cash refund on any unused portion of it. 
However, such an unused part can be transferred to the spouse.
<P>
	This tax credit amounts to a reduction of federal tax of about 
$610 per year for all tax-paying senior citizens. In most 
provinces, and in Quebec in particular, this credit also reduces 
the provincial tax. The combined reduction of federal and 
provincial taxes averages about $950, but in Quebec it comes to 
about $1,050.
<P>
	On May 31 of this year, I took the floor to oppose any 
reduction of the tax credit for senior citizens. I stressed that once 
again the meagre efforts to reduce spending were done at the 
expense of the neediest. At that time, I also mentioned that, on 
May 10, I had questioned the minister responsible for seniors 
about the projected use of so-called voice mail boxes to answer 
inquiries from senior citizens.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development merely 
stressed the efficiency of the proposed service. I explained that a 
lot of seniors hate to use this type of service and that the 
golden-age club representative voiced their concerns. In the last 
year, the Minister of Human Resources Development received 
numerous letters from Quebec members of the AFEAS, the 
Association féminine d'éducation et d'action sociale. Here are 
excerpts from one of them:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We heard that your department, Human Resources Development Canada, is 
planning to use voice mail in its communications with senior citizens wanting 
information on income security matters.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe this measure will affect people who may naturally be at a loss 
when confronted by this technology. Moreover, many of them do not have the 
required telephone sets.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6950"> 6950 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We AFEAS members are strongly opposed to your project to provide services to 
seniors through voice mail instead of having real people answer questions about 
income security.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We ask you to reconsider this unfortunate decision as soon as possible.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On May 11, 1994, I insisted again. I then asked the House: 
Why does the federal government insist on attacking senior 
citizens, considering that most of them find it very difficult to 
deal with a system that is so impersonal?
<P>
	Last September 28 in this House, I asked the following 
question of the Minister of Human Resources Development: 
Does the Minister of Human Resources Development still 
intend to slash programs for seniors in order to finance other 
federal government programs? Will we have to wait until after 
the Quebec referendum to know the answer?
<P>
	On September 29, I rose again in this House, in an attempt to 
get a formal commitment from the government not to tax 
RRSPs. The purpose of my remarks is not to reject all the 
measures in Bill C-54 affecting senior citizens, given that 
certain rules that complicated their lives unnecessarily have 
been relaxed.
<P>
	However, the government must guarantee seniors a certain 
security by not slashing the social programs that affect them. 
The government's direct expenses associated with senior 
benefits, which include old age security, the guaranteed income 
supplement and the spouse's allowance, represent $20.6 billion 
in 1994-1995. The burden carried by seniors must be fair and 
equitable. Recent studies indicate that one person in eight is 
over 65.
<P>
	In ten years, the number of people 65 and older will increase 
by at least 40 per cent. More Canadians aged 65 and older will 
have to rely on the ability to pay of working Canadians aged 15 
to 64. However, many seniors are still active and prefer to live at 
home, look after themselves and make their own decisions.
<P>
	With respect to seniors who wish to live together, one measure 
that I find very discriminatory is reducing old age security 
payments when seniors living in a residence decide to share an 
apartment with their spouse. Do you not think that more 
humanity, more generosity and less pettiness are in order?
<P>
	In conclusion, I move, seconded by the hon. member for 
Châteauguay, that all the words after the word ``that'' be struck 
out and the following substituted:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``this House declines to give second reading reading to Bill C-54, An Act to amend 
the Old Age Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Children's Special 
Allowances Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act, because it does not provide a 
penalty under the Criminal Code for the disclosure of personal information 
concerning beneficiaries to persons who are not legally authorized to such 
information pursuant to Access to Privileged Information.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Hon. colleagues, there 
have been discussions, and the amendment is in order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as critic for human resources development I have some 
statements to make about the bill.
<P>
	For the benefit of Canadians who are joining the debate by 
television, I would like to set out the purpose of the bill. It deals 
with major pieces of legislation involving enormous 
expenditures by the government. However the bill is not a major 
initiative. It is a piece of housekeeping and its purpose, 
according to the summary, is to improve services to clients to 
allow for more efficient program administration and to increase 
efficiency between programs in the case of old age security and 
the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	It is almost exclusively concerned with amendments to the 
Old Age Security Act, that is the first 16 pages of the bill; with 
the CPP act which takes us through the first 30 pages of the bill; 
with the Children's Special Allowances Act which takes up a 
couple of pages; and with the Unemployment Insurance Act 
which takes up another couple of pages. These acts are 
housekeeping in nature but, as has been stated by my colleague 
from the Bloc, there are some policy considerations that should 
be brought out as we debate the piece of legislation.
<P>
	The government speaker who spoke on the bill in the House 
this morning played rather heavily on the government's 
``commitment to seniors''. Back in January the government 
introduced with much fanfare a review of our social security 
system. I will read from the terms of reference that were put 
forward to the House respecting that review: ``that the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development be directed to 
consult broadly, to analyse and to make recommendations 
regarding the modernization and restructuring of Canada's 
social security system'', and this is the operative part, ``with 
particular reference to the needs of families with children, youth 
and working age adults''.
<P>
	Seniors are quite conspicuous by their absence from this 
mandate and review of the social security system. At the time 
the mandate was debated in the House I stood and proposed that 
it was deficient in that it ignored our social security system as it 
related to seniors. Seniors are some of the people most impacted 
by our social systems. OAS, CPP and health care are very much 
of concern to seniors. Yet their interests were ignored in the 
terms of reference for the review. Now the government stands 
and plays the violin about its commitment to seniors. That is a 
little hypocritical.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6951"> 6951 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	The bill does one thing for Canadians. It points out the 
enormous complexity of the legislation and administration of 
our social programs. This complexity catches Canadians in 
many ways and causes their lives to be a nightmare of forms, 
deadlines, red tape, information exchanges, letters, phone calls 
and all things that go along with an enormous state bureaucracy 
that is supposed to look after us but in fact does not do it very 
well.
<P>
	After one year in office the Liberal answer to the need to 
address the substantive dysfunction of a lot of our social 
programs, and the concern that the services to Canadians are 
eroding and cannot be sustained, is to bring forth a bit of 
housekeeping legislation. That is simply not good enough for 
Canadians. We need to be serious about addressing our social 
programs.
<P>
	I will talk about that in a moment but first I will address the 
concern about confidentiality. Canadians want to see some 
common sense in this area. For example, if a non-citizen, 
someone from another country, comes to Canada, decides to stay 
for reasons we can certainly well understand and makes 
applications as a refugee, that the individual is on welfare or 
some other social program cannot be disclosed to Canadians 
trying to evaluate which people should be allowed to come to 
our country and be accepted as citizens to help build our nation.
<P>
	There are many areas where the concern about confidentiality 
interferes with efficient, effective and common sense 
administration of our own system. For example, if someone 
applies for benefits often it cannot be disclosed in other 
jurisdictions or to administrators of other programs. That is one 
of the reasons we have abuse, inefficiency and overlap.
<P>
	We need to be very sensible when we address this area and not 
go overboard by suggesting that nobody, especially the system 
that is paying the bills, has a right to know what individual 
Canadians are receiving in benefits.
<P>
	The real issue is not that we need a little tinkering with our 
programs, a little housekeeping legislation from time to time to 
try to smooth the bureaucratic wheels. As we know these 
programs are in far deeper trouble than that. What is really 
needed is a substantial review and reform of our income security 
programs and our social programs and that is what we are not 
receiving from the government.
<P>
	The review taking place presently totally ignores all the 
programs of most concern to seniors. It totally ignores CPP. It 
totally ignores old age security. It totally ignores health care. 
Government says this is coming. Our social system is just that. It 
is a system. All these programs are interrelated. If changes are 
made to program <I>a it will impact on programs </I>b<I>, </I>c<I> and </I>d. That is 
the way it works. To do this piecemeal, to look at one program,
<P>
then maybe another and a couple of years  down the road we will 
get around to looking at the rest, is not the way to look in a 
coherent, effective and clear manner at how social programs 
should be administered.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	A lot of people refer to the old saying: if it ain't broke don't 
fix it. Why are we looking at social programs? Why has the 
government brought in the review of social programs in 
Canada? It is fairly clear to everyone in the House and certainly 
to most Canadians why it is necessary. Although these programs 
are barely 30 years old, they are already unsustainable 
financially. They are not paying their own way. The cost of these 
programs is growing astronomically year by year and, worst of 
all, they have been largely financed on the backs of our children.
<P>
	The bill for much of the spending on these programs which are 
so nice for us today is being handed to our children tomorrow. 
We are mortgaging our future so that we can have these 
programs. How long have we even had them? We have had them 
for 30 years. For 30 years we have impoverished our country and 
we are impoverishing our children so that we can have enormous 
benefits and an enormous bureaucracy to administer them. What 
have we accomplished? Very little as far as the long term benefit 
to the country is concerned.
<P>
	Someone needs to stand and say this and do something about 
it. Canadians are looking to the government for leadership and 
for a good, common sense grappling with the issues facing us 
not just today but in the future. We do not see that happening.
<P>
	We have a government that is continuing to say mortgaging 
our country to the tune of $100 billion during its term in office is 
okay. It will celebrate if that is all it does: if it only puts us in the 
hole by $25 billion a year it has done a great job for us! 
Canadians will beg to differ and certainly our children will beg 
to differ.
<P>
	Seniors are at risk unless something is done. This is why many 
seniors are dependent upon pension benefits they have counted 
on to sustain them in their retirement years. It is very clear from 
anybody looking at these programs that in coming years our 
seniors will be sadly disappointed.
<P>
	In just 15 short years we will have 40 per cent more retired 
Canadians than we have today. That is a huge increase. These 
Canadians will be looking for old age security payments. They 
will be looking for Canada pension plan payments. They will be 
looking to the health care system to make sure that their 
increased medical needs are covered and looked after.
<P>
	Yet what is happening? These programs are costing more and 
more money. They are increasing the debt burden on our country 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6952"> 6952 </A></B>
<P>
and are in serious trouble by any standard. Yet there has been no 
substantial, serious or urgent look at the situation.
<P>
	If we look at the Canada pension plan into which people like 
me faithfully and without any free will on the matter paid for so 
many years of our working lives, we see that the premiums to 
sustain the program have already had to rise. By the most 
moderate analysis they will be rising to at least 13 per cent by 
the time the next generation is paying our pensions. Some 
analysts suggest that the burden on future workers and taxpayers 
could be as high as 16 per cent. This off the top payment, even if 
it were only 10 per cent, will be in addition to the enormous 
yearly interest that will have to be paid on the money that we 
borrowed and to the payment for all the other programs we will 
be using.
<P>
	Do we seriously think the taxpayer of the future, in addition to 
paying the interest, paying for all the other programs to sustain 
society, trying to keep their lives together and building 
businesses and professional lives are going to pay an additional 
10 per cent, 13 per cent or 16 per cent off the top so that you and 
I, Mr. Speaker, can have the Canada pension plan? That is not 
going to happen.
<P>
	The future taxpayer will rise up in revolt and say that we are 
the guys that got them into the mess and if we think they are 
going to pay that much money off the top of their earnings in 
addition to everything else so we can have Canada pension fund 
benefits, we can think again; it is not going to happen. I can 
scarcely blame them.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	Somebody has to get serious about the situation. Just going 
along with it and saying ``don't worry, be happy; it will all work 
out'' is not good enough.
<P>
	The future taxpayer will have to pay billions and billions of 
dollars every year in interest on what we have borrowed. This 
year, for example, we are having to dig into our pockets for at 
least $40 billion-and it looks like it will be $44 billion-to pay 
interest on money the Liberal and Conservative governments 
have borrowed in the last 25 years. In 25 years they have 
managed to extract from our economy an obligation for $44 
billion, and that is $44 billion that cannot be used for old age 
security, Canada pension plan, health care and all other 
programs we desperately need.
<P>
	That interest obligation is rising. The government is going to 
think it is doing us all a favour if it only rises by another $5 
billion or $6 billion every year due to its feeble stewardship over 
the next four years of its mandate.
<P>
	We cannot continue to impoverish our future by not getting a 
grip on the issue today. We simply have to say we cannot 
continue to obligate our children to take $40 billion or $50 
billion every year out of our economy, out of their hard earned 
pay, out of our economic activity, because we did not have the 
courage and the good sense to do what is right: to live within our 
means and pay our own way.
<P>
	These programs have to be reorganized so that the people who 
really need them can count on them in the future. They have to 
be reorganized so that the state does not continue to have this 
enormous inefficient and ineffective bureaucratic growth, 
saying that it is going to look after us when it is abundantly clear 
that even at great cost, great inefficiency and great numbers of 
bureaucrats and administrative tribunals, it is simply not 
working and will not continue to work.
<P>
	Last of all, we need to ensure these programs will be 
something we can continue to count on and pay for into the 
future. That is absolutely essential. It is a cruel deception for the 
government to tell Canadians it is looking after things, that 
everything is all right and that it is going to reward seniors who 
have invested in the country by making sure they get the 
programs. The government's inaction is virtually ensuring that 
our seniors will not be getting these programs, even in the 
foreseeable future as numbers of seniors rise.
<P>
	I urge the House today not to look just at housekeeping 
legislation and a few little administrative changes to help a few 
people caught in the bureaucratic jungle. That is good; that is 
nice. However the answer is not to tinker with the programs. The 
answer is to look at the whole system that we have set up, all the 
structure that is not working after a mere 30 years or sometimes 
less, and have the courage, the vision and the leadership to get a 
grip on the situation and turn it around so that all Canadians can 
feel secure and confident that when they need help it will be 
there; otherwise the government will keep its hand out of their 
pockets and its nose out of their business.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We have now moved to

Standing Order 74, members will be allowed to make 20-minute

<P>
	Resuming debate. The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in this House today to speak 
to the bill before us. I want to emphasize a specific aspect of the 
bill, namely the proposed amendments to the Old Age Security 
Act, the Canada Pension Plan, and the Unemployment Insurance 
Act. These amendments are intended to advance the cause of 
social justice in this country.
<P>
	The proposed enactments would allow the government to 
disclose information to the Commissioner of the RCMP for the 
sole purpose of facilitating investigations, prosecutions and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6953"> 6953 </A></B>
<P>
extradition activities in relation to individuals suspected of 
having committed war crimes or crimes against humanity.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	The existing OAS and RPC legislation does not allow us to 
disclose privileged information, unless the person in question 
has been charged formally. Regarding unemployment insurance, 
the present legislation prohibits the disclosure of certain 
information, but does not prescribe the type of information that 
can be released in other instances to facilitate investigations.
<P>
	The amendments contained in this bill will standardize the 
circumstances under which information can be communicated 
to the RCMP regarding the three programs I mentioned.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to the fact 
that, with the new legislation, the Commissioner of the RCMP, 
the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of Canada are 
the three persons to whom the information could be made 
available. It would be strictly forbidden, under any 
circumstances, to disclose information concerning any 
beneficiary to a foreign organization.
<P>
	In 1985, the federal government instituted the Commission of 
Inquiry on War Criminals, presided by the hon. Justice 
Deschênes. The commission tabled its report in the House of 
Commons in March of 1987. It recommended that the RCMP 
and the Department of Justice work together to investigate war 
crimes that were said to have been committed between 1939 and 
1945, that is to say during the last World War.
<P>
	The report also contained a list of people presumed to be war 
criminals living in Canada. Both the RCMP and the Department 
of Justice worked hard to find and charge these people. 
Unfortunately, this was no easy task. Despite the considerable 
resources invested by Canada and 17 other countries, the RCMP 
was unable to find many of those suspected of war crimes or 
crimes against humanity. The lack of information is, of course, 
the main reason behind this lack of success.
<P>
	Furthermore, efforts to obtain relevant information overseas 
were compromised since the information was destroyed. 
Although such information exists in Canada, it is more often 
than not impossible to access because of the restrictions 
imposed, not to make war criminals untouchable but to protect 
the legitimate rights of honest Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Given the age of the individuals in question, the clientele of 
the OAS and the CPP programs, the databases for these 
programs are clearly a valuable source of information for 
locating and identifying persons alleged to have committed war 
crimes. A first step toward providing access to this information 
was taken in 1992 when the legislation for OAS and CPP was 
amended to allow the release of confidential information where 
a criminal charge had been laid.
<P>
	However the loosening up of the existing restrictions did not 
prove to be all that helpful to investigators since a charge cannot 
be laid if the RCMP is not certain that the suspect is in fact a war 
criminal. Unfortunately the needed information to establish this 
can only be released after a charge has been laid.
<P>
	There are two types of information belonging to the 
unemployment insurance program which could be of value to 
investigators. The first type is the information given by the 
persons receiving unemployment insurance benefits. Given the 
ages of the suspected war criminals few of them are likely to still 
be in the labour force let alone collecting unemployment 
insurance. However, there may be exceptions and providing the 
RCMP access to UI client information could in fact provide the 
missing link needed in a few cases.
<P>
	This type of information will be of valuable assistance in the 
investigation of modern war crimes and crimes against 
humanity. As well it would mean that all beneficiary 
information under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Human 
Resources Development would be treated in essentially the 
same way for war crimes investigations.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	It is also important to emphasize that providing access to 
client information in this one instance does not mean the 
government is taking its responsibility to safeguard client 
information any less seriously. OAS, CPP and UI privacy 
provisions have always been deliberately restrictive because of 
the nature of the information collected. Public servants who 
administer these programs are required to collect personal 
information from millions of Canadians in order to manage 
these programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. This is a very 
important debate, so I would like to call a quorum please.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I see a quorum. Resuming 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is indeed a very important 
debate. I should also advise hon. members opposite that this 
government takes its work very seriously. I am also informed 
there are 15 committees taking place today on a variety of 
subjects.
<P>
	I would like to continue my speech.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We want your views.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> I will give you some views later on.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. With the greatest 
respect to all my colleagues on both sides of the House, please 
direct all your interventions through the Chair so that we might 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6954"> 6954 </A></B>
<P>
continue to have the usual customary respectful debate we are 
accustomed to in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, public servants who administer 
these programs are required to collect personal information 
from millions of Canadians in order to manage these programs. 
It would be a tremendous administrative obstacle if clients 
refused to give officials of the Department of Human Resources 
Development personal information because they feared this 
information would not be adequately protected. Confidentiality 
provisions were made as restrictive as they are to protect 
Canadians from unwelcome intrusions.
<P>
	However, Canadians are also concerned about criminals who 
have entered Canada and may be living in their midst. While 
Canadians value their privacy they also want justice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, there remains another amendment that I would like to 
explain to all members of the House. It is the amendment to the 
Old Age Security Act and the Canada Pension Plan, which 
results from another amendment that has been proposed by the 
Solicitor General.
<P>
	This amendment would allow the Department of Human 
Resources Development to provide information on OAS and 
CPP benefits now paid to prison inmates. This must surely be of 
interest to Reform Party members.
<P>
	The goal is to deduct housing and feeding costs from these 
inmates' income. The Solicitor General could then receive from 
the Department of Human Resources Development accurate 
information on inmates' income so he can make reasonable 
deductions.
<P>
	Is it right that inmates are housed and fed for free and that they 
can accumulate income from federal benefits which are, of 
course, eventually paid for by the government and by Canadian 
taxpayers? I do not think so. Pensioners who are not criminals 
must pay their own housing and other costs. To ensure a 
minimum level of fairness and responsibility, the same principle 
should apply to prison inmates, especially if they also receive 
federal benefits.
<P>
	In conclusion, I hope that my explanations have helped to 
establish the validity of some of the amendments in this bill and 
that all members now have the information they need to explain 
in turn these amendments to their constituents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member opposite is of course in favour of the bill and is 
telling us now that he supports it mainly for the sake of social 
justice. I wonder, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	The confidential information that he praised and which would 
be made available to the RCMP would just be a tool to expose 
some cheaters of unemployment insurance or in other areas.
<P>
	The bill as presented does not contain enough measures to 
limit it to that. Knowing the way RCMP officers work, we 
noticed in past years that they used these famous lists to do their 
work, although this information was not available. We need only 
recall the Parti Quebecois's membership list. The RCMP tried to 
obtain a copy and then tried to see if members on that list were 
breaking certain laws.
<P>
	So I ask the hon. member the following question: Does this 
bill in its present form guarantee us that the information which 
will be made available to the RCMP will be used only by that 
force and not for other unintended purposes?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that a long time has passed 
since the unfortunate events of the 1970s; however, I can assure 
him that, under the terms of the law as proposed, we will ensure 
the confidentiality of information on Canadians. Nevertheless, 
we should still take into account the presence of some war 
criminals, or at least consider certain crimes against humanity 
that they committed. Of course, I referred to the period from 
1939 to 1945, but we must still understand that others who took 
part in wars which are still going on, be it in Yugoslavia or 
Somalia or elsewhere in the world, committed crimes which are 
as atrocious as those committed from 1939 to 1945 for which 
people were charged.
<P>
	Unfortunately, such people try to enter Canada and settle 
among us, and I believe that it is the duty of the RCMP, the 
Government of Canada and all hon. members here in this House 
to denounce the presence of any war criminals in this country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a 
few years away from becoming a senior. The hon. member is 
many more years away from becoming a senior; it is way out 
there in front of him as he points out.
<P>
	Based on the hon. member's age and notwithstanding the 
contributions he is making to the Canada pension plan now, all 
of us know there is an unfunded liability there that we are not 
currently accounting for that we are all paying. Knowing that, 
does he believe there will be sufficient funds in the account? 
Does he believe that future generations will be able to make the 
size of premium payments required for this hon. member to 
receive his CPP when he reaches the age of 65, whether or not he 
elects to get it at an earlier age? If he does not believe that, what 
does he think this government should do about it?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6955"> 6955 </A></B>
<P>
	The other issue I would like to touch upon is a little closer 
to my heart. There is another fund that we look after in our 
social programs. We in the Reform Party, as do government 
members-they have said it often enough-care about the truly 
needy. We care about providing services, funding and facilities 
for those people who really and truly need it. The problem in 
our government today however is that we have not spent enough 
time and effort to establish where that line is, or the grey area 
where it is, so that we can start helping those people.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	OAS is an unfunded program currently which nobody since 
1971 has paid into. I would like the hon. member, based on his 
youthful experience, to say whether he believes that 25 years 
from now or 35 years from now, whenever he reaches the age of 
65, he should receive $386 per month as his reward for 
becoming 65. If he does not need it, should he receive that 
money? If his income is below a household average or a certain 
minimum income level, then I believe we all should get it should 
we be so unfortunate, the two of us, that when we are 65 we need 
that help.
<P>
	These two questions are meant to be serious questions. I am 
not playing games here. These are two issues that play hard on 
my mind. I am grappling with them and I want to come up with 
some solutions.
<P>
	Would this member tell me whether there will be money there 
for CPP, and does he feel an entitlement to his OAS payments 
when he reaches 65?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course the hon. member is 
raising a very pertinent question on the state of finances in 
Canada. We know we have a high deficit. We are facing 
problems, but we are also facing challenges.
<P>
	One has to keep in mind that the whole idea of the projet de loi 
is to try to find solutions, to bring Canadians back into the 
workforce, putting them back to work. Much has to be done in 
terms of training and retraining. Much has to be done in terms of 
trying to free up capital for small businesses.
<P>
	Just the other day there was a report that was brought to the 
attention of hon. members as a result of which we are going to be 
asking banks to put up some money to try to encourage small 
businesses and free enterprise and to go on to try to create jobs 
throughout Canada. Much can be done with small employers.
<P>
	Of course the Canada today is not that of the year of my birth, 
1962. Things have changed. Things will keep on changing. 
However, as long as we look into other venues in trying to 
encourage investment, foreign investment, trying to free up 
capital for small companies and corporations, I am sure that we 
will surmount these obstacles and that there will be money 
available for all Canadians in the years to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, I had 
overestimated the member's age. Now that I know his age I 
would like to ask him again whether he feels there will be 
sufficient moneys in CPP. The CPP question he did answer. He 
feels there will be. On the OAS, the second question I asked, 
does he feel an entitlement to receive whatever the monthly 
payment may be in the future just because he reaches age 65 
should he be above the minimum wage?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a Liberal and as a Canadian as 
well I should add that I believe in the concept of universality in 
different programs that are given to all Canadians. That is one of 
the hallmarks of this federation, that we recognize the fact that 
all Canadians should be treated equally.
<P>
	However, trying to answer a hypothetical question as posed by 
the Reform Party would be like asking one of my predecessors 
elected in 1962 whether he foresees the election of the Reform 
Party and the Bloc Quebecois 32 years down the road. It is very 
difficult to make those kinds of assumptions that moneys will 
not be there.
<P>
	The economy is evolving and changes are taking place. Of 
course, our government is taking charge of our finances. The 
Minister of Finance is doing a commendable job. We have to 
keep in mind that also our Minister of Human Resources 
Development wants to consult Canadians. That is one of the 
reasons why we are out there asking Canadians to put something 
into the system.
<P>
	We want to consult them and I am sure we are going to get all 
kinds of proposals and solutions outside this Parliament which 
we do not regrettably receive from the opposition benches.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure today to rise and address this bill, but I also wish to 
address the larger debate that is going on across the country and 
really the one that has been going on this morning and that is 
with respect to the social program review that is currently under 
way.
<P>
	To have a good understanding of the social program review I 
think it is very important that we go back and look at the genesis 
of this idea and the genesis of the debate. Probably the first thing 
we should do is point out that during the last election campaign 
the Liberals across the way did not even mention social program 
reform as an issue. It was as though it did not exist.
<P>
	There was an interesting article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> from 
October 14:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the election, then Prime Minister Kim Campbell stepped on a land 
mine by declaring a campaign was the ``worst possible time'' to discuss social 
policy reform. Jean Chrétien criticized her heavily and tiptoed around the same 
land mine with the following assurance: ``I say that the programs are there and 
they will remain the same-''.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6956"> 6956 </A></B>
<P>
	That was a year ago. That is the type of double talk that the 
Prime Minister used to accuse the Conservatives of using.
<P>
	The article goes on, quoting the Prime Minister:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The plan of the party is clear. The social safety net that we have in Canada will 
remain.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Liberal's election bible, the red book, made no reference to a major review 
of social programs or even whether one might be necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to contrast that with how the Reform Party 
addressed this issue which was to address it head on, 
recognizing that fiscal problems in this country are directly 
linked to social policy because social programs eat up almost 
$80 billion a year and we cannot tackle fiscal problems without 
making some cuts in social programs.
<P>
	However, I point out that the approach we took was to start 
cutting at the top first before we got to social programs. We said 
that Canadians demand leadership by example. They want to see 
cuts to the cost of Parliament. They want to see MPs' pensions 
done away with in the current form. They are concerned with 
overlap between not only federal and provincial government but 
also between different departments within the federal 
government. They want to see subsidies to business and special 
interest groups trimmed. We would then take a look at social 
programs in conjunction with the people of Canada.
<P>
	What we found out in the days and months leading up to the 
election was that people did believe that there had to be cuts 
made there in order to achieve a balanced budget which even 
now the finance minister is beginning to recognize in this 
country. Hopefully it is not too late.
<P>
	What we said is that people place a very high priority on 
maintaining spending for health care in this country and we 
agreed. We said that health care spending should be maintained. 
However, we should respect the authority of the provinces and 
their jurisdiction under the Constitution to have control over 
health care.
<P>
	The other thing that people told us was very important to them 
was maintaining funding for post-secondary education. We 
proposed various ideas to make that even more effective but 
maintain the funding.
<P>
	Some of the other areas where people felt there could be some 
cuts and changes made were unemployment insurance; a 
proposal to make unemployment insurance a true insurance 
program based on the idea that employers and employees who 
fund the program, who put the money in, should have control 
over it. In other words, we were proposing to empower 
individuals to have control over their own lives and create the 
type of insurance system that would be truly responsive to their 
needs. They would set the eligibility requirements, the 
premiums and the benefits. That I will refer to in a little more 
detail further down the road.
<P>
	Let us fast forward now to the throne speech of January of 
1994, to the budget and to the announcement that there would be 
a social program review. I think it was January 31 if memory 
serves. The hon. member from across the way is nodding his 
head.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	On that day it was announced that there would be a social 
program review and that there would be a final report to the 
House with recommendations and, I believe, legislation this 
fall. That has now gone way off track but we will get into that in 
a moment.
<P>
	Let us go back to what the budget speech and budget 
documents were saying about the social program review. On the 
issue of social security reform, I quote from one of the 
documents: ``The standing committee will seek the views of 
Canadians on issues and objectives until April. The minister 
will then table a federal action plan and the standing committee 
will conduct public hearings on it until September and report in 
October. As well, federal-provincial territorial activities will 
take place during this period. The government will table reform 
legislation in the fall''.
<P>
	It also addressed how it would tackle some of the other social 
policy areas that are not actually in the social security review 
right now, things like health care, old age security and Canada 
pension plan.
<P>
	For some reason these were not included in a package together 
and I find that odd because they are inextricably linked and I 
think we will see if we look at the current green paper that there 
are contradictions perhaps or at least we are putting the cart 
before the horse in some cases. For instance, in the green paper 
there is a reference to unemployed people using RRSPs so that 
they can get themselves through a period of unemployment.
<P>
	On the other hand we have not even addressed the issue of 
Canada's old age security and Canada pension plan yet and what 
is going to happen with that. Meanwhile the government is 
floating trial balloons on RRSP taxation and things like that. 
That is well ahead of any paper that is coming down on the future 
Canada pension plan and old age security.
<P>
	Right from the get go the government made a grave error 
when it did not look at these different areas together.
<P>
	The idea of the social program reform was to find out what 
kind of ideas there were out there so we could do two things, 
make social programs more efficient and save some money.
<P>
	The government denied that was really the case initially. It 
wanted to leave us with the impression that this was really an 
effort to make things more efficient and help people get off 
unemployment and that kind of thing. Running through this was 
a growing awareness, certainly from the finance minister if not 
from the rest of the cabinet, that cuts were going to have to come 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6957"> 6957 </A></B>
<P>
in the  next federal budget and that we could not go on spending 
as much money as we have been spending in this country.
<P>
	Once the social program review was launched there were 
delays. There were problems right off the bat. There were 
patronage appointments made to the task force, people being 
paid big per diems. More delays came along. The thing 
floundered.
<P>
	People really wanted to see the social program review 
succeed. Canadians have been talking about the need for social 
program review for 10, 12, 15 years and they want this 
government to succeed. They want it to do well because they 
know that their interests are at stake. They grew concerned and I 
would argue that those concerns continue to grow today.
<P>
	Not only was this program review put on hold continually 
much to the chagrin of Canadians, but on the eve of the release 
of the long awaited green paper there was a revelation in the 
Toronto Star that the social program reform was going to 
include big cuts, $7.5 billion worth, even though the 
government had given Canadians the impression that they would 
be consulted in this before any types of cuts were actually 
considered.
<P>
	On the other hand, I am certain there was a printing mistake. 
When the green paper was released there were no figures at all in 
it. In other words, Canadians were being asked to choose among 
all these different programs without knowing how much they 
would cost and what the costs of the various alternatives were. 
Obviously that was a mistake, a printing mistake I am certain, 
because no government would ever put forward a list of 
proposals without having something so critical in it as the cost 
of the actual programs.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	Every day Canadians make decisions on all kinds of issues. 
Chief among them I can guarantee is how much they cost, 
because they know they have to live within their means. 
Somehow this escapes the government.
<P>
	Also missing from the various options were many of the 
options put before the government during the period that led up 
to the actual presentation of the document in the House. I sat in 
on some of the HRD meetings and heard some of the 
presentations that were given. I remember sitting in a committee 
meeting suggesting that the studies and inquiries from past royal 
commissions should become part of the official body of 
information that the government refers to when it is considering 
the options.
<P>
	I mentioned specifically the Forget commission report. It 
talked for instance about unemployment insurance and 
returning it to the employers and the employees, the people who 
fund it. That was rejected by the committee because the Liberal 
majority voted against it for reasons that escape me. There were 
members who spoke in favour of it. When the whip was cracked 
they all voted against the proposal. I invite the hon. 
parliamentary secretary to review the record.
<P>
	Not all of the various options are in the paper. That is 
unfortunate because Canadians should have a chance to look at 
some of the other options that were put before the committee.
<P>
	Initially this document was put forward as an action plan. 
That was the wording of the motion. It said-I think on January 
31-that the government would be tabling an action plan in the 
days and weeks to come. Somehow over the course of the last 
several months the action plan became watered down and 
diluted to the point where it became a discussion paper.
<P>
	In other words the minister who has the power to call to heel 
armies of bureaucrats and all kinds of minions to gather all the 
wisdom in the country about social policy reform, after all that 
time, money and the thousands of hours that were spent on it, 
brought forward a little green pamphlet with scarcely any action 
at all or any call for action, but merely a few of the options of the 
many that were discussed. That was a real shame.
<P>
	We are now in a situation in which other groups around the 
country have come forward and said: ``We have some ideas that 
the government for some reason did not want to consider''.
<P>
	I point to the Kierans-Robson report from the C.D. Howe 
Institute in which not only did they come out with options, but 
they came out with costs. They said: ``We will tell you how 
much money we are going to cut from some of these areas''.
<P>
	These are not what I am suggesting, but they should be in the 
debate. On the topic of unemployment insurance they suggest 
that unemployment insurance should be converted into true 
insurance; there should be a proposal to eliminate regional 
differences in qualifying periods and benefits and we should 
eliminate all regional and non-insurance components. The 
savings from that would be $5.5 billion. They were not ashamed 
to suggest there would be some savings there.
<P>
	Under the Canada assistance plan they suggested that we 
eliminate and divert $2.5 billion to a new child tax credit to low 
income households. The total savings on that would be $4.9 
billion.
<P>
	They talked about health care, which is something the 
government has been reluctant to discuss, or at least they are 
having trouble getting the provinces to come to the table. At this 
very moment the Prime Minister is delivering a speech to an 
empty assembly of people called for the health care forum. Not 
only were the health care ministers from across the country 
invited and did not show up, but the premiers were invited by the 
Prime Minister himself. They refused to come for two reasons: 
first, they know that under the Constitution this is their 
jurisdiction; second, they resent that although they are the 
senior partners in this arrangement and they pay the lion's share 
of the cost for health care-almost double what the federal 
government pays-the federal government is attempting to set 
the agenda. It has made a grave error in this. There are other 
areas including social  program reform, GST reform and 
interprovincial trade barriers where it has made the same errors.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> They would not 
even let them co-chair the proceedings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> The government would not even let them 
co-chair the proceedings, Mr. Speaker, as my hon. friend points 
out.
<P>
	Suffice it to say there are many problems with the green paper. 
It has been roundly criticized by the media, by the provinces, 
and by the many special interest groups that were funded by the 
government to come and appear before them but by Canadians 
themselves.
<P>
	Reform's zero-three program really led the way. Lately we 
have had proposals from Tom Courchene who actually appeared 
before the committee. The hon. member from Winnipeg across 
the way was there when he appeared. He made an excellent 
presentation. I guess he did not find any of his proposals in the 
green paper so he felt it was necessary to bring out his own. It is 
now in the arena of public debate. Hopefully the government 
will see fit to include it in its area of debate as well and will 
consider some of Mr. Courchene's ideas.
<P>
	The government has another problem. We are rapidly 
approaching the end of 1994. It has delayed again the time when 
it will call for the reporting deadline on this issue to February 6, 
1995. We have moved from getting this into legislation this fall. 
Possibly when we consider the time it takes to draft legislation 
and for it to pass through various readings in the House and 
committee, it is quite conceivable that it will be well into 1996 
before it actually becomes legislation, if that is what the 
government decides to do.
<P>
	It will probably be a year, perhaps a year and a half, before the 
next election if the government holds an election within four 
years. That concerns me. It is a well known fact that 
governments very often fail at the last moment, at the critical 
point, when they are faced with going before the electorate, 
particularly when they are talking about making deep cuts to 
something that Canadians value like social programs.
<P>
	I am concerned about that. This issue is inextricably 
intertwined with the whole issue of fiscal responsibility and the 
huge problems we face because of overspending by this Liberal 
government and the Conservative governments that went 
before.
<P>
	We have a deficit of $40 billion. We have a debt approaching 
$535 billion. Soon international lenders are going to get fed up. 
They are going to say that they have had enough and want to find 
a place where their investment will be safe.
<P>
	I am concerned the government across the way has not 
realized that. It does not understand the urgency. While the 
finance minister may realize it, I think the Prime Minister has 
failed to grasp it, as has the human resources development 
minister.
<P>
	I urge the government to come to grips with the seriousness of 
the situation, to take another look at its social program reform 
and to move ahead with serious cuts in the very near future for 
the sake of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I paid attention to the hon. member's speech.
<P>
	I thought we were debating the redesign of the ISP. I want to 
ask the hon. member if he has any opinions on some concrete 
examples that would improve services for seniors because this is 
what the bill is about.
<P>
	For example, it will only take half a day to process a simple 
OAS application which now takes around seven days to do. 
Processing time for an application for Canada pension plan 
benefits will drop from 13 days to one day. Telephone service 
will be improved so that 97 per cent of all telephone calls will 
get answered. Today only about 50 per cent get answered. 
Seniors will be able to make changes to information such as 
change of address over the telephone using a touch tone system. 
For clients who prefer personal service or who do not have a 
touch tone phone, staff will be available to answer their 
questions quickly.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	These are real, positive changes that have an impact on the 
lives of seniors on an every day basis. The hon. member should 
be addressing issues that we deal with in this bill. However he 
has taken the opportunity to expand and talk about the social 
security review. The reality is that the government has been the 
first one in a long time that has had the courage to face up to 
some very difficult challenges and choices we have to make as a 
nation.
<P>
	Thirteen per cent of the people in Canada are unemployed for 
a year or longer. Long term unemployment has increased three 
times since 1976. When 40 per cent of these people are faced 
with structural unemployment and 30 per cent of Canadians 
have problems with literacy and numeracy skills, one has to 
admit we have to move toward building a better and more 
efficient social security system that; first, helps Canadians get 
jobs and keep jobs; second, would help the most vulnerable and; 
third, is sustainable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6959"> 6959 </A></B>
<P>
	Another flaw in the speech delivered by the hon. member 
deals with the red book. I do not expect the hon. member to 
read the red book, among other books which he has not read. 
If he was to read the red book very carefully he will find these 
references. I want to cite them to the hon. member because I 
know he will be engaged in the social security debate. I am sure 
he does not want to give misinformation to Canadians.
<P>
	If the hon. member would read page 16 he will find the red 
book commitment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will adopt a series of measures to put Canadians back to 
work and foster economic growth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Page 21:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is our goal to help people on social assistance who are able to work, to move 
from dependence to full participation in the economic and social life of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Page 22:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will work with all the provinces to use established 
funding mechanisms such as CAP in more innovative ways in order to move from 
passive to active support of people in need.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Other pages deal with issues we are dealing with in the social 
security review. It seems to me that the hon. member must take 
the time to read the red book, to read the green book, and in a 
very honest way also tell Canadians where the Reform Party is 
going to cut $15 billion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. parliamentary 
secretary for his series of questions. He has touched on a number 
of issues and on this bill in particular. I commend the 
government if it is trying to improve services. Obviously we 
have to do that.
<P>
	However, as the hon. member for Calgary North pointed out it 
is kind of like polishing the chrome when the transmission is 
going. The big issue before the country today is social program 
reform. It is one of the huge issues. Let us not debate whether 
answering the phone sooner is a good thing. Of course it is. We 
all know that answering the phone and providing faster service 
for seniors is important. We understand that.
<P>
	By pulling out vague references to discussion about social 
program reform or about minor aspects of social program 
reform, it does not follow that the government made any kind of 
commitment in the red book to deal with this problem in a 
serious way.
<P>
	The government downplayed the whole issue during the 
election campaign. It downplayed the seriousness of the debt 
situation to the point where a year after it came into power it is 
just now beginning to realize how seriously we are in debt in this 
country. Not because it wants to but because international 
investors have told them: ``Get your act together or we are going 
to start to move our money out of the country''. It is that simple. 
It is not because it somehow saw this ahead of time and put 
together a big task force and went to Canadians.
<P>
	With all due respect to the parliamentary secretary, if he had 
referred to our zero and three plan, of which we distributed 
millions of copies during the election campaign, he would know 
we talked about our changes to social program reform. They are 
on the public record. In fact this spring we gave the finance 
minister a list of $20 billion in proposed cuts for the government 
to use in its efforts to get the deficit and debt under control. I 
offer that to the parliamentary secretary for him to look at.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, B.Q.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member, which 
relates more to the human aspect of this bill.
<P>
	When reading the amendment we proposed, one realizes that 
the bill really does little to protect those it covers against 
possible undue solicitation. I refer, for example, to the fact that 
the person giving unauthorized sources access to a beneficiary's 
personal information, for commercial purposes, telemarketing 
or whatever, would not be liable to prosecution under the 
Criminal Code. This would open up quite a window of 
opportunity to those wanting to take advantage of clients who 
might be more vulnerable to such an approach.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not fear that, if we adopt this bill, we 
might create another situation like the one we now face under 
the Unemployment Insurance Act, concerning the entitlement of 
related people working for the same employer, for example, and 
where there is something akin to harassment from Revenue 
Canada? In these cases, studies and inquiries might be more 
justified, but in others, they may not be. One thing is certain, 
this is time-consuming.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not think that this bill, as presented, 
might subject the elderly to the difficult situation that UI 
recipients are now facing? Second, as I said, will we not be 
subjecting the elderly to a series of solicitations, due to the fact 
that some people could have a financial interest in 
communicating the lists of those concerned by the legislation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize to the hon. member. I 
missed the first part of what he was saying but he spoke largely 
on the aspect of confidentiality. There is no question in my mind 
that is something we have to be careful of.
<P>
	Obviously this country has a long history of trying to keep 
records of a personal nature confidential. I point to the problems 
that can occur when those things get out. In fact if memory 
serves, in Ontario a provincial minister resigned over that issue. 
There is no question that is something we have to be cautious of. 
It is an area I think the hon. member knows more about than I do. 
Having said those things I will leave it at that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to speak to the specific issue before the House 
which
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6960"> 6960 </A></B>
<P>
is Bill C-54. For that reason I want to take the opportunity to 
summarize the amendments and the purpose for them.
<P>
	As we have heard from some during the course of this debate, 
these amendments do not reflect major policy initiatives. 
Instead, this bill deals with the improvements required to the 
affected acts to improve client service and administration.
<P>
	Undoubtedly, the most significant of the changes is the 
amendment to the Old Age Security Act which will grant the 
Minister of Human Resources Development the discretion to 
waive renewable applications for guaranteed income 
supplements and spouse's allowance recipients. This is an 
obvious example of improved client service. It will make it 
possible in the future to reduce the paper burden for many 
seniors and reduce the number of seniors who do not receive 
their income supplements on time because they are late filing 
their renewal applications.
<P>
	Next, are the changes to the old age security appeal system 
which will allow for a more efficient and effective appeal for 
those clients who are dissatisfied with a decision under the OAS 
Act. This new system should result in fewer decisions having to 
be appealed to the courts. It should allow clients to see a 
resolution to their appeals more quickly.
<P>
	Another important group of amendments deal with expanded 
information disclosure. These amendments which affect all four 
acts being amended by Bill C-54 will improve co-ordination 
and administration of programs that are, out of necessity, 
becoming more interdependent.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	For the first time as well important client databanks could be 
used to assist in investigations, prosecutions and extradition 
activities in relation to war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
Because of the restrictions on the circumstances under which 
such information can be released clients can still be assured of 
the government's commitment to protect personal information.
<P>
	Also included in this group is an amendment which allows the 
Correctional Services Canada to have limited information about 
OAS and CPP benefits that are paid to inmates in federal 
institutions.
<P>
	The next amendment I would like to address is the 
reintroduction of 12 months of retroactive benefits for those 
Canada pension plan retirement beneficiaries who apply after 
their 65th birthday. This will equal the retroactivity period for 
the old age security benefits as well as for other benefits 
provided under the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	Also of significance to the fair and equitable treatment of 
pensioners is the amendment which would give the minister 
discretion to waive old age security overpayments that are 
caused by errors on the part of the  department. This amendment 
mirrors a provision currently in the Canada pension plan and 
ensures that clients are not financially responsible for errors 
over which they have no control.
<P>
	That summarizes what in my mind are the major amendments 
included in Bill C-54, but there are also a number of minor 
amendments of which I want to make mention. In some of these 
more minor amendments we really see the subtle changes that 
can be made to improve the way we do business in government. 
These improvements translate to better service to those persons 
affected by government legislation, in other words, to all of us at 
some point during our lives.
<P>
	For instance, any employee in the Department of Human 
Resources Development involved in the administration of one of 
the acts will be able to take statutory declarations and 
affirmations not only for these programs but for other federal 
and provincial departments. This will save clients from having 
to go to more than one office for these services as now happens.
<P>
	In addition, the OAS and CPP acts will allow for 
municipalities to be reimbursed directly for assistance that they 
provide to a benefit applicant while their application is being 
adjudicated. Currently the acts only permit for reimbursement 
to a provincial government which means that the province then 
has to reimburse the municipality. Removing the middle man, if 
that is what you want to refer to it as being, will certainly 
streamline administration.
<P>
	Old age security and Canada pension plan clients will also be 
well served by an amendment to the administrative error and 
erroneous advice provisions. It would no longer be necessary for 
the client to complain in writing before the minister could take 
corrective action in cases where the department has made an 
error. Without this amendment the department cannot legally 
take corrective action when it finds that a client has lost benefit 
entitlement because of an error made by an employee. The client 
is required to contact the minister in writing before such errors 
are corrected.
<P>
	This provision was not fair nor did it recognize the 
complexity of the legislation. Clients should not be expected to 
always realize when an error has been made. Now both sides, 
either the client or the administration, can be the catalyst which 
prompts corrective action.
<P>
	Under the Old Age Security Act benefit overpayments can 
only be collected if the overpayment occurred in the last two 
years. This time limit is being removed to ensure that clients are 
not receiving benefits to which they are not entitled. It is only 
reasonable that a debt should not be waived just because of a 
certain length of time has past.
<P>
	As we all know, the government as a whole must ensure that 
scarce financial resources go to those individuals for whom they 
are intended. There will be those individuals for whom 
repayment would cause hardship. This is already taken care of 
through a  provision in the Old Age Security Act which gives the 
minister the authority to waive overpayments in certain circum-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6961"> 6961 </A></B>
<P>
stances. Only those individuals who can repay benefits are asked 
to do so.
<P>
	I certainly have not covered all of the amendments. However I 
have summarized those that I feel will have the most significant 
impact on our pensioner population. I feel that this bill is a step 
in the right direction and that clients are the beneficiaries of the 
changes. As I am sure we are all aware, there is more that we can 
do and will be done as the efforts to improve the machinery of 
government move along.
<P>
	I look forward to seeing further improvements in the not too 
distant future.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the member's comments 
on Bill C-54 which is before us today. He is talking about very 
technical but really minor housekeeping items to the social 
programs.
<P>
	I am not sure if we can tackle this minor housekeeping with a 
whiskbroom. A farmer once said that after the cows have been in 
the barn for a long time, you cannot use a whiskbroom; 
sometimes you need to use a front end loader to clean up the 
mess. Maybe that is what we should be looking at today.
<P>
	The member talked about old age security. The Reform Party 
has put forward proposals on several occasions during the 
election campaign and in this House regarding old age security. 
It has made some recommendations and shown actual savings in 
the area of $3.5 billion, keeping in mind that we feel very 
strongly that the program should be directed to those most in 
need in this country.
<P>
	Can the member give us a specific example of what he thinks 
would be a way we could actually show some savings with that 
program?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway</b>: Mr. Speaker, I am quite interested that a 
member from the west of Canada would talk about 
whiskbrooms. I guess he knows more about farming.
<P>
	I am also quite surprised with the observations made by the 
speaker in the sense that he feels that in some ways this is a trite 
and insignificant piece of legislation. I am surprised this would 
come from a member opposite who in the party sense is always 
suggesting they are the ones who can discern in their wisdom 
what people are thinking.
<P>
	I can safely tell the member opposite that despite what he 
feels about the triteness of this if he would follow what happens 
in his constituency office he would find that this delivery of 
service is a major factor. It is of great concern to seniors. To 
suggest that in some way dealing with this problem is using a 
whiskbroom when he would use some other farm device I find 
quite surprising.
<P>
	I would ask him to consult with the seniors with whom he 
deals. I would ask him perhaps to have one of these consultation 
processes with the seniors whom he serves. I think he would find 
they would welcome these changes.
<P>
	In dealing with government bureaucracy, and we all 
acknowledge there is a certain element, a continuum of 
bureaucracy, I think he will find that his constituent base will 
welcome these types of changes. The seniors are going to 
welcome the streamlining and flattening of the process 
somewhat and empowering those who make the decisions and 
collapsing the vertical portion of the system.
<P>
	We are talking about the delivery of service to primarily a 
senior base. In the past, the have found the operation of the 
system to be very frustrating.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member very much for not 
answering my question.
<P>
	The interesting thing is that my riding of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, has one of the highest 
percentages of senior citizens in the country. The hon. member 
should study that and pay attention to when the west speaks, 
because we do know what we are speaking of.
<P>
	The hon. member spoke of consultation. No other party in this 
House has spent more time in consulting with the people of 
Canada than the Reform Party of Canada. Recently I held a 
series of townhall meetings in my riding. These are not just 
townhall meetings where we go out and speak; they are 
interactive workshops where people participate back and forth. 
In these series of meetings we identified the deficit and debt as 
the number one enemy in Canada right now.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	We are looking at a social program system that spends some 
$80 billion a year. We are looking at interest payments of $40 
billion to $44 billion a year. That is what is robbing the social 
safety net. I support some of the items in the bill 
wholeheartedly. I can say that we have to improve on the 
administration but I want specifics.
<P>
	I will ask the member the same question. What can he and his 
party suggest that will save some money on social programs, 
specifically old age security?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it very interesting that the 
hon. member is on the cutting edge of consultation. Once again 
it would appear that members opposite are the only ones who in 
some way, as I stated earlier, are able to discern what the public 
wishes.
<P>
	He stated that during recent townhall meetings in the west the 
number one issue was the debt and the deficit. At the same time 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6962"> 6962 </A></B>
<P>
members opposite stated that during the election. This party on 
this side of the House dealt with that during the election and the 
finance minister is dealing with it now.
<P>
	In terms of identifying issues I do not think members on that 
side of the House are in some way on the cutting edge of 
knowing what Canadians are thinking. I would agree to an extent 
that they may know what is going on in certain very limited 
regional areas of the west, but I do not think that in the 
mainstream of Canada they are able to discern what is on the 
minds of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind the member that not only are 
there Reform Party of Canada members in western Canada. 
They are from coast to coast and we do have townhall meetings 
right across the country.
<P>
	Can the member just give me one area? I think all of Canada 
should be able to come to any member of Parliament and ask for 
one area where money can be saved in a specific program.
<P>
	For the third time I would like to ask the same question. Will 
the member identify one area in old age security where we can 
have substantive savings, and will he tell us the figure we would 
save?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a hallmark of members 
opposite that they do not like to speak about the legislation 
before the House. They would rather speak about their grand 
scheme of Canada and their identification through their unique 
patented processes called townhall meetings.
<P>
	As a result of all the townhall meetings they are apparently 
having in Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and 
other provinces, why does the member opposite not tell us the 
results of what Canadians are telling them in terms of what the 
number one issues of the day are?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> On a point of clarification, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Perhaps the member 
would like to speak to a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. According 
to the Standing Orders I understand that when members ask 
ministers of the crown questions in question period they do not 
necessarily have to answer. In debate and under questions and 
comments do members of Parliament have to answer?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Clearly the Speaker does 
not deem the matter to be a point of order; it is more a matter of 
debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the member for Richmond-Wolfe, I am pleased to 
participate in this debate on Bill C-54, which concerns an 
extremely important group of people in our society, to whom we 
owe a great deal.
<P>
	A society which respects its seniors is one which respects its 
past as well as the wisdom and the maturity that come with it.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Such a society tends to create a healthy environment for 
future generations and it is the Bloc Quebecois' goal to promote 
and build such a society, and not to destroy a country, as Liberal 
and Reform Party members like to think.
<P>
	In Canada, 21 per cent of seniors, that is 625,000 of them, live 
in poverty. The proportion of old people with low incomes is 
always greater than for the population as a whole. In 1992, the 
average income of families made up of seniors was 30 per cent 
lower than that of other families. Between 1982 and 1992, the 
average income of seniors increased by 6 per cent, compared to 
10 per cent for the rest of Canadians. In 1992, the average 
income of seniors living alone was $18,434, while that of other 
persons in the same situation was $25,000.
<P>
	This reality of the Canadian society certainly does not support 
claims by the Prime Minister to the effect that Canada is a good 
place to live.
<P>
	It must be recognized that Bill C-54, which amends the Old 
Age Security Act and in particular the Canada Pension Plan, 
includes several measures which will have a positive impact on 
programs for seniors. However, this legislation is clearly 
inadequate when it comes to alleviating the problem of poverty 
among our seniors. On the contrary, some provisions of the bill 
reflect a strong desire by the government to increase social 
controls and to pinch pennies at the expense of the poorest 
Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	Bill C-54 contains some positive provisions, like the ones 
making the application process for Old Age Security benefits, 
the guaranteed income supplement and the Canada Pension Plan 
more flexible. For example, spouse's allowances will now be 
automatically converted into Old Age Security benefits when 
recipients turn 65 years of age.
<P>
	This bill also includes some more provisions that could 
improve the lot of the elderly in both our societies. For instance, 
guaranteed income supplement and spouse's allowances will 
now be paid to the recipients even though their applications 
were late. Individuals will now be able to cancel assignments of 
pensions at any time, assignments meaning the transfer of all or 
part of a pension to a spouse.
<P>
	Recipients will also be able to ask the federal government to 
directly reimburse the various provincial benefits they have 
received while they wait to become eligible for Old Age 
Security or Canada Pension Plan benefits. To exempt benefits 
from seizure and to let older people who want to appeal 
decisions to do so by making requests for reconsideration 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6963"> 6963 </A></B>
<P>
instead of appeals are two more examples of measures aimed at 
improving the lot of the elderly in both our societies.
<P>
	However, with Bill C-54, the federal government is 
proposing a piece of legislation that has absolutely no scope and 
that reflects its unwillingness to reduce poverty among the 
elderly. True to form, the government has deliberately chosen to 
increase its control over the poor people, while maintaining the 
parameters for an artificially rich society, which is, in fact, 
debt-ridden and on the verge of bankruptcy.
<P>
	All of our social programs have been called into question 
because of the deficit, spending controls and especially the 
failure of the government to act. In the last budget, the measures 
concerning contributions to the unemployment insurance fund 
and the proposed changes to the age credits for the elderly 
clearly indicated the direction in which the government is going.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	When public authorities attack the most destitute and 
vulnerable among us, as does the Liberal Party of Canada, it is 
the sign of a society with no plan for the future, a society which 
protects the rich.
<P>
	Let me remind you briefly that all taxpayers who are 65 or 
over may claim a tax credit equivalent to 17 per cent of $3,482 at 
the federal level and to 20 per cent of $2,200 in Quebec. The 
change made in the last budget aims at reducing this credit for 
senior citizens with a net revenue exceeding $25,921 and at 
eliminating it completely for those with a net revenue of over 
$49,100.
<P>
	We have to wonder if the government considers that a senior 
citizen with a $25,000 revenue is rich. Obviously, the meagre 
efforts to reduce spending are made on the back of the most 
destitute members of the middle class. In this way, Bill C-54 is 
the logical result of the first Liberal budget and goes well with 
the reform of the social programs proposed by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development.
<P>
	In reality, Bill C-54 is part of the same budgetary reduction 
process as the social program reform. Thus, public pensions are 
as much under scrutiny as unemployment insurance and 
manpower training. Similarities between the first budget, the 
social program reform and Bill C-54 can be seen mostly in two 
aspects of this bill: first, the savings measures considered by the 
government, and, second, the greater number of organizations 
given access to personal information on senior citizens, which 
means an extension of the control measures.
<P>
	As for the savings measures, the government says that the 
retroactive period needs to be reduced from five to one year to 
be in line with Old Age Security and the Canada Pension Plan. It 
should be noted, however, that every time we pay heed to this 
need, the result is always a downward adjustment. All things 
considered, the government is again tightening program 
requirements for the elderly.
<P>
	Also, the government will have to explain what it thinks is 
wrong with the current clauses on Old Age Security 
overpayment. It is worth mentioning that, under the present 
legislation, the government can go back at most two years. By 
eliminating that limit to the retroactive period, the government 
would collect $2 million more. Since pensioners enjoy some 
protection from possible mistakes by government officials, the 
minister should indicate from whose pockets that money will 
come from.
<P>
	Furthermore, I submit that it is indecent for this government 
to propose measures for deferring benefit payments when there 
is an appeal. The implementation of such measures could put 
many pensioners in a very precarious situation. The proposed 
measures would not have a major impact on most pensioners, 
but they nonetheless reflect the direction taken by the 
government since its election, namely cutting social programs, 
despite the commitment it made during the election campaign 
not to attack these programs.
<P>
	The proliferation of control agencies, which was mentioned 
earlier, is another aspect of the bill to which the Bloc Quebecois 
is opposed. Governments are interfering more and more in 
everyone's private life and they accumulate ever more detailed 
information on each one of us. As we know, there is currently a 
public debate on the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. 
New facts are being uncovered. We know since the 1970s that 
the inquiries on government management are made beyond 
public scrutiny and kept secret.
<P>
	Although the gathering of some data is often necessary to 
process certain files, the government should always justify its 
new intrusions into people's private lives.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The government has not yet demonstrated the need to increase 
the release of information regarding seniors in both our 
societies. The Bloc Quebecois will not support this provision of 
the bill unless the government demonstrates this need.	
<P>
	Moreover, we think that the provisions regarding the penalties 
for illegal release of information are clearly inadequate. The 
clients of social programs must be protected in a very effective 
manner against any abuse that could happen in the passing on of 
information. The legislation should provide for special 
penalties for this kind of offence.
<P>
	For these reasons, I will support the amendment proposed by 
my colleague, the member for Argenteuil-Papineau, which 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by striking out all the words after the word 
``That'' and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6964"> 6964 </A></B>
<P>
``this House declines to give second reading reading to Bill C-54, An Act to amend 
the Old Age Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Children's Special 
Allowances Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act, because it does not provide a 
penalty under the Criminal Code for the disclosure of personal information 
concerning beneficiaries to persons who are not  legally authorized to such 
information pursuant to Access to Privileged Information.''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would, in fact, have a few 
questions to ask the hon. member. He mentioned the average 
amounts paid to senior citizens as compared to the national 
average in Canada. When he mentions $25,000 and $19,000 are 
these gross or net amounts?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine did not listen carefully to 
my speech, because I made it very clear that these figures were 
for net incomes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, if that is their net income, their 
gross income must be around $35,000 or nearly $40,000. The 
average income of a family of four is almost $45,000. Therefore, 
those individual incomes are way above the national average for 
a family of four.
<P>
	At any rate, I want to make one thing one thing clear. This 
government has no intention of tampering with old age security. 
All Liberal governments, and especially the present one, have 
always preserved the vested rights of senior citizens, and more 
particularly those received or accrued by people who have been 
contributing for at least 50 years. Through their contribution, 
they shaped Canada as we know it today. Everybody recognizes, 
as well as I do, the great efforts made by our senior citizens. 
Believe me, we are the first ones to look after the have-nots.
<P>
	Once again, I hope the hon. member of the opposition 
understands there are 800,000 people on welfare or 
unemployment insurance in Quebec. All kinds of suggestions 
are being made to meet the needs of Quebecers and make our 
economy more efficient and create more jobs. But all I hear in 
this House is a condemnation of the government of Canada. I 
will send the ball back in his court and ask him, for example, 
what the experts did at the regional level.
<P>
	In this matter, I listened to Quebec's Minister of Health who 
still has not made a decision on the problem of medical 
specialists who are needed in outlying regions. Pensioners come 
and see me to say that they need specialists. We have hospitals in 
Maria, Chandler and Gaspé. But no. Quebec's civil servants 
prefer to send them to Rimouski, Quebec City or even Montreal. 
Unfortunately, the Government of Quebec does not often 
respond to my constituents' real requests for social services and 
health services. Of course, this is provincial jurisdiction, but I 
say that it is wrong to blame the federal government, Mr. 
Speaker. Indeed, what do we hear very often? That it is the 
Government of Quebec, the member's head office, which does 
not meet Quebecers' real expectations and needs.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member has a short memory. I think he cannot see past the tip of 
his nose. I must remind the member that the Parti Quebecois 
government was elected only a few weeks ago and that, for the 
past ten years, it was his Liberal friends in Quebec who had been 
managing the health care system.
<P>
	I would like to remind the member, who does not seem to be 
too firmly grounded in reality, that money you have to live on is 
not what appears on paper but what you have left in your hand. 
With an income of $25,000, I say that you live in poverty. If the 
member looked at the government's statistics, he would know 
that with $25,000 you are in dire straits. Many times, when you 
are paying for your groceries, you wonder if you should not put 
an item back on the shelf because you do not know if you are 
going to have enough money to pay the bill.
<P>
	The money in your hand is a far cry from what appears on 
paper. When the amount on paper is $50,000 and you are left 
with only $25,000, it is because the government took the other 
$25,000. This is what it means.
<P>
	Does the member realize that, while there are 800,000 
unemployed people, his government has just taken some 
extraordinary steps cutting social programs and training, and 
that the Minister of Human Resources Development has just 
announced an astounding proposal asking students to get deeper 
into debt, under the pretence of making it easier to have access 
to training? What the minister is telling university and 
post-secondary students is this: ``We are giving you better 
access to funding from banks and credit unions so that you can 
get deeper into debt and we are cutting grants and bursaries''. 
We know very well that to get a bachelor's degree now, a student 
piles up a debt of about $9,000 or $10,000.
<P>
	A student who goes as far as the doctoral or post-doctoral 
level leaves university $40,000 in debt. That is what your 
government is doing!
<P>
	That government is doing nothing to stimulate employment. 
They invested in infrastructure, which is not a bad program, as 
everyone admits, except where do young people get jobs in the 
infrastructure program? Where do women find work in the 
infrastructure projects? Nothing, zero.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that when we see trucks rolling in the 
streets, the economic recovery will be under way. That is a very 
short-sighted way to look at economic recovery and it is 
especially short-sighted to think that you will put people back to 
work just by digging in the streets. It is an old, well-known 
model that works in some ways, but they did not think of 
training. They did not think of investing in young entrepreneurs. 
What the government is doing is the opposite of what it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6965"> 6965 </A></B>
<P>
announced during the election campaign. It was elected with 
NDP-style advertisements that said, ``We will protect  social 
programs. We will create jobs''. It was elected with many 
promises that are now completely rejected.
<P>
	The finance minister's budget and all the reform proposals 
clearly show us that they are doing the opposite and can only 
think of cutting $15 billion from operating expenses in the 
budget at the expense of all the poorest people, in order to 
protect their friends, the richest people who back that regime.
<P>
	I would conclude with this. If only this government were 
honest enough to apply the red book, as they said in their 
advertisements, every time they refer to it, we could at least be 
working on the economic recovery in some ways, but they are 
not doing that, on the contrary. They are acting to the detriment 
of the very poor, women, young people, training, education. 
Again I say to the hon. member: If you have $25,000 in your 
pocket, you are poor in a society where everything costs more, 
with taxes on food, medicine, the basic needs of families, rent, 
etc. You may have $50,000 on paper, sir, but that is not what you 
have in your pocket. Remember that!
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> You are a liar!
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The 10-minute question 
and comment period has expired. Resuming debate. The hon. 
member for Winnipeg South.
<P>
	Order! The hon. member for Richmond-Wolfe on a point of 
order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine has just 
called me ``a dirty liar''. I think it was very clear. What I am 
saying concerns verifiable facts; I cannot accept this comment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I paid close attention to 
what was said between members and I would ask the hon. 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine to please 
withdraw his comments to the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, it appears to be a rather passionate 
debate but it is still outside- First of all, I did not have the floor 
and it was really a private discussion. I will, however, make 
amends. True, I made such a comment but, unlike the hon. 
member who steadfastly refused to apologize to the Prime 
Minister of Canada, I at least have the honour of apologizing to 
him. I hope that in the future he can benefit from his experience 
with me in that when I make a mistake, I apologize. I would have 
liked to hear the hon. member opposite say the same thing to the 
Prime Minister of Canada the other day.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The matter is closed. I 
thank the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine for his co-operation. I 
have no intention of reviving another matter that occurred one or 
two weeks ago.
<P>
	Resuming debate. The hon. member for Winnipeg South.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague in the House for his intervention. It sets a 
model for the House that perhaps we should all think a bit about.
<P>
	Despite the debate that has taken place over this last while in 
the House what this bill purports to do is simply bring the 
administration of the programs administered by the Department 
of Human Resources Development into the 20th century. It is 
simply an attempt to modernize the way we deliver services to 
people, to use the advantages which computers and information 
technology offer to us to allow us to better identify what services 
we are providing to whom, to ensure that we do not provide 
services to people who do not have entitlements to that service, 
to make it easy to access information quickly and to make the 
overall operations of government more efficient and more 
effective.
<P>
	The fact is that this has been a movement that has been taking 
place in the private sector throughout this last decade. The fact 
is many governments at all levels are moving in this direction 
and it is about time the federal government caught up.
<P>
	I commend the Minister of Human Resources Development 
for being able, given all the things he is having to deal with, to 
move forward with such an important initiative at this time.
<P>
	I want to talk a bit about one aspect of it and to preface that I 
want to remind members of a couple of things. People 
historically are nervous about change. It was not that long ago 
when telephone answering machines were introduced and 
people used to complain all the time if they got a machine, they 
do not want their phone answered by the machine, they do not 
want to have to talk to a machine. Today when you phone 
somebody, if they do not have a machine you are annoyed 
because you cannot leave a message.
<P>
	It was not that long ago we were concerned about electronic 
banking machines. People do not want to deal with a machine, 
they want to deal with a real person. I would ask most members 
of the House to reflect on where they do their banking. I bet the 
majority of them use their cards, go into the teller 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week because it is much more efficient, much more 
effective and much better service.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6966"> 6966 </A></B>
<P>
	That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about 
using those technologies to bring better, faster, more effective 
service to people.
<P>
	Because of these concerns about technology there has always 
been a fear about if information is given to the government, how 
will the government utilize that information. There have been, 
and necessarily, strong prohibitions against the transfer of 
information among government departments.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	Between that time, when we first began to introduce these 
programs and now, the House has enacted privacy legislation. It 
has enacted all sorts of protections and our use of technology has 
become much more efficient so that we know how to provide 
secure access. If a bank can provide secure access to my money 
24 hours, seven days a week and prevent somebody else from 
getting at it then the government can provide secure access to 
confidential information that it holds in its records.
<P>
	The bill identifies certain kinds of information that will be 
shared between legitimate users of the information within 
government to provide more efficient, more effective and faster 
service to citizens. When we talk about one-stop shopping, 
when we talk about service to citizens, this is what we are 
talking about.
<P>
	I would like to concentrate on those provisions aimed at 
improving information sharing between government 
departments. The protection given to the information which old 
age security pensioners, unemployment insurance claimants, 
Canada pension plan recipients and children's special allowance 
beneficiaries must provide has always been high. The reasons 
for this are clear.
<P>
	The Department of Human Resources Development is 
required to collect personal information in order to determine if 
an individual is eligible for a benefit and in what amount. 
Should clients feel uncertain about the confidentiality of this 
information, they might be reluctant to provide such 
information. In such a case the department would find it almost 
impossible to administer these programs.
<P>
	Nevertheless there are situations in which the strict protection 
afforded this information actually prevents the government 
from giving its clients the best service possible. In some cases it 
sets up artificial barriers which hamper the service or action 
which the client is requesting. In other cases it prevents the 
government from making use of technology which could save 
the taxpayers of Canada money and avoid stressful 
overpayments for beneficiaries.
<P>
	There was a member opposite talking about what specific 
savings would arise. This program will produce savings to 
government in the delivery of government services.
<P>
	I am sure that all members have had to respond to many 
constituent queries concerning program and benefit 
information, changes or the resolution of difficulties. In such 
situations it is often unclear exactly what sort of information can 
be shared. When this involves OAS, CPP, UI or CSA benefits, 
MPs and their staff must contact the Department of Human 
Resources Development to request information about their 
constituent's particular case.
<P>
	Some would argue that a constituent request for a member of 
Parliament to intervene on his or her behalf constitutes 
permission or authorization for the department to share 
information with that MP about the individual. However, it is 
not clear in law under which circumstances information can be 
released to MPs.
<P>
	Public servants must therefore weigh off the requirement to 
protect client information against the need to provide proper 
service. One of the amendments in the bill would eliminate any 
uncertainty with respect to CPP, OAS and CSA legislation and 
so permit public servants to provide client information to 
members and their staffs acting on behalf of clients.
<P>
	Another amendment would help departments provide better 
service to common clients. Because of the age group of their 
clients, the Departments of Human Resource Development and 
Veteran Affairs have many clients in common. Furthermore, if 
the circumstances under which a veteran qualifies for certain 
benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs as well as the 
amount of benefits depends in part on what benefits he or she 
receives from the old age security and the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	To determine benefit eligibility, the Department of Veterans 
Affairs requires information on that person's entitlement to 
OAS and CPP benefits.
<P>
	While the OAS act currently allows the department to share 
some types of information, the CPP legislation does not. This 
has resulted in substantial overpayments to some veterans who 
have reported incorrect benefit amounts to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. Many of these overpayments are difficult or 
even impossible to collect because of the hardship this would 
cause low income veterans.
<P>
	The amendment in the bill pertaining to the Old Age Security 
Act would allow the Department of Human Resources 
Development to provide information to veterans affairs on 
common clients for the purposes of administering all acts 
pertaining to veterans. The amendment to the CPP would allow 
information sharing with veterans affairs for the first time and 
on the same basis as OAS.
<P>
	The effect of these amendments would be to minimize 
overpayments to clients, eliminate the distress caused to 
veterans in overpayment situations and bring consistency and 
comprehensiveness to the OAS and CPP provisions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6967"> 6967 </A></B>
<P>
	Another amendment would enable the Department of Human 
Resources Development to give better service to disabled 
Canadians trying to re-enter the workforce.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Under current provisions of the Canada pension plan, 
disabled contributors who are unable to work may qualify for a 
CPP disability pension. The CPP administration is currently 
evaluating a project which offers rehabilitation to those 
disability pension recipients most likely to benefit from it.
<P>
	These services would be provided by private rehabilitation 
specialists. However, in order for these professionals to evaluate 
the situation of disabled persons and the services he or she might 
require to get back into the workforce, they need access to client 
information. Current Canada pension plan legislation prevents 
the Department of Human Resources Development from 
providing this information directly to such professionals.
<P>
	One of the amendments in the bill would enable the CPP 
administration to provide this information directly, thus 
reducing the present annoyance of the department having to give 
the information to the client who in turn has to pass it on to the 
rehabilitation specialist.
<P>
	Two other amendments would allow certain information to be 
released under specific circumstances to enable the Government 
of Canada to proceed with two important initiatives. In one 
initiative the Correctional Service Canada is embarking on a 
program to charge federal inmates a portion of their income as 
room and board.
<P>
	One amendment in the bill would allow information on CPP 
and OAS benefits paid to inmates to be transmitted to 
Corrections Canada for inclusion with other income information 
for assessing the room and board to be charged.
<P>
	Another amendment would allow disclosure to the Minister of 
Justice, the Attorney General for Canada and the commissioner 
for the RCMP of OAS, CPP and UI client information in order to 
assist activities undertaken in Canada to investigate, prosecute 
and extradite persons suspected of war crimes and crimes 
against humanity.
<P>
	Finally, another amendment would enable the provision of 
client information to Canada Post via computer tapes or other 
electronic means to print benefit award and denial letters. 
Should Canada Post be contracted to undertake this activity, 
strict conditions would be placed on the types and circumstances 
of this sharing.
<P>
	Canada Post would be subject to government contractual 
agreements. Canada Post would continue to be obliged to 
protect the confidentiality of the mail and to abide by the 
provisions of the Privacy Act. It is important to emphasize that 
sharing information in these circumstances in no way lessens 
the protection given to confidential client information.
<P>
	Those authorized to have access to this type of information 
would be bound by the legislation and any person releasing 
information illegally would be guilty of an offence punishable 
on summary conviction.
<P>
	In conclusion, the amendments will be of great benefit both to 
Canadians and the federal government departments serving 
them. They will provide better service levels for Canadians and 
eliminate unnecessary work and red tape in dealing with 
government departments. They will eliminate much hardship 
for clients by reducing the incidence of incorrect payments.
<P>
	As well, they will provide savings to the Government of 
Canada and in some cases result in additional revenues. Finally, 
they will permit the federal government to further the goal of 
justice in Canada.
<P>
	For all of these reasons, I feel the House should support the 
bill and get on with its passage as quickly as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the member for 
Winnipeg South. He is correct in pointing out that this is an 
omnibus bill that covers a lot of territory as far as our social 
programs are concerned. I agree with him on the idea that we are 
in the 20th century.
<P>
	I especially appreciate his comments regarding the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. We must not put veterans in 
distress when they have gone to war for this country and 
especially when next year is the 50th anniversary of the end of 
the second world war. That is very substantive in this bill.
<P>
	I would like to try to flesh it out some more. We are all in this 
place to try to come up with ideas to make the programs and bills 
that are put before us better and more effective, more efficient. 
We are all here with that common goal.
<P>
	He talked about efficiency and how the programs will be more 
effective, that this technology is a movement that is taking 
place. I do not think anyone in the House would disagree that it 
should be done.
<P>
	The access to information is also something that I can feel 
very comfortable in supporting with some assurances that it 
does not go too far. He mentioned several areas. One he briefly 
mentioned but did not go into too much detail with was the UIC 
program. If we are to come up with ideas, we should talk about 
some substantive ideas the member would bring forward that 
would save the country some money in regard to UIC.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada has stated that this program 
should be actuarially sound, that it should be a true insurance 
program that would save the government some $5 billion in 
delivering the program to its clientele. Whether the member 
agrees or disagrees with that concept, I would like to hear from 
him what his specific  ideas are that could save the program and 
save Canadians dollars.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6968"> 6968 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to try to direct the member's 
attention to a particular area. We all like to stand up and talk 
about the grand ideas that will transform programs and save 
billions of dollars, however impractical, inefficient or 
incredible those ideas might be. What I am trying to talk about in 
this bill is something that my mother used to say to me and I 
suspect other mothers said to their children: ``If you look after 
the pennies, the pounds will take care of themselves''.
<P>
	This is not about a massive restructuring of government 
programs. This is about, in many little steps, doing the work of 
government better, more efficiently, faster, giving better service 
and at the same time, saving money. There are all sorts. 
Computer programmers have come to government for the last 20 
years and said: ``If the government will just build this system, 
we will be able to deliver better service and save money''. 
Unfortunately that has not always proved to be the case.
<P>
	However, we have learned over time the techniques necessary 
to do exactly that. If we look at what has happened in the private 
sector: we have seen massive changes in management; a 
flattening of management hierarchies; more direct delivery at 
the service level and the use of expert systems.
<P>
	Each one of the programs I mentioned here keeps a file on 
people with information on their names, addresses, postal 
codes, all of that identifying information. Why do we need to 
have four or five such databases? Why not one? Think about that 
between departments.
<P>
	Canada Post was mentioned. Canada Post is building or is 
near finishing a database that has the name and address of every 
single Canadian in it. Why do we need to replicate that? Why 
can we not take advantage through proper information sharing 
of that information to save us money. Will this produce $5 
billion savings? No, I do not think so. Will this flatten out the 
need for new resources, provide better service and save money 
along the way? Yes, it will.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's comments 
on the question. I do not mean to stand here and offer grandiose 
ideas to the people of Canada. We are trying to come up with 
solutions to very complex problems. As we move very rapidly 
on the train tracks, there is a brick wall straight ahead.
<P>
	It does not matter how effective, how efficient and how far we 
have advanced technologically with our systems if we do not 
tackle this massive problem of deficit and debt. We are spending 
some $44 billion dollars a year on interest alone on the money 
we have borrowed. This cannot go on forever. We are going to 
end up in a situation with very effective delivery services, but no 
money to deliver to the people in need anyway.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member again if he could give me one 
substantive idea that we, as the House of Commons, could sink 
our teeth into regarding social programs, in particular the UIC 
program, that could save a substantial amount of money for the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am slightly bemused because I did 
exactly that. I heard the Speaker has a written speech that he 
uses asking for specific information from members, because he 
asked the identical question of the member from my party who 
spoke last time.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	I gave him a specific example. I can give him a number of 
specific examples. I would refer him first to the budget 
document from last February in which the Minister of Finance 
detailed specific reductions in the Human Resources 
Development portfolio. I can refer him to many speeches and 
statements by the Minister of Human Resources Development 
talking about a restructuring of the $38 billion social service 
envelope. I can refer him to the framework document that the 
Minister of Finance brought down earlier this week.
<P>
	These are grand discussions, these are huge programs that 
affect millions and millions of Canadians and I find it very 
difficult to understand how any member could stand up and wipe 
out the benefits for millions and millions of people without any 
thought and discussion.
<P>
	What we are proposing to do and what we are doing is taking a 
very difficult debate to the people of this country and asking 
them to participate in an exercise that is going to be painful for 
all of us. We are not deciding that in this Chamber based on a few 
throwaway comments from a few members.
<P>
	I really find this debate right now very difficult when a 
member stands up and so quickly and so easily asks to deprive 
seniors of their pensions, or to deprive UI recipients of their 
benefits. I find this intolerable.
<P>
	I would like to see from that party some specific suggestions 
that take into account the nature of this country. You cannot do 
what this member just suggested with UI without bankrupting 
some of the provinces. He should stop and think a bit before he 
starts carrying that debate forward to the public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not like the tone the member adopts in even 
suggesting that I was wiping out benefits to people in need in 
this country. That is not at all what I said. That is a total 
misrepresentation of what I am saying here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6969"> 6969 </A></B>
<P>
	Very quickly, all I am asking for are some substantive ideas. 
This country has waited. We saw a social program action plan 
that was supposed to be presented in April and now we are still 
in the discussion stage.
<P>
	I feel very strongly that what has happened here is that the 
government spent all its time when it was were on this side of the 
House discussing and criticizing but not coming up with a 
substantive plan. Right now it finds itself in a quagmire and does 
not know what to do. It is too busy looking at itself, as the 
member says.
<P>
	Let us give the Canadian people some credit. They have 
watched this progress over months and months now and all that 
is coming out are bills that skirt around the edges of the real 
problem.
<P>
	I would like to know substantively once again if this member 
can give us a substantive and direct figure and an idea that will 
help us save money in social programs today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me give the member two. Let me 
refer him to this bill, this bill which he throws away and says is 
nothing. This bill is a major modernization and improvement of 
services that will produce reductions in the cost of 
administering programs. That is a fact-this bill.
<P>
	You want to make savings in UI, you want to-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know this is a 
place for vigorous debate but please direct your interventions 
through the chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize for that. I am not 
arguing with you. If the members opposite wish to contribute to 
this debate and want to save the people of Canada money then let 
us have a debate on getting people back to work, let us have a 
debate on getting this economy going, let us have a debate on 
getting people trained. I do not hear a single idea coming forth. I 
have never heard the words `research and development', I have 
never heard the word `investment' come from that side of the 
House.
<P>
	Let us have a debate about it. Let us get people back to work. 
Let us get people off UI. Let us get people into high quality, high 
paying jobs. Then we will see a difference.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
purpose of this act is to improve service to clients, to allow for 
more efficient program administration and in the case of the Old 
Age Security Act, OAS, and the Canada pension plan, CPP, to 
increase consistency between these programs.
<P>
	To the degree to which technical items in this bill achieve 
those ends we certainly support this bill.
<P>
	However, let us look at these major programs and the need to 
address them not only from a purely technical point of view but 
at the programs and their viability and their serviceability and 
their achievements. Are they doing what they are intended to 
do?
<P>
	This brings the operations of the various pieces of legislation 
more into harmony with one another and it does correct various 
minor flaws and omissions in the legislation. It addresses the 
section on appeals and on confidentiality of information.
<P>
	The only significant change that exists is that under clauses 9 
and 23 of the act affecting clauses 18 and 37 of the OAS act, the 
crown can now attempt to recover accidental overpayments 
from more than a year ago provided this would cause no undue 
hardship. Inquiries should be made in the human resources 
development committee as to whether this really is the meaning 
of this section and if so how significant such a provision could 
be financially and why it was made.
<P>
	What about the big picture? The government has been in 
power for one year. The government prepared to be in power for 
four years and developed the red book, the infamous Mao red 
book.
<P>
	During the election campaign the current Prime Minister 
travelled across the country holding up this red book, 
pronouncing that he had the people and he had the plan. Where 
he did not have the people he duly appointed them in those 
ridings where they could not get elected.
<P>
	Now he finds out that the plan, which is not very democratic in 
my opinion, he and the finance minister and many others in the 
front row on the benches of the government had was no action 
plan whatsoever.
<P>
	What has this government accomplished after one year? It has 
the plan. It supposedly has the people. Here we are 12 months 
after almost to the day when this government took over. After 
cancelling the EH-101 contract, after cancelling the Pearson 
airport contract, after reversing its election campaign promise 
on NAFTA, which of course we supported-it finally saw the 
light on that one-what has it done? As far as legislation in this 
House, we have had housecleaning bills, housecleaning bills and 
more housecleaning bills.
<P>
	In January the first bill brought before this House was Bill 
C-2, an act to amalgamate the Department of National Revenue 
and taxation with customs and excise in an effort to improve 
efficiency and effectiveness. This is the very same justification 
and tremendous adjectives and rhetoric it is using to promote 
this bill. It is a small technical bill and the government makes it 
appear it is doing great wondrous things for seniors and 
pensioners.
<P>
	What did that bill accomplish from back in January earlier 
this year, efficiency and effectiveness? They have been really 
effective at the borders. They are seizing books they should not 
seize. They have been really effective collecting taxation. Since 
they took over there is $6 billion in taxes uncollected. There are 
more dollars uncollected in GST. The more we look into this the 
more we find out that this government has done less instead of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6970"> 6970 </A></B>
<P>
more, the more we find out that this government is less efficient 
and effective than more.
<P>
	Today we have before us Bill C-54, another housecleaning 
bill and the government makes it sound as if it is better, 
improved, more efficient and more effective.
<P>
	I ask the Canadian public to listen to what this government 
says, to what its front benchers say because the difference 
between what it says, what actually happens and where we will 
end up is like day and night.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us get back to this bill specifically. Let us look at the 
Canada pension plan, the CPP. It is a compulsory pension plan 
based on earnings. Upon retirement it pays 25 per cent of former 
salary up to $8,000 per year. Only former contributors are 
eligible. CPP is left out of the federal budget and not included in 
the analysis. The annual cost is $13.2 billion for the 
government's share of this program.
<P>
	The present value of the Canada pension plan based on some 
sound assumptions is several billions of dollars. The payments 
will have to rise 6 per cent to 7 per cent of income or an increase 
of three to four times for Canada pension if we keep the current 
method of funding. Will future generations be able to afford 
this? Will the young Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor 
General be collecting his money like he earlier said he would?
<P>
	Why not begin now to fix the problem? It is ignored by the 
finance minister in his planning for economic development. It is 
ignored by the finance minister in his budgetary process and it is 
ignored in this bill.
<P>
	The present value of public service unfunded liability just for 
the federal government is $100 billion. This number was given 
to the finance committee as recently as last night by a prominent 
economist. Once again, why not begin to fix this problem of 
unfunded insurance now?
<P>
	When the finance minister declares that Canadians do not 
want to make cuts, when the Prime Minister declares that 
Canadians do not want to make cuts, because as the 
prebugdetary consultative process goes across this land and as 
they discuss with Canadians and in committee as to what they 
should do and what they cannot do, it will be the special interest 
groups that will organize, flood and distort the prebudget 
conferences which primarily exclude the rank and file average 
Canadian.
<P>
	The finance minister and the Prime Minister will announce 
that they have no choice but to raise taxes, first of all because of 
their commitment and because come hell or high water, as said 
by the finance minister, he will meet his deficit targets.
<P>
	When both the finance minister and the Prime Minister have a 
ready made excuse, which is what this whole two month process 
is all about the way I see it, they will look to raising taxes.
<P>
	As recently as yesterday the finance minister said if the 
Canadian public will not look at cuts, if the Canadian public will 
not look at the sound economic planning of the finance minister, 
they have no choice but to raise taxes because of their 
commitment in the red book.
<P>
	The finance minister will have to look to RRSPs for taxes. He 
will do that because it is too obvious. It is too big an area to leave 
untouched. It is too tempting. It is too easy. He just needs the 
excuse and it will be there.
<P>
	These prebudget hearings are merely invented to help the 
government, the finance minister and the Prime Minister to 
develop an excuse based on the results of the so-called 
deliberations across this great land to interpret these 
submissions to their own pleasure at the expense and pain of the 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	In any case, when he does look at taxing RRSPs I hope he 
proceeds to consider the following. I hope he does not tax 
RRSPs. If he does I hope he also then adheres to the principle of 
fairness which was enunciated in the red book, which is 
enunciated by the finance minister in his purple book, which is 
enunciated in the grey book by the finance minister. We now 
have three books that are committed to the principle of fairness.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He should write a comic book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I believe the finance minister should write a comic 
book. He likes to give answers quite often in a comedic fashion.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	If he is going to tax RRSPs for all Canadians across this land, 
then he should also consider taxing those funds the government 
puts into MP pension plans, that portion which is a seven to one 
ratio that we put in as MPs. That government portion should be 
taxed in all the public service pension plans as well.
<P>
	We like to pride ourselves as not only listening to people and 
looking at what the problems are, but coming up with solutions 
based on what causes the problem. What causes the problem in 
both OAS and in CPP is that there are insufficient funds to look 
after future generations. Why not consider combining OAS and 
the GIS, the guaranteed income supplement, with the CPP into a 
single guaranteed annual income program for the elderly? It 
would be phased in gradually to preserve benefits for the current 
generation of pensioners. This would pay more to the poorer 
seniors and less to the wealthy seniors.
<P>
	The principle and problem I am trying to resolve is the fact 
that what I pay into CPP today and what I have paid into it is less 
than what future generations are going to have to pay when they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6971"> 6971 </A></B>
<P>
have to pay for me. That is because it is only funded by current 
premiums. It is not  set up on an actuarially sound basis. That is 
what we should be looking at to solve that problem.
<P>
	Let us look at OAS. OAS is a universal pension scheme. It 
pays a pension to all but the wealthiest seniors with benefits up 
to $4,547 per person and is taxed back at 15 cents per dollar of 
income above $53,000. The annual cost is $14.4 billion.
<P>
	There is also a guaranteed income supplement for those 
seniors who truly need it. This particular program has to be 
preserved. This program must continue. We must make cuts 
elsewhere in the budget so as not to affect the seniors guaranteed 
income supplement. It is imperative that the $4.3 billion subsidy 
in this area is protected and guaranteed. Those are the seniors 
who truly need it. Not only do they need their OAS but they need 
their GIS.
<P>
	What we should do is perhaps combine OAS with the CPP, a 
solution to ensuring there is something left for those seniors 
who really need it and for those who need extra over and above 
their CPP there is a guaranteed annual income. Their income 
levels are topped up based on whatever level we define as the 
bare minimum required for food, shelter and clothing.
<P>
	We should develop our social programs, design and target 
them to those people who truly need them. If the funding could 
come from the government to those people through the raising 
of funds directly for those people rather than through the various 
complex methods we are now using through the Income Tax Act 
it would be more clear and obvious and less costly 
administratively. It would also be more effective and efficient. 
More money would go into the hands and pockets of those 
people who truly need it.
<P>
	Earlier today I debated under questions and comments with 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General. He stated 
that he was a Liberal and I agreed; I figure I have learned that 
much. He also said he felt there would be enough money in the 
Canada pension plan for him despite the fact that the 
contributions he is currently making do not allow for the 
unfunded liability. With that extra great incremental cost that 
will be there he still believes he does not have to worry.
<P>
	I understand he is only 32 years old and he is not worried. I 
know 60 year olds who are five years away from collecting it 
who are worried. I know 63 year olds who are worried. I think 
the parliamentary secretary should be a little bit worried.
<P>
	He also stated that as a Liberal he believes in the principle of 
universality. This was a great concept the Liberals subscribed to 
even back in 1968. I remember that when I was in university. 
Universality had a purpose then. Universality had a reason for 
the majority of Canadians to follow it. There was nothing wrong 
when the principle of universality was introduced at the time 
that it was. However this is 1994, not the 1960s. Although the 
principle of universality has a lot of merits and  would be great if 
we could afford it, that is the point: we cannot afford it.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	We must look at and develop programs that help the seniors 
and students. Once they are developed what we need to do is not 
adhere to a principle of universality but adhere to a principle of 
universal access for those people who need to tap into these 
great programs. These great programs the government spends 
hours, days, months and years developing should be available 
and accessible universally, and portable all across this land. 
That is the way to address our social programs.
<P>
	As long as this government continues to believe in the 
principle of universality and thinks we can live the life of Riley 
at the expense of future generations, then it will never solve the 
problems that face this country. It will never really address them 
with an action plan. One or two years from now the government 
will be coming up with another book of another colour looking 
for further discussion and further consultation.
<P>
	I also debated with the government whip on a TV program. He 
told me that this plan of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development would be one that would help solve the problems 
of our social programs. I told him on television-and he can 
look at the tape-that it would just be a discussion paper, that 
there was no action plan at all. He disagreed and I said I would 
eat my words. Well, I do not have to. Now we know.
<P>
	Not even the government members know what the senior 
cabinet ministers are doing. They are just tinkering with the 
system. It is a complex system, but rather than addressing the 
big major problems, they are avoiding them.
<P>
	In conclusion, I have a seventh point, if I could find it here. 
My fellow members are saying to end, to finish, but I still have a 
couple of minutes. Do I have anything left to say? If I had 
another 15 minutes I would repeat it all because the members 
opposite as usual do not listen.
<P>
	We know what the purpose of their bill is; we know they are 
not addressing the problem. But the purpose of my speech is so 
that hon. members across the way can accept some constructive 
criticism and perhaps solve the problems that truly face this 
nation and we can get on with an action plan for this country, not 
a discussion plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this was such a good speech I almost felt like not 
asking a question. Almost. But I was really urged to do so when 
some of the member's own colleagues seemed to disagree as to 
how excellent his speech was. They seemed to urge their 
colleague to sit down rather prematurely. I would not have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6972"> 6972 </A></B>
<P>
suggested that because of the immense respect I have for the 
member across the way.
<P>
	I heard him say a few things in his speech which I believe to 
be-how should I say it-factually incorrect. One of them is 
with regard to the MPs' pension plan. In his remarks-and I 
disagree with him as to the figure-he said the taxpayer 
subsidizes $7 to $1 for what the MP contributes to the system. I 
think that is a bunch of nonsense.
<P>
	Going beyond that, and I do not know how he concocted the 
reasoning but perhaps he could explain it to us. He alluded to the 
fact that the benefits of that were non-taxable and that the $7 to 
$1 which he says the government puts in should be taxed. 
Perhaps there are more creative accountants who do the 
bookkeeping for people who are members of the Reform Party 
when they receive benefits from pensions, but I do not receive 
any MP pension and heaven knows whether I ever will. However 
I intend to pay my taxes. I am sure that Liberal colleagues who 
have come and gone and who are now receiving pensions do pay 
taxes on those benefits. Those benefits are in fact taxable. I 
challenge the member to indicate to us why he feels they are not 
taxable. For what reason is he attempting to convince Canadians 
that what is factually incorrect is a reality. That is how I put it to 
be kind.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I also want to challenge him on another issue. The member 
talked about the fact that he wants a guaranteed annual income. 
We heard that. I agree with that proposition. He said we should 
have a guaranteed annual income and he also said moments later 
that we should end universality of pensions. Recognizing that 
universality only applies to the basic pension it is a form of 
guaranteed annual income for people who are beyond a certain 
age.
<P>
	I do not understand how the hon. member across the way 
could advocate both of these things together. I do not think it is 
reasonable to suggest we should end universality and replace it 
with a system that he qualified as a guaranteed annual income. 
How does that make sense at all? How is it essentially different 
from that which exists right now for people who get nothing 
more than the minimum amount? Perhaps he could explain that 
for the benefit of all members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, to begin with I would like to state that 
as a rookie parliamentarian I am fast learning what those with 
experience do. They like to twist things. Whatever it is you say 
they like to twist and flip it, just as the member opposite did 
when he stood up and said that I think we should have a 
guaranteed annual income. I did not say that. What I said was 
that we could consider it. I said let us solve the big problem. We 
could consider it.
<P>
	Also members opposite, especially the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and the Minister of Finance, said that in 
the social policy debate when the hon. member for Calgary 
North talked about what the federal government had to do to 
meet their deficit targets, the cuts it would have to make. The 
cuts this government has to make to meet its targets are not the 
$9 billion being talked about in the newspapers today. Over the 
next two and a half to three years it will be cuts of $15 billion 
that will have to be made. That is the point our member on the 
committee made at a press conference.
<P>
	This government proceeds not only in Question Period but at 
any opportunity it gets to say that the Reform Party is 
recommending cuts of $15 billion in social programs. That is not 
true. The government itself is recommending cuts of about $9 
billion in social programs. It is not saying it. Secret memos are 
circulating from minister to minister. It does not come clean 
with the general public. It likes to twist things.
<P>
	Yesterday the member for Calgary West asked why go over a 
wide chasm in two leaps. The finance minister got up right 
away; why not do it in one, was the implication. That was my 
inference. What was the finance minister's inference? His is: 
``Let's twist it and use it against them. The public is gullible; the 
public will really listen to me. I have a good routine. I can really 
deliver this. Unlike the Reform Party, we would not do it in two 
steps''. He missed the point, as they continually do. Similarly, 
the government whip has just missed the point on taxing and the 
point I made about the MP pension plans.
<P>
	During my speech I may have said $7 to $1. If I said that it is 
inaccurate and I am wrong. That is not accurate so to that degree 
I will agree with it. The amount of money MPs put into the 
pension plan and the amount the government puts in on our 
behalf is not matching dollar for dollar. It is not matching two 
for one. It is not matching three for one.
<P>
	There are two parts to it. There is a 4 per cent and a 7 per cent. 
The 7 per cent part, not the pension plan itself but the 7 per cent, 
the registered annual allowance or whatever it is, I do not even 
know the initials it is so complicated, the ratio of what the 
government puts in, what the taxpayers put in, versus what MPs 
put in is seven to one. If he cares to refute that then he can rise 
any time he wishes.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	This is the kind of twisting government people do once they 
get power. I do not understand. In business I get nowhere by 
misrepresenting the facts. I get egg on my face and I get the door 
closed in my face the next time I come around. Perhaps that is 
why people in Canada always turf out a government: they find 
when members are over on this side they say one thing but when 
they are on the other side they do another.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6973"> 6973 </A></B>
<P>
	This is one thing the Reform Party will not do. What we say 
here today on this side, what we put in our blue book and our 
policy book, and what we work hard to do to find out what 
constituents want and the voters want, we will do when we get 
over on that side. Mr. Speaker, I assure you we will be over 
on that side and we will do what we said we would do from 
this side.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my friend opposite to whom I paid rapt attention talked 
about the gullibility of the public. I would suggest, given the 
results of the election almost a year ago, the public was not 
gullible. It was sensible when it elected 177 Liberals.
<P>
	In any event it is my great honour to rise in the House today to 
speak in support of Bill C-54 which seeks to increase the 
efficiency of a number of income security programs and, by 
doing so, to improve client services.
<P>
	I am sure all members of the House have either heard 
complaints in the media about government runaround or they 
have had to intervene themselves on behalf of constituents with 
problems. I know that I have.
<P>
	Frankly these problems usually involved programs delivered 
by Human Resources Development Canada. As members are no 
doubt aware this can be time consuming for clients and time 
consuming for our staffs, for ourselves and for human resources 
development employees. Improvements have to be made to this 
situation. That is clear to me and it is certainly clear to the 
minister.
<P>
	The income security programs branch of Human Resources 
Development Canada which administers the Old Age Security 
Act and the Canada pension plan, the two programs most 
directly impacted by the bill, is committed to addressing the 
challenge of improving client services. To do so the branch has 
undertaken a three-year project to implement computer services 
and high technology systems in order to replace existing 
systems which are clearly antiquated.
<P>
	The government wants to be proud of the service it provides to 
its many ISP clients across Canada. As well frontline staff and 
all other staff in the public service sincerely want to be able to 
work more efficiently because they realize the impact that their 
work can have on benefit recipients or on those seeking 
information about those programs.
<P>
	Many of the amendments contained in the bill complement 
the redesigned project. For instance, expanded information 
sharing provisions and improved consistency between the 
Canada pension plan and the Old Age Security Act will alleviate 
many of the frustrations benefit recipients have had to deal with 
in the past.
<P>
	There is another type of client service provided for in the bill 
which I should like to mention. It involves two amendments to 
the Canada pension plan, the direct result of client 
representations to the government and requests for change.
<P>
	In 1987 significant changes were made to the Canada pension 
plan which made flexible retirement possible for the first time. 
In recognition of the fact that Canadians wanted more say in 
when they would be able to retire, the Canada pension plan was 
amended to allow people to take their retirement benefits as 
early as age 60 and as late as age 70. For those taking early 
retirement between 60 and 65 years of age the benefit was 
reduced. For those taking late retirement between 65 and 70 the 
benefit was increased.
<P>
	Upon introducing flexible retirement it was determined that it 
was only necessary to pay 12 months of retroactive retirement 
benefits to persons who delayed their benefit until after they 
were 70 years of age. It was felt that persons retiring at some 
point between 65 and 70 no longer needed this option because 
their benefit entitlement would be increased to reflect the fact 
that they had not taken their retirement benefit five years before, 
at age 65.
<P>
	Experience has shown that there are those individuals over 65 
years of age who would rather have up to 12 months of 
retroactive retirement pension than the actuarial increase in 
their monthly pensions. For this reason one amendment in the 
bill would allow persons to delay applying for retirement 
benefits past age 65 and to have the benefits paid retroactively 
for up to 12 months if they chose. The nice thing about it is that it 
is done at their election and is not something the government 
forces on them.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Another amendment to the Canada pension plan is also a 
reflection of the plan responding to input from the clients it 
serves. I am referring to an amendment which would allow 
former spouses divorced between 1978 and 1987 to waive the 
three-year limit for making application for a division of pension 
credits.
<P>
	As I am sure many members are aware, when credit splitting 
was first introduced into the plan in 1978 it was only available to 
individuals who divorced or had their marriages annulled on or 
after January 1, 1978. As well, one of the conditions for a credit 
split was that application had to be made within three years of 
the date of the divorce or annulment.
<P>
	In 1987 credit splitting was extended to separated spouses and 
the time limit was removed for divorced spouses but only if the 
divorce occurred after January 1, 1987. While this was certainly 
a major step forward in the pension protection afforded women, 
it did not recognize those women who had missed out on the 
time limit that had been in place. The further back we go in time, 
the more women we have in divorce situations who did not work 
or contribute to the Canada pension plan during their married 
lives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6974"> 6974 </A></B>
<P>
	The rationale for not removing the time limit for the group 
divorced prior to 1987 was that the government would be 
changing the rules of the game after the fact. By this reasoning, 
a divorced spouse who had not had his or her credit split had 
a right to expect that he or she could make his or her retirement 
plans in the knowledge that CPP pension credits would not be 
split. There was one group left out of this attempt at fairness: 
former spouses who wanted a credit split even though the 
three-year limit had passed.
<P>
	I am sure all members of the House would agree with me that 
divorced spouses who stayed at home to raise their children and 
to attend to the countless challenges which are part of taking 
care of a home deserve a fair share of the pension protection 
earned during the time the couple was together. The amendment 
would allow the three-year time limit to be waived and therefore 
would allow a credit split where both parties agree in writing.
<P>
	Passage of the legislation will supplement other initiatives 
under way within the department which will improve customer 
service and will allow the employees of the department the 
opportunity to provide excellent service to an ever growing 
client population. Over the next few years the introduction of a 
better way of doing business, supported by new technology, will 
renovate the department's systems and update those which are at 
least a quarter of a century old.
<P>
	Because our client service will be greatly enhanced, future 
seniors in need will receive rapid and responsive service. This 
will at least give the department the tools and technology they 
need to provide the excellent service Canadians expect and 
Canadians deserve.
<P>
	I am proud of the way the government has risen to the 
challenge to provide even better and more responsive service at 
a lower cost. In spite of the important role played by technology, 
I am pleased the initiative has not lost sight of its real intent 
which is to help to provide for the security of Canadians. It is 
clear that Canada's income security programs faithfully reflect 
the needs and the characteristics of the people they serve. It is 
for this reason that I am supporting the bill and that I urge all 
other members to do likewise.
<P>
	The bill is one example of several undertakings the 
government has made in connection with the red book promises. 
We have promised, particularly in the human resources area, 
that we will streamline programs so that their administration 
costs less, their service is better and the people who need money, 
the people who need support, will be the ones who get it. The 
amendments to the Canada pension plan and to other income 
security plans have taken us a long way toward fulfilling that 
promise.
<P>
	The next step is the overall social security review, during 
which time we will be consulting with Canadians based upon our 
discussion paper. We will be hearing from Canadians what their
<P>
position is and what their  beliefs are on how we can provide 
them with better income security programs at a lower cost.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Those members who are critical of the program should get 
busy, get out there, have townhall meetings in their ridings, find 
out what their people are saying, find out what they want from 
our government, and let us know.
<P>
	This is a consultative government. This is a transparent 
government. This is an open government. This is a government 
that will deliver responsible government services in an efficient 
and timely fashion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the speech of the 
member and I appreciate her comments. As we have said before, 
we agree with many things that are in the bill.
<P>
	With regard to the Canada pension plan I was wondering if the 
member might be able to answer a few questions for me. First, 
the facts of the situation are that our population is aging. In 
1986, 9 per cent of all Canadians were eligible for the Canada 
pension plan. It is estimated now that by the year 2031 the ratio 
will have doubled.
<P>
	I truly hope the program continues. I have contributed to the 
program and when I am 65 years of age I hope that it will be 
there. People like myself have 23 years to go before we can 
collect it. Quite honestly for my age group, and I am sure many 
members would agree, it just does not appear feasible that the 
program will be around.
<P>
	Has the member recognized the problem of the aging 
population and the fact that between now and the next few years 
the portion we contribute to that program will have to triple for 
it to remain solvent? The program is going to be a problem in the 
future. Can the member comment on that?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot quarrel with my friend's 
numbers because I do not know if they are accurate or not.
<P>
	The government is a Liberal government and it was a Liberal 
government that put in place the Canada pension plan in the first 
place. For a question like that to come to me is especially 
appropriate because the late Right Hon. Paul Martin, Senior, 
was a key person in putting the pension plan in place and I hold 
his riding today, a fact of which I am very proud.
<P>
	I can assure the member and the listening public that under a 
Liberal government the Canada pension plan will not falter; it 
will not fail. Yes, even my friend opposite in 23 years' time will 
get his Canada pension plan payments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member suggested a number of times in her 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6975"> 6975 </A></B>
<P>
speech that these changes would achieve a much lower cost in 
terms of administration of the program.
<P>
	How much are these savings and how would they be achieved? 
I would ask her to be specific if she could.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are fortunate to live in 1994 
when technology has reached a point that by its use we can 
implement mechanized and virtually foolproof office 
procedures and administrative procedures that are much more 
efficient and less labour intensive than 25 years ago when the 
services we currently have were put into place.
<P>
	The nice thing about the Canada pension plan is that it is a 
unit. Administration comes out of the plan itself so that the 
lower the administration goes, the more money we have to make 
payments to our friend who in 23 years is worrying about how 
much money he is going to get every month.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I asked the hon. member if she 
could be specific. She referred to replacing civil servants with 
technology, but that does not tell me in any way that there will be 
savings or how much these savings will be.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not refer to replacing civil 
servants with technology. I did not say that at all. What I did say 
was that we could mechanize offices and make more efficient 
the administration that we have. There will still be civil 
servants. This will never be, at least in our mandate, a totally 
mechanized system.
<P>
	The Canada pension plan is absolutely precious to Canadians 
and certainly to the Liberal government which established it in 
the first place. When we look at the Canada pension plan we 
know as a government that it is important that we continue to 
streamline it so that the money in this plan goes to its clients and 
not to inefficiencies which have been built into the system, 
particularly over the last nine years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, old age pensions are a subject of concern to me 
because, so far, the legislation put in place by the government of 
Canada has dug into the pockets of the unemployed and limited 
access to funds for the poor. This government seems to be in the 
habit of attacking the most vulnerable and seniors, who are 
certainly among the most vulnerable members of our society.
<P>
	But Parliament should have every respect for these people 
who deserve to retain full pensions wherever possible. After all, 
the quality of life that we enjoy today, we owe it to their work, 
their hard work. And when we talk about wanting to reorganize 
old age pensions, it causes us and them concern.
<P>
	Of course there are problems. Our population is aging and the 
demographics of an aging population can cause problems. But 
the government should state clearly-and make it really 
clear-today and in the weeks to come, that it has no intention of 
reducing the entitlements of our seniors. That is what matters 
and causes concern because  so far, the government has made 
promises regarding the protection of entitlements for the 
disadvantaged, promises it has definitely failed to fulfil.
<P>
	The government made cutbacks in the UI program, in 
programs providing support to the disadvantaged, in community 
programs. I wonder: could the hon. member rise in this House 
today and state clearly and firmly that her government intends to 
fully maintain all existing entitlements for the seniors of this 
country?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, with this cold, this laryngitis and 
this temperature, this member can barely stand at all. However I 
am happy to stand in the House and say to my friend opposite 
and to all Canadians that the senior citizens of Canada are 
absolutely, perfectly, totally and completely safe with the 
Liberal government in power.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am so happy to hear from the other side of the 
House and this member that the Canada pension plan is such a 
sacred and important program that all Canadians can rejoice in 
knowing that they do not have to fear down the road that there 
will not be such a program.
<P>
	With a program such as this, I am sure that the Liberal 
government, when this program was developed, looked into the 
future a little bit and had a vision. If it did, surely this program 
would have a reserve fund. However, I am afraid that the Canada 
pension plan does not have a reserve fund to ensure that 
Canadians down the road, 23 or 25 years from now, will be 
assured that when they pay into a program they will actually 
receive benefits. No, there is no reserve fund. The way the 
Canada pension plan system works-I would like the member to 
comment on this-is that the people who are working today pay 
into the Canada pension plan. The money they pay into the 
program does not go into a reserve fund and it is not held in a 
sacred trust for their retirement. That money is used to pay the 
benefits of the people who are collecting today.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	We are headed down a road and there is a wall. At some point 
in time we are going to hit that wall.
<P>
	I would like the member to please comment on this. If this 
program is so valuable to the government why is it not 
actuarially sound?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I just love to hear this stuff from 
over there.
<P>
	I am from Windsor. I may not have mentioned that any more 
than two or three times today. Windsor is on the Canada-U.S. 
border for those from far away who maybe have not been there. 
Detroit is so close that people go there for lunch and get back in 
an hour. When we go to Detroit we can see what happens when 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6976"> 6976 </A></B>
<P>
people start talking about debt walls and knocking money off of 
our social programs for the sake of the bottom line.
<P>
	Over there we can see seniors in the gutter because they have 
no other place to go. We can thank a right wing governor for that, 
a guy whose policies sound very much like the policies of the 
current Canadian Reform Party.
<P>
	The Canada pension plan is fiscally sound. The government is 
sound. The government will be here for a long time and so will 
the Canada pension plan.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise in this House when you 
are in the Chair.
<P>
	I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-54 because 
this legislation, which looks to be an harmonization measure, 
could have a significant impact on the poorest people in our 
society. It should be pointed out for the benefit of those viewers 
who may have just joined us that Bill C-54 amends four very 
important acts providing the basis of income support measures 
for the poorest Canadians.
<P>
	Indeed, Bill C-54 is an act to amend the Old Age Security Act, 
the Canada Pension Plan, the Children's Special Allowances Act 
and the Unemployment Insurance Act. It is therefore a piece of 
legislation which targets the two main pillars of our social 
security system, namely social assistance and social insurance.
<P>
	It should also be pointed out that this is a bill which deals 
primarily with income support measures for our seniors. As you 
know, several experts claim that, on the whole, the problem of 
poverty among seniors is not as bad as it once was. 
Consequently, the old assumption that poverty and old age went 
hand in hand is probably not quite true any more. However, the 
fact remains that, compared to the national average, that age 
group still has the highest percentage of low-income 
individuals.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the 1992 figures. That year, about 16.8 
per cent of all Canadians were considered to be low-income 
individuals. However, the figure was 20.6 per cent in the case of 
our seniors. Consequently, the government has to be very 
careful when reviewing any legislation affecting seniors, for we 
have not necessarily done everything we could to ensure that 
people over 55 have a decent income to live on.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	And I think we will have to consider this in connection with 
the bill before the House today. I must admit this bill contains a 
number of positive elements, but we must not forget that in this 
situation, the government is firmly resolved to do everything it 
possibly can, and this often includes measures that 
unfortunately affect people who are vulnerable.
<P>
	It has to be said, and we as the Official Opposition have a 
responsibility in this respect, that Bill C-54, ostensibly an 
attempt at harmonization, is intended to give the government a
<P>
chance to save money. In this respect, in the way it treats 
seniors, it is consistent with  the last Martin budget, because you 
will recall that the budget brought down last February 
substantially reduced the tax credit for seniors.
<P>
	Before the budget, seniors in this country could count on an 
age credit, which meant they could claim 17 per cent of their 
taxable income. This gave seniors in this country a tax rebate of 
roughly $610. We all know that the last budget launched a 
shameless attack on this tax credit and deprived the neediest in 
our society of a tax rebate to which they otherwise would have 
been entitled.
<P>
	Although Bill C-54 is supposed to be about harmonization, it 
must be pointed out that its purpose is also to make it possible 
for the government to get money back from the neediest in this 
country, through our tax system. However, since we have always 
taken a very positive approach, I would like to take a few 
minutes, and it certainly will not take long, to describe the more 
positive aspects of this bill.
<P>
	There is the fact that it will be possible, in some cases, for 
spousal benefits to automatically become OAS benefits, without 
having to go through all the red tape that is so onerous for 
Canadians.
<P>
	Other positive points-and I see my time is running out. Yes, I 
will sit down like a good boy at 2 p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, we will hear the rest of your 
speech after Question Period, if all goes well, but it being 2 p.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to 
Statements by Members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government is launching a major media 
campaign under the theme: ``Jobs and Growth''. It is putting on 
quite a show!
<P>
	However, having carefully reviewed the three documents 
tabled regarding social programs and finances, we are forced to 
recognize that the federal government is putting forth no 
positive job creation measures. It is nothing but an empty 
slogan.
<P>
	The government has set specific deficit reduction targets but 
none regarding job creation. The government has no 
constructive job strategy or policy. Yet this is the government 
that had put job creation at the forefront of its election 
campaign.
<P>
	What initiatives did this Liberal government take? It has cut 
in social programs to force the unemployed onto welfare, thus 
passing the buck to the provinces.
<P>
	The federal government is short of ideas. It should let the 
provinces take over; they are in a much better position to look 
after their own economic development.

Fortunately, most media outfits declined the Department of

<P>
	These statistics are shocking but even more shocking is the 
fact that in the six months since the government rolled back the 
taxes, sales are up 41 per cent.
<P>
	This sharp increase in overall consumption is directly 
attributable to the drop in prices. The federal Minister of Health 
said it is time for Canada to share the expertise it has gained in 
its efforts to reduce smoking in Canada.
<P>
	The government is guilty of negligence with its policy in this 
regard. It should now do the right thing and scrap the tobacco tax 
rollback which has backfired so badly. Anything less will cost us

affected by his company's bid to take over the CN Rail line and 
to sell off the rest of its Atlantic operations.
<P>
	At a time when the port of Saint John is active and many

Societies, I wish to bring to the attention of the House that this is 
Canadian Foster Family Week.
<P>
	In this International Year of the Family the celebration of the 
contributions of foster parents is even more significant. It is 
important to recognize that nearly 5,000 Ontario foster families 
provide much needed care, nurturing and stability for children 
in need of protection, many having suffered from abuse and 
neglect.
<P>
	Between 1982 and 1992 the number of foster families 
available to care for children dropped substantially. This created 
personal challenges for the Childrens Aid Societies and in some 
cases required the separation of siblings and a move far from the 
child's home community.
<P>
	Canadian Foster Family Week provides an opportunity for 
members of this House to recognize the contribution of foster 
families in their respective communities. We must alert the 
general public to the need for more foster parents to care for 
children who need the special love and care that foster parents 
can provide.

	For the third time in the past year China has detonated an

Prime Minister has spoken at great length about Canada's 
generous system of redistributing wealth from one province to 
another. And yet, in its reform of unemployment insurance in 
the last budget, the federal government went looking for close to 
$1.4 billion in the pockets of unemployed workers in Quebec 
and the Maritimes. Close to 60 per cent of the initial cuts are 
affecting these regions, which are hard hit by the job crisis.
<P>
	Now, as a result of social program reform, these regions will 
again bear the brunt, with cuts in the billions of dollars. 
Quebecers will not accept a reform whose sole objective is to 
slash programs. Although opposition to the reform is 
widespread, Quebec's response to this attack will be quite 
different. When it attains sovereignty, it will be sure to 
implement a full employment policy, using its own resources.

	At the same time, they know Canada must cope with costs due 
to new technology, new drugs, our aging population and the 
emergence of new diseases.
<P>
	The forum, chaired by the Prime Minister, will bring together 
Canada's wealth of talent and knowledge in the health care field 
such as that of Dr. Noralou Roos of Winnipeg. It will engage 
Canadians in developing solutions to challenges facing 
medicare, taking into account its five basic principles and all the 
major determinants of health.

	The National Forum on Health will set the framework for 
Canada's renewed vision of medicare as we approach the 21st 
century. Let us applaud the government.

	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to read you an excerpt from a letter: ``I am writing to 
further offer my strong support for the project because of the 
significant job creation this project will provide-One of the 
main objectives of the infrastructure program is to promote 
public and private sector partnerships that will not only improve 
the local and regional economic climate but also help Canada as 
a whole attract corporations by providing prime business 
opportunity-''.
<P>
	One would logically assume that the Prime Minister or the 
minister responsible for the program would have made this 
statement.
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
	The fact is that the member for Simcoe Centre made this 
statement in support of infrastucture programs in the city of 
Barrie despite condemning them yesterday.
<P>
	The national infrastucture program has been a catalyst for job 
creation. If the Reform Party followed our government's 
example perhaps the public would not be so cynical of 
politicians.

	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, social security reform is a very serious issue for all 
Canadians. It offers alternatives to address the serious 
challenges we must face.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada social security reform left many 
unanswered questions in relation to seasonal employment. I 
commend the minister of human resources for responding to 
these concerns and for creating a special committee to study the 
question of seasonal workers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The committee in question is addressing a serious concern of 
Atlantic Canada. Special attention must be given to seasonal 
workers. Social program reform is not only important, it is 
necessary. I encourage all Canadians to become involved in the 
consultation process and to express their opinion on the future of 
our social programs.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, B.Q.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, very serious allegations have been made recently 
about CSIS's infiltration activities. Now come revelations from 
a former officer of the Communications Security Establishment, 
another federal agency, who in a book published this week 
mentions the existence of a special unit called ``French 
Problem'' that is responsible for intercepting Quebec 
government members' telephone calls or having these calls 
intercepted by foreign services.
<P>
	For his part, the Prime Minister said yesterday in this House 
that since he entered politics, he knew nothing about any spying 
on the sovereignist movement by federal services.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. How can the 
government pretend, as the Prime Minister did yesterday, not to 
be aware of federal agents spying on Quebec's pro-sovereignty 
movement, when the reports of the Keable and MacDonald 
commissions showed the extent of the RCMP's illegal activities 
in the 1970s, much activities as planting bombs, burning barns 
and stealing the Parti Quebecois's membership lists?
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="6981"> 6981 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to draw the 
attention of the House to what the Prime Minister said 
yesterday, that the activities of the CSE are totally subject to 
Canadian laws, including the Criminal Code, the Canadian 
Human Rights Act, the Privacy Act and the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms, and they obey the law.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, B.Q.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, can the Deputy Prime Minister from her seat 
clearly assure this House that the federal intelligence services, 
CSIS and the Communications Security Establishment, have not 
and do not engage in electronic eavesdropping on elected 
officials and members of the Bloc Quebecois, the Parti 
Quebecois and the Quebec sovereignty movement and do not 
have others engage in such activities for them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat, the activities 
of the CSE are in no way directed against Canadians, including 
people involved in politics.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, B.Q.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we note that Mike Frost's revelations report that 
interception services do each other favours, some spying on the 
ministers of others, and so on.
<P>
	We all noted that the Deputy Prime Minister carefully avoided 
giving the clear, specific assurance which I asked of her. On 
such a serious subject involving respect for the law and 
democracy in Canada, a refusal to deny is the same as an 
admission.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask the Deputy Prime Minister to tell us clearly 
if we must conclude from the evasive answer she just gave that 
the federal services are now engaged in such electronic 
eavesdropping?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in no way was I 
evasive. What I said and I repeat, in French and in English, if the 
hon. member cannot understand, is that the CSE is subject to 
Canadian law, including the Criminal Code, and to all Canadian 
laws. They do not take any action against people in Canada who 
are in politics.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, B.Q.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	I wish to remind the Deputy Prime Minister that the 
Communications Security Establishment is not accountable to 
any review agency. The disclosures made by a CSE spy, Mike 
Frost, raise the whole issue of electronic surveillance of the 
sovereignist movement by federal services.
<P>
	Why is it that, unlike CSIS, the Communications Security 
Establishment, whose budget is estimated at $200 million a 
year-yes, Mr. Speaker, $200 million a  year-is not subject to 
any external parliamentary control whatsoever? Who monitors 
the spies in this country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have said it many 
times and I will repeat it for those who did not understand. The 
CSE is subject to the Criminal Code of Canada. It does not spy 
on Canadians or on those who are involved in politics, whether 
they belong to the Parti Quebecois, the Liberal Party or any 
other political party. Is that clear enough?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, B.Q.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, does the Deputy Prime Minister not admit that, 
given the recent and very serious allegations concerning both 
CSIS and the Communications Security Establishment, the 
government should set up a royal commission of inquiry, as 
requested, to shed light once and for all on these allegations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, many books are 
circulating this week. One is by Claude Morin, one by Joe Clark, 
and there are others. Are we here to say that all that Claude 
Morin writes is true? We in the government want to deal in facts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We want to deal in facts. If the member is interested in 
slinging the mud, if he believes every word that is written in 
every book that is flying around town-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. My colleagues, I would again ask you to 
please not use any props while you are in the House of 
Commons. It just leads to bigger and bigger props.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTHCARE">HEALTH CARE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a funny thing happened on the way to the health care 
forum.
<P>
	The provincial governments which have jurisdiction over 
health care and pay the bulk of the bills are not being allowed to 
lead the health care reform process. They are sitting on the 
sidelines.
<P>
	The Prime Minister would not even agree to share the 
chairmanship of the forum with the premier of Saskatchewan, 
the province that pioneered medicare.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is when is the federal 
government going to stop alienating the provinces by pretending 
to lead the health care reform process and let them lead the 
reform of social programs for which they are constitutionally 
responsible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal 
government spends $16 billion of hard earned Canadian 
taxpayers' money on the health care system. We have a direct 
interest and a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6982"> 6982 </A></B>
<P>
direct fiduciary responsibility. I am sure that the Reform Party 
agrees with that.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister has declined to notice that 
the provinces spend 46 per cent of the money spent on health 
care and private individuals and insurance companies pay 28 per 
cent and the federal government is now a junior player.
<P>
	We are wondering who is going to supply the fiscal facts of 
life at the health care forum. The Prime Minister and the health 
minister are not strong on math, and the finance minister is here.
<P>
	My question is for the finance minister. The finance minister 
has said that everything is on the table in his spending review. 
This is the new fiscal reality. Can the finance minister confirm 
that federal health care spending is on the table and is the Prime 
Minister communicating this fact at the health care forum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the things 
that we have made very clear is that not only do we need smaller 
government, we need smarter government and better 
government.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard, Lib.):</B> They are applauding 
me and not the leader of the opposition. You had better watch 
out, Preston.
<P>
	The reason for the health care forum is that we recognize full 
well that costs have to be kept under control and we have to be 
able to deliver services better. We also understand very 
clearly-because this is the party that brought medicare and 
hospital insurance in-that we are going to protect the social 
programs of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had a call from a woman in Saskatchewan the other 
week. The hospital in her community was being completely shut 
down because of lack of funding. She and others in her 
community wanted the option of continuing to use the facility 
even if this required some fee for service. What she wanted is 
expressly prohibited by the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	My question for the Deputy Prime Minister is if the federal 
government cannot maintain funding for health care, will it at 
least give provinces and communities options other than 
shutting down hospitals by opening up and reforming the 
Canada Health Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a little confused 
because on the one hand we hear every day from the Reform 
Party how important it is to be responsible for Canadian tax 
dollars.
<P>
	In the light of that responsibility the Prime Minister has 
committed to a national examination of how to spend our $16 
billion federal health care investment better.
<P>
	The leader of the third party tells us we should leave it up to 
the provinces. Unfortunately that is not what his critic said. On 
January 27 in <I>Hansard</I>, page 472, Mr. Grant Hill said the federal 
government should be standing up and setting national 
standards for our health care.
<P>
	Who is speaking for the Reform Party, the leader or the health 
critic?

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. Yesterday, 
in answer to a question in this House, the Prime Minister left 
open the possibility that he might renege on his commitment not 
to increase taxes when he said, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-if people do not want us to make cuts, the alternative is to raise taxes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So, I ask the Minister of Finance: Are we to understand that 
the Minister of Finance is contemplating a tax increase for the 
middle class since, except for cutting indiscriminately in social 
programs, he is unable to cut where it is really necessary, that is 
in the government's operating expenditures?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister was very clear yesterday when he said that we really 
want to lower the deficit by reducing government spending. 
However, if we cannot reach our goal that way, we will 
definitely consider other alternatives, including tax measures. 
Again, I invite the hon. member to make constructive 
suggestions and I ask him this question: Does he really think that 
we will eliminate a $40-billion deficit merely by reducing the 
government's operating expenditures, which amount to $20 
billion? The hon. member, who is an economist, should learn 
how to add.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have already made seven recommendations to the 
Minister of Finance. If he wants another one, I will tell him not 
to raise taxes, as promised by the Prime Minister during the 
election campaign. He must not do it.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance claim, as he has been doing 
for four days, that all taxpayers will have to help reduce the 
deficit when he excludes at the outset the major corporations 
and the richest families in the country by not taking all 
appropriate means to ensure that these people pay their fair 
share of taxes, nothing more but nothing less?

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, again I say to the 
hon. member that he should read the budget tabled in February. 
He will see that we closed loopholes, such as the $100,000 
capital gains exemption, and that we launched the most 
comprehensive reform ever regarding corporate tax. We closed 
all kinds of loopholes for corporations. The hon. member 
should really do his homework.
<P>
	He says that we must not tax and we must not make cuts, but 
we have to eliminate the deficit. The problem with the Bloc 
Quebecois is that it does not know how to add, how to multiply 
or how to subtract. It only know how to divide.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was really 
nice to be referred to by personal name by the Deputy Prime 
Minister in the House today. Might I express what I actually said 
in <I>Hansard</I>. I said there was a place for the federal government 
in national standards as long as they paid the bill.
<P>
	The Prime Minister this morning addressed the national 
health care forum and he stated: ``The forum is not an 
intergovernmental body''. A good sense of humour. ``This body 
is missing arms, legs and head''.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister admit that this $12 million is 
being spent to make a minor payer look like a major player?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has 
acknowledged that the national government has a role to play. 
We are footing the bill to the tune of $16 billion.
<P>
	On the one hand he is suggesting that we should have no 
national input, and on the other hand his leader is saying: ``Turn 
it over to the provinces''.
<P>
	What we want and what the Prime Minister is trying to do is to 
go to the Canadian Hospital Association, to go to the Canadian 
Nurses Association, to involve the Canadian Public Health 
Association, to involve the players who are delivering the 
service on the ground, to see if there is a way that we can spend 
our $16 billion investment a bit smarter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> And that will take four 
years, Mr. Speaker? Here is the format of the forum that should 
have been: short and sweet; dialogue from all the provinces, 
other nations, nurses, physio, disabled and natives; everyone 
present; and specific goals. All MPs would then consult with 
their constituencies. The time frame: about a month; results: 
dramatic.
<P>
	This is the consultation Canadians want. This is the 
consultation Canadians deserve. This is the consultation 
Canadians need. Will the government give us that kind of 
consultation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind the hon. 
member that when the Prime Minister launched the promise of 
the forum as he did in the red book, he did so with the express 
purpose of bringing the stakeholders around the table.
<P>
	That is why the Consumers Association of Canada has 
endorsed the forum. The Canadian Public Health Association 
has endorsed the forum. The Canadian Medical Association has 
endorsed the forum. The Canadian Nurses Association has 
endorsed the forum. The Canadian Hospital Association has 
endorsed the program.
<P>
	The players are around the table. We think this $12 million 
investment will yield dividends in a system that is currently 
costing us $16 billion. Is that money not being well spent?

Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Natural 
Resources. We are informed that the shipyard in Marystown, 
Newfoundland, was unable to deliver on a $35-million 
subcontract for the Hibernia megaproject. Without calling for 
tenders, the contract was transferred directly to the shipyards at 
Saint John Shipbuilding Limited in New Brunswick.

confirm that this $35-million contract was transferred directly, 
without tender, to Saint John Shipbuilding Limited in New

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me explain to the hon. member the 
process by which that decision was taken. It was a decision of 
the Hibernia management board. That board is one on which the 
federal government has one representative out of five. That is by 
virtue of our 8.5 per cent equity interest in the Hibernia project.
<P>
	The federal government does not have the intention of 
micromanaging projects like Hibernia. The decision was a day

board.

MIL Davie already bid on this contract in 1993, unlike Saint 
John Shipbuilding which never bid on the contract at all, will the 
Government of Canada, as a full partner in Hibernia, need I 
recall, exert the necessary pressure to reverse this decision and 
give the contract to MIL Davie, or will it do everything it can to 
close down MIL Davie, which might gladden the heart of the 
Minister of Transport?

	However, if my hon. friend would like to discuss with the 
Hibernia management consortium the reasons for its decision in

<P>
	Allan Kinsella has 29 adult convictions, previous escapes, a

although it was recorded at 2 a.m. today, the escape actually

	The Canadian Wheat Board has come under attack in recent

that the board has done an extraordinarily good job. However 
there is controversy among farmers about marketing systems 
and about the role of the board.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
recently the Supreme Court ruled that extreme drunkenness is a 
viable excuse for rape.
<P>
	Citing this ruling on Tuesday in an Ontario court, a drunken 
man was given a light sentence for sexually assaulting a woman. 
It appears that he will probably serve the sentence in a halfway 
house while still going to work.
<P>
	On October 3, I asked the Minister of Justice what his plans 
were to eliminate such nonsense. The parliamentary secretary 
said they would come forward with a report.
<P>
	I have two questions: Where is this report and what are its 
recommendations?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>

seriously. The department is working on it very carefully.

question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	Following the <I>Estonia</I> disaster, Finland and Sweden ordered 
their ship owners to weld the bow doors on this type of ferry. In 
Canada, four ferries similar to the <I>Estonia</I> face deep-sea 
weather conditions that are as difficult as those on the Baltic. 
One of these ferries, the <I>Bluenose</I>, is operated by the federal 
government under the Bahamian flag.
<P>
	Since several experts recognize that this type of ship has 
major safety risks, can the minister explain to us what he has 
done to avoid a tragedy with the four ships in service in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course everyone who knows about the tragedy which 
happened overseas understands the importance of the hon. 
member's question. We dealt with the issue immediately. We 
know that the British Columbia government was concerned 
about its ferries which might present problems. The four ferries, 
the four ships to which the hon. member referred have been

action is being taken in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since the <I>Caribou</I> and the <I>Bluenose</I> have already suffered storm 
damage to their outer door, does the minister not believe that it 
is his duty as Minister of Transport to take much more 
significant action than simple tests and checks?

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

General who has the legal opportunity to intervene in this 
situation. I have had a legal opinion given to me and indeed he 
can do this. Why will he not do this before another innocent

not want to see risk created by such absences for anyone. My 
understanding of the legal position is not the same as the hon. 
member's.
<P>

other point of view. He should be a little more even handed.
<P>
	I was invited to attend one of those meetings. I indicated that 
because the House of Commons was sitting and because this 
happened to be a cabinet day and a busy agenda from the point of 
view of agricultural interests, it would not be possible for me to 
be in Regina.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, B.Q.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, if I may, I would like to reiterate that Bill C-54 
is particularly significant because it substantially changes some 
aspects of four pieces of legislation that are ultimately central to 
income support for the most disadvantaged in our society.
<P>
	As the Official Opposition, we had an opportunity to say that 
we see in this bill a number of positive points but we still have 
three concerns which I will be happy to discuss with you.
<P>
	Before being interrupted in a friendly way by our Speaker, I 
had explained to the hon. members that we were happy with two 
positive aspects of the bill and I was about to discuss the third 
point, which will give OAS and spouse's allowance recipients an 
avenue of administrative recourse without them having to 
appeal to another court. We agree with this effort to simplify 
administration. We are also pleased that this bill allows 
recipients to settle overpayments quickly and to avoid more red 
tape.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	We have three main concerns with this bill. Our first concern 
lies at the centre of democratic life and concerns access to 
personal information that would be extended to other 
departments. This concern-that the bill before us allows other 
departments and agencies to access information on 
recipients-is the subject of an amendment to the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6989"> 6989 </A></B>
<P>
	It must be understood-and I think it is important for our 
viewers to understand it as well-that this bill adds to the list 
of departments and agencies that will have access to the 
information given by program beneficiaries. This list will grow 
so much that even Canada Post will have access to this 
information, although it has not been explained to us why 
Canada Post would need this type of information. We think 
there has been an oversight, a lack of accuracy which, in the 
long term, could lead to abuse.
<P>
	The list of departments and agencies which will be able to 
access this information is also expanded. The result is that the 
Correctional Service of Canada, the Commissioner of the 
RCMP, the Department of Justice, the Attorney General and any 
other person designated as a health care professional will have 
access to that information.
<P>
	No justification has been made for expanding that list. Yet, 
such a measure could lead to abuse and to violations of the 
principles of democracy.
<P>
	I draw your attention to the fact that the Correctional Service 
will even be allowed to prosecute inmates who are pensioners to 
ensure that these people continue to pay off debts incurred in the 
past. We would have liked the act to provide more details where 
it authorizes any person designated by the minister as a health 
care professional to have access to information by name.
<P>
	Why not be more specific? Why not say exactly what we are 
talking about? Why be so vague? You will agree with me that 
past experience has demonstrated the importance, for the 
legislator, to specify who, and in what specific circumstances, 
can have access to such information. I see the Minister of 
Revenue nodding his head. Heaven knows how important access 
to important information by name is for his department.
<P>
	We would have liked this bill to provide some bench marks, to 
be more specific regarding the managers and the officials who 
will have access to such information by name, as it concerns the 
private lives of individuals. In fact, we know from past 
experience that failure to do so by the legislator results in abuse 
which, in turn, leads to representations before administrative 
tribunals or courts of law.
<P>
	This is the reason for the amendment tabled by the hon. 
member, and I hope that this House will adopt it. In fact, I will 
read that amendment again, so that viewers can understand what 
the Bloc Quebecois is trying to do.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Our position is that we agree with the essence of this bill. We 
agree that it provides for a substantial reduction in 
administrative procedures. However, considering some of the 
concerns we have about the bill, we ask that:
<P>
``this House declines to give second reading reading to Bill C-54, An Act to amend 
the Old Age Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Children's Special 
Allowances Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act, because it does not provide a 
penalty under the Criminal Code for the disclosure of personal information 
concerning beneficiaries to persons who are not  legally authorized to such 
information pursuant to Access to Privileged Information.''
<P>
	There is quite a contradiction here. We have legislation that is 
intended to protect the privacy of Canadians, and we have 
legislation before the House today that fails to provide any 
mechanisms for laying charges or imposing formal sanctions, in 
the case of public employees who might be guilty of 
unauthorized disclosure of information.
<P>
	You do not have to be a member of the Canadian public 
service to know that this has been known to occur in the past. 
Why did the minister not propose mechanisms to prevent such 
practices?
<P>
	So this is a serious concern. Madam Speaker, this is a 
fundamental error which should be corrected, and that is what 
we are doing, as part of the responsibilities and duties we have 
as an Official Opposition that takes those duties very seriously.
<P>
	Our second cause for concern is that clearly, Bill C-54, in 
addition to streamlining certain administrative procedures, 
reflects an austerity policy the government claims to support, an 
approach reflected in somewhat haphazard cuts of up to $7 
billion over the next few years, cuts which, as they were in the 
past, will be at the expense of the less well-off in our society.
<P>
	Our listeners and members of this House should recall that in 
the past, those who failed to apply for old age security benefits 
within the prescribed period could do so retroactively for up to a 
maximum of five years, which gave people considerable leeway.
<P>
	Today, the government wants to reduce this period to one year. 
Aside from the somewhat shortsighted, financial considerations 
that might deprive Canadians of the basic right to get their 
pension benefits retroactively over a period of more than one 
year, there is no indication of what this is supposed to 
accomplish, since it is not a measure that will benefit Canadians.
<P>
	The government is getting ready to put an end to the five-year 
retroactivity provision which is in force until this bill is passed. 
In an effort to balance its budget, the government wants to 
reduce, arbitrarily and without giving any explanation, 
retroactive payments to pensioners. It is estimated that up to 
1,200,000 people availed themselves of this right to recover 
retroactively their Old Age Security pensions.
<P>
	This is an important issue. There are many reasons why 
people may have to apply retroactively for old age pensions. 
Instead of getting five years of retroactive benefits they will 
only get one, and we believe that it is unfair. We are totally 
against it.
<P>
	There is another administrative measure aimed at balancing 
the budget we disagree with because we believe that it is not in 
the best interests of our fellow citizens. Let us keep in mind that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6990"> 6990 </A></B>
<P>
when we are talking about Old Age Security, we are not talking 
about wealthy people.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	We are talking for the most part about people who are not 
financially independent. We are talking about people who are 
depend largely on transfers from the government, namely Old 
Age Security.
<P>
	Therefore, the other point about which the opposition is in 
disagreement with the government is the elimination of the 
deadline for the recovery of overpayments. We have to realize 
that, when you are dealing with social legislation, any kind of 
legislation under which civil servants, managers, must review 
applications, interpret the act and justify their decisions, human 
nature being what it is, it might happen that, even with the best 
of intentions-and we do not doubt the good intentions of civil 
servants in Quebec, in Ottawa or elsewhere-overpayments are 
made. It means that people are given rights they were not 
entitled to, in the strict sense of the law.
<P>
	From now on, the government will be able to ask that money 
paid in excess be reimbursed and there will be no time limit for 
this; to use a legal expression, there will be no statute of 
limitations. In the past, when overpayments were made to 
recipients, we could not ask for the amounts owing to be 
remitted after two years had gone by. Today, the government is 
assuming the right-a right basically unprecedented in social 
law-to recover overpayments at any point in time.
<P>
	This means that, under this legislation, if someone incurred a 
debt 15 years ago and an erroneous decision was made 
concerning this person, we could recover this money. I can see 
my hon. colleague nodding. I guess she agrees with me. It is 
always a pleasure to receive support from the opposition, a 
support as unusual as it is unsubstantial. No limit will be put on 
establishing overpayments. This is a practice that hardly seems 
to be in the interest of our fellow citizens.
<P>
	We have concerns about another thing. We realize that this 
bill provides for an appeal procedure enabling our fellow 
citizens who receive old age security and a pension under the 
Canada Pension Plan to appeal, to go before an administrative 
tribunal and challenge decisions that were made and that they 
disagree with. Such review tribunals are commonplace, of 
course, in administrative and social law.
<P>
	There are review tribunals for the CSST, for income security, 
for the motor vehicle insurance bureau, and that is how it should 
be. We are not concerned so much about-seeing that I have but 
one minute remaining, I will make this my conclusion, as I was 
about to close- the existence of appeal mechanisms, as about 
the minister having the power to discontinue the payments of 
benefits when no decision has been made under the appeal 
procedure.
<P>
	Therefore, while recognizing that some administrative 
adjustments may be in order, we cannot support this bill without 
the amendment put forth by the Official Opposition, which 
would have the effect of really  limiting the actions and powers 
of those who will be handling personal information data banks. 
So, we have every confidence that the government will approve 
the opposition's proposal. I thank you for the speaking time I 
was given.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, B.Q.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened very attentively to my colleague and I would have a 
question for him. Just now, he told us about $7 billion in cuts to 
the poorest people. I would like him to give us some alternatives 
to these cuts. Where else could one cut, except at the expense of 
the very poor? I would like the hon. member to give this 
government some alternatives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, as you see, this is a very 
relevant question, which shows us how deeply committed our 
colleague is. We have always had quite a clear position on this.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	The opposition party operates on the principle that full 
employment has been possible in small countries which had all 
the instruments they needed to bring it about, but it is not 
possible in the Canadian context since two levels of government 
take action which is often contradictory.
<P>
	We see now that countries with an unemployment rate of 3, 4 
or 5 per cent, which is called frictional unemployment and is 
acceptable, are those which have acquired mechanisms for joint 
action and co-operation. They have been able to bring together 
around a table at the national level people from labour, 
management and professional corporations to set 
macro-economic objectives.
<P>
	Of course, such a solution is not possible in the Canadian 
context because two levels of government are in competition 
without regard for efficiency.
<P>
	The second solution that we think we can contribute concerns 
a thorny issue which is a disgrace for this government, namely 
family trusts. We know that plugging this loophole could save 
billions of dollars.
<P>
	Finally, when it comes to corporate taxation, we see that 
companies pay less tax in Canada than in other OECD countries. 
We think that corporation taxation should be reviewed. If Mr. 
Martin were a courageous man-and we on this side of the 
House long ago realized that the Minister of Finance does not 
really qualify as courageous-he could have reviewed corporate 
taxation in February so that the government could collect the 
amounts which it is now lacking.
<P>
	We have three approaches: one involves a political 
reconfiguration, one that will be possible when two sovereign 
states with all the powers they need can deal with each other as 
complete equals; this means sovereignty for Quebec and a 
redefinition of what English Canada should be. The second 
approach of course involves the tools at the finance minister's 
disposal, if he has political courage and integrity. Certainly, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6991"> 6991 </A></B>
<P>
when you form a national government as the Liberal Party does 
and you take money from your election fund so that your party 
can live, you get that money from the private sector and you 
have close ties to those people, so it is not easy for a finance 
minister to raise money for his party and also to revise the tax 
system in favour of the less fortunate. However, in Quebec, we 
do not have that problem, since we have passed legislation on 
democratic financing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to ask 
my colleague if reducing the deadline from five to one year 
indicates, in his opinion, that the government is contemplating 
cuts to retirement plans?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the 
key question asked by the hon. member for Lévis. I would like to 
point out that the hon. member for Lévis has always shown 
affection and concern for the less fortunate, for whom he has 
been one of the most distinguished spokespersons since he was 
elected last October. I want to commend him for that.
<P>
	Our concern about reducing the deadline from five to one year 
is, who will pay for this? Who can claim retroactively an OAS 
cheque or a cheque-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Sorry, sir, but your time 
is up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, on Bill C-54, an act to amend the Old Age Security 
Act, the Canada pension plan, the Children's Special 
Allowances Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act, any 
sane, reasonable scrutiny of this bill would very quickly indicate 
to almost any informed reader that this has to be what has 
become known in Parliament as comma legislation, that is to say 
legislation which seeks to make certain technical changes but 
substantively has very little impact.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a need for comma legislation, technical legislation, 
to tidy up the business, to make it of more service to the people it 
is purporting to serve. That is the reality, this is in effect comma 
legislation. It is legislation that will seek to do a number of 
important but relatively minor things in the scheme of things.
<P>
	That is not to say they should not be done. I support the bill 
and in a moment I will state two or three reasons why I support 
the bill. However, if we accepted as the reality of the bill and 
then listen to some of my friends opposite, we would wonder if 
we are both talking about the same piece of legislation.
<P>
	As I listened to a bit a of the debate this morning for some 
strange reason I found myself deciding that what I needed to do 
was reread an old poem that I learned and taught in high school 
called ``Matilda''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> ``Waltzing Matilda''?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> No, not ``Waltzing Matilda'', the other 
``Matilda''. I will not read it all, just a couple of lines that are 
very much to the point. Matilda, growing tired of play and 
finding she was left alone, went tiptoe to the telephone and 
summoned the fire brigade.
<P>
	We know the story. It was a false alarm. There was no fire. She 
did it so many times that a few weeks later when her aunt was 
away at the theatre, that night a fire did break out: ``You should 
have heard Matilda shout. You should have heard her scream and 
bawl''. We know the rest: ``For every time she shouted fire, they 
only shouted little liar''. They did not believe her because too 
often she had used the dramatic overstatement to draw attention 
to her situation. Why did they not believe her? Along the way by 
overstating the simple and the untrue she had worn out her 
credibility.
<P>
	In a more modern idiom, she was Chicken Little: ``The sky is 
falling. These big bad Liberals over there want to put a comma 
in the legislation. The sky is falling, the world is coming to an 
end''. That is what we have been hearing for the last couple of 
days.
<P>
	I say to my friends in the Reform Party and the Bloc 
Quebecois that I spent some time in opposition provincially and 
federally. If they want to check the record I said some fairly 
dramatic things from time to time. One has to learn that there is a 
time for making dramatic statements and there is a time for 
standing up and calling things exactly as they are.
<P>
	Let us look at this particular bill. This is no occasion for 
pulling your hair or threatening the end of reality or saying the 
sky is falling or screaming fire when there is no fire. There is no 
fire here at all.
<P>
	The Unemployment Insurance Act would be amended here, 
for example. Listen how drastically this foul government wants 
to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act, then decide 
whether the sky is falling.
<P>
	Bill C-54 has no impact whatsoever on eligibility criteria or 
benefit structure of the UI program. What else is there in the 
program other than the benefits and the eligibility? It has no 
impact on those matters at all. Here is what it would do, though. 
It does contain one little amendment, giving the minister the 
discretion to disclose UI client information only to the 
commissioner of the RCMP for the purpose of conducting 
investigations and prosecution, for purposes of ensuring 
compliance with the law. That is the amendment. That is the sky 
is falling amend-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6992"> 6992 </A></B>
<P>
ment we have been hearing about for the last day or so in this 
particular bill.
<P>
	On the proposed amendment in this bill to the Children's 
Special Allowance Act, no change again in eligibility criteria or 
the benefit structure of the CSA program-not a wit of change 
proposed in this.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	There are two amendments though, both advanced for reasons 
of administration. I believe hon. members are familiar with 
those. I can read them into the record if they wish.
<P>
	Let us come to the question of changes for OAS, old age 
security, and the Canada pension plan. Again we read that the 
government's sin here is in finding ways to make it a little less 
onerous for the people out there who are receiving these 
benefits, instead of having them fill in forms ad nauseam every 
year as they are required to do now in order to qualify for those 
supplements. That is what the bill is about. You would wonder if 
you listened to some of the speeches.
<P>
	The bill is what I called earlier some comma legislation. I 
have some advice to give to my friends in all parties including 
myself. Save the fire call for when there is a fire. When there is 
some legislation here that we have some real discomfort with 
then get up and say so. Then people will recognize that we know 
what we are talking about. Screaming fire when there is no fire 
creates false insecurities out there. People are asking: ``What 
are they doing to the old age security?''.
<P>
	I will tell them what we are doing with the old age security. I 
will tell the people watching exactly what we are doing to the old 
age security in this bill. Instead of that silly form people have to 
fill in every year, we are going to see to it that they have to fill it 
in less often, sometimes only once. That is what the bill is about.
<P>
	What are we doing to the UI? If somebody is out there trying 
to beat the law, we are going to make it harder for them. If this 
bill passes, we are going to allow the commissioner of the 
RCMP to have access to client information for the purpose of 
prosecuting a person if they are in that particular category.
<P>
	I identify with those objectives. I have no difficulty at all with 
those objectives. That is why it gives me great honour and 
pleasure to rise in support of Bill C-54, because when passed the 
amendments here will directly benefit and assist over 4 million 
Canadian seniors, in particular the 1.4 million seniors who are 
currently receiving the spouse's allowance or the guaranteed 
income supplement, commonly known as the GIS.
<P>
	The proposed amendments will allow these seniors, the 
majority of whom are women, to receive the benefits to which 
they are entitled with a minimum of red tape. Let us look at a few 
of the features of the programs we are talking about. Then let us 
look at why these amendments although small in one way are 
nevertheless important.
<P>
	The foundation of the retirement system is the old age 
security benefit. The OAS pension is paid to individuals 65 
years of age and over who meet certain residence requirements. 
That benefit though is not enough for certain seniors. That is the 
reason we have additional benefits which are income tested.
<P>
	The GIS is a monthly income tested benefit payable to seniors 
with low income, while the spouse's allowance is a monthly 
income tested benefit payable to the 60 to 64-year old spouse of 
an OAS pensioner as well as to low income widowed persons in 
that same age bracket of 60 to 64 years.
<P>
	The amount of these additional benefits is determined on a 
sliding scale of income with the maximum paid only to those 
pensioners with no income other than the basic old age security 
pension. While having outside income can reduce the amount of 
the supplement or the allowance, this reduction does not 
completely offset the benefit since only one dollar of 
supplement is lost for every two of other income. This ensures 
that pensioners will be better off for having saved and prepared 
for retirement.
<P>
	The GIS and the spouse's allowance are both income tested 
benefits, and so they are normally based on a recipient's income 
in the preceding calendar year in accordance with the Income 
Tax Act. For example, the benefits for the period from April 
1994 to March 1995 are based on the income for 1993.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	Each year before the benefit can be calculated and paid in 
April, seniors must fill out a renewal application, including a 
complete statement of income. Of course, most seniors also fill 
out their income tax form at about that time with the very same 
information that they provide on their annual GIS application 
form.
<P>
	There in a nutshell is an example of unnecessary government 
red tape, where the senior sits down, paper in hand, fills out a 
form putting in certain information related to income and mails 
it to the income tax people; then goes over to the other end of the 
table and gets another form, using the same pen and putting 
down the same answers to the same questions, then mails it off 
to the old age security. They wind up in offices almost across the 
corridor in Ottawa or wherever these forms go.
<P>
	While they may appear so, these two systems do not operate in 
isolation. The income security branch of Human Resources 
Development Canada pays the benefit initially on the basis of 
the GIS application. Later on, usually in the fall, it verifies the 
income that the client filled out on the application with the 
assessed income figures received from Revenue Canada to 
determine if the payments to be made are still correct. However, 
pensioners often very rightly wonder why they have to give the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6993"> 6993 </A></B>
<P>
information twice and why it takes so long to cross-check the 
information.
<P>
	The amendments to this bill will serve to eliminate some of 
that duplication so that in the future not all seniors will have to 
fill out the same information twice for two government 
departments. As well, it will simplify the process of transferring 
information between the departments, which is already allowed 
by legislation anyway.
<P>
	Let me emphasize that the desire to improve and simplify 
administration is not confined to one department or set of 
programs. Last year, for example, Revenue Canada introduced 
three new tax returns for people with straightforward tax 
situations and one of these returns was for seniors who meet 
certain requirements regarding age, level and type of income. 
That return is mailed to people over 65 who have been retired for 
at least a year with income under $50,000 and receiving most of 
their income from pensions and investments and receiving old 
age security benefits.
<P>
	The simplified tax return which I was just mentioning has 
large print and provides preprinted amounts for old age security, 
guaranteed income supplement benefits and Canada and Quebec 
pension plan benefits. Any lines from the standard tax form that 
are not needed by seniors are deleted and the accompanying 
guide is easy to read with large print.
<P>
	I realize that if I read very much more of this I am going to 
have everybody sound asleep, including myself, because it is 
such ongoing straightforward logical information. I thought I 
would read just a little of it to demonstrate to the House that 
while some of the speakers have almost had cardiac arrests 
telling us about the pitfalls of this legislation, the reality is that 
it could not introduce a mild headache let alone a heart attack.
<P>
	This is a fairly simple bill. Let us get on with it and allow the 
government to produce the enabling legislation to simplify 
those forms for senior citizens and the other matters which I 
have outlined here, administrivia but necessary nevertheless.
<P>
	The second point, to reiterate, to all of us here in this House 
including myself is save the fire screams for fires. I spent 
slightly more time in opposition than I did in government and so 
I am very much committed to the role of opposition in 
government. I happen to believe very firmly that the less 
effective an opposition is the less effective government is.
<P>
	I understand my friends from Elk Island and Okanagan 
Centre, I understand that they want to muse on the possibility of 
when I will be back in opposition.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	I not only happen to accept that possibility but in time would 
look forward to it. If it is anything that is more debilitating than 
too long in opposition, it is too long in government. That is the 
very point I am trying to make to my friends. Good government 
consists of a good government bench and a good opposition 
bench as well. To put it differently, if we do not have a good 
opposition we do not have as effective a government.
<P>
	One of the mixes of this particular House which is different 
than any other chamber that I have been in, both other sessions 
here and in the chamber in Newfoundland where I had the 
privilege of sitting for 10 years, is that we have a completely 
new mix in terms of a party, the Reform Party, which heretofore 
had only one seat in the House and the other, the official 
opposition, which heretofore had six or seven seats in the House. 
Almost the entire opposition bench, not to mention a good many 
of the government bench, is here for the first time. That is 
refreshing in the context of not getting bogged down in hanging 
on to all the old things.
<P>
	It is a particular challenge when one has to come in here on the 
day one arrives and help make good government. Helping make 
good government includes being appropriately critical.
<P>
	Some people talk about the free vote. We have free votes. I am 
not being tongue in cheek. We have free votes as do all the other 
parties. We are now finding, having been here a year, that most 
of our free votes take place in caucus where they should take 
place. That is why we are a party and not a conglomerate of 52 
members or 54 members or 170 members. We are party because 
our real fights take place. If you saw the exchange, Madam 
Speaker, I had with a minister in a caucus yesterday you would 
wonder why the two of us are still in the same party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Tell us about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> It will cost you but I probably will.
<P>
	To conclude on this point because it is important for me as a 
parliamentarian, there are going to be vociferous, strenuous 
debates in this House. I participated in some of them. Whether 
colleagues on this side or colleagues on the opposite side, in 
order to know where they are coming from we have to know if 
they are Matildas or not. We have to know if they scream fire all 
the time even when there is no fire. We have to know whether 
they flag something when it really needs to be flagged.
<P>
	I say to those people in the Bloc and in the Reform Party as 
well as in my own party that when the day arrives when they spot 
something genuinely wrong with the legislation I want to be the 
first to know. I hope they will count me as enough of a friend to 
tell me so I can be on the side of right.
<P>
	Sometimes we engage in partisan rhetoric but there comes a 
time when you cannot stand with your party because something 
is genuinely at odds with what you believe. To have that kind of 
rapport with parliamentarians we have to know that they are not 
a bunch of Matildas, they are not a bunch of Chicken Littles, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6994"> 6994 </A></B>
<P>
they are not a bunch of people who scream when there is 
absolutely no need for screaming.
<P>
	I have much pleasure in supporting the bill and invite hon. 
members of the House to do likewise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I followed with interest the presentation of the 
hon. member for Burin-St. George's. He had the typical 
Liberal approach to problems, don't worry, be happy. He was 
even discussing cardiac arrest. I am sure if he had a cardiac 
arrest he would still be saying: ``Don't worry, be happy, there is 
no problem here. Do not bother calling the doctor. We are just 
fine and if we are not who cares''.
<P>
	He was saying there is really not much in this bill, there is no 
change. There are a couple of little administrative things here 
and there. I am quoting him close enough that he will not protest. 
He is saying there are some little minor administrative changes 
but basically this bill leaves everything as is with regard to OAS 
and CPP and the other issues that it deals with.
<P>
	I would suggest that is probably the problem. That is why we 
are speaking rather energetically about this bill. It is lack of 
action. We have seen that from this Liberal government ever 
since it took office: ``We are not going to do anything, no 
changes. We will diddle around a little, change the 
administration, have the appearance on the outside as though we 
are doing something, but everything continues as the status 
quo''.
<P>
	The hon. member said we should not be suggesting the sky is 
falling and let us not be alarmists. Perhaps the sky is not falling 
but I assure the House the foundation is crumbling away and the 
whole building will fall in on itself.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	The government talked about studying. It is becoming almost 
gritting for one to hear the ongoing remarks that we are going to 
study this or investigate that. Right now we are having a 
conference on health but the players are not there. We have 
talked about fish but there are no fish so we are going to study 
that. We are studying peacekeeping and defence yet we have no 
plan. Now we are diddling around with OAS and CPP but we are 
not really coming to grips with the issue. The foundation is still 
crumbling.
<P>
	I wonder how we can study so much and still be so 
unintelligent and not know what to do about the problem.
<P>
	I suggest to the member, rather than lecturing the Reform 
Party about free votes, he look at the seriousness of the situation 
and be concerned about his constituents who may not have OAS 
or CPP because while he is looking for the sky to fall, the 
foundation is crumbling away beneath him.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member would like to respond to the fact that 
we have a younger generation coming up that has no expectation 
whatsoever of reaping any benefits from OAS or from CPP. This 
generation, our generation, has been irresponsible. We have not 
balanced our budgets. We are creating a debt that is going to be 
placed on our children that they will never be able to pay. They 
will not even be able to sustain the social programs that we 
enjoy. That is unconscionable.
<P>
	I hope that the hon. member will become a little alarmed and 
want to change some things to provide a better future for his 
children and his grandchildren.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to get this glass just 
about half full so I can demonstrate something. I say the glass is 
half full.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> It's leaking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> The member from Kindersley-Lloydminster 
wants to insist it is half empty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> It's going down. There is less now than 
there was before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> That is the difference between us. One can put 
a negative spin on anything one wants to. If he is saying to four 
million Canadian seniors that relieving them of the burden of 
those forms every year is diddling, in his term, I hope they heard 
him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> What is the sense of having forums when 
there is going to be no program?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> The member makes the mistake of thinking 
one has the same speech on every piece of legislation. I hear his 
views. I share many of the views he expressed a moment ago in 
his intervention. Of course I share many of his views but it has 
nothing to do with this bill.
<P>
	If he is saying: ``Let's go out and solve the deficit and all you 
older people, you four million, just wait there with your forms 
now. Keep filling them out. We are going to rush out and fix the 
deficit first. We will be back a few years from now and then we 
will help you with your forms''. We can do both. It is not such a 
big deal. Let us give them a few simplified forms. So work with 
me on this, Matilda.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, B.Q.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the hon. member opposite, who talked 
about fire throughout his speech. And speaking of fire, I would 
like to say that the government started the fire, and it is now up 
to the opposition to put it out.
<P>
	My question is very straightforward. Earlier, in referring to 
social security reform, the hon. member mentioned one aspect 
of unemployment insurance reform. My question is about 
unemployment insurance and one specific point on which I 
would appreciate some clarification.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6995"> 6995 </A></B>
<P>
	The government says it will put in place a mechanism to find 
people who are cheating. I have no objection to that. I would, 
however, appreciate a little more information on unemployment 
insurance reform and what it entails. I would appreciate it if 
the hon. member could expand on the role of the RCMP in 
apprehending cheaters. Could we have some more details?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to say to the hon. 
member for Lotbinière that my French is still as bad as ever.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore, for the time being I will speak to him in English 
because I lost the first part of his intervention in French and I 
apologize to him for that. As he well knows, I like to, when I can, 
respond to him in his first language. For clarity, let me do it in 
the other language that I am working on, English.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	If he is talking about the reforms generally, I say to him that 
this certainly is the place to discuss everything, but certainly not 
the agenda item.
<P>
	This agenda item is not talking about UI reform. We are 
talking about a very simple administrative change that would 
make it possible for the commissioner of the RCMP to enforce 
the law. It is simply that. There is nothing very sinister here.
<P>
	We have on our statute books all kinds of examples where 
there is certain access to information for prosecuting alleged 
criminal offences. Therefore there is nothing sinister in this 
legislation so far as that item is concerned. It is a very simple 
administrative provision that would allow the commissioner of 
the RCMP to have access to certain client information, UI client 
information for the purpose of prosecution.
<P>
	If members subscribe to the basic tenet of law and order, then 
I do not think they can argue with the need for the commissioner 
of the RCMP to have access to that kind of information. I do not 
know whether that answers the member's question. I might have 
missed something else. If so, I would be glad to hear from him 
again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I will recognize the hon. 
member for Lotbinière very briefly, because someone else has a 
question as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Thank you, Madam Speaker. When the hon. 
member opposite was spoke earlier, he made a few points about 
unemployment insurance. Since he has already started to 
respond to my comments and talk about unemployment 
insurance, I would appreciate it if he would expand on what he 
was saying. That was it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, I understand my time is just 
about up so I cannot be as expansive as I would like to on this.
<P>
	Yes, I say to my friend from Lotbinière, I have many views on 
unemployment insurance and its application. Some of those 
views do not agree with some of the options laid out in the 
discussion paper which the Minister of Human Resources 
Development put before the public in the last week or so. I will 
have an opportunity to say that as I have already been saying so.
<P>
	The time will come when we will have, as a result of those 
discussions, those public consultations-I have begun the 
process in my own riding and I am sure the member has in his 
because it is going to be a very thorough going review-and 
during the day I will have my say. At the end of the day, based on 
what kind of a package we come up with, I will do whatever the 
other members of the House will do. I will make a decision as to 
whether I will support that package or not.
<P>
	If he wants my views on the issue in more detail I can give 
them to him when I have some more time. However I do not 
believe that one can punish people who through no fault of their 
own are locked into seasonal employment as opposed to longer 
term employment, for example.
<P>
	I do not believe we can have in Canada two classes of citizens. 
We can have all the categories we want but we have to always 
apply the basic rule of fairness to all. If I had more time I would 
be much more specific on that issue. I have some strong views.
<P>
	I have in my riding several thousands of people who drew 
their first cent of UI two years ago. I have people who fished for 
35 years who never drew one cent of UI until two years ago. 
They fished for 11 and a half months a year. They took 
Christmas off and never even bothered to fill in the form even 
though they qualified for a week or two. They went back out 
again in January as they had done for many years.
<P>
	My brief is not for people who have learned to beat the 
system. There are some of those out there. My brief is for those 
who are generally out of work from time to time and need the 
assistance of the program to see them through.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to say, as I have done before, how much I always 
enjoy the speeches of the member for Burin-St. George's. 
However it seems to me he may have moved a little to the right 
of me since I last heard him speak.
<P>
	He talked a fair bit about fire, in calling fire. The member is 
looking a little puzzled but I can see that he is a little more to the 
right than he was the last time I heard him speak. A matter of 
positioning I think, Madam Speaker.
<P>
<B></B>

<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	The member repeatedly talked about the Reform Party crying 
fire. I think he misinterpreted us. We are calling smouldering 
embers that could burst into a flame at any time. I was rather 
hoping he would use his glass of water to douse some of those 
embers but he never did get round to it.
<P>
	The bill we are debating, Bill C-54, is a bill full of what, I 
agree with the member, appear to be pieces of legislative 
housekeeping. Although there are one or two areas that give me 
a little concern, I will deal with those a little bit later in the 
speech.
<P>
	First I would like to remind the House that Bill C-54 amends 
the Old Age Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the 
Children's Special Allowances Act, and the Unemployment 
Insurance Act. Clearly we are dealing with amendments to 
various social programs, programs which cost taxpayers an 
enormous amount of money and some of which are currently 
under review as a consequence of the discussion paper that was 
presented by the minister of human resources.
<P>
	No doubt we will have to make some cuts to the social 
programs in order to gain control of federal spending. In case 
any member doubts the seriousness of the problem I would like 
to remind the House that the current debt stands somewhere in 
the region of $354 billion. This already enormous debt will 
increase by about another $2 million in the time it takes me to 
give this speech.
<P>
	In case some of the members are rushing to check the <I>Hansard</I> 
of October 7, yes, in my speech that day I said that the debt 
would increase by $1 million, but I have twice the allocated time 
today so there will be twice as much quality content for 
government members to absorb. It should not be difficult for 
anyone to see the risk to our social programs posed by this 
enormous debt.
<P>
	On Monday morning of this week I was a guest at Windsor 
Secondary School in my riding. I was invited by a political 
studies teacher, Mr. Tony Kapusta, to speak about life as an MP 
and some of the critical issues that are facing the country today. 
When I asked these grade 11 students to tell me what they 
thought were the really big issues facing Canadians, they 
identified Indian land claims, possible separation of Quebec, an 
out of control immigration and refugee situation, an ineffective 
Young Offenders Act, and justice problems in general. They also 
mentioned the debt and deficit in relation to social programs.
<P>
	I asked these young people, who will actually have to pay off 
this debt-it will probably be $600-$700 billion by the time 
they are out in the work force-how long they thought it took for 
Canada to incur this debt. Their guesses included 100 years, 50 
years. You should have seen the looks of astonishment when 
they found out that it has basically taken only their lifetime, 
something less than 20 years to incur this $534 billion worth of 
debt.
<P>
	It was also a Liberal government in power when this whole 
deficit problem began so perhaps it is fitting punishment that 
many of the same people who were present in that Liberal 
government of the late 1970s will now be forced to face the 
problem of the smouldering embers that I talked about a little 
earlier.
<P>
	The chief offender in fact may have been the present Prime 
Minister who, as the Minister of Finance on budget day, 
November 16, 1978, said: ``Significant reductions in the deficit 
can be expected''. The problem is he did not say when.
<P>
	Now he is quoted in this morning's <I>Financial Post</I> as saying 
that if Canadians will not accept spending cuts in the next 
budget, then the government has no option but to increase taxes. 
The whole country is screaming for cuts to government 
spending and the Prime Minister is still talking about raising 
taxes.
<P>
	It took 20 years to incur $534 billion worth of debt and he is 
still talking about raising taxes. How are we going to pay it off? 
Let us imagine for a moment that we could somehow manage to 
eliminate the deficit this year by cutting $40 billion in spending. 
Then let us say we could somehow manage to cut a further $10 
billion from spending and begin applying it to paying off the 
debt. Allowing for ongoing interest, it would take at least 60 
years to pay off the debt. This debt that we have incurred in less 
than 20 years would not be paid off by our 
great-great-grandchildren. To achieve that would, as I have just 
explained, require us to cut about $50 billion from spending this 
year, $50 billion from a total of about $165 billion or almost 
one-third of the entire federal budget.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The problem is that every day we delay making serious cuts it 
becomes harder and harder to take the first step. Every day takes 
us closer to that time when those smouldering embers burst into 
flames and the interest payments will end up consuming such a 
large percentage of federal revenues that the entire federal 
structure will collapse.
<P>
	What will happen to our social programs then? What will it 
matter about all the housekeeping amendments in Bill C-54 if 
there is no money to pay the benefits?
<P>
	Bill C-54, because it appears to improve the efficiencies of 
the Old Age Security Act, the Canada pension plan, the 
Children's Special Allowances Act and the unemployment act, 
may not in itself be an offensive bill. But the very fact that it 
deals with aspects of social programs raises serious concerns 
about how we can maintain these programs for those who 
genuinely need them before our out of control federal spending 
destroys the entire system.
<P>

<P>
	I heard an NDP member in the House yesterday complaining 
that far too much attention is paid to the deficit. I am astounded 
that there are still members in the House who have not learned 
anything from witnessing the collapse of socialism in Sweden. 
How can they ignore what happened in New Zealand, a country 
that failed to gain control of its debt? When New Zealand 
experienced its debt crisis in 1984 there was a labour 
government in power, the equivalent of the NDP. But all the 
NDP philosophy in the world did not help them when nobody 
would buy their bonds. They had no choice but to cut social 
programs to the bone, to sell off the country's assets, and to 
deregulate unions; no choice regardless of the NDP philosophy.
<P>
	Imagine how the labour, let us say NDP, prime minister of the 
time, the Right Hon. David Lange, must have felt. He had to tell 
the people of New Zealand that there was no free lunch, that they 
had been buying their social programs with borrowed money, 
and that the foreign lenders had decided they were sick of 
picking up the tab.
<P>
	Let me read a recent quote from the Right Hon. David Lange:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There was an enormous revolution in the New Zealand economy. The 
outcome was that in the course of about three years we changed from being a 
country that was run like a Polish shipyard to one which could be internationally 
competitive.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Costs are big. People with privileges were dispossessed of them. They 
crashed. It was tough. But on the other hand there is something fair about a 
society which is transparent in its reward to people who work and which does 
not preserve for those who do not, an inevitable flow of taxpayers' money.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is a key sentence in there from an NDP prime minister. 
Let me read that key sentence again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But on the other hand there is something fair about a society which is 
transparent in its reward to people who work and which does not preserve for 
those who do not an inevitable flow of taxpayers' money.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The message is that people and companies which are cheating 
the system will have to be cast adrift. The regulations that 
permit people to collect benefits when they are earning above 
the average family income must be changed. Our social services 
have to be seen to be transparent and fair, available to those who 
really need them and unavailable to those who have been 
cheating or using the system to their own advantage.
<P>
	It is extremely important that we voluntarily trim our social 
programs so that they are preserved for those who truly need 
them. The alternative could be having to deal with the aftermath 
of a New Zealand style debt crisis.
<P>
	There is a lot of talk in the House too about training programs 
for people who are out of work. The human resources minister 
has been running around saying that these programs are going to 
be part of the new, revised social security system. I think the 
evidence is that government run training programs are on 
average pretty useless.
<P>
	I see grant applications for UI training programs coming 
across my desk on a regular basis, as most members of the House 
must have. I have done a fair bit of in depth analysis of these 
programs. Typically they claim great success in placement, 
sometimes around 80 per cent, but on further investigation I 
have found that often this means that 50 per cent have gone on to 
a further training course that they could not have done without 
the first one. That is considered to be placement when in fact it is 
not a job at all; it is becoming a perpetual student.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The present programs are openly discriminatory. The 
application forms require the training company to fill in a quota 
of women, visible minorities, disabled people and natives. 
Instead of being able to choose the people with the best chance 
of success on the course, the trainers are forced to make racist 
and sexist decisions about who gets to be trained. It is a disgrace 
that the government is openly encouraging racist and 
discriminatory practices in its UI training programs. These 
abhorrent requirements should be removed from the application 
forms immediately so that prospects for training can be selected 
without regard to their ethnic origin, sex or religion.
<P>
	In Vancouver recently I was listening to a radio talk show and 
a president of a local training company called to say that he was 
prepared to train people for existing job opportunities and that 
he would only ask for payment from the UI system when he 
made a successful placement.
<P>
	What an opportunity for the taxpayers. Here is a private 
company that is prepared to risk its own money to select people, 
to train them and then to put them into a job and only ask for 
payment when the job is done. But our present laws do not allow 
for this option.
<P>
	I would have thought the minister would be falling over 
himself to introduce an amendment to Bill C-54 that would 
allow this opportunity. I am very disappointed he has not done 
so. Instead of making meaningful changes to help reduce the 
cost of social programs, he is quietly funding special interest 
groups to lobby his ministry for retention of their own special 
interest program funding. Six days before he presented his 
social services discussion paper in the House, the minister's 
department had already approved lobbying funds to a special 
interest group in my riding.
<P>
	I happen to think this particular group does some pretty good 
work helping disabled people to gain work skills, but I strongly 
object, on behalf of the taxpayers of Canada, to the handing out 
of lobbying funds to organized special interest groups. These
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6998"> 6998 </A></B>
<P>
groups already have the advantage of being organized, with 
research material readily available to them and the ability to 
mount aggressive lobbying campaigns.
<P>
	In a committee meeting on Monday the minister admitted that 
many special interest groups have already completed their 
submissions. How can this be? The people of Canada did not 
even get the chance to see the discussion paper until the first 
week of October. The minister has left us with the impression 
that his favourite special interest groups already knew what 
would be in it and had received special interest funding to ensure 
that they lobby to protect their own special interest programs.
<P>
	How can we believe the minister is serious about social 
program reform when he has apparently already stacked the 
deck in favour of specific groups, forgetting as usual the most 
important single group of people: the workers who pay the taxes 
and who will have to deal with the debt?
<P>
	Ministers of the New Zealand government thought that they 
could play that game too but the game had a finite end. They too 
used to hand out grants and privileges to special interest groups, 
to farmers and to businesses, but it all stopped because they 
failed to address the problem of the debt.
<P>
	An excellent ``W-5'' program on the New Zealand debt 
problem was shown in Canada just over a year ago. In case some 
members of the House did not get the opportunity to see it, I 
have arranged to have it broadcast on the internal House of 
Commons television channel in the near future. I will send 
notice to all members to let them know when it will be shown.
<P>
	However, as an update, I would like members to know that the 
minister of finance for New Zealand rose in the New Zealand 
House about one week ago to make a very important 
announcement regarding the debt. He had made a mistake about 
the budgetary surplus of $600 million predicted for this year. It 
was not going to be $600 million after all; it was going to be a 
surplus of over $700 million. The prediction for next year was 
$2 billion, a surplus of $2 billion, with tax cuts promised for the 
following year. How I long for the day when a minister of 
finance can stand in this House and tell us that there will be tax 
cuts the year after next.
<P>
	Talking about the Minister of Finance reminds me that the 
Canada pension plan is also being amended in Bill C-54. The 
amendments are of a housekeeping nature, but it brings to mind 
that the finance minister has refused to deny that he may 
introduce a tax on RRSPs in the upcoming budget. I am sure 
government members are receiving plenty of letters about it 
because I certainly am.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Many Canadians have done exactly what the government has 
been urging them to do. They have been putting aside money for 
their retirement in RRSP funds. They have put aside these funds 
because they are afraid the present debtload will cause the CPP 
system to totally disappear. Even floating a trial balloon about 
the taxing of RRSP balances is a cruel thing to do, but to refuse 
to deny it is being considered is completely unacceptable.
<P>
	The next RRSP season is due to peak around the time the next 
budget may come down. Unless the minister puts it on record 
that he will not under any circumstances tax RRSPs, he will 
cause a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the investment 
markets and a lot of stress for taxpaying Canadians.
<P>
	While the government refuses to assure Canadians that their 
RRSPs will not be taxed, nothing is being done to bring the gold 
plated MP pension plan into line with the private sector. In the 
next month or so a large group of Liberal MPs will become 
eligible for lifelong pensions after just six years in the role of an 
MP. They will be sidling up to the tax trough for a combined 
total payout of around $53 million. It is a lifelong pension 
collected as soon as they are thrown out of office in the next 
election and fully indexed to inflation in later years.
<P>
	I would like it on the record that I refused to sign the form 
authorizing 11 per cent of my salary to be paid into the MP 
pension fund. Despite this, the 11 per cent is being taken against 
my will, forcing me to bring this topic up regularly until I am 
permitted to opt out of the plan, or it is brought into line with 
plans in the private sector.
<P>
	I am almost out of time. I did want to question some of the 
provisions of Bill C-54. Clauses 9 and 23 of Bill C-54 affect 
clauses 18 and 37 of the OAS act and permit the crown to 
attempt to recover accidental overpayments from more than a 
year ago, provided it would not cause undue hardship.
<P>
	Overpayment is overpayment. I am not sure just because the 
recipient spent the money that there is a reason not to collect it. 
The key perhaps is whether the crown was negligent in 
overpaying and by its actions caused the recipient to believe that 
he or she was receiving the funds legitimately. I hope this area 
will be studied and addressed in committee in order to determine 
the true meaning and purpose of the clauses.
<P>
	Clause 37 amends clause 86(1) of the CPP act and appears to 
make it more difficult for out of country residents to claim travel 
costs in the event of an appeal. I am curious to know how much 
money is expended on such travel claims and hope that one of 
the government members can clarify this point for me. I am all 
in favour of eliminating unnecessary government spending, but 
I wonder if justice is being done by making it financially 
difficult to appeal a ruling, especially if the appeal is successful.
<P>
	Finally, none of us want our children to be deprived of all the 
social services that Bill C-54 addresses. I do hope the 
government will start to address the problems soon.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have to start by asking the Chair whether or not any 
thought was ever given to installing a large gong in the House 
that members could approach and hit.
<P>
	I am absolutely astounded at some of the comments. It is 
irresponsible of the member to create fearmongering about all 
the different things he talked about. I cannot deal with all of 
them in the brief time I have, but I would like to address the 
RRSP question, for instance.
<P>
	The member will know that the federal government had 
commissioned a major report. It was reported in today's <I>Ottawa 
Citizen</I> that the study the finance minister had commissioned 
would not be ready before the next budget. The article fairly 
reflected the fact that there will not be the information available 
for the minister to consider any major changes to RRSPs and 
pensions. There may however be some minor changes that may 
for instance lower the maximum limit one can contribute to an 
RRSP.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The member is somehow suggesting that every time a 
question is asked, will the minister do this, he has to say yes or 
no. That is totally denying the process of discussion with the 
Canadian public which has just commenced.
<P>
	Last evening a roundtable of 20 groups representing 
economic organizations and groups from right across the 
country came before the finance committee to advise on the 
process and ways in which the government could address the 
deficit and the debt. That is consultation which the hon. member 
is denying. He wants answers and decisions right away before 
the consultation has even taken place. He discounts the value of 
communicating and consulting with the Canadian public.
<P>
	Finally I would simply like to say with regard to MP pensions 
that I do not think the member is ever going to find any 
disagreement in this House with the need to reform MP 
pensions. That is coming. Indeed the Prime Minister said in this 
House that MP pension reform will be coming.
<P>
	The government ran on the platform in the red book that 
included the elimination of double dipping and the delay in 
pension receipts until retirement age. With regard to those facts, 
just those two of the many things I could have mentioned, I 
certainly for one would have opted to take the hammer and hit 
the gong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
member has accused me of fearmongering and making 
unacceptable statements. I personally do not consider it 
fearmongering or unacceptable to express the concerns of my 
constituents in this House.
<P>
	I am being showered with letters and phone calls from my 
constituents demanding that this government deny it is going to 
tax their RRSPs. That is not an irresponsible request; it is a 
reasonable request from Canadians.
<P>
	We often joke on this side of the House that question period is 
properly named because we never get answers. The minister has 
a responsibility, studies or no studies, to ensure that RRSPs 
which are the foundation of Canadians' retirement programs are 
not going to be taxed. It is very important that he does so.
<P>
	I stand by the statements I made in my speech. I think the 
member is irresponsible if he does not communicate his 
constituents' concerns about RRSPs also into this House.
<P>
	I would like to mention that he also indirectly accused me of 
fearmongering with respect to the rest of my speech. I would 
like to make the note that although Bill C-54 is fairly thick and 
heavy and full of only minor amendments, it does not help 
whatsoever in reducing this huge deficit problem that we have, 
$40 billion this year.
<P>
	Imagine how many hospitals and roads we could build and 
what we could do to upgrade our armed forces, how much it 
would contribute to reducing child poverty if we had that $40 
billion to spend instead of using it to pay interest on the debt. We 
could build 12 times as much infrastructure as the red ink book 
infrastructure program does in one year, 12 times as much in a 
single year. Vancouver could finally get a freeway capable of 
carrying its traffic.
<P>
	We have to do something about the deficit and the debt 
problem. I stand by every word I made in my speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my hon. colleagues have eloquently shared 
with members of the House many of the details of the 
amendments contained in Bill C-54 and many other items as 
well. However because some hon. members may portray these 
amendments as detrimental to old age security and the Canada 
pension plan and unemployment insurance beneficiaries, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to set the record straight.
<P>
	These amendments arise out of a genuine desire to improve 
the service which the Department of Human Resources 
Development provides its many and varied clients. At the same 
time these amendments enable the Government of Canada to 
pursue other important goals while respecting the rights of its 
clients and those of the taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	One of the amendments contained in Bill C-54 would reduce 
the period that old age security benefits can be paid retroactively 
from five years to one.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	Some will suggest that the government is robbing pensioners 
of their pensions. Really what older Canadian, in fact what not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7000"> 7000 </A></B>
<P>
so old Canadian has not heard of the old  age security pension. It 
is probably one of the best known of all government programs.
<P>
	Everyone knows that we have to be age 65 to get the pension. 
One of the reasons it is so widely known is that it opens doors to 
other entitlements. If you receive the old age security pension 
and have a low income you can qualify for the guaranteed 
income supplement. If your spouse is between 60 and 65 he or 
she can qualify for the spouse's allowance.
<P>
	As well once a person receives the OAS pension they receive 
an OAS identification card. Many seniors use that as proof they 
have reached the so-called golden age and are entitled to 
discounts and special rates that businesses, transportation 
providers and others offer to senior citizens. Let us not forget the 
benefits that many provincial and territorial governments 
provide to low income recipients of the old age security pension.
<P>
	On the other side however some individuals aware of the five 
year retroactivity period may in fact decide to delay application 
for their OAS. Their profit so to speak may be eligibility or 
increased benefits for other provincial or federal benefits 
because they are not receiving the OAS.
<P>
	Further, higher income individuals may look at the five year 
retroactivity period as a means to defer taxes with the so-called 
clawback of the OAS.
<P>
	Given then that the old age security pension is so widely 
known, is one year not a reasonable period during which to 
expect that a senior citizen can make application for benefits or 
have a family member or friend do it on his or her behalf? Indeed 
data from the Department of Human Resources Development 
show that the vast majority of pensioners apply not just on time 
but well in advance of their 65th birthday.
<P>
	Providing a one year retroactivity period is not only 
reasonable, it is consistent with the retroactivity periods of other 
related programs. Even within the OAS legislation guaranteed 
income supplements and spouse's allowance payments can be 
paid retroactively for only one year.
<P>
	As well Canada pension plan benefits which many OAS 
pensioners receive may also be paid retroactively for just one 
year. Indeed the two different retroactivity periods have been a 
source of confusion for CPP and OAS clients and have been very 
difficult to explain.
<P>
	Furthermore the amendment would also include a special 
provision for those individuals who fail to apply because of 
incapacity which could occur because of serious illness. For 
these people the bill would allow unlimited retroactivity back to 
the point that the incapacity began.
<P>
	This approach to retroactivity for OAS benefits is fair and 
reasonable and I am sure hon. members will see it as such. To 
relieve any concerns hon. members may have about this change, 
there will be a grace period until April 1995. This will enable 
anyone over the age of 65 who  may not have applied for their 
OAS pension up to now and who could qualify for more than 12 
months of retroactive payments to apply under the current rules. 
This approach is fair, reasonable and I am sure hon. members 
will see it as such.
<P>
	I would like to turn to another provision which could cause 
concern to those not properly informed. This is the amendment 
to the Old Age Security Act which would remove the existing 
timeframe restrictions for the recovery of overpaid moneys to 
OAS, GIS and spouse's allowance clients.
<P>
	The current legislation allows overpayment benefits to be 
recovered only if they are discovered and recovery is started in a 
very short time after the overpayment is made. The provision 
does not apply in cases of fraud or wilful misrepresentation.
<P>
	However those situations aside, the restrictions of the 
existing provisions mean that each year millions of dollars in 
overpayments must be written off even where the pensioner 
could easily afford to repay the overpaid amount. It is important 
to mention that the act already has provisions allowing 
overpayments to be forgiven if the recovery would cause 
hardship, the amount is small, or there is no reasonable hope of 
repayment.
<P>
	Another proposed provision in this bill would also allow 
overpayments to be forgiven if they occurred as a result of an 
error on the part of the OAS administration. The policy for 
recovery of overpayments also allows for the negotiation of a 
schedule of repayments to ensure that no hardship would occur 
to the pensioner.
<P>
	I should also add that another amendment in the bill would 
allow Revenue Canada information to be used to verify GIS and 
spouse's allowance income statements at an earlier stage in the 
annual process for applying for income supplements. This has 
been the main source of GIS and SPA overpayments.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The taxpayers of Canada expect us to spend their tax dollars 
wisely, but Canadians are also compassionate. This amendment 
would be fair to the taxpayers of Canada while at the same time 
treating pensioners who have been overpaid fairly and 
compassionately.
<P>
	The Department of Human Resources Development is 
required to collect very personal information from its clients in 
order to determine if they are eligible for benefits. The 
responsibility for safeguarding this information has never been 
taken lightly. Indeed, keeping such information privileged has 
been so important to the department that many of its legislative 
provisions have been even more stringent than the Privacy Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7001"> 7001 </A></B>
<P>
	These tight restrictions on the use of CPP, OAS and UI client 
information, while guaranteeing Canadians privacy, have 
prevented justice from being done in one very important 
situation. I am speaking about investigations into war crimes 
and crimes against humanity.
<P>
	The existing provisions of the OAS and CPP legislation allow 
confidential client information to be released only after a 
criminal charge has been laid. With respect to UI that legislation 
prohibits the release of some kinds of client information while 
in other instances the legislation is vague about such release.
<P>
	Often the identity of the individuals who have been identified 
as suspected war criminals cannot be confirmed. This has meant 
that the RCMP has not been able to conclusively establish the 
existence and location in Canada of many of the individuals in 
question and therefore cannot lay charges.
<P>
	The amendments contained in this bill would allow OAS, CPP 
and UI data to be used by specific and very restricted individuals 
within the RCMP for the investigation, prosecution and 
extradition activities undertaken in Canada in relation to war 
crimes and crimes against humanity. This information would be 
used in Canada only. In no instance would confidential client 
information be made available to foreign governments or 
agencies and in no instance would the RCMP have access to 
client information for other than this purpose.
<P>
	The last thing the government wants to do is erode 
individuals' rights to privacy, but this right has been used as a 
cover by those wanting to evade prosecution for unspeakable 
crimes. The Government of Canada and indeed Canadians no 
longer want our right to privacy to be used as a shield by those 
who do not want to be held accountable for crimes they 
committed against humanity. This amendment would help 
ensure that it is not.
<P>
	Finally, there is one more amendment that I want to clarify for 
hon. members. This is an amendment to the Old Age Security 
Act and Canada pension plan that is consequential to an 
amendment being proposed by the Solicitor General. This would 
allow the Department of Human Resources Development to 
provide information on the OAS and CPP benefits being paid to 
pensioners who are incarcerated in federal penal institutions. 
The intention is that these individuals would be charged room 
and board based on their income. This information would allow 
the Solicitor General to receive accurate information from the 
Department of Human Resources Development on the amount of 
these moneys so that a fair charge could be made.
<P>
	Is it right that prisoners receive free room and board at the 
same time that they may be accumulating income from federal 
benefits that may also be paid from the public purse? I do not 
think so and neither do Canadians. Pensioners who are not 
criminals have to pay for their own accommodation and other 
needs. It is only fair and indeed responsible that those of penal 
institutions do the  same, especially when they are receiving 
federal benefits at the same time.
<P>
	In conclusion, I hope these explanations have helped to 
clarify the rationale for a few of the amendments contained in 
Bill C-54 and I give hon. members the information they need to 
be able to explain them to their constituents. It is my distinct 
honour to support this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, B.Q.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I welcome this opportunity today to speak to 
Bill C-54, an Act to amend the Old Age Security Act, the 
Canada Pension Plan, the Chidren's Special Allowances Act and 
the Unemployment Insurance Act, introduced by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development. This legislation contains 
amendments to several acts that are extremely important to the 
economy of Quebec, and to Canada's as well.
<P>
	Furthermore, it gives us an opportunity, as members of the 
Bloc Quebecois, to explain our position on social security 
reform. On several occasions we have made it clear where we 
stand on these programs, and Bill C-54 is another opportunity 
for us to show that we support social programs and that we are 
prepared to defend the interests of those who are affected by this 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	I think it is important to realize, as I said earlier at the 
beginning of my speech, that this bill concerns people who 
receive old age security benefits. This means they are 65 years 
of age and over. People in this age group may be less aware of 
their rights and obligations under this legislation, and they may 
also be more vulnerable than young couples or people in their 
thirties or forties who can find their way through the legislative 
maze. That is something we should not forget.
<P>
	However, in this bill, I am particularly worried about the fact 
that certain government agencies will have access to 
information on beneficiaries. The government already had 
legislation that authorized communication of this information to 
certain agencies, but Bill C-54 has expanded this authority to 
include agencies such as Canada Post, the Correctional Service 
of Canada, the Commissioner of the RCMP, the Minister of 
Justice and the Attorney General, Members of Parliament and 
persons designated by the minister as health care professionals.
<P>
	This authority is very broad. It means giving a large group of 
people access to a very extensive data bank. That is why, at this 
stage, we moved an amendment to ensure that no one will abuse 
this information, bearing in mind that these people are among 
the most vulnerable in our society and that there is always the 
possibility that someone could, not necessarily use the 
information to blackmail them, but use it improperly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7002"> 7002 </A></B>
<P>
	The amendment we are suggesting is very simple. It says that 
we refuse to support the bill on second reading because it does 
not provide for any sanctions under the Criminal Code for 
anyone who discloses personal information on beneficiaries to 
sources not authorized to have access to privileged information.
<P>
	Where I come from, we always say: ``Too strong, will not 
bend''. I think a chapter could be included to really ensure that 
whoever has access to such information will pay careful 
attention to how it will be used.
<P>
	This is what our reasoned amendment is about. I will tell you, 
in my speech, about another reasoned amendment we could have 
tabled but did not. This amendment also deals with an important 
matter.
<P>
	I must say right away that I am not against the bill as a whole. 
On the contrary, I think it contains some valuables clauses and 
principles that will make certain things easier. But we must 
always be very careful with this kind of legislation.
<P>
	Let us look at certain changes together. Some of these set 
limits regarding access to information, as I said earlier. They 
introduce time frames concerning the return of benefits to save 
money. I have no problem with that.
<P>
	Others deal with technicalities concerning benefit repayment. 
They change the appeals system and enable the minister to 
acquire assets. I have a little problem with that, but I will 
address it later on.
<P>
	All in all, the Minister of Human Resources Development saw 
fit-and we are behind him on this- to make the benefit scheme 
and plans for the elderly easier and more flexible. Contrary to 
what the minister claims, as have several other ministers during 
question period, we do not systematically object to any 
government proposal. If he listened more carefully, he would 
realize that we do support some of this government's initiatives, 
as I said earlier.
<P>
	At any rate, before dealing with the bill per se, I think it is 
important, in fact essential, to take a look at the situation of the 
elderly, because it is not quite as rosy as the government seems 
to believe it is.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	I think I should remind the minister of certain figures. For 
example, in 1992, the average income of elderly families was 
$39,439, as compared to approximately $56,000 for other 
families. Also, and more importantly, the average income of the 
single elderly was $18,434, as compared to $25,000 for other 
single individuals. Moreover, some 21 per cent of seniors, or 
625,000 seniors, are considered as low-income earners. While 
this number remains mind-boggling, it must be pointed out that 
it has gone down over the past decade. The number of 
low-income seniors has decreased while it has increased in the 
general population.
<P>
	However, the proportion of low-income people among 
seniors is consistently higher than in the general population. So 
we can see that the situation of seniors deserves special attention 
and compassion going beyond the Canadian finance minister's 
obsession with the deficit, but this can improve with time. 
People in exceptional situations need exceptional, but not 
drastic, solutions.
<P>
	Over the years, the federal government has come up with 
several ways to help seniors. There are the two main programs, 
Old Age Security and the Canada Pension Plan, as well as some 
tax measures such as the guaranteed income supplement, 
spouse's allowance, survivor benefits and disability benefits. 
All these measures are designed to ensure the well-being of 
seniors.
<P>
	It must also be noted that since the Liberals took office, 
Quebec's welfare rolls have swelled up by 30,000, and that the 
Minister of Human Resources Development's social program 
reform will make the situation worse. Employment 
development requires much more than an infrastructure 
program. The thousands of jobs the Liberals boast of creating 
are almost all temporary.
<P>
	Before we scrutinize Bill C-54, it is important to look at the 
tendency shown by the government in its first budget, however 
slim it is. We must remember that the past tells us about the 
future. The measures in the last budget call into question all the 
social programs Canada and Quebec have put in place in the last 
30 years.
<P>
	The last budget sets the tone for the government's direction. 
This little test by the Minister of Finance involves cuts to 
unemployment insurance and, of special concern for seniors, to 
the age credit.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance made the decision to reduce the age 
credit, so that all taxpayers aged 54 and older can claim a tax 
credit amounting to 17 per cent of $3,482 at the federal level and 
20 per cent of $2,200 in Quebec. This credit is non-refundable, 
that is, it can be deducted from taxes payable but the excess 
portion cannot be refunded. Any unused portion can, however, 
be transferred to one's spouse.
<P>
	The combined federal and provincial tax reduction averages 
about $950, while in Quebec the reduction is around $1,050. The 
change brought about by the last budget aims to reduce this 
credit for seniors whose net income is over $25,921. The 
applicable threshold for other credits is based on one's income. 
The amount of that threshold will be indexed according to the 
fraction of the annual consumer price index increase which 
exceeds 3 per cent. As I said earlier, the credit will be reduced by 
an amount equal to 15 per cent of the part of an individual's net 
income which exceeds $25,921. That credit will completely 
disappear when a person's income reaches $49,100.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7003"> 7003 </A></B>
<P>
	These measures raise questions. Does the government 
consider that a senior with an income of $25,000 is a rich 
taxpayer? That measure does not target the rich; once again it 
affects the middle class and, this time, more specifically the 
older people who belong to that group.
<P>
	The feeble attempts to reduce spending are made at the 
expense of the poor, the unemployed, the welfare recipients and 
the middle class. We cannot say it often enough. The more we 
repeat it, the greater the chances the minister will finally 
understand.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The government has difficulty understanding what fairness 
implies. In fact, this government seems to adhere more to the 
notion of unfairness. After all, where is the fairness in this 
double standard whereby, for the 1993 taxation year, old age 
security pensioners whose net incomes exceed $53,215, see 
their pension clawed back at a rate of 15 per cent, which 
gradually increases to the point where the whole pension is 
clawed back for pensioners whose income reaches $83,215?
<P>
	Moreover, in his social policy reform, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development excluded programs for seniors. 
However, the fate of our seniors is sealed in the budget of his 
colleague, the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	On page 41 of the Budget Plan, the minister says that: ``the 
government will[-] release in the coming months a paper 
which will examine the challenges and the opportunities posed 
by Canada's aging society. The paper will examine what the 
aging society will need in terms of services and what, if any, 
changes are required to the public pension system to make it 
financially sustainable''. This leaves the door open to a lot of 
things.
<P>
	He goes on saying: ``The paper will also examine what, if any, 
changes should be made to the tax treatment of contributions to, 
and income buildup in, registered pension, profitsharing, and 
retirement savings plans''.
<P>
	If the Minister of Finance is going to take care of senior 
citizens instead of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, we can conclude that the Liberals are seeing 
senior citizens as economic factors, just like interest rates, 
rather than a productive human resource. And that should worry 
us.
<P>
	Now, as to the bill and its main cost cutting measures, I must 
say that it is comforting to see that the government is trying to 
put some oil in the gears of a very heavy bureaucratic machine. 
These are the positive aspects of the bill, the ones we can agree 
with.
<P>
	It is nice to know that those applying late for their pension 
will be able to get up to a year's worth of payments. That is a 
good thing although, in the case of OAS, this is a reduction from 
five years to one. As well, clients can be forgiven OAS benefit 
overpayments that are the result of an administrative error or 
erroneous advice from department officials. This too, I think, is 
fairer.
<P>
	In addition, the timeframe restriction for the recovery of 
guaranteed income supplement overpayments will be removed. 
I find this a bit dangerous. If the errors were made by civil 
servants and the situation is allowed to drag on for several 
months, several years, this is dangerous for the person at the 
point where the government notices the error and claims its due, 
the overpayment. No limitation is mentioned, however, and this 
needs to be looked into. If I were an older Canadian, this would 
worry me. I would want to ask the department how this would be 
dealt with.
<P>
	In addition, we are told that the government hopes to recover 
1 to 2 million dollars with this measure. The Minister of Human 
Resources Development will also be able to postpone payment 
of benefits pending a review or an appeal. This sets off warning 
bells. It is an opportunity ripe for patronage. What will go on? 
The minister reserves the right to postpone certain payments, 
certain decisions. I do not like things that are not clear and this 
point is not clear.
<P>
	Claimants could thus be deprived of benefits that they need to 
live, and that are often their only source of income during this 
entire period.
<P>
	There are a series of clauses of a somewhat technical and 
administrative nature that I will not dwell on, given that we are 
in agreement. I think that if there are any points on which we do 
not agree and that should be raised immediately, I will do so.
<P>
	First of all, the government is saying that it has reduced the 
period of retroactivity from five years to one in order to increase 
consistency between the Old Age Security and Canada Pension 
Plan programs.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	It must be noted that every time such concern arises, the result 
is a downward adjustment. It boils down to the government 
making even tighter the qualifying conditions for programs for 
the elderly. Therefore, the government will have to explain how 
the existing provisions on old age security benefit overpayment 
do not provide it with adequate protection.
<P>
	As it stands, the act provides that the government may go back 
up to two years. Eliminating this time limit would enable the 
government to recover anything between one and two million 
dollars, as I said earlier. Considering that beneficiaries are 
afforded protection against potential mistakes by civil servants, 
these two provisions seem to be in contradiction. This clause 
would really need to be clarified so as to not generate a conflict 
between citizens 65 and older and the government.
<P>
	I must reiterate in this House that people over 65 years of age 
tend to be less inclined to put up a fight. They may be less 
affluent and more vulnerable in this respect. Perhaps the 
govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7004"> 7004 </A></B>
<P>
ment will take advantage of this situation to claim repayment of 
benefits whenever it feels like it.
<P>
	Moreover, in case of appeal, the minister could defer 
payment. But the minister himself admits that a major portion of 
beneficiaries have no income besides old age security benefits. 
That being so, many beneficiaries could finds themselves in an 
extremely difficult situation when this provision is put into 
application.
<P>
	At the end of the day, while they will not have a substantial 
impact of recipients in general, these provisions nonetheless 
reflect the direction this government has taken since coming to 
power, that is to say, to cut in social programs.
<P>
	I also have reservations about a few other provisions and one, 
in particular, whereby clients required to repay to Revenue 
Canada amounts claimed from old age security using the 
revenue-tested reduction rate will be able avoid repaying by 
asking that benefit payments stop. This should be clarified in the 
bill, to facilitate the interpretation of the act.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that we had moved only one reasoned 
amendment, while we might have moved two. At least, we 
considered the possibility. I think it would have provided the 
government with a great opportunity to include some kind of 
safeguard in this bill. With everything that is now going on in the 
House, with everything that we want to cut-and when I say 
``we'', I mean the government-with everything that the 
government wants to cut, in wide swarths, billions and always in 
the same direction, of course. But there were times when they 
frightened elderly people in Quebec, on several occasions; the 
federal government frightened seniors-In the 1980 
referendum, they said, ``If you vote for sovereignty,'' even 
though that was not the question, ``the PQ and the sovereignists 
will cut your old age pensions''.
<P>
	That was the time for the federal government to put a 
provision in the law, in this law, in Bill C-54, to guarantee this 
income for people in need, to put a clause in the law saying: ``We 
guarantee that you people 65 and over who need your pension 
will have it, whatever cuts are made in social programs; we will 
not cut your family income and we guarantee these old age 
benefits for you''. But no, there is nothing like that in the bill.
<P>
	If I were a senior, I would be worried about that. I would call 
the department to find out what is going on. ``Why do you not 
guarantee this sum of money? We need it. In many cases, it is our 
only source of income''.
<P>
	No, there is nothing.
<P>
	That being said, I think that I have presented enough material 
to show that on the whole, Bill C-54 has some good features, but 
it should be amended to make it more humane, fairer and more 
equitable for everyone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I listened attentively to the member's speech. It is obvious that 
he has looked carefully at the legislation and is speaking well on 
behalf of his constituents.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	I did want to raise a couple of points, however. I would like to 
hear the member's comments because I get the sense that there 
was an indictment that the government was somehow going after 
seniors. This is an unwholesome way to put the issue.
<P>
	As we all know, the finance minister's last budget included a 
clawback in the old age exemption for seniors. That meant that 
once seniors had an income over the $25,000 level it started to 
be reduced until they reached just over $49,000.
<P>
	To help explain the situation or understand the equity of the 
situation the member could have indicated that the clawback 
mechanism that is applied to the old age exemption is exactly 
the same clawback mechanism that is applied to the child tax 
benefit. That is the tax benefit that replaced the family 
allowance system we had for many years. That means people 
with children who made over $25,000 all of a sudden started 
losing that child tax benefit as well. That happened in the prior 
year.
<P>
	What is worse for families with children is that last year they 
also lost the exemption for their children on the income tax 
return. As a father of three, I know how much that cost me as 
well.
<P>
	One thing we have to ask ourselves is that if there is a cut in 
the old age exemption, is that simply an issue to do with seniors? 
I think not. When there are changes to the benefits levels that 
Canada can extend to its citizens, it is not just the people who 
enjoy them today, it is also the people who were hoping to enjoy 
them tomorrow. That means that I will never get an old age 
exemption. I have already lost a child tax benefit that most 
people ahead of me had taken advantage of.
<P>
	All of a sudden we have to consider that any changes in the tax 
structure or in the deductions of the tax credits do not simply 
affect those who are presently benefiting from those benefits but 
also those who are to come later.
<P>
	Last night the finance committee had a round table for some 
six hours with economists from right across the country. If 
members want to hear some draconian measures they should 
listen to some of these economists who, the member might be 
interested to know, were saying across the board cuts of 5 per 
cent or 7 per cent on everything, all programs.
<P>
	Those kinds of things I do not think we will see this 
government embrace. There are certainly major changes that 
have to be made but they have to be done in a way to make 
absolutely sure-I know the member agrees and I know the 
government is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7005"> 7005 </A></B>
<P>
of this view-that those in most need are always taken care of in 
Canada, the best country in the world.
<P>
	I would be interested in the member's comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, I am happy to answer 
that question. I, too, will ask the hon. member a question by 
repeating what he has just told me. With what he heard in 
committee, I wonder who leads in this government. Is it the 
economists, the IMF, the actuaries? Who leads in this 
government and where are they going?
<P>
	Bill C-54 gives me some idea of where they are heading. As I 
said earlier, they are cutting some very wide swarths and starting 
to squeeze old age pensions. This is what they are doing today, 
but what will they do tomorrow? That is why I feel we must be 
wary of this bill. It must really be examined from all angles to 
see what is happening in this department.
<P>
	I am being told: ``The hon. member seems to think that this 
bill attacks seniors or others''. I not only think so, I am sure of it. 
Reducing from five to one year the deadline for claiming 
benefits seniors were previously entitled to is an attack on 
seniors. Second, waiving overpayment requirements is another 
attack on seniors. The government could turn around five years 
later and ask you to repay the $300 and change, plus interest, you 
received every month for five years. I think that seniors have a 
right to be concerned about this bill.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Seniors are also justifiably worried, in my opinion, about the 
fact that several departments would have easy access to 
information. The most serious oversight is that, as I said earlier, 
the bill does not guarantee that people aged 65 and older will get 
their old age pensions.
<P>
	The burden of proof is being reversed. Talking about 
sovereignists and about Quebec, they tell us: ``If you become a 
sovereign country, you will lose your old age pension''. But I am 
telling you that if we stay in Canada-if we decide to stay in 
Canada, but I hope not-seniors may not collect old age 
pensions either and I think it is something they will keep in mind 
when it is time to vote and to really think about this issue.
<P>
	I think I have given the hon. member enough explanations to 
show that Bill C-54 is indeed the beginning of an attack on the 
needy, on those aged 65 and older. That is why we, in the Bloc 
Quebecois, are concerned, why we proposed a minor reasoned 
amendment to at least ensure that the information will be put to 
good use. This is one shortcoming of Bill C-54.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke: Pearson 
International Airport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the issue being debated today is of great interest to this 
government, since it concerns our seniors.
<P>
	Bill C-54 essentially aims to improve services to those who 
benefit from various old age security programs. These include 
basic benefits, spouse's allowances and, of course, the 
guaranteed income supplement. It must be noted that this bill 
does not change the content of those programs.
<P>
	It does not change in any way the amount of the benefits 
received by seniors. The purpose of this legislation is essentially 
to make life easier for the recipients by reducing duplication and 
the paper burden, something we talked about during the last 
election campaign. I was very pleased to hear the Official 
Opposition critic recognize the improvements contained in this 
bill.
<P>
	Like us, the hon. member realizes the importance of 
streamlining as much as possible the procedures and the paper 
work for seniors to be eligible for benefits. The amendments 
tabled today will allow some 1.4 million seniors to receive their 
pensions with a minimum of red tape.
<P>
	This is a very concrete example which confirms the 
government's will to streamline the federal administration and 
make it more accessible for its clientele. The reorganization of 
income security programs is in response to a growing demand 
for government services during this period of budget 
constraints. It is expected that, by the turn of the century, the 
number of Canadians benefitting from the Canada Pension Plan, 
the Old Age Security Pension as well as other income security 
programs will have increased by 40 per cent. During the next 
three years, social security reform will offer new technologies 
and services. The main purpose is to provide an efficient 
response to the needs of Canada's aging population and the 
government's growing number of clients.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	This new approach will make it easier for clients to deal with 
the bureaucracy. In our client-service centres, employees will 
be able to make decisions immediately, thanks to all the 
information that will be available to them. This will obviously 
cut down on the time needed to process applications, and we will 
be able to tell clients the date of their first payment.
<P>
	Furthermore, seniors will be able to communicate 
information changes, including a change of address, by 
telephone, using the touch- tone key pad. In the case of clients 
who prefer more personalized service or do not have a touch 
tone telephone, employees will be available to answer their 
questions without delay.
<P>
	Annually, nearly 1.4 million seniors, the majority of whom 
are women, have to reapply in order to continue to receive their 
guaranteed income supplement and spouse's allowance. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7006"> 7006 </A></B>
<P>
department cannot authorize  payments for the new fiscal year 
until an application for renewal has been filed and approved.
<P>
	Every year in April, as many as 100,000 pensioners do not 
receive their benefits on time for various reasons, either because 
they applied late or because information on their applications 
had to be checked. Since only seniors on low or modest incomes 
are eligible for these benefits, any delay in benefit payments 
may cause problems for the recipients.
<P>
	In the case of many seniors, income amounts hardly change 
from year to year. A substantial proportion of recipients of GIS 
and SPA have no source of income other than their pension. It 
would be possible to simplify the renewal process for a large 
number of pensioners. However, no exceptions can be made 
under the current provisions of the Old Age Security Act. All 
recipients must file a new application every year. From now on, 
however, in the case of certain recipients, the minister will be 
able to waive the obligation to file annual renewals of 
applications for GIS and SPA.
<P>
	The minister could, for instance, waive the requirement for a 
full year. He could also extend payment of a benefit based on 
estimated income until updated information is available from 
Revenue Canada. In this way, there will be no need to interrupt 
payments of GIS and SPA to seniors. Individuals applying for 
the first time would, of course, have to file an application in any 
case.
<P>
	The changes will be implemented gradually in order to 
prevent any disruption for pensioners and to ensure smooth 
management.
<P>
	The present legislation allows the release of confidential 
information to some departments, provided that certain rules are 
adhered to. There is no doubt that the management of senior 
citizens' programs is getting more and more complex. 
Therefore, good management requires that relevant information 
be shared and circulated among departments, but according to a 
given set of rules. For example, if there were better access to 
information, Canada Post could make available to us its 
knowledge of new techniques which would accelerate the 
processing of cheques to clients. However, the present 
provisions on the sharing of information prevent us from buying 
services from Canada Post.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	According to the new provisions, personal information will 
only be made available according to very strict procedures. 
Clearly, as a government, we will continue to protect all 
confidential information on our clients. To that end, the 
legislation contains very strict guidelines on the release of 
information to third parties.
<P>
	We even have special provisions where criminal charges are 
involved. Information will only be made available under certain 
conditions, in this particular case if criminal charges have been 
laid against the person or if the government is under order from a 
court to produce documents.
<P>
	Anyone making available personal information under 
circumstances not covered by the legislation will be guilty of an 
offence. This shows that the government is taking the protection 
of personal information very seriously. Moreover, the 
legislation provides for penalties for every violation of the 
rules.
<P>
	As you can see, the government has been particularly 
attentive to the protection of personal information on our 
clients, which is only natural.
<P>
	I sincerely believe that our opposition colleagues should trust 
the government in this matter. We live in a free and democratic 
society based on a fundamental principle which I respect, 
namely the rule of law.
<P>
	It goes without saying that when lawmakers produce a bill, 
they should leave no room for discretionary powers which too 
often lead to arbitrary decisions. It is therefore very important to 
understand that even though this bill allows for some disclosure 
of information, it seeks first and foremost to protect senior 
citizens. When I say to protect senior citizens, I mean two 
things. First, to protect them against arbitrary decisions and, 
second, to protect them so that they have easier access to 
government services.
<P>
	Indeed, this bill is aimed at making life easier for all senior 
pensioners. I repeat that neither the level of benefits nor the 
eligibility criteria have changed. The benefits these people are 
receiving now have not been touched. All we are doing is 
proceeding with an administrative reorganization in line with 
what I call the new evolutive federalism, a cost-effective 
federalism which tries to forge ahead and eliminate overlapping, 
in co-operation with the various stakeholders, namely the 
provinces, because we keep in mind that the overriding 
preoccupation of every government should be, first and 
foremost, the taxpayers' best interest.
<P>
	I must tell you that in the particular context of this bill, the 
best interest of senior citizens, whom the party I belong to has 
always protected and will continue to do so, is taken into 
account. This bill illustrates the commitment of our party to this 
important segment of our society whom I call our builders. We 
are showing them that we care.
<P>
	We believe that this bill is a fundamental piece of legislation 
and that it will provide senior citizens with the best protection 
possible.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	As a matter of fact, we believe it is the only way to prove our 
gratitude for their great contribution to the well-being of the 
Canadian population as a whole.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying again that, in the past, some 
governments have tried to reduce the deficits at the expense of 
that group in our society. Now, according to the basic principles 
established by the Liberal Party that I represent, I can tell you 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7007"> 7007 </A></B>
<P>
that we will never touch the pensions of our seniors, we will 
never modify those  pensions nor will we ever act in any way to 
reduce their incomes.
<P>
	If there is a reform, I suppose it will affect more directly 
coming generations, people of my generation. Senior citizens 
who now receive benefits from the government, be it pensions or 
others, have earned them with their work. They have worked to 
build this country and it would be immoral to start cutting into 
what we owe them.
<P>
	When I see members of Opposition acting as scarecrows and 
trying to scare those people by telling them that the government 
is trying to reduce the deficit at their expense, I think this is pure 
and effective demagogy. I repeat: We will not touch pensions. 
What we do, we do in the interest of taxpayers. We protect them 
and offer them better access by allowing information to 
circulate more freely.
<P>
	On the other hand, of course, as in any bill allowing the 
release of information, we have established parameters that 
have been examined very closely. Certain parameters will allow 
the release of information if this serves the interest of taxpayers 
and other parameters will forbid such release. Those parameters 
will be rigorously enforced in cases where there is no need to 
release information.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the hon. member on his excellent 
presentation this afternoon. Can he comment on the type of work 
the constituency offices actually do, how the amendments that 
will be brought forward in Bill C-54 will actually help us as 
members of Parliament to provide a more effective and efficient 
service, especially to our retirement constituents? In April we 
received many calls because of changes the retirement 
population has to comply with when filling out these 
applications.
<P>
	If the hon. member could expand on his experience with his 
constituency office, the kind of work he does during that time 
and how these amendments would lend themselves to providing 
a more effective delivery system to our retirement population.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
his question. Of course, providing information is a fundamental 
activity. As the hon. member said, it has an impact at the level of 
our constituency offices. It goes without saying that, when we 
meet seniors in our electoral ridings, their questions are often 
varied and deal with various government departments. Seniors 
may come to us with health problems or problems in their 
dealings with Canada Post, Veterans Affairs or the Department 
of Justice.
<P>
	It is obvious that, with a piece of legislation making 
communications between departments more flexible, where 
authorized to do so by the taxpayers, it will be much easier for us 
to obtain information from  departments for one thing. The work 
of these departments will also be made more efficient by the fact 
that they will not have to access the data bank and request 
permission to have access to the information. Since it will be so 
provided in the legislation, departments that meet the prescribed 
requirements will have access to the information.
<P>
	In concrete terms, this means that the taxpayers are bound to 
come out on top. As I like to point out now and then, our duty is 
indeed to serve the public, and personally, I will be able to serve 
the taxpayers much more effectively, efficiently and quickly.
<P>
	In fact, by raising this question, my colleague puts his finger 
on the core issue of the access to information reform, he touches 
on the whole philosophy underlying this bill, a philosophy 
mainly centred on maximizing the efficiency of the federal 
administration.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I found the member's speech very interesting, 
especially one phrase. The phrase was trust the government. I 
would like to be able to do that. To many degrees we must trust 
the government and in many instances we can trust the 
government.
<P>
	I was particularly impressed with an earlier member opposite 
who seemed to be more in line with what the Reform Party was 
thinking about, taking a position that was consistent with the 
constituents rather than with the party position at that time. For 
a while I was wondering whether he was going to walk across the 
floor or whether he was going to stay where he was. I 
appreciated that.
<P>
	I really want to come back to this member's statement when 
he asked us to trust the government and understand that the 
purpose of the bill was to protect services to make sure that the 
pensioners get their pensions and things of that sort. I certainly 
commend him for doing that.
<P>
	I am very concerned about the future of the pensions that will 
be available for our seniors. Of course we do not want to cut 
their benefits. How does the member opposite intend to make an 
efficient system distribute money that is not there? How is he 
going to guarantee that there will be adequate money for the 
pensions to be paid out? We could have the most efficient system 
in the world. We could build the best car around, but if there is 
no gas for it the car will not go any where.
<P>
	Therefore I ask the member opposite where is the money 
coming from that he says will be available? He says that they 
will not touch the seniors' pensions that are there, particularly 
not those who are getting the benefits now. Does he not realize 
the benefits that are currently being received by pensioners are 
coming out of the contributions that are currently being 
provided? How will he guarantee that will be the case later when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7008"> 7008 </A></B>
<P>
there  will be more people taking benefits than those who are 
contributing to the plan?
<P>
	There is no actuarially significant foundation for the Canada 
pension plan as it is at the present time. Could the hon. member 
explain in a little more detail how he intends to make sure that 
we can trust with confidence the government?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. When we talk about trusting the government, you 
need only take a glance at the opinion polls in Canada to see that 
the Liberal government enjoys the support-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon: </B>I see that it hurts when people tell the truth, but 
the Liberal government has most people's support.
<P>
	Now for the question of where we will get the money to 
continue paying pensions, I said that the Liberal Party is 
committed to protecting seniors and old age pensions and that is 
what we will continue to do. If there is ever a reform, it will be 
for later generations and not for those who today are collecting 
the benefits to which they contributed.
<P>
	We as the Liberal Party and the government are acting 
responsibly. We are making a social choice based on respect for 
those who built this federation.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Basically, I find it quite odious that such a question can be 
raised today. Clearly, the answer depends on a social choice, a 
logical social choice. Of course, if the Reform Party were in 
power, a party which is obviously suffering from the ostrich 
syndrome and all they do is try to make cuts everywhere, society 
would have no services. This government promised something 
in the election campaign and that is what we are doing: to be a 
responsible government which will attack the deficit while 
continuing to meet our obligations and maintain services for 
everyone. I want to tell you that seniors are a priority for us and 
we will respect them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to address Bill C-54, an act to amend the 
Old Age Security Act, the Canada pension plan, Children's 
Special Allowance Act, and the Unemployment Insurance Act. 
While the acts which the bill amends represent a significant 
portion of the federal component of Canada's income support 
system, the amendments are classified as minor administrative 
changes. Bill C-54 seeks to improve administrative efficiency.
<P>
	The Reform Party is supportive of efforts by the government 
to streamline the delivery of services to the public. Any 
streamlining is more than welcome. What Reform members 
would ultimately like to see is an immediate overhaul of the 
programs to ensure long term financial sustainability for 
Canada's entire social security system.
<P>
	The massive debt that has accumulated and the interest 
payments needed to service that debt taken out of every year's 
budget have been increasing yearly. The portion of the federal 
budget pie that goes toward social programs has been shrinking 
as a direct consequence of the federal debt and the 
accompanying interest payments. That is why the Reform Party 
constantly states that the debt is the nation's number one 
problem and is the greatest threat to our social programs.
<P>
	Our position has been misinterpreted, misconstrued and 
misrepresented. We have been portrayed by government and 
those on the left as ogres with axes in our hands, ready and 
willing to swing those axes any time we get near social 
spending. This characterization is grossly unfair.
<P>
	What Reformers have realized and realized over a year ago is 
that if we continue on the road of excess debt and borrowing our 
social programs will by necessity have less and less of the 
federal pie every year. The longer we ignore the debt problem, 
the worse the situation becomes for our social program.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance, in his two-day presentation to the 
finance committee, presented a good analysis of the way in 
which the debt affects our economy, our standard of living, our 
social programs, and it was all for the worst. The minister 
outlined how the debt begins a vicious circle. I would like to 
quote from page 3 of the presentation the minister made on 
Tuesday, ``Creating a Healthy Fiscal Climate'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Interest on the debt is doing more than shackling our finances. It is putting a 
damper on growth and jobs. Lenders looking at our debt demand a premium. 
That means higher interest rates. Higher interest rates dampen consumer 
spending and business investment, hurting potential growth and jobs. That in 
turn reduces the revenue government receives and increases our spending on 
social programs, increasing the pressure on our deficit. Those higher interest 
rates in and of themselves also add to our debt charge as we borrow to pay for 
the higher interest. Those higher levels of debt then put more pressure on 
interest rates to rise. And the vicious circle goes on and on and on.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I commend the minister for attempting to lay aside partisan 
politics in his analysis of the effects of the debt. He can expect 
constructive support and guidance from the Reform Party for 
viable efforts to control the deficit. He can also expect calls 
from this party that his own target of 3 per cent of the GDP, a 
deficit of approximately $25 billion in two years, is simply 
unacceptable. It is also unacceptable by his own analysis of the 
negative effects on the debt. For the sake of long term financial 
sustainability of our social programs the  government should set 
a goal of zero deficit by the end of this Parliament.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="7009"> 7009 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals ran and by many accounts won the election on 
the issue of job creation. Their main proposal was the $6 billion 
infrastructure program intended to simulate job growth in the 
entire economy. The Liberals saw the program as the key to 
restoring hope and dignity to those on government assistance.
<P>
	Reformers on the other hand have consistently put forward the 
view that the best stimulant for job creation and decreased 
government dependence is a serious attack on the deficit and the 
debt. By reducing our deficit we will be setting in motion 
positive effects that will create jobs which will in turn provide 
less demand on some of our social programs.
<P>
	I want to quote the Minister of Finance once more on this 
subject:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Facing up to the debt challenge is the keystone of a responsible economic 
policy. If we fail at that, we will fail at everything else. It is not a question of 
focusing on jobs or the debt. It is question of focusing on both. The debt stands in 
the way of the growth we seek; in a very real way, it limits our economy's ability to 
create jobs. The fact is that we will not get the quality of growth we need to 
generate jobs we want until we gain control of the debt, until we have broken the 
back of the deficit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I must applaud the government on the progress it has made in 
its thinking on this subject. In the first few months of Parliament 
the Reform Party's views on the debt and cutting of spending 
were characterized as letting people starve. Now our views are 
being repeated and strongly emphasized in the process by the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	My point in talking about the debt is trying to explain its 
effect on social spending, the so-called vicious circle I referred 
to earlier. For just as there is a vicious circle for high debt and 
excess borrowing, there is also a good or a positive circle if we 
reduce the debt.
<P>
	The lower the deficit and the debt, the lower the interest rates. 
Lower interest rates mean more consumer spending, business 
investments and increasing growth in jobs. That in turn 
increases employment and decreases reliance on social 
assistance giving people the opportunity and the dignity to 
work. The decreasing reliance on social assistance means less 
pressure on social programs and less pressure on government 
revenues.
<P>
	Cutting the deficit is not an end in itself. It is a means to an 
end. That end is stronger growth, increased employment, 
decreased dependence on government and perhaps, dare I say it, 
lower taxes. However reaching these goals requires cutting 
spending and any real cuts in spending will include cuts in our 
social programs.
<P>
	We in the House should be honest and recognize that the 
present social security reform discussion the minister of human 
resources has started is not only about reform but is also about 
saving money. Unfortunately after a year in the House it is only a 
discussion paper. It would be more preferable to be an action 
plan.
<P>
	The most basic, most effective way the government could 
save money in this area without hurting the most unfortunate in 
our society is to target our social programs toward those in the 
most need. Applying the concept of universality to every social 
program we have simply undermines the long term financial 
sustainability of our social programs.
<P>
	Another basic principle that should be applied to social 
programs is that they should be meant to be temporary measures 
to help those who are down, not permanent measures to create an 
unhealthy dependence on government.
<P>
	In conclusion, the best course of action the government could 
take to ensure the survival of our social safety net is to upgrade 
its deficit reduction targets and to design social programs to 
target those most in need.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to introduce legislation to restore the 
tax on tobacco to the level existing at January 1, 1994, and to apply the revenue 
from the tax on tobacco to health care.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I rise today with varying emotions. 
On one hand it saddens me to have to present this motion, but on 
the other hand, it infuriates me.
<P>
	The motion I am bringing to the House today, a motion to 
restore tobacco taxes back to the level they were in January 1994 
and apply this revenue to health care is something we should not 
need to be discussing here at all. Unfortunately, I have been 
pushed to do this, given the tax rollback that occurred on 
February 8, 1994.
<P>
	The reason for my sadness is that this reduction enacted by the 
government poses the single greatest threat to the health care of 
Canadians in the last 50 years. No legislation will have a more
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7010"> 7010 </A></B>
<P>
detrimental effect on the health of Canadians than anything that 
has gone on in recent history. This is particularly germane to the 
youth of the country.
<P>
	This rollback will cause hundreds of thousands of people to 
take up smoking, half of whom will die of cigarette related 
illnesses such as pancreatic cancer, lung cancer and suffer from 
illnesses such as chronic obstructive lung disease, a disease that 
tears away at the very fibres of somebody's lungs so that if they 
were to walk from where I am to where you are, Madam Speaker, 
they would be severely short of breath and exhausted.
<P>
	We are not even talking about the pain and suffering that is 
endured by the hidden victims of this, the families of the 
patients.
<P>
	Already in the six months after the rollback the sales of 
cigarettes are up 41 per cent. The number of people smoking has 
also increased, especially among youth, going from 23 per cent 
to 27 per cent now. This trend is completely opposite to what 
was going on since 1982 when the tobacco taxes were raised and 
the cost increased.
<P>
	I am chagrined that the standing committee of management 
has decided not to make this motion votable. This issue was 
highly contentious back in February. The vast majority of the 
public opposed it, virtually every health care professional 
vehemently opposed it, and yet the government brought it 
forward.
<P>
	If this motion had been made votable it would have enabled 
members to truly represent the wishes of their constituents and 
vote for this motion which would have such a significant impact 
on the health and welfare of Canadians.
<P>
	Before we look at the reasons for my motion and the 
constructive solutions that I pose, it is wise for us to look at the 
situation that existed in February 1994. Up until that time 
Canada was a leader in the fight against tobacco consumption. 
Interestingly enough, in 1979 virtually half of all 15 to 19 year 
olds smoked. However, because of the increase in taxes on 
cigarettes and the cost, by 1991 this percentage had fallen to 16 
per cent, something of which Canada was justifiably very proud.
<P>
	This rate of reduction was unparalleled in the world. The 
cause of this was cost.
<P>
	It is estimated that had the proportion of tobacco users in 
Canada remained at 1979 levels, there would currently be three 
million more smokers in this country today. All statistics show 
this powerful relationship between price and consumption.
<P>
	As a result of these tax increases, a price differential existed 
between Canada and the United States in the order of $48 a 
carton in Canada to $25 a carton in the United States. This was a 
double-edged sword and the smuggling of contraband cigarettes 
became rampant. Cigarettes were exported legally into the 
United States but were illegally brought back into Canada, 
primarily through the reserves in Quebec. Some contraband was 
brought in through other conduits, private cars and through the 
mail routes, but they were minimal compared to what was 
occurring on the three reserves in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	When analysing the smuggling, it is wise to divide up the 
situation between Quebec and the rest of the country. The 
smuggling that was occurring in Quebec had a profound effect 
on the lives of the people living there. Quebec represents 30 per 
cent of cigarette consumption, 70 per cent in the rest of the 
country. In Quebec one-third of the cigarettes that were 
purchased were purchased legally and two-thirds were 
purchased illegally, a complete reversal to what was occurring 
in the rest of the country.
<P>
	Also at this time a tragedy was occurring. The smuggling was 
occurring right before the noses of our judiciary and our police 
forces. They were directed to look the other way. Why? To avoid 
confrontation, to avoid an Oka situation that nobody wanted. It 
is completely unfair to have a legal situation that looks at the 
law and enforces the law in one area and in another area does 
not.
<P>
	The smuggling not only occurs in contraband cigarettes but 
also involves drugs, liquor and illegal weapons, all of which are 
occurring right now. Getting rid of the smuggling of tobacco 
does not get rid of the smuggling of other contraband.
<P>
	Outside of Quebec and parts of southern Ontario the 
smuggling was minimal. This was the dilemma that we were in. 
How the government reacted was appalling and incurred the 
anguish of many Canadians and every health care professional 
in the country. The reaction had the primary effect of increasing 
legal consumption of cigarettes and decreasing illegal 
consumption of cigarettes, which was worthy, and eliminating 
the smuggling of contraband cigarettes which is to be 
applauded. However there is another way of doing this.
<P>
	They also brought in to eliminate these channels the export 
tax of $8, a pledge to increase enforcement and education 
against smoking, all of which I applaud.
<P>
	Now that we have analysed the situation, let us look at the 
impact that this tobacco rollback had on the financial cost and 
the human cost of Canadians.
<P>
	Let us look at the financial cost first. The loss of revenue to 
the provincial governments is massive. Tax revenues on 
cigarettes are estimated to decrease from $5.5 billion to $2.3 
billion per year, a loss of $3 billion outside of Quebec. In 
Quebec tax revenues will decrease from $774 million to $559 
million per year, roughly a $210 million decrease. The total loss 
in revenue to the public purse is $3.2 billion. The loss to gross 
national product is very difficult to quantify but in my province 
of
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7011"> 7011 </A></B>
<P>
British Columbia it is estimated that if the decreases go ahead 
that it will cost $150 million per year.
<P>
	Let us look at the human cost, something impossible for us to 
quantify. For every 10 per cent decrease in cost the overall cost 
in consumption is between 4 and 9 per cent for the general 
public. In youth and teenagers the major factor in determining 
consumption is cost. It results in a 14 per cent increase in 
consumption for every 10 per cent decrease in cost.
<P>
	Thus we can see that the tax rollback has had a devastating 
effect on the health of Canadians, particularly in that group 
which is most vulnerable, the youth.
<P>
	As I said in my opening statement, this has already been borne 
out. By the most conservative of estimates a 50 per cent decrease 
in price will result in a national increase of 14 per cent in 
consumption but in teenagers this increase is 35 per cent which 
translates into 840,000 smokers, 175,000 of which are 
teenagers.
<P>
	Let us look at a more realistic view. It is a more chilling view. 
A 50 per cent decrease in cost will result in a 45 per cent increase 
in consumption which is close to the 41 per cent I originally 
mentioned. This is going to add 1.8 million more smokers to the 
list, of which 250,000 are teenagers. This great effect of 
consumption will not be in the areas where smuggling was 
maximal but in areas where it will be minimal. Tragically for the 
people who live in Quebec and for those in southern Ontario, the 
effect has already been felt because they have been consuming 
cheap cigarettes for a while.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	The World Health Organization recently estimated, after long 
study, that 50 per cent of all smokers will die as a result of 
tobacco consumption. It kills in at least 24 ways. Each smoker 
will get 20 years knocked off their life expectancy.
<P>
	To put it in more graphic terms, it will result in many times 
more deaths than all the people who died in World War I and 
World War II combined.
<P>
	The increase in health costs are staggering. Smokers currently 
cost the health care system approximately $9.5 billion a year. 
The increase in consumption will result in an increase in health 
care costs of between $1.3 and $3 billion every year. Our health 
care system does not need this at all, it is in desperate need of 
funding currently.
<P>
	The combined increase in health care costs and loss of 
revenue is between $4 and $6 billion per year to the Canadian 
taxpayer. This does not include the costs we are going to suffer 
in our loss of gross national product.
<P>
	The Minister of Health stated that she wants Canada to 
exchange and share her expertise with other countries in an 
effort to decrease smoking. Madam Speaker, I hope not. I hope 
we do not do this. What she wishes to share is an increase in 
human suffering, an increase in death, an increase in deficits. I 
hope no country in the world learns those lessons.
<P>
	The minister also stated that she would do anything to save 
even one life from the results of tobacco consumption, and in 
particular the youth. If this is true, then I have some constructive 
solutions.
<P>
	First, continue with the $8 export tax. It was a very worthy 
move. It has proven it works. We have an example. In February 
1992 the then government instituted an export tax of $8 per 
carton, the same as was instituted by this government. In four 
weeks it decreased the smuggling of contraband cigarettes by 60 
per cent. It is important to remember this figure.
<P>
	Second, enforce the law. Do not allow the law to be applied 
differently in different areas. We have one law in this country. 
To apply it differently in different areas is a travesty of the law. 
We must all bear in mind that the smuggling conduits that exist 
involve other contraband, not only cigarettes. The only way to 
address the smuggling is to enforce the law. This is imperative.
<P>
	Also, nobody speaks about the law-abiding citizens who live 
on the reserves. What about the effects the illegal activities 
through the smuggling of contraband has on their lives? Why 
should we apply the law any differently for them than we apply it 
to people outside the reserves?
<P>
	These two efforts by themselves will have a dramatic impact 
on smuggling. As I said before, the export tax alone had a 
dramatic effect. There is no need to produce these tax rollbacks 
that are going to have such a devastating effect on the health of 
Canadians.
<P>
	In order to decrease consumption, particularly among 
teenagers, it is imperative that we bring the cost of cigarettes 
back up to where it was. As I have said before, this is the number 
one factor in consumption. If we do what I said before, then we 
would be honestly imparting knowledge to other countries of 
which we can truly be proud.
<P>
	The current rollback in taxes is a large blight on the country's 
health care system. The other aspect of my motion is to utilize 
the funds from the taxes to apply to a health care system, a 
system that is in critical shape and needs emergency care.
<P>
	Our current health care system is caught between a rock and a 
hard place. On the one hand we have an increasing demand from 
an aging population and more expensive technologies, on the 
other hand we have a system of decreasing funding and 
squeezing an increasing deficit. If we manage to go ahead and 
apply this money to our health care system we would be able to 
give it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7012"> 7012 </A></B>
<P>
an injection of capital that the health care of the people of this 
country desperately need. Right now the provinces  are forced to 
engage in the deplorable concept of rationing. They are 
rationing essential health care services-bypass surgery, hip 
operations, the closure of hospital beds. All these things are 
occurring and are compromising the health care of Canadians. 
This past week the head of the Heart Institute here in Ottawa said 
that the waiting time for bypass surgery is now five months.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	If one needs a new hip in this country and are in severe pain, 
that category of people who are in severe pain, 40 per cent of 
those individuals will wait at least 13 months to get their hip 
operation after spending that time in severe pain, a travesty in a 
country that is as affluent as ours.
<P>
	Another benefit of raising the taxes on cigarettes is that the 
moneys can be applied to a public anti-smoking campaign. I 
advise this government that the greatest impact that it will have 
on youth is between applying those moneys to an anti-smoking 
campaign for them between the ages of eight and seventeen, the 
age at which 90 per cent of the individuals who smoke take up 
this habit, a habit that is the second most addictive one that we 
know, more addictive than heroine.
<P>
	To that end I would like to briefly give members a testimonial 
from a 13-year old girl who wrote a letter that was actually 
published in <I>Newsweek</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Right now I am 13 and I am going into ninth grade and started smoking in the 
sixth. The first cigarette that I ever had was in fifth grade.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have tried to quit, but it is very hard when all my friends smoke, too.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some people think that Joe Camel is directed towards teenagers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She is referring to advertisements.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I do not think so. If they are trying to get it directed towards teenagers, they 
are doing a pretty bad job. I am sorry, but a goofy looking camel who smokes his 
brains out does not quite turn me on. Actually, I have never seen an ad that made 
me want to smoke a particular brand. All those cigarette ads are practically the 
same.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She is 13. On health she says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since I have started smoking I can hardly run around the block without 
getting out of breath. A lot of my friends have gotten asthma. My mom and dad 
quit smoking about 14 years ago, and my mom now has cancer and my dad has 
had three heart attacks. My grandma quit eight years ago, and she has 
emphysema. Not only that-my two grandfathers died from the results of 
smoking. After all these problems, you would think I would know better than to 
smoke. But I guess I do not.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I cannot tell that I smell when I smoke, but my parents and other can. I 
remember one time, before I smoked, I left my jacket at my friend Brynn's 
House. Her whole family smoked. I got the jacket back around five months later, 
and I had to throw it away because it smelled like an ashtray.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is funny, but I think it is easier to give up drugs than cigarettes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I really hate the thought of quitting. But yet, I do not want to do anything that 
might make cigarettes more expensive to buy. You see, I am really hooked on 
cigarettes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would suggest that the government does not emphasize its 
advertisements on showing a group of yuppy Rosedale teenagers 
playing basketball and turning into cigarettes. Rather, we have 
to face the facts that teenagers believe they are immortal. There 
is another way of dealing with this. It will not work to tell them 
that they are going to die of lung cancer or mouth cancer 40 
years from now because they believe they are immortal.
<P>
	I feel it would be far more potent to threaten their sense of 
narcissism. Tell them that their breath smells foul. Tell them that 
their hair smells foul and tell them that their skin will become 
pallid.
<P>
	In conclusion, I hope that this government which promised to 
bring back the taxes to where they were and has not made any 
efforts whatsoever to do this will take it in its heart to look at the 
facts.
<P>
	Smuggling is under control. It can continue to be under 
control with the export tax and enforcement. It needs to apply 
those taxes to the health care and welfare of Canadians. One 
does not need to keep a tax rollback and compromise the health 
and welfare of the people of this country and sacrifice 
smuggling as a result. One can do both without sacrificing the 
health care of Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, considering the success of the government's 
anti-smuggling policy, I would never have expected to hear 
comments like those the hon. member made today. I admit-in 
fact, I am proud of it-that I was one of those who pushed for 
lower tobacco taxes.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	As you know, I have the honour and the privilege of 
representing the riding of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and 
the Akwesasne Native community. It is indeed an honour and a 
privilege as I have great respect for my constituents living on the 
reserve.
<P>
	I am arguing today against raising the taxes on tobacco, and 
not because I want cheap cigarettes for myself or my family. 
Three years ago, I lost my father to a type of cancer believed to 
be caused by smoking. I do not smoke and smoking is prohibited 
in my offices. Smoking was prohibited in my offices before it 
was banned elsewhere on Parliament Hill. That is not the point.
<P>
	Here in the House of Commons, I raised questions on 
numerous occasions about the cigarette smuggling problem. I 
remember that, in June 1993, I asked then Solicitor General 
Doug 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7013"> 7013 </A></B>
<P>
Lewis-I think it was the last question raised in the House 
before it adjourned prior to the election-to do something about 
this problem which was almost out of control in our region. The 
problem was going from bad to worse.
<P>
	This is the question that I raised, which I will repeat for you 
and for all my colleagues: ``Almost every night machine gun fire 
is heard and speedboats are running the rivers at full speed in the 
dark with their lights turned off pursuing criminal activity. I am 
not describing life in Sarajevo or Mogadishu. I am describing 
the practice of tobacco smuggling on the St. Lawrence River 
near Glengarry in my riding. I want to ask a question to the 
Solicitor General on the last day of this Parliament. What 
precisely does the government intend to do to stop this illegal 
activity which endangers the lives and safety of my 
constituents?''
<P>
	That was the last question raised, not the first one. For years I 
had been asking the government to take action to put a stop to 
this illegal activity. Nothing was done at the time. The 
government of the day let the situation deteriorate to the point 
where in Quebec and in eastern Ontario-the problem did not 
only exist in Quebec; in fact, most of the Akwesasne reserve is 
located in Ontario-70 to 75 per cent of cigarettes on the market 
were smuggled. The level of illegal activity was such that it 
endangered the lives of my constituents. In fact, some of them 
were killed. The member opposite talks about saving lives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to read a little story written by Claude McIntosh, 
the associate editor of the <I>Standard-Freeholder</I> of Cornwall, 
from Saturday, July 3, 1993. He was describing what he referred 
to as the dark side of cigarette smuggling. He recalls a few 
incidents. Here are a few I would like to share:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Cornwall welfare recipient switched to a supplier selling cartons $1 
cheaper than his previous supplier. His old supplier fearful of losing other 
accounts paid him a visit. During the conversation he had his arm broken in an 
accident. He went back to the previous supplier. Welfare recipients are sought 
out because they are one, more willing to take the chance and two, available day 
and night.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Here is another incident. A teacher ordered a disruptive 
student out of the classroom. On his way out the student reached 
into his pocket, pulled out a wad of bills and sneered: ``I do not 
need your education''. The student works as a runner in one of 
the cigarette smuggling cartels with potential to earn more in six 
months than the teacher earns in one year. He earns bonuses for 
recruiting other students.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Did you report him?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> If the member had been listening, paying a bit 
of attention, I was reading from a newspaper article.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Why did anybody not report him?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The member across who just made this remark 
should know this is no laughing matter. We had all the police 
officers we could round up trying to enforce the law on the St. 
Lawrence River in a forested area at night.
<P>
	This business got so lucrative during one period that they 
were actually crossing shipments into Canada by helicopter. It 
got to be that bad. We have a border between Canada and the 
United States four thousand miles long. One day I was raising 
this problem with members across who asked why the military 
was not brought in. Is it the position of the Reform Party, or was 
it at that time, to have a militarized border four thousand miles 
long between Canada and the United States?
<P>
	I am told by people in the know that drug smugglers and 
others have got out of that business. There was a lot more money 
to be made in cigarettes. That is where the real money was. That 
is the situation we had.
<P>
	I have a report prepared by a forensic and investigative 
accounting firm known as Lindquist Avey Macdonald 
Baskerville. That accounting firm had on its staff none other 
than Rod Stamler, former deputy commissioner of the RCMP, no 
fool by anyone's account. He described to us how severe this 
problem was. We had the commissioner of the RCMP give a 
letter to the Prime Minister which was tabled in this House that 
said the way to control the crime was reduced to that and only 
that solution.
<P>
	I had been saying it to the previous government for years. The 
previous government would not listen. This Prime Minister, 
within weeks of seeing the danger to the lives of Canadians and 
the damage it was doing to Canadian society to see this kind of 
disrespect for law, took action. I congratulate him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Now it is going to kill 
teenagers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> If I get nothing else from my riding in all the 
years I will be an MP, and I hope that is another long time, I will 
be happy because at least I was able to do this. At least I was able 
to do the right thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> You transferred the 
problem to teenagers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I did not transfer anything or pass off anything 
to anyone else.
<P>
	The members across say they stand for law and order yet they 
know and the police have told us that was the only possible 
action we could have taken, and it was the right action.
<P>
	They say they are against increasing taxes. The leader of the 
Reform Party stood here yesterday and asked for a commitment 
not to increase taxes. Today in the dark hours of the day when 
few reporters are listening we have a private member's bill from 
a member of the same caucus advocating an increase in taxes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7014"> 7014 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> That is a cheap shot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It is not a cheap shot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> It is a cheap 
shot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I do not care if the members think it is cheap or 
not, this is an important issue. It affects the lives and safety of 
many Canadians, including my constituents.
<P>
	I want to say one final thing in the moment or two that is left 
about respect for law. If it is cheap cigarettes that we wanted to 
keep off the market, cheap cigarettes were there. They were 
there and they were sold in schools. It was easier to get illegal 
cigarettes than legal ones with the contraband that we had. That 
was the reality.
<P>
	Finally, what kind of message were we giving to young people 
in Canada when we were tolerating in society a situation in 
which the smuggler in the school drove the Corvette while the 
kids who were obeying the law were walking? That was the 
situation we had. That was the kind of crime we had and $2 
billion a year was made by the underworld in this country. That 
is what this government was able to stop by its action. I am 
proud of what it did. Consumption of cigarettes has not 
increased. On August 18, 1994 the Minister of Health tabled a 
report. It said quite clearly that smoking had remained flat 
overall and had not increased. That is the truth. That is the 
reality. The action taken was the right and proper one.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, B.Q.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan 
de Fuca, who argued his case so eloquently. I must say that the 
question of restoring the tax on tobacco to the level that existed 
on January 1, 1994 is a difficult subject. I will consider two 
aspects of this question.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to recall, as did the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, the situation that existed when 
the tax was abolished. The hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de 
Fuca mentioned the fact that the price of a carton of cigarettes in 
Canada was up to $48, twenty dollars more than in the United 
States. The result was a brisk trade in contraband cigarettes. The 
hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell referred to the 
impact of cigarette smuggling in Eastern Ontario and the 
Montreal region.
<P>
	However, its impact was also felt in regions assumed to be 
safe, including my own region, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, 
which is 300 kilometres from the U.S. border. We had never had 
a problem with cigarette smuggling.
<P>
	During the last six months or year the tax was in effect, we 
started seeing contraband cigarettes in the region. At meetings I 
saw honest people take out packs of cigarettes marked with the 
insignia of the U.S. surgeon general,  which meant they were 
contraband U.S. cigarettes. I saw this at meetings of normally 
law-abiding citizens who do not deal with smuggling rings of 
any kind.
<P>
	These people took out their packs of cigarettes without a care 
in the world and thought nothing of it. It had reached the point 
where honest citizens did not realize they were breaking the law, 
because as I see it, that is what they were doing. There are taxes 
which are levied to provide services. At the time we had a 
situation where honest citizens felt they could break the law. It 
was a very bad situation.
<P>
	In fact, a cigarette smuggler in my region was interviewed. Of 
course, it was all anonymous. You only saw his profile, and you 
could hardly recognize him. This guy boasted that he made one 
million dollars in eight months by hauling truck-load after 
truck-load of cigarettes into an area 300 kilometres from the 
border. The situation was truly disgraceful.
<P>
	But even worse, while this cigarette smuggling network was 
spreading to my own riding, alcohol smuggling networks, 
clothes smuggling networks, even jewellery smuggling 
networks were sprouting. In other words, a number of products 
which, in the past, had never been smuggled, were becoming fair 
game for smugglers, and this, in an area like mine which is 
considered too far from the borders and where smuggling is 
rather unusual.
<P>
	I think it was time that Canada took steps to curb this 
smuggling.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Of course my colleague from Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
was instrumental in this, but you will recall that, for weeks, the 
Bloc Quebecois had been asking the government to roll back 
taxes on cigarettes because we believed that it was the only way 
to go. We had tried to bring this plague under control. My 
colleague described very accurately all the efforts which were 
made. We had reached the point where we were thinking of 
bringing in the army. When you find yourself in this kind of 
situation, you must realize that you have made a mistake, that 
taxes are too high, that it is too enticing, too tempting for 
everybody.
<P>
	As was normal under these circumstances, we lowered taxes 
on tobacco. And in so doing, we removed much of the cancer 
that smuggling is.
<P>
	At the same time, we perhaps avoided another cancer, the one 
that occurs when citizens start to think that they do not have to 
follow the rules and to abide by the tax laws. If one can stop 
paying taxes on tobacco and get away with it, why would one 
pay taxes on clothing, gas or anything else? Measures had to be 
taken, I think. And the measures that were taken were adequate.
<P>
	Of course, this did not solve the tobacco problem. As my 
colleague for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca rightly said, this is a 
huge problem in our society. To me, tobacco is a hard drug. I 
have friends who have tried to quit smoking but without success. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7015"> 7015 </A></B>
<P>
It probably is as difficult as getting rid of other drugs that are 
illegal in Canada.
<P>
	Nevertheless, we came to a point where we had to choose 
between two evils. I think that, under the circumstances, we 
temporarily chose the lesser of the two. It does not mean that 
taxes on cigarettes will be abolished forever. It does not mean 
that they will not be raised some time in the future-and I think 
that the Minister of Finance will keep an eye on the situation. I 
believe that taxes will be raised again, but they will be kept 
within reasonable limits so that the high price of cigarettes does 
not become, for some people, an illegal means of making a quick 
buck.
<P>
	That does not prevent us, however, from paying particular 
attention to the growing problem of cigarette smoking.
<P>
	Like the hon. member, I have also seen young men and women 
of 15, 16 or 17-I taught in high schools for years and I was 
stunned to see young 16-and 17-year olds develop a smoking 
habit. In spite of all the information campaigns and all the 
pressing requests made, these young people started or continued 
to smoke. Why? Is it simply a matter of being informed? Let us 
just say that I am less affirmative than the hon. member; I do not 
know what the solution is. I do not know exactly what to do to 
keep our young people from smoking.
<P>
	I know the situation is very serious and the description made 
by the member was truly frightening. He may be right in a sense, 
but then should we prohibit cigarette smoking the same as 
cannabis, marijuana, cocaine and all these other drugs? I do not 
think this is possible in a society like ours. I think we will have 
to compromise; we will have to pursue our efforts to create an 
awareness and convince young people not to develop this habit. 
It is important to do so.
<P>
	I regret to say that I will not support this motion. I believe it is 
motivated by good intentions. However, under the 
circumstances and given the situation that prevailed in recent 
years, it was necessary to greatly reduce taxes on tobacco.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak in favour of this 
motion tonight, a motion that was brought forward by my hon. 
friend and colleague from Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	Members of this House will remember our debates on Bill 
C-11 and Bill C-32 when we warned the government of the 
serious health consequences and the human suffering this tax 
reduction on cigarettes would cost. This motion would correct 
the government's major mistake and would restore that tax on 
tobacco to the level existing as of January 1 of this year.
<P>
	Our concerns about the government's tax reduction on 
cigarettes were confirmed when the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Health appeared before the Standing Committee 
on Finance on June 7 and advised that the government's goal was 
``to reduce the demand for tobacco, the number one cause of 
preventable death in Canada''. She went on to say: ``The 
government fully recognized that the action plan to combat 
smuggling and the tax measures associated with it would pose 
health risks''. That is from a government member, despite what I 
hear from across the floor today.
<P>
	It is inconceivable to me and most Reformers how 
government can rationalize its goal of preventing death with its 
actions which will increase smoking and cause many hundreds 
of deaths.
<P>
	This government does not seem to have the courage or the 
intestinal fortitude to do what is right. We were opposed to the 
tax reduction on cigarettes and tobacco products because it will 
increase smoking and that cannot be denied, particularly among 
young people. As a result it will increase health costs.
<P>
	Reformers find it amazing that the government caved in to the 
criminal element of society so quickly. It sends the wrong signal 
to those who would break the law. In effect the Liberal 
government said: ``If you defy the law we will change the law 
rather than enforce it''.
<P>
	Reformers find it hard to believe that the government did not 
take a more reasonable approach and impose an effective export 
tax and increase enforcement in the areas where the majority of 
smuggling was occurring.
<P>
	Even the commissioner of the RCMP confirmed in February 
that 70 per cent of the contraband tobacco was coming through 
the three Mohawk reserves between Cornwall and Montreal. 
Therefore all this we hear about big borders is simply a 
smoke-screen. If that was where the problem was, why not have 
the courage to enforce the laws of Canada? What are we doing 
now when the criminal element redirects its smuggling 
activities to alcohol, drugs and guns? Are we going to simply 
change the law on that as well? One bad decision leads to more 
problems and not solutions. The government has not solved a 
thing by what it has done.
<P>
	The main point I would like to make today is in regard to the 
government's disregard for the health of the Canadian people, 
particularly young people. When the government first 
introduced its national action campaign to combat smuggling in 
February, we asked the government to tell us what the increased 
health costs would be. How many people will start smoking as a 
result of the tax reduction? How many Canadians will become 
addicted? How many people will get lung cancer and 
emphysema, heart disease and strokes? How many people will 
suffer or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7016"> 7016 </A></B>
<P>
die as a result of the government's tax reduction? How much 
will it cost the Canadian taxpayer? The government 
implemented Bill C-32 despite not having the answers to these 
very important questions.
<P>
	While the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health 
has made it clear that the tax reduction would pose increased 
health risks, these risks, the costs and the implications for 
government and the human suffering have not been quantified. 
Months have gone by with no action by the Liberals.
<P>
	The Canadian Cancer Society asked the Standing Committee 
on Finance to complete a thorough evaluation of the health costs 
and implications of smoking in Canada because such an 
evaluation has not been done since 1986. Reformers find this 
appalling.
<P>
	During debate on Bill C-32 the members of the finance 
committee listened politely to witness after witness warning 
them of the serious health consequences. The committee 
ignored the dozens of excellent recommendations and passed 
the clause by clause study of Bill C-32 in less than 15 seconds. 
The clause by clause review of a 62 page bill was done in less 
than 15 seconds. This is democracy? Is it any wonder that 
Reformers are pushing for a triple E Senate where we can give 
some serious and thoughtful sober second thought to the 
reasoned amendments that we proposed and debated very 
intelligently?
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	What will the increased health costs be? The Canadian Cancer 
Society provided the Standing Committee on Finance with some 
of the estimates prepared by Professor Robert Allen from the 
department of economics at Harvard University.
<P>
	Using Professor Allen's most conservative estimates, he 
predicted that national cigarette consumption would rise by 14 
per cent among adults and 35 per cent among young people. Now 
we find those estimates were very conservative. Actual 
increases have been 41 per cent, as has been mentioned by my 
colleague. The tax reduction implemented by the Liberals will 
increase the total number of tobacco users in Canada by 
840,000. Of this number 175,000 would be teenagers. At this 
rate Professor Allen predicted health costs would rise in the long 
term by $1.33 billion per year. That was the most conservative 
estimate.
<P>
	Every piece of literature that comes out on this shows there is 
an increase. How can the government close its eyes and be blind 
to what is happening? These are Professor Allen's most 
conservative estimates, as I have said. It could be even higher. It 
could be as high as 1.89 million new smokers and of these 
245,000 would be young people. That would mean $3 billion in 
increased health care costs, $3 billion, three thousand millions.
<P>
	Still the government fails to even tell Canadians what the 
impact will be. It refuses to even conduct its own evaluation of 
health costs and implications, ignoring the health of Canadians. 
Liberals love to do studies; they love to have commissions. They 
like to have all of these consultants tell them things, but when it 
comes to this issue they close their ears.
<P>
	During our debate on Bill C-32 we asked the government for a 
timetable showing when tobacco taxes will start to go up again. 
None was given. The government acknowledged the dramatic 
effect that high taxes have on tobacco consumption. It 
acknowledged that the health promotion surtax will end in three 
years, but it still has not told Canadians what it plans to do at the 
end of three years.
<P>
	During the previous debate we asked the government to make 
a commitment to raise prices to their level prior to February 8, 
1994 at the end of the three years when the health promotion 
surtax is renewed. Reformers proposed such an amendment, but 
we were told that only the minister could make such an 
amendment. The minister chose to ignore this reasonable 
proposal.
<P>
	If the government will not support my hon. friend's motion, 
Reformers respectfully request that the minister introduce a new 
bill clearly telling Canadians when tobacco taxes will be 
increased. For the sake of the health of all Canadians, for the 
sake of all those young people who will take up smoking as a 
direct result of government's actions, will the government tell 
Canadians today this is not a permanent tax reduction? Will the 
government tell Canadians that their health is of more concern 
to it than the interests of a few smugglers in the tobacco 
industry?
<P>
	Government ministers are always accusing us of never telling 
them what to do. They yell and they shout at us like we do not 
have a plan, but our blue book has been around a lot longer than 
their red book.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member's time 
has expired. The hon. member for Essex-Windsor and 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I must rise today 
to oppose Motion No. 288 before us. While I appreciate the 
concern for Canadian health that motivates the hon. member, I 
cannot agree this is the time for the backward steps he is 
proposing. It is quite the opposite.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	I feel there are very good reasons why the federal government 
should maintain the current level of federal tobacco taxes. Just 
as important, the government should also adhere to the general 
practice of avoiding earmarked taxes. Let me explain why I 
believe this to be true.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall that just nine months ago we were 
besieged by the black market sale of tax free exports of 
Canadian cigarettes which were being smuggled back into 
Canada. Indeed, contraband tobacco products which often sold 
for less than half the price of legal sales were accounting for an 
estimated 40 per cent share of Canada's $12.4 billion tobacco 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7017"> 7017 </A></B>
<P>
market. The country was confronted with a very serious 
problem.
<P>
	Tobacco smuggling was fostering disrespect for our laws and 
creating serious law enforcement problems. Organized crime 
networks controlled 95 per cent of the tobacco smuggling. Their 
tobacco profits helped to fund other illegal activities, including 
drugs, alcohol and firearms smuggling. Cheap contraband 
cigarettes were readily available to young Canadians and the 
problems of smuggling and the attitude of too many Canadians 
that avoiding tobacco taxes was a sort of game may well have 
added to the tobacco's appeal to impressionable youngsters.
<P>
	The consequences were serious. It was undermining the 
government's health policy objective to reduce tobacco 
consumption, particularly among youth. As well, many 
law-abiding merchants were being pushed out of business by the 
underground sales.
<P>
	I want to inform the House that the federal and provincial 
governments were also being deprived of the tobacco tax 
revenues, $1 billion for each level of government in 1993, that 
helped to pay for government services and programs that 
Canadians expect.
<P>
	To combat this illegal activity, on February 8, 1994 the Prime 
Minister introduced the action plan on smuggling. That plan 
includes an enforcement crackdown, reduced taxes on tobacco 
products, measures affecting tobacco manufacturers and a 
health promotion surtax on tobacco manufacturers' profits to 
provide significant funding for health related anti-smoking 
initiatives.
<P>
	The enforcement crackdown entails increased RCMP and 
customs personnel and equipment dedicated to fighting 
smuggling. Their efforts are particularly aimed at stopping the 
flow of contraband at key spots along the Canada-U.S. border.
<P>
	Federal excise taxes have also been reduced by $5 per carton. 
Up to a maximum federal reduction of $10 we offered to match 
on a dollar for dollar basis provincial reductions above $5. Most 
provinces east of Manitoba have reduced their tobacco taxes.
<P>
	The action plan also imposed an export tax of $8 per carton on 
Canadian tobacco exports. This reflected the fact that 80 per 
cent of the cigarettes sold on the black market were Canadian 
cigarettes manufactured for export.
<P>
	In addition, the federal tax rate on corporate profits for 
manufacturing and processing tobacco products was increased 
by 40 per cent. The revenue generated by this surtax will fund 
Canada's largest ever anti-smoking campaign.
<P>
	The government has also undertaken to ban the manufacture 
of kiddie packs which were targeted at young buyers. It also 
moved to increase the legal age for purchasing cigarettes, 
increased fines for selling tobacco to minors, restricted vending 
machine locations and made health warnings on tobacco 
packaging more effective.
<P>
	A majority of Canadians believe the action plan is the right 
approach to address tobacco smuggling. Their belief is 
well-founded. Our integrated approach is definitely working.
<P>
	By seriously reducing profit margins it is eradicating both the 
supply of and demand for contraband tobacco products. It has 
particularly caused serious disruption to the operation of 
organized smuggling networks. It has substantially restored the 
domestic tax paid market for tobacco products.
<P>
	However, I want the House to know that this initial success 
does not provide unconditional support for a tax increase that 
will bring back previous levels. The fact is some amount of 
tobacco smuggling continues in central and eastern Canada. 
Moreover the RCMP reports that smugglers have developed new 
supply and distribution lines to the western provinces where 
governments have not reduced tobacco taxes.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	I too would like to see tobacco taxes increased but first we 
must win the battle against smuggling. To that end, tax measures 
support enforcement efforts and enforcement efforts take time 
to achieve maximum effectiveness. That is why this government 
remains committed to strong action to address smuggling on a 
comprehensive national basis, strong action which includes 
maintaining federal tobacco taxes at current levels.
<P>
	Motion No. 288 also calls for the redirection of tax revenues 
to specifically fund health care costs. The government is not in 
favour of such action. All members will know that tobacco tax 
revenues are an important part of government tax collections. In 
keeping with our general practice of avoiding earmarked taxes, 
these revenues are used to fund programs and services across 
many areas of responsibility. This ensures that the government's 
flexibility to respond to changing needs and conditions is not 
constrained. It also protects over or underfunding of the selected 
area.
<P>
	I should note however that the use of proceeds from the health 
promotion surtax is an exception to this general rule. In 
particular this targeted approach was undertaken on the basis of 
the measure's temporary nature and specific intent to ensure that 
manufacturers do not derive any benefit from the tobacco tax 
reductions.
<P>
	I share the concerns of all members with respect to low 
tobacco taxes. I know our government has no interest or intent in 
encouraging tobacco use. Nevertheless, this is not the appropri-
<P>

<B><A NAME="7018"> 7018 </A></B>
<P>
ate time to reintroduce higher tobacco taxes, nor should tobacco 
taxes be directed solely to  health care. Hence, I urge this House 
to dismiss Motion No. 288.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There are two minutes 
left.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in two minutes I will have to pick something out of my 
10 minute speech. I want to thank my colleague from 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca for bringing this topic back to the 
House for debate.
<P>
	I want to reiterate what one of my colleagues said previously 
in relation to the fact that the main issue to address is that we are 
dancing to someone else's tune. This is the Government of 
Canada. We make the laws here and because we have some 
difficulty in enforcing those laws it seems the best way to 
resolve that issue is to change the laws instead of going out and 
enforcing the issue.
<P>
	I would also like to comment on the cost. We all know that if 
you cannot afford to participate or you cannot afford to buy 
something, then you do not. That is what the majority of people 
do. However, what we have done here is we have actually 
enabled more people to buy and consume cigarettes. It does not 
matter whether they are young, old or middle aged, the 
consumption of cigarettes will indeed go up.
<P>
	We may not feel that effect today from the point of view of 
how it relates or translates into other services, but we certainly 
will reap its benefits shall we say from the point of view of 
taxing our health care services in the future. Here we are 
debating our social programs and their survival because of our 
debt and we are implementing an opportunity for people to go 
out and abuse their health which we will have to address at some 
time in the future.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the time 
provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business 
has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1), the order is 
dropped from the Order Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PEARSONINTERNATIONALAIRPORT">PEARSON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, my question to the Minister of Transport was a result of 
a proposal I sent to the minister on October 7.
<P>
	In that proposal I pointed out that Bill C-22 does not protect 
Canadians as the minister would have everyone believe. What it 
does do is strip all Canadians of the right of due process by 
pronouncing a group of Canadians guilty until proven innocent 
and then proceeds to remove their right to prove their own 
innocence.
<P>
	In his response to my question the minister suggests I want 
this to go to court to protect my friends. I point out to the 
minister as I did in my proposal to him that of the group of 
companies that make up the Pearson Development Corporation 
only 18.5 per cent have close known ties to the former Tory 
government.
<P>
	In actual fact there are far more Liberals than Tories involved 
in the deal and I have never heard him accuse me of being in this 
to help the Liberals.
<P>
	My interest in this matter goes far beyond the subject of the 
Pearson contract. It goes to a matter of basic justice. If the 
government can cancel any contract without regard for due 
process, no one is safe.
<P>
	The Pearson Development Corporation had a contract with 
the government. The minister quotes me as stating that I see 
nothing wrong with the deal. Frankly, I have not found anything 
wrong. If there is something wrong with the deal, I do not know 
what it is.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, according to a secret government 
document supplied to Robert Nixon, the government also thinks 
that it is a good deal. Quoting from that secret document, airline 
rents are in line with other airports undertaking major capital 
investments. Crown return is considerably better than the crown 
construction option. The Pearson Development Corporation 
return on investment is endorsed as a reasonable rate of return 
by both the Department of Finance and an independent financial 
consultant.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary to the minister stated on October 
17 that the government was waiting to get the national airport's 
program all set up so that it could go ahead and start spending 
the $740 million that the Pearson investors were going to spend.
<P>
	Maybe he should consult with the Minister of Finance to find 
out where their cash strapped government is going to get another 
three-quarters of a billion dollars. He should also read his own 
government's secret document that says that this is not a good 
idea.
<P>
	If the government chooses to cancel it, that is its prerogative. 
However, when a contract is cancelled there are rules to govern 
this. The government chose to ignore those rules.
<P>
	To put this in an analogy of a ball game, imagine a game, top 
of the ninth. Canadian taxpayers are ahead four-nothing against 
the government. The government says it is pulling the ump and 
putting in a person of its own. It extends the game until it 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7019"> 7019 </A></B>
<P>
announces it is over, changes the rules so it can get ahead and 
then announces that the game is finished.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport has tried this group of Canadian 
investors on the basis of accusation alone. He has been the 
judge, jury and financial executioner. If there is any evidence of 
illegal activity then and only then are the contractors the ones 
who have broken the rules.
<P>
	So far the government has not brought forth any such 
evidence. A judicial inquiry would help clear the air and assure 
that justice is done. That was my proposal to the minister.
<P>
	My question was will the minister agree that the Pearson 
problem is not going to go away and that the proposal I sent him 
is the only fair and logical way to bring this matter to a just 
conclusion. The minister did not answer that question. 
Therefore I ask it again and I await a response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very surprised but not 
unhappy that the member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke keeps 
giving us the opportunity to explain how far from reality the 
member's proposals are.
<P>
	Let us talk about his October 7 letter to the Minister of 
Transport. In his opening paragraph, he states that all Canadians 
will be stripped of their rights to due process by this statute.
<P>
	The Ministers of Transport and Justice have been scrupulous 
in ensuring that this legislation is specific to one particular deal, 
the Pearson international deal.
<P>
	It has only been one year since the people of the Toronto 
region expressed their opinion on this deal quite vocally and 
ultimately quite democratically. They do not want to be tied to 
this deal. I believe they know very well that their rights are 
being protected by the government.
<P>
	While we are truly looking to limit access to the courts by the 
developers, in case the member has not noticed the consortium 
is now in court. Even the majority in the other place agreed that 
members of the consortium could go to court after passage of 
Bill C-22 if they refused to believe we have the constitutional 
right to take back Pearson airport in the public interest of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I cannot let the hon. member get away with saying they are not 
asking for any money in their present court case. They are 
asking for third party indemnity. That means they want to be 
covered for a lot of money. It is that simple.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport has most ably presented the costs 
that the members of the consortium want by way of 
compensation. They have already submitted claims for lost 
profits for over $400 million. Those were the claims they 
submitted when we only asked them to provide their actual 
expenses. I cannot wait to see what they submit when they want 
to present their final bills.
<P>
	I am absolutely amazed that the Reform Party member 
continues to persist in making this his issue when he knows that 
the people of Canada support the government on it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5) the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.37 p.m.)
